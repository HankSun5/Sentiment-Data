Instead of short-term hype, attention is shifting toward use cases, strong updates, and long-term value. Whether it’s AI-driven platforms, decentralized infrastructure, or scalable networks, some crypto assets are standing out more clearly. These are the names gaining serious traction in 2025. In this guide, we’re looking at the key crypto platforms expected to gain strength this year. From automation in Web3 to secure GPU rendering and expanding blockchain utility, several top bullish cryptos are showing the right mix of utility and forward momentum. Let’s explore which ones should be on your radar. Unstaked: Set to Launch Powerful AI Automation Unstaked is gaining wide attention in 2025. Its AI-powered autonomous agents are scheduled to launch once the presale ends and UNSD gets listed. These AI tools will work on Telegram, X, and Discord, covering content moderation, engagement, and creation without human input. Built on a Proof of Intelligence system, every action by these AI agents is recorded on-chain, and users earn $UNSD for genuine engagement. Ownership is direct, as each agent links to the user’s wallet, creating personal control. Monthly subscriptions start at $10, and the current presale price in stage 4 is $0.00710, with the launch rate set at $0.1819. The Unstaked presale offers over 2,700% projected ROI. There are no private deals, giving equal opportunity to all early supporters. This structure, along with Web3 tools and AI-driven automation, places Unstaked among the top bullish cryptos in 2025. Its value lies in offering simple tools that help scale digital engagement. Solana: Momentum Grows With Institutional Interest Solana is growing due to major updates and increased attention from financial firms. SOL trades near $150, showing around 9% growth in the past 30 days. Key developments include the Firedancer validator, which is helping improve network throughput. Institutions like Franklin Templeton and Fidelity are moving toward Solana ETF filings. Upexi’s announcement to build a $100 million Solana reserve also added to the positive news. Solana now reports more than 100 million monthly active users, and its DeFi total value locked has reached $4.9 billion. Forecasts say SOL could climb to between $220 and $1,000 by the end of 2025. These figures show that Solana remains among the top bullish cryptos, supported by market expansion and real-world adoption. With both traditional finance and decentralized systems fueling its progress, SOL continues to gain traction across sectors. Chainlink: Expanding Its DeFi and Data Utility Chainlink is reinforcing its importance in blockchain infrastructure as 2025 moves forward. Despite a small dip to around $14.65, LINK maintains a strong upward trend. Over the past month, it added 77 data streams and expanded across 37 blockchains through its Multistream rollout. A key highlight is its Smart Value Recapture feature, helping DeFi apps recover MEV profits. Another major step was PayPal adding support for LINK purchases and sales. Current analyst targets project LINK to rise toward $21.63, with shorter targets near $16.43. As Chainlink continues to grow its DeFi reach and data integration capabilities, it clearly ranks among the top bullish cryptos in 2025. This continued progress, real platform usage, and adoption by mainstream apps make Chainlink a strong pick for those focused on smart contracts and secure blockchain data access. Render (RNDR): Scaling Web3 Graphics With AI Render is moving quickly in 2025, offering decentralized GPU rendering for AI and creative use. RNDR sits near $4.36 after a brief dip, but signs point to continued strength. The emergence of a golden cross on April 27 suggests a bullish phase. Its RenderCon event triggered a 5% uptick as well, showing market interest. Forecasts for RNDR range from $6.69 to $9.54 in the coming months, with a possible rise to $10.13 later this year. On the security side, Render added more controls like permissioned GPU nodes and completed fresh smart contract audits. With strong AI links and infrastructure built for Web3 creators, RNDR is among the top bullish cryptos showing real promise. Final Say! As 2025 unfolds, not every crypto platform is proving its real value. But Unstaked, Solana, Chainlink, and Render are pushing ahead with real progress. Unstaked’s AI agents are ready to reshape engagement models, Solana is growing with ETF exposure and DeFi strength, Chainlink is supporting data-rich smart contracts, and Render is helping power the visual side of Web3. Anyone exploring top bullish cryptos should take a closer look at these four. Each offers strong market presence, functional use, and the kind of development pace that often leads to long-term success. The crypto market is shifting fast, and these names are at the front of the next wave.

At the same time, Solana (SOL) is gaining attention due to a rise in DEX activity that may signal the start of a bullish continuation. Still, beyond these coin-specific moves, a wider shift is underway. Web3 ai is entering the scene with real-time AI tools built for multiple chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Solana. In a landscape where top opportunities move across ecosystems, these tools help traders act faster and smarter. Bittensor (TAO) Moves Toward a Big Target Optimism around Bittensor is rising, with analysts predicting a move to $480, which would be a 480% gain. This outlook is based on TAO’s growing role in decentralized AI systems. It leads in creating on-chain networks for machine learning and peer-based model sharing. Chart signals now show patterns that suggest a breakout, backed by higher trading volume and positive price action. TAO’s incentive structure rewards sharing of AI knowledge and attracts more developers. This setup encourages growth that does not rely on centralized compute hubs. If adoption continues, TAO could become a key asset in Web3 AI projects. Short-term price swings are still likely, as the market reacts quickly to both progress and setbacks. Solana’s Growth Reflected in DEX Activity Solana is showing new strength as trading on decentralized exchanges rises fast. This increase in volume points to fresh interest from both traders and developers. Analysts believe if this trend continues, SOL may revisit recent highs and break into new levels. More developers are building in Solana’s ecosystem, and new wallets are being created every day. The network is gaining traction in DeFi and NFTs, supported by ongoing upgrades to its developer tools. These signs support a positive outlook, though some concerns remain about past network stability and centralization. If Solana continues on its current path, it could remain a strong pick for users following market momentum. AI Tools for All Chains Are Finally Here In today’s divided blockchain space, Web3 AI brings something users have been waiting for. It introduces an AI layer that works live across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon. This means users are no longer stuck in one chain. Web3 ai scans every major blockchain to find opportunities in yield, arbitrage, liquidity, and trades. This isn’t just an idea, it’s already live. The WAI token is now in presale, starting at $0.00031 in stage 2 and rising to $0.003267, before listing at $0.005242. The early stages show a possible return of 1747% at launch. Picture an AI tool spotting a price gap between two decentralized exchanges and alerting you while the window is open. Or one that finds high-yield farming offers before the rates go down. These tools are more than bots or dashboards. They use real-time data from many blockchains and are designed to highlight chances before most traders even notice. That’s the strength of Web3 AI. In crypto, where every second matters, having access to this wide-angle view gives users the upper hand. And at the center of it all is the WAI token, now available in presale. By holding WAI, users can use several advanced tools: Smart scanner for arbitrage across chains Optimizer for yield farming across platforms Trading system that considers gas fees Alerts for real-time on-chain changes A say in how AI is trained and deployed WAI is more than just a key to tools. It also gives users a role in shaping how the AI grows. That means users are not only using the system, they are helping guide it. This turns the WAI holders into active members of the AI process. Analysts now often compare Web3 ai to the “Bloomberg Terminal for crypto” because of its useful insights and ability to work across many chains. While some crypto projects stay within their own chain, Web3 ai is taking a different path. It is building a smart data system that works with all major blockchains. Just like Ethereum launched DeFi and Solana helped it grow faster, Web3 ai plans to bring intelligence into the mix. That’s one reason people are starting to see it as one of the top crypto coins to watch this cycle. The project’s timeline is also clear and packed with updates: Q3: Liquidity radar for Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana Q4: AI-powered auto-trading and listings for WAI 2026: Launch of DAO tools, SDKs for developers, and APIs for trading bots Each release adds more use for WAI. Those who join early will not only get to use the tools first, they will also help shape the system through feedback, updates, and AI training. This way, everyone helps build a smarter and more balanced crypto world. Final Thoughts on What’s Changing Bittensor’s rise, Solana’s trading tools, and AI-powered tokens are getting lots of attention, but something bigger is already starting to take shape. It’s about working across blockchains with smart tools. Web3 ai is leading that shift by offering live tools for cross-chain trading and a crypto presale token that already has built-in use. Whether it’s Solana, Ethereum, or any other chain, Web3 AI connects them all. That is what makes it a top crypto coin to follow in 2025. As AI tools, arbitrage systems, and chain-wide data feeds become more important, WAI gives users a chance to act early. This is not just about using more than one chain. It’s about creating a smart system that works across all of them. And it’s built for those who want to lead, not follow.

The latest Filecoin price analysis points to a possible rebound from $2.64, triggered by a rare TD Sequential “13” signal, something traders usually associate with short-term reversals. Meanwhile, the Cardano price prediction leans positive, but only if buying volume returns around the $0.74 mark. There’s still buzz around Cardano’s LAOS upgrade and ETF potential, but for now, that optimism needs support. While both are waiting on confirmations, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already in motion. Following a string of AMAs, the launch of a new podcast series has boosted engagement, pushing the project’s presale total to $228.5 million. Filecoin Price Analysis Points to Bounce from Key Support The current Filecoin price analysis highlights a potential upward move as the token hovers near a key support level at $2.64. The appearance of a TD Sequential “13” buy signal has traders watching closely, as this signal often appears near trend reversals. Traders are now looking for signs of follow-through. A jump in volume or confirmation in candle patterns could push prices higher. Recent trading shows the lower edge of the channel acting as support, and if that holds, Filecoin may rally toward its mid-range resistance. Still, the strength of that move depends on whether buyers show up. Cardano Price Prediction Relies on Volume at Key Resistance The Cardano price prediction shows potential for gains if trading volume increases near the $0.74 resistance level. ADA is currently priced around $0.6845 after a modest uptick in April, with investor hopes tied to the LAOS upgrade and the possibility of an ETF development. While recent movements brought some momentum, overall activity has been limited. Analysts say a breakout above $0.74 could clear a path to $0.88. Meanwhile, on-chain data points to growing traction in Africa and the lead-up to enterprise partnerships. Until volume increases, the Cardano price prediction remains hopeful but cautious. BlockDAG’s Podcasts Turn Presale Updates Into Trust-Building Conversations BlockDAG has stayed vocal throughout its journey. From seven AMAs to three viral keynote videos, the team has made sure to keep its community updated. The launch of a new podcast series proves they’re still focused on keeping communication open. With three episodes live, engagement has ramped up quickly. These podcasts offer a direct look into what’s coming. From presale mechanics to exchange rollout plans, BlockDAG’s team is laying it all out. And the response has been strong, the project has now raised $228.5 million and sold over 19.8 billion BDAG coins. Batch 28 has launched, but BlockDAG has kept its limited-time price of $0.0019, which is much lower than the current $0.0262 rate. This offer expires on May 13. Buyers understand what that pricing gap means. With BDAG set to list at $0.05, anyone entering at $0.0019 stands to earn a 2,531% return. That’s one reason it’s being called the best long-term crypto right now. The combination of active updates and steady development is building momentum. In a market where silence raises doubts, BlockDAG’s consistent communication is giving buyers a reason to act before prices move. Key Insights! The Filecoin price analysis suggests a possible rebound, but there’s no clear confirmation yet. The Cardano price prediction depends on whether volume picks up. Both could move, but neither has moved yet. BlockDAG, on the other hand, isn’t waiting. With three podcast episodes live, $228.5 million already raised, and a limited-time entry price of $0.0019 available until May 13, the setup is already there. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05, the built-in 2,531% ROI speaks for itself. In this space, the best long-term crypto isn’t always the one with the loudest headlines. Sometimes, it’s the project that’s already executing, already growing, and already communicating, like BlockDAG.

While each asset brings its own strengths, market participants are growing cautious amid mixed technical signals — and many are turning their focus to emerging names like MAGACOINFINANCE for more aggressive upside potential. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Ethereum Holds Above $1,830, But Struggles for Direction Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,832.06 , with a +0.48% move in the past hour, but down -0.27% over the last 24 hours. Its 7-day performance is slightly positive at +2.01% , showing modest resilience. Despite its role as the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum’s growth has slowed. With major upgrades priced in and gas fees still an issue, investors are beginning to question how much more upside remains in the short term. ETH remains a long-term pillar of DeFi, but near-term traders are now seeking sharper ROI plays. Cardano Slips Under Pressure at $0.7031 Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.7031 , gaining +0.99% in the last hour but falling -0.59% in 24 hours and -1.09% for the week. Despite ADA’s loyal base and consistent ecosystem upgrades, price action has failed to reflect long-term enthusiasm. With resistance forming near $0.72 and a lack of high-volume buying, ADA’s sideways action may continue unless a significant technical breakout occurs. Many traders are rotating capital into underexposed alternatives with higher growth ceilings. Shiba Inu Drops Sharply Despite Meme Coin Buzz SHIB is trading at $0.00001324 , with a +0.73% hourly bump, but down -1.50% over 24 hours and a steeper -7.39% on the 7-day chart. Shiba Inu remains one of the most talked-about meme tokens, but its recent performance suggests fading interest from short-term holders. With no major catalyst on the horizon and momentum waning, SHIB is under pressure as traders begin exploring fundamentally stronger microcaps. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE Gains Strength as Altcoin Rotation Intensifies While larger caps stall, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming a favored early-stage target among investors looking for long-term upside. Still under the radar, the project is gaining recognition for its smart release structure, clean tokenomics, and a community-led approach that avoids VC dominance. The project’s growth potential is drawing comparisons to early-stage tokens that later surged 30x or more. Forecasts point to 30x upside from current levels, with early entry still available through its official site. What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart is its positioning before broader exchange exposure. With the crypto cycle entering a new phase and capital rotating out of fatigued majors, MAGACOINFINANCE is building momentum as a fresh, institutional play. With institutional-grade branding, real-time traction, and a growing community of over 14,000 holders, the project is quickly climbing up the 2025 altcoin watchlist.

He emphasized that artificial intelligence (AI) will play a crucial role in driving demand for Bitcoin, stating that the productivity surge from digital property, digital intelligence, and digital labor will fuel an increased need for digital capital. Saylor described Bitcoin as an ""immortal asset"" capable of lasting 1,000 years and the most globally interesting asset. He also compared Bitcoin favorably against gold, asserting it is 100 times better, and criticized traditional corporate financial strategies such as stock buybacks, advocating instead for companies to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets to outperform. Saylor encouraged sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible. He highlighted that Bitcoin remains accessible at prices below $200,000 per coin. Additionally, Saylor noted that AI agents would prefer to settle transactions using Bitcoin due to its efficiency and neutrality as a digital asset, which aligns with the evolving AI-driven economic landscape. Other commentators have echoed this view, suggesting that Bitcoin will serve as the neutral digital asset of the AI era, facilitating real-time value settlement and conversion between fiat and stablecoins when human involvement is necessary.

The Federal Reserve just hit the pause button on rate hikes, and that ripple effect is shaking up the crypto world. With equity markets staying cautious, alternative assets like crypto are quietly gaining momentum. Tezos is flashing a potential reversal, VeChain is drawing attention with transparency-led growth, and a new powerhouse— Qubetics —is storming through the presale charts with staggering numbers. While the traditional financial sector braces for slower moves, Qubetics ($TICS) is doing the exact opposite—charging ahead with bold innovation. Its real-world asset tokenization marketplace is already making noise among DeFi circles, especially with real application cases unfolding. Add in the timer-based presale model and ROI projections that would make any early adopter take notice, and it’s clear why Qubetics is being ranked among the best cryptos to join for short term profits this May. Qubetics’ Tokenization Tech Is Solving Real-World Inefficiencies It’s not just hype—Qubetics is building what many other blockchains couldn’t deliver: a real-world asset tokenization marketplace with genuine impact. Imagine a mid-sized logistics business in Texas looking to tokenize its delivery vehicle fleet. Qubetics’ ecosystem allows them to turn those vehicles into fractionalized digital assets—tradable, trackable, and auditable on-chain. Or picture an art curator in New York who’s finally able to sell shares of a rare piece securely through blockchain without relying on centralized exchanges or shady brokers. What separates Qubetics is its role as the world’s first Web3 aggregator. It doesn’t just create another chain—it connects them. With native support across major chains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana, it provides seamless interoperability for tokenized assets. This eliminates silos and empowers everyday users—from real estate firms in Los Angeles to small manufacturers in Detroit—to digitize and manage physical assets with blockchain-backed certainty. This isn’t theoretical either. The infrastructure is being fine-tuned right now in the lead-up to its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, and industry watchers are taking notice. With tangible use cases and institutional-grade tooling, Qubetics is rapidly emerging as one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits as real-world adoption gets closer to reality. Qubetics Presale’s $16.7M Surge Turns Heads Among Best Crypto Pre Sales Qubetics isn’t just building tech—it’s also rewriting the presale playbook. The project is in Stage 33, and every single stage lasts exactly seven days, ending at 12:00 AM every Sunday. With each new stage comes a 10% price jump, creating a disciplined, predictable framework that rewards early adopters without relying on whales or pump schemes. Right now, over $16.7 million has already been raised. The token count has crossed 511 million $TICS sold, and there are now more than 25,900 token holders actively participating in the event. The current crypto presale price sits at $0.2302, but that won’t last long given the Sunday cutoff. Here’s where things get wild: If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, that means a 334.33% ROI. But if it climbs to $10 after the mainnet, you’re looking at a 4,243.26% ROI. Say someone throws in $100 right now—that’s 434 $TICS tokens. If the token hits $6, that $100 turns into $2,606.40. And if it rockets to $15, we’re talking $6,514.35. That kind of upside is what’s making this one of the best crypto pre sale events on the market—bar none. Unlike other presales where pricing is chaotic and rushed, Qubetics’ timed, structured pricing model offers clarity. It encourages participation without manipulation—making it a standout choice for those looking for best cryptos to join for short term profits while riding a serious momentum wave. No gimmicks—just performance, projections, and precision. Tezos Shows Technical Reversal Signs as XTZ Tries to Break Downtrend While macro markets remain uneasy, Tezos (XTZ) is offering subtle but important signs of reversal. According to Capital.com’s recent price analysis, XTZ has been trapped in a downtrend since late March, but technical patterns suggest the token might be preparing to turn the corner. One key figure noted is the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, a well-known reversal zone that has historically triggered bouncebacks for Tezos. Coupled with the fact that XTZ was trading around $0.91 at press time, technical bulls are watching closely. The daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) sat at 39.28, hinting that XTZ could be approaching oversold territory. If that level holds, a rally could emerge soon. Yet, this isn’t a guaranteed breakout. Capital.com emphasizes that for the uptrend to take form, XTZ needs to cross its April high near $1.15 and reclaim momentum above the 50-day EMA. The fundamental picture remains mixed, but the chart action is growing louder—and for risk-tolerant participants, Tezos is a chart worth watching in the best cryptos to join for short term profits conversation.

XRP maintained its position as a top-performing coin during Q4 of 2024 yet now experiences a sudden price drop. It has become necessary to watch the performance of Cardano (ADA) due to its popular development network alongside smart contract advancements. Investors who want to access promising high-yield projects are discovering MAGACOINFINANCE as they seek early entry points. Crypto traders are studying metrics alongside technical indicators and market stories during the pre-monetary policy period ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate presentation. MAGACOINFINANCE stands apart from other tokens since investors buzz about its presale and anticipate a listing price that exceeds the entry point. LISTINGS COULD DROP ANY MOMENT –ACT NOW Most advanced crypto traders continue observing XRP and ADA but a rising number of traders now expand their holdings across multiple projects while moving capital toward expected future market transformations. XRP and ADA: Market Movements and Investor Sentiment The cryptocurrency XRP which mainly serves cross-border payments showed a significant market withdrawal when early May arrived. The token is currently available for trade between $2.08-$2.12 while demonstrating a 7% decrease in its value over five trading days. Several important events preceded this recent price correction. Network operations face a slowdown and investors capitalize on their end-of-2024 price gains as the United States delays approving spot ETFs. Ripple’s prioritization of developing its RLUSD stablecoin seems to divert investor perception away from the utility of XRP. However, there’s room for optimism. XRP spot ETF approvals hold a predicted 77% chance of approval according to analysts before the end of 2025 so they might stimulate institutional investments. The recent Hidden Road acquisition valued at $1.25 billion by Ripple implies Ripple will maintain XRP as a component of decentralized fintech systems in upcoming years. XRP fee burning shows promise for reducing supply which in history has led to positive price effects for bullish markets. The market situation for Cardano (ADA) remains different from other cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency exchange value for ADA reached $0.6578 during May 6, 2025 yet experienced a 3% decline since yesterday and an 8% decrease throughout this week. The resistance area at $0.72 successfully maintains its position and the Relative Strength Index rating at 35 points to continuing seller dominance in the market. Quick Stats: XRP Current Price: $2.08 5-Day Decline: ~7% Chance of ETF Approval in 2025: 77% Cardano Current Price: $0.6578 Weekly Decline: 8% New Wallets in 2025: +4% increase, >5.3 million total CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS MAGACOINFINANCE: Presale Developments and Market Attention MAGACOINFINANCE establishes its momentum against the market swings of large-cap tokens in a separate manner.

Numerous EVM-compatible DEX aggregators and liquidity pools are expected to integrate with MAGACOINFINANCE through timelines which remain approximate. Conclusion: Why Investors Are Watching XRP, ADA, and MAGACOINFINANCE in May 2025 Market uncertainty stemming from macroeconomic factors and regulatory changes has brought about a careful feeling of hopefulness in May 2025. The downward trend of XRP has not affected the future outlook of investors especially when considering institutional developments in ETF preparations alongside a better-defined ecosystem structure. The value decrease of ADA remains an issue for traders but this decrease is compensated by active network progress together with smart contract development. As retail investors look for high-risk potential returns the speculative MAGACOINFINANCE cryptocurrency has captured their attention.

Celsius Mashinsky Faces Justice The proceedings took place before US District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan’s Southern District, where Mashinsky faced the repercussions of what prosecutors characterized as a sweeping scheme to defraud investors. In December, the crypto lender’s former CEO admitted guilt to charges of commodities fraud and manipulation of the Celsius token, CEL, leading to his current sentence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Toward $100,000 As Treasury, Not Fed, Drives Liquidity: Expert Mashinsky’s legal troubles began in 2023 when he was arrested on multiple counts, including securities, commodities, and wire fraud. This arrest coincided with Celsius’s announcement of a $4.7 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of the largest settlements in the agency’s history. The resolution of this settlement remains dependent on Celsius successfully returning the remaining customer assets amidst ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, emphasizing the scale of the fraudulent activities. SEC And CFTC Pursue Multi-Billion Dollar Fraud Prosecutors alleged that Mashinsky misled investors regarding the safety and profitability of Celsius’s yield-generating platform while simultaneously liquidating tens of millions of dollars in personal holdings. Initially, Mashinsky denied any wrongdoing, but his guilty plea and subsequent sentencing have brought this lengthy legal saga to a close.

The scrutiny of Mashinsky and his actions mirrors the fates of other high-profile crypto executives, including FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, as well as Do Kwon of Terraform Labs, all of whom faced serious legal challenges in the country.

Restructuring of Celsius protocol under a creditor-owned Bitcoin mining has been ongoing. Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of defund lending protocol Celsius ( CEL ), was sentenced to a 12-year prison term on Thursday, May 8. The United States District Judge John G. Koeltl at Manhattan’s Southern District noted that Mashinsky undertook a sweeping scheme to defraud investors. The 12-year prison term was not what the federal prosecutor sought based on the identified charges. According to the federal prosecutor, Mashinsky ought to have been slapped with a 20-year prison term as a just punishment. Notably, Mashinsky had already pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud, including commodities fraud and securities fraud. As part of the plea deal, Mashinsky agreed to forfeit $48 million and not appeal any sentence of up to 30 years. However, the funds were a drop in the ocean as Celsius had an identified financial hole of more than $1 billion. Nevertheless, the court approved the restructuring plan for Celsius to a creditor-owned Bitcoin mining company dubbed Ionic Digital LLC. What Next for Crypto Market After Mashinsky’s Sentencing Since the cryptocurrency industry experienced the 2022 bear market, catalyzed by the Terra Luna and FTX collapse , lawmakers in different jurisdictions have put in place measures to protect web3 investors. In the United States, Sam Bankman Fried has been a key lesson to web3 developers seeking to override the set crypto regulatory rules. As a result, the crypto market is well positioned to grow exponentially in the coming years, catalyzed by clear regulatory frameworks.

Speaking to the Russian Parliamentary Gazette on May 7, Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, also suggested that some states are now using BTC as a payment tool in cross-border arms deals. India-Pakistan Conflict to ‘Spur Bitcoin Buying?’ The lawmaker explained that any escalation of military operations between India and Pakistan would see global investors start pouring their funds into assets such as gold, crypto, and other precious metals. Aksakov said: “As a rule, such tense political situations work in favor of various investment instruments. These include Bitcoin and gold. Especially as Bitcoin is beginning to be used to pay for various weapons supply programs.” While geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan are top of investors’ minds, many are finding comfort in the muted impact on stocks historically.

(Source: CoinGecko) However, he added, events in America still have “the greatest impact on Bitcoin” prices. This is because the US is home to the “largest number of Bitcoin owners in the world,” Aksakov explained. He concluded that an India-Pakistan conflict would “not affect the Russian ruble in any way,” noting that ruble prices depend almost entirely on Russian “internal economic conditions.” Aksakov is the chief architect of all of Russia’s crypto legislation to date. He has previously claimed that Moscow is aware that domestic firms are using BTC and other tokens to conduct cross-border trade. In September 2024, Russian reports claimed that Moscow had launched a focus group to explore crypto payments for so-called “dual-use goods.” Such goods can either used for both civilian and military applications.

Market Sentiment Turns Greedy The mood in the crypto market has changed. According to statistics from the Crypto & Fear Index, the sentiment is now “Greed” with a reading of 65. That indicates that most investors are optimistic and ready to take higher risks.

Short liquidations occur when bettors against Bitcoin are compelled to close their wagers because of price increases. Rates Remain Flat As Trump Resists Trump’s tweet saw print just a few hours after the US Federal Reserve chose to maintain interest rates as they were. The prevailing rate range is between 4.25% and 4.50%. Trump had been pushing the Fed to reduce rates, but the central bank made no move. As the Fed held firm, Bitcoin continued rising. That might be an indicator that investors are giving more credibility to trade reports and international politics than central bank policy—at least in the meantime.

One emerging asset has started to capture serious attention in recent weeks — MAGACOINFINANCE , still trading under $0.07 , and quickly developing a reputation as a high-multiple contender in 2025. Why Sub-$0.07 Pricing Matters With the current price hovering below $0.07 , MAGACOINFINANCE sits in the early accumulation zone that seasoned crypto investors recognize from previous major breakouts like SHIB, DOGE, and early-stage DeFi plays. These were tokens that saw explosive upside — not because of hype, but because of smart timing and limited early access. For investors familiar with the wealth cycles in crypto, entry at sub-$0.07 levels could represent one of the last opportunities before MAGACOINFINANCE moves into a more public phase via listings and broader visibility. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Forecasted Growth: 34x–35x From Current Levels Analyst projections around MAGACOINFINANCE are striking. Multiple sources estimate a return potential of 34x to 35x by year-end based on listing targets, market structure, and token supply dynamics. This is the kind of setup that has historically rewarded early entrants with disproportionate gains. Projected ROI: 3400%–3500% by 2025 Expected Returns: 34x from Entry Price Anticipated Upside: +3000% to +3500% Range Potential Return: Up to $3250% , depending on bonus structures and early-stage allocation This kind of return profile places MAGACOINFINANCE in a unique category — not a meme play, not yet mainstream, but sitting on the edge of breakout territory. What’s Driving the Momentum? Several key factors are pushing MAGACOINFINANCE into investor focus: No centralized exchange exposure yet, protecting early pricing Tokenomics built for scarcity, with no VC overhang Community-led acceleration backed by a rapidly growing user base Clear roadmap and milestone execution that builds long-term credibility These fundamentals set it apart from “hype-only” tokens.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 350,000 YouTube subscribers that S&P 500 (SPX) may dip lower in the second quarter and drag Bitcoin down with it, based on BTC’s historic correlation with stocks. Pizzino suggests the SPX may swing lower in the second quarter based on its historic performance pattern. “I’ve got our 20-year line on the [S&P 500] chart here, and we’re just using this to look at the swings of a market… With that in mind, you can see we’ve had a similar event here starting from about December into these peaks of February, running down into April, and then May has this little bit of a drop, along with June also having a correction. It gets a bit messier through the second half of quarter two and quarter three, then things start to get a little bit cleaner towards quarter four. And that’s why I’m still considering that Bitcoin does have a correction in quarter two. We’ve been up for a few weeks here. Generally, we’ll get some sort of correction.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Pizzino also says that Bitcoin may gain bullish momentum based on its historic inverse correlation with the US dollar index (DXY), as more investors may be treating the flagship crypto asset as a safe-haven asset similar to gold. The DXY, which has been declining, pits the USD against a basket of other major foreign currencies. “There’s a strong downtrend for the US dollar. It has paused here. So that’s not a bad sign at the moment, especially with Bitcoin still going up. US dollar pausing, could see some further strength for BTC in the coming weeks, after any sort of correction.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $97,346 at time of writing, flat on the day.

Under the agreement, the remaining $75 million will be returned to the company. The motion was submitted to Judge Analisa Torres in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. This marks the official end of one of the most closely followed and prolonged legal battles in the crypto industry. Ripple emerges stronger as legal cloud lifts and growth accelerates The case began in December 2020, when the SEC, under then-Chair Gary Gensler, accused Ripple of conducting unregistered securities offerings through its XRP token sales . Despite the legal battles, Ripple does seem to be in a relatively financially stable position and is poised for growth. The settlement arrives when Ripple benefits from a regulatory shift under President Trump’s administration. Just last month, Ripple made a significant move by acquiring the prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.2 billion and was reportedly in talks with Circle, the issuer of USDC, about a potential $5 billion acquisition, although that offer was declined. Now that the lawsuit is behind them and the majority of the penalty is being returned, Ripple is expected to ramp up its acquisition strategy both in the US and internationally. The case has reinforced the stance that XRP is a commodity, not a security, potentially paving the way for an XRP ETF approval. Bloomberg senior ETF analysts said that the five spot XRP ETFs , including Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Canary, and Franklin Templeton, have an 85% chance of approval after the change in leadership at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is a significant improvement from their prediction over two months ago that set the chances of an XRP approval in 2025 at 65%. Similarly, the betting odds for an XRP ETF approval by Dec. 31 now stand at 77% on Polymarket. Ripple’s ties to US regulators also seem to be strengthening. While rumors swirled today about President Trump being misled into endorsing XRP as part of a national crypto reserve , Ripple’s lobbying efforts with the administration are well-documented. The company’s proactive engagement with policymakers is now bearing fruit. XRP soars as investors bet on final SEC settlement approval XRP, the native cryptocurrency of Ripple, jumped more than 10% in early Thursday trading following the news that Ripple and the U.S. SEC filed a joint request for an indicative ruling to finalize their long-standing legal settlement. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.28, up 7% just 24 hours earlier. While the price has slightly corrected since the announcement, the rally was strong enough to break $2.3 today. Analysts now eye resistance at the $2.5 level , with some suggesting a breakout to $3 is possible. And if settlement approval comes swiftly and macro conditions remain stable the price predictions wild enough to $7 and $20. The final ruling is still pending; the market is clearly betting on a favorable outcome. Should the court approve the joint request, XRP could be primed for a massive rally. XRP’s price surge reflects strong market optimism, as traders and longtime holders view the settlement as the closing chapter of a regulatory battle that has weighed on the token since 2020.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter. Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs. In contrast, US President Donald Trump’s election win in November was considered one of the main catalysts behind the rising market prices in Q4. Key financial metrics for Coinbase in Q1. Source: Coinbase Meanwhile, Coinbase’s subscription and services revenue rose 8.9% to $698.1 million, with stablecoin revenue the most significant contributor. Despite the fall in total revenue and trading volume, Coinbase said it gained more market share in global spot and derivatives trading while deepening its presence in emerging markets such as Argentina and India with “critical registrations.” On the regulatory front, Coinbase said the dismissal of its lawsuit with the US securities regulator marked a “major judicial win for balanced, innovation-friendly regulation, and our efforts to make crypto mainstream.” Coinbase makes deal with major crypto derivatives platform On May 8, Coinbase agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion, marking the industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date. The acquisition will expand Coinbase’s footprint in the crypto derivatives market immensely, which previously had been limited to its Bermuda-based platform. Coinbase noted that Deribit facilitated over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024 and has around $30 billion of current open interest.

Competitor firm Kraken struck a similar deal in March when it agreed to acquire futures brokerage NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion. Coinbase’s Deribit deal contributed to a 5.1% rise in Coinbase’s (COIN) share price during the May 8 trading day, though shares have pulled back 3.1% in after-hours since the crypto exchange posted its Q1 results.

While all three show technical setups worth monitoring, a growing number of investors are eyeing a new entrant — MAGACOINFINANCE — for its outsized upside and early-stage momentum. Here’s how each asset stacks up in terms of projected ROI this month. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Cardano: Steady but Capped Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.7031 , reflecting modest strength as it hovers above key support. A bounce to the $0.78–$0.80 range remains possible if overall sentiment improves, but ADA has yet to reclaim the strong upward momentum it showed earlier in the year. Despite network growth and a loyal community, ADA’s price action remains relatively muted. Analysts forecast a +10% to +15% upside through May, assuming no major catalyst emerges. Solana: Momentum Slows Near Resistance Solana (SOL), trading around $147.87 , is facing overhead resistance that could limit near-term upside. While its Layer 1 credentials remain unmatched in terms of speed and ecosystem activity, traders say the bulk of short-term gains may already be priced in. If SOL breaks above the $155 level with volume, a move to $165 is feasible, which would reflect a +12% to +18% gain . Without that push, consolidation may continue through mid-May. XRP: Quiet Rebound in Progress XRP’s slow recovery in April sees the cryptocurrency recently trading at $2.19. If prices surpass $2.30, a technical breakout could follow as some analysts foresee a +15% to +22% upside with recovering institutional sentiment. Ripple’s ongoing regulatory developments, combined with renewed speculation on global partnerships, add to XRP’s bullish case in the short term. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE: Early-Stage Asset With Massive Upside The promise of short-term returns of a structured but limited nature is available from ADA, SOL and XRP. However, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as an early-stage project that is worth considering. The token is trading at sub-0.07, nonetheless; it’s gaining some traction owing to the clean tokenomics, no VC dilution and road-map that is milestone driven. Analyst projections place MAGACOINFINANCE’s potential ROI between 3000% and 3200% over the next year, with some estimates calling for a potential return up to 3250% based on entry timing and listing valuations. The token remains off major exchanges for now — a feature, not a flaw — offering early investors exclusive access before wider market recognition. Unlike saturated large caps, MAGACOINFINANCE is built for asymmetric upside, making it an attractive option for those seeking more than incremental gains. Cardano, Solana and XRP are all worth holding for a diversified portfolio. But if you’re looking for the maximum percentage ROI in the current cycle, then MAGACOINFINANCE could the best entry. Investors are quickly repositioning themselves for imminent visibility increase amid ongoing market rotation.

While much attention is given to AI in finance or trading, its impact on foundational digital commerce is equally significant. Amazon, a giant in the e-commerce space, is leveraging AI to make life easier for its millions of sellers , a move that streamlines online business operations relevant to anyone navigating the digital marketplace. What is the New Amazon AI Tool? Amazon recently announced the release of a new Amazon AI tool specifically designed to help its vast network of third-party sellers . This tool, named “Enhance My Listing,” utilizes generative AI technology to improve the quality and completeness of product listings on the platform. For sellers managing hundreds or even thousands of items, keeping product information accurate and up-to-date can be a time-consuming and complex process. Enhance My Listing aims to automate parts of this task by: Automatically suggesting improvements to product titles and descriptions. Identifying and suggesting missing attributes or details. Tailoring suggestions based on observed seasonal trends and customer engagement patterns. The tool draws its capabilities from Amazon’s own Bedrock service, which provides access to various generative AI models. By analyzing data from customer interactions on the platform, the AI generates insights to make relevant and potentially impactful suggestions. How Does Enhance My Listing Benefit Sellers? The primary benefit of this new Amazon AI tool is increased efficiency. Sellers can review the AI-generated suggestions and choose to accept, reject, or modify them before updating their product information in Amazon’s catalog. This significantly reduces the manual effort required to maintain high-quality product pages. Improved product listings are crucial for visibility and sales on Amazon. Complete and accurate information helps customers make informed purchasing decisions, potentially leading to higher conversion rates and fewer returns. By leveraging generative AI , Amazon is empowering sellers to present their products more effectively with less manual work. Amazon’s Growing Use of Generative AI for E-commerce This isn’t Amazon’s first foray into using generative AI to assist its sellers . The company began introducing such tools in 2023. One early feature helped sellers draft product descriptions. In March 2024, Amazon added a tool allowing sellers to create a listing by simply providing a product URL from their own website, or by uploading an image and writing a few words. The adoption rate for these tools appears promising. According to Amazon, over 900,000 sellers have used their generative AI features to date. Furthermore, they state that merchants accept the AI-generated content without edits over 90% of the time. While this high acceptance rate could indicate satisfaction, it also highlights the importance for sellers to carefully review the AI’s output for accuracy and brand consistency. Who Else is Using AI in E-commerce? Amazon is not alone in integrating generative AI into e-commerce platforms to aid sellers . Other major players in the digital marketplace arena are also developing and releasing similar tools. Companies like Google, eBay, Meta, and Shopify have introduced various AI-powered features aimed at assisting merchants with marketing, content creation, and listing optimization. Additionally, startups are emerging that focus specifically on providing AI applications to help sellers create marketing assets efficiently. This trend underscores the growing recognition across the industry that AI is essential for scaling and optimizing online retail operations. For sellers , it means access to increasingly sophisticated tools to compete effectively in the crowded e-commerce landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future of AI in Product Listings The rollout of Enhance My Listing, starting with select U.S. sellers and expanding soon, signifies Amazon’s continued investment in AI for its core business. As generative AI models become more advanced, we can expect these tools to become even more intuitive and capable of generating highly tailored and effective content for product listings . For sellers , embracing these AI tools will likely become less of an option and more of a necessity to maintain efficiency and visibility. While the technology offers significant advantages, the human element of review and strategic input remains critical to ensure accuracy and brand voice. In conclusion, Amazon’s new Enhance My Listing tool is a significant step in integrating generative AI deeper into the e-commerce workflow. By simplifying the task of optimizing product listings , Amazon aims to empower its vast network of sellers , contributing to a more efficient and dynamic online marketplace that is integral to the broader digital economy.

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling. Source: James Filan “This settlement, alongside the programmatic disassembly of the SEC’s crypto enforcement program, does a tremendous disservice to the investing public and undermines the court’s role in interpreting our securities laws,” she said. “In the meantime, the settlement joins a line of dismissals that collectively erode the credibility of our lawyers in court who are being asked to take legal positions today contrary to the ones taken just months ago.” Under the Trump administration, the SEC has slowly been walking back its hardline stance toward crypto firms forged under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s reign, dismissing a growing number of enforcement actions against crypto firms. At the same time, Crenshaw argues that if Judge Torres accepts the settlement, it would erase “the investor protections we already won” and leave a “regulatory vacuum,” until the crypto task force hammers out a regulatory framework. “The settlement is not in the best interests of the investors and markets that our agency is tasked with serving and protecting. It creates more questions than answers.” In August last year, a Judge ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in penalties after ruling the firm’s XRP ( XRP ) token was covered by securities laws when sold to institutional investors. What’s next for the Ripple case? It’s not over yet While the SEC and Ripple have agreed to a settlement, it’s still not a done deal, according to ex-federal prosecutor James Filan, because there are several steps before the long-running legal saga can conclude. For a start, Judge Torres needs to provide an indicative ruling if she agrees to the settlement letter, Filan said in a May 8 analysis on X. Source: James Filan If Torres provides an indicative ruling, the SEC and Ripple will ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for a limited remand back to Judge Torres, which, if granted, will result in another motion being filed for the agreed settlement, according to Filan.

The company blamed the dip on reduced trading activity despite a broad recovery in the crypto market. The total revenue in the quarter was about $2.03 billion, below analysts’ estimated $2.2 billion, a 10% decline from the previous quarter . The price of Bitcoin climbed to nearly $100,000 during the quarter, but the rally did not prompt enough user activity to lift trading revenue. As a result, transaction revenue declined, settling at $1.26 billion below the estimated $1.33 billion. Historically, this core segment was the company’s bread and butter—it underperformed as retail investors remained cautious and institutional activity slowed. However, Coinbase managed to rack up points in its stablecoin sector , with revenue rising 32% Q/Q and the average USDC balance across its products jumping 49% Q/Q to $12 billion. Total revenue rose to $2.03 billion from $1.64 billion a year earlier. That still missed analysts’ expectations of $2.1 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company earned an adjusted net income of $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, for the three months ended March 31, compared with $679.2 million, or $2.53 per share, a year earlier. Higher expenses drive down Coinbase earnings The earnings report also disclosed that operating expenses spiked 51% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. The spike was fueled mainly by increased marketing expenses and write-downs related to crypto assets held for operational use. The higher outlays weighed heavily on profits. Coinbase recorded an adjusted net income of $526.6 million, or $1.94 a share, well below $679.2 million, or $2.53 a share, in the same quarter last year. The company said that macroeconomic uncertainty and reduced trading demand were among the factors that had affected user engagement. However, market watchers also attributed broader risk-off sentiment to U.S. policy uncertainty, which likely kept retail and institutional investors on the sidelines. Shares of Coinbase dropped about 3% in after-hours trading after the report. Coinbase expands into Derivatives with $2.9B Deribit buyout In a series of ambitious moves intended to diversify itself and hold on to more of the growth in cryptocurrency-related derivatives trading, Coinbase also said that it had signed an agreement to acquire Deribit, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency options exchanges, for $2.9 billion. The deal, made up of $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase stock, is a major foray into the crypto options universe. Deribit, which is headquartered in Dubai, saw more than $1 trillion in derivatives trading volume on its platform last year. This acquisition aims to position Coinbase as a global crypto derivatives market leader, which is increasingly becoming a key growth area for digital asset platforms. The chief executive of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, said the shift was part of the company’s yearning to develop, over the long term, into a one-stop financial hub for the crypto economy. The purchase of Deribit is expected to close later this year, pending regulatory approvals. The deal comes amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s vocal support for digital assets and his promise to make America the global hub for cryptocurrency. Riding a wave of regulatory optimism, several crypto firms are actively striking major deals to expand their reach. Just last month, Ripple acquired multi-asset prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion—one of the largest acquisitions in the company’s history.

44350139,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158685,1746751835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Superstate Platform Brings US Blockchain Stocks to Solana,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/superstate-launches-blockchain-stocks/,"Get ready for a potential shift in how we think about traditional finance and digital assets! A major development is unfolding that could bridge the gap between Wall Street and the blockchain world. Superstate, the innovative company founded by Compound founder Robert Leshner, is making waves with its new platform designed to allow trading of U.S. SEC-registered stocks directly on the blockchain. This is a significant step towards integrating traditional financial instruments with the efficiency and transparency of distributed ledger technology, specifically starting with the high-performance Solana network. What is Superstate’s “Opening Bell” Platform? Superstate’s new initiative is called “Opening Bell,” a fitting name that evokes the start of the trading day. The core idea behind this platform is straightforward yet powerful: enable companies to issue their public shares not just on traditional stock exchanges, but also as digital assets directly on a blockchain. This means that the ownership and transfer of these blockchain stocks could potentially be managed on-chain, offering new possibilities for accessibility and efficiency. Here are some key aspects of the Opening Bell platform: Direct On-Chain Issuance: Companies can issue their shares as digital tokens. SEC-Registered Securities: Focus is on shares already registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, aiming for regulatory compliance. Initial Blockchain: Launching first on the Solana blockchain, known for its speed and low transaction costs. Target Audience: Designed for both retail and institutional investors. This move represents a significant expansion for Superstate, which initially focused on tokenizing traditional investment funds. By moving into programmable equities, they are tackling a much larger and potentially more impactful market segment. The Vision of Robert Leshner and Superstate The driving force behind Superstate is Robert Leshner , a well-known figure in the DeFi space as the founder of Compound Protocol. His vision for Superstate appears to be centered around bringing the benefits of blockchain technology – such as efficiency, transparency, and programmability – to traditional financial assets. Tokenizing funds was a logical first step, but moving to public company shares is a bold leap that could redefine how securities are issued, owned, and traded. Leshner and Superstate believe that putting shares on the blockchain can unlock new capabilities: Potentially faster settlement times compared to traditional T+2 cycles. Increased transparency of ownership records. The ability to program compliance rules directly into the digital asset. Greater accessibility for a wider range of investors globally. This aligns with a broader trend in the financial world exploring the potential of tokenization for various asset classes, from real estate to fine art and now, public equities. Why Solana for Tokenized Equities? Superstate’s choice to start with Solana for its Opening Bell platform is noteworthy. Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and scalability, capable of handling a large volume of transactions quickly and cheaply. These characteristics are crucial for a trading platform that aims to handle potentially millions of securities transactions. Using Solana could offer several advantages for trading tokenized equities : Speed: Transactions can settle in seconds, far faster than traditional systems. Cost: Transaction fees (gas fees) on Solana are typically very low, making frequent trading more economical. Scalability: The network is designed to handle high throughput, essential for market activity. Developer Ecosystem: Solana has a growing ecosystem of developers building financial applications. While other blockchains are also exploring asset tokenization, Solana’s technical architecture makes it a compelling choice for a high-frequency application like a stock trading platform. Who is the First Company to Join? The first company slated to utilize Superstate’s Opening Bell platform is Canadian firm SOL Strategies. This partnership is set to be a real-world test case for trading SEC-registered shares on the blockchain. Key details about this first step: Company: SOL Strategies (a Canadian firm). Asset: Their public shares. Target Blockchain: Solana. Timeline: Expected to begin trading this summer. Crucial Hurdle: This is all pending regulatory approval, highlighting the ongoing need for clear guidelines in this emerging space. The success of this initial launch with SOL Strategies will be closely watched as it could pave the way for other companies to consider issuing their shares on the blockchain. What Are Tokenized Equities and Why Do They Matter? Tokenized equities are essentially digital representations of traditional stock shares on a blockchain. Each token represents ownership of a specific share in a company. This process of tokenization transforms the traditional stock certificate or electronic record into a programmable digital asset. The significance lies in the potential benefits they could bring: Increased Liquidity: Potentially easier to trade globally, 24/7. Fractional Ownership: Easier to buy and sell fractions of expensive shares. Programmability: Corporate actions (like dividends or voting rights) could potentially be automated using smart contracts. Reduced Costs: Streamlining intermediaries could lower transaction costs. Enhanced Transparency: Ownership history is recorded on an immutable ledger. While challenges remain, particularly around regulation, compliance, and integration with existing financial infrastructure, the promise of tokenized equities is substantial for modernizing capital markets. Challenges and the Path Forward Launching a platform for trading SEC-registered securities on a blockchain is not without its hurdles. The primary challenge mentioned in the announcement is regulatory approval. Navigating the complex landscape of securities regulation while utilizing novel blockchain technology requires careful consideration and collaboration with regulatory bodies like the SEC. Other potential challenges include: Ensuring robust security measures for digital assets. Developing infrastructure for clearing and settlement in a blockchain environment. Educating investors and market participants about this new paradigm. Achieving widespread adoption among companies and investors. Superstate’s approach of starting with SEC-registered shares suggests a focus on working within existing regulatory frameworks, which is a crucial step towards broader acceptance and adoption. Concluding Thoughts: A Glimpse into the Future? Superstate’s launch of Opening Bell marks a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. By enabling the issuance and trading of U.S. SEC-registered public shares on networks like Solana, Robert Leshner and his team are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with tokenized equities . While regulatory approval and market adoption will be key factors determining its ultimate success, this initiative offers a compelling glimpse into a future where traditional assets are seamlessly integrated with the efficiency, transparency, and programmability of the blockchain. The potential implications for capital markets, from increased accessibility to potentially lower costs, are vast and worth watching closely as the first trades commence this summer.

The current phase 4 price stands at $0.025 while phase 5 will initiate a value increase to $0.03 since the current phase currently has 60% of its supply sold out. The trading range of Cardano (ADA) remains restricted below 0.73 USD. The innovative lending model of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts investors while predicting a 40,650% growth during its upcoming 10 weeks thus competing against Cardano’s (ADA) slow-speed progress. The presale event of MUTM attracts numerous investors because they sense a limited chance to enter the market. Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) so good that it surpasses its competition in the market space with Cardano (ADA)? The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The crypto market keeps its eye on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it continues to skyrocket in popularity. 65% of the tokens in MUTM Phase 4 of an 11-phase presale have been bought at $0.025 each. Phase 5 of the MUTM presale will initiate at $0.03 thus delivering 20% profit to early phase 4 buyers. The tokenomics system provides a 140% profit at the $0.06 listing price while showing potential to reach $3 after launch for an incredible ROI of 11,900%. The team recently introduced a top 50 holder dashboard that gives bonus tokens to maintain their positions. The growing loyalty among investors creates higher demand for the token. The rapid disappearance of phase 4 positions compels investors to speed up their entry before the entry window closes. Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Gain Traction The price of Cardano ADA maintains a static position at $0.66 whereas the highest value achieved this month stands at $0.73. The adoption of network upgrade Loas fails to improve ADA prices because their chart continues showing a descending triangle pattern. Although technical analysis shows an upward trend potential there are signs of weakening bullish momentum on the MACD which indicates extended market consolidation periods. An ADA Exchange Traded Fund demonstrates institutional support but ADA faces decreased optimism because it fails to cross above $0.7. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) accelerates while Cardano moves gradually which creates the risk of faster DeFi projects replacing it in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Bolsters Trust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team members are conducting a Certik smart contract audit that will provide results through social media channels. The initiative to reveal project activities leads to increased faith from investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides stability by using its dual-lending protocol which unites peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems supported by overcollateralized loans. Revenues from token buybacks establish a permanent market demand that effectively benefits token stakers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrencies because its phase 4 completion brings a potential $3 post-launch value together with a 140% listing gain. Implementable capabilities make Mutuum Finance stand above Cardano since its success relies completely on future product developments. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Outshines ADA Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will overtake Cardano (ADA) in terms of market position during 2025. ADA faces hurdles and uncertainty in the market as the MUTM platform achieves high presale success with properly designed token economics which delivers both rapid value appreciation and extended financial growth prospects. The crypto market stands to be taken over by MUTM based on projections predicting a 40,650% growth shaped by its anticipated $3 post-launch value. Phase 4 of MUTM presents investors with a precious opportunity to receive high-yield returns before its closure.

44350439,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158687,1746752432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BTCPay Server Receives Pivotal $100K Tether Grant for Open Source Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btcpay-server-tether-grant/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, support for foundational infrastructure is key to long-term growth and adoption. That’s why recent news from Tether, the issuer of the widely used USDT stablecoin, has caught the attention of many in the space. Tether announced a significant contribution aimed at bolstering the backbone of crypto commerce: a second $100,000 grant to the BTCPay Server Foundation. This move isn’t just about money; it’s a strong reaffirmation of commitment to the principles of free and open-source software development, which are vital for a decentralized future. Why is Support for Open Source Crypto Critical? The cryptocurrency ecosystem thrives on transparency, security, and community collaboration. This is where Open Source Crypto projects like BTCPay Server play an indispensable role. Unlike proprietary software, open-source code is publicly available, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and contribute to it. This collaborative model fosters innovation, enhances security through peer review, and prevents vendor lock-in. Supporting open-source development is an investment in the entire ecosystem. It ensures that critical tools and infrastructure remain accessible, adaptable, and resilient against censorship or control by a single entity. For a project like BTCPay Server, which handles sensitive payment data, the open nature of its code is a fundamental security feature, building trust with users and developers alike. What is BTCPay Server and Its Role as a Crypto Payment Processor? At its core, BTCPay Server is a self-hosted, open-source cryptocurrency payment processor. Think of it as a powerful tool that allows businesses, individuals, and non-profits to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly, without relying on third-party payment gateways that might charge high fees or impose restrictions. It provides a secure and private way to handle crypto transactions. As a leading Crypto Payment Processor , BTCPay Server offers a suite of features: Direct payments: Funds go straight to your wallet, no intermediaries. Privacy: Enhanced privacy compared to traditional payment processors. Security: Control your own keys and infrastructure. Customization: Highly flexible and adaptable to various business needs. Accepts multiple cryptocurrencies: While focused on Bitcoin, it supports others, including facilitating USDT Payments . Integrations: Plugins for popular e-commerce platforms like WooCommerce, Shopify, and more. Its open-source nature means its development is driven by community needs and contributions, making it a robust and evolving solution for anyone looking to integrate crypto payments. Understanding the Significance of the Tether Grant This latest Tether Grant of $100,000 to the BTCPay Server Foundation is particularly noteworthy because it’s the second such contribution from Tether in a relatively short period, following a similar grant in April. This indicates a sustained commitment rather than a one-off donation. Why is Tether, a stablecoin issuer, investing in a Bitcoin-focused payment processor? It aligns with Tether’s broader goal of fostering utility and adoption within the cryptocurrency space. By supporting essential infrastructure like BTCPay Server, Tether helps create more avenues for businesses and users to interact with digital assets, including making USDT Payments easier and more accessible where BTCPay Server supports it. Grants like these provide crucial financial stability to open-source projects that often rely heavily on volunteer efforts and smaller donations. This funding can be used for various critical activities: Hiring core developers to dedicate full-time effort to the project. Improving security audits and infrastructure. Developing new features and integrations. Enhancing documentation and user support. Covering operational costs like servers and legal expenses. Essentially, the Tether Grant empowers the BTCPay Server team to accelerate development and maintain the high quality and security standards necessary for a trusted Crypto Payment Processor . How Does This Grant Benefit the Ecosystem and Facilitate USDT Payments? The ripple effects of this funding extend beyond just the BTCPay Server team. A stronger, more feature-rich BTCPay Server benefits anyone looking to accept crypto payments. For merchants, it means a more reliable, secure, and easier-to-integrate platform. This lowers the barrier to entry for accepting cryptocurrencies, potentially driving wider adoption. For users, it means more places where they can spend their digital assets directly. Furthermore, as BTCPay Server continues to evolve, its ability to handle various digital assets, including stablecoins, improves. This directly impacts the potential for widespread USDT Payments . Stablecoins are often preferred by merchants due to their price stability compared to volatile assets like Bitcoin. By supporting robust open-source infrastructure that can process stablecoins efficiently and securely, Tether helps build the rails for a future where digital currency payments are commonplace. This grant is a concrete example of how established players in the crypto space can contribute meaningfully to the underlying Open Source Crypto infrastructure that benefits everyone. What Are the Challenges for Open Source Crypto Projects? While the support from entities like Tether is invaluable, Open Source Crypto projects still face significant challenges. Sustainability is a constant concern; relying solely on donations can be unpredictable. Burnout among volunteer developers is also a risk. Ensuring timely security updates and keeping pace with rapid technological changes requires dedicated effort and resources. Another challenge for a Crypto Payment Processor like BTCPay Server is competing with well-funded proprietary solutions that often have larger marketing budgets and sales teams. Educating businesses about the benefits of a self-hosted, open-source solution versus a traditional third-party processor is an ongoing task. However, the inherent advantages of open source – transparency, security, and community ownership – provide a strong foundation to overcome these hurdles, especially with crucial financial backing like the recent Tether Grant . Actionable Insights: How Can You Support Open Source Crypto? Whether you’re a developer, a business owner, or simply a crypto enthusiast, there are ways you can contribute to the growth of projects like BTCPay Server and the broader Open Source Crypto movement: Contribute Code: If you’re a developer, find a project you believe in and contribute bug fixes, features, or documentation. Report Bugs & Provide Feedback: Use the software and report any issues you find. Your feedback is vital for improvement. Donate: Financial contributions, like the Tether Grant , are essential. Many projects accept donations directly in crypto or fiat. Run a BTCPay Server Instance: If you’re a merchant, use BTCPay Server to accept payments. If you’re technical, run a public node to help the network. Spread the Word: Educate others about the importance of open source and the benefits of using open-source tools for crypto payments, including facilitating USDT Payments . Create Content: Write tutorials, make videos, or create guides to help others use open-source crypto tools. Every contribution, no matter how small, helps these projects thrive and build a more decentralized and resilient future for cryptocurrency. Conclusion: A Positive Step for Crypto Infrastructure Tether’s second $100,000 grant to the BTCPay Server Foundation is a powerful statement. It underscores the importance that major players in the crypto space place on robust, decentralized, and community-driven infrastructure. By supporting a leading Open Source Crypto project and Crypto Payment Processor like BTCPay Server, Tether is not only helping to improve a vital tool for accepting payments, including potentially expanding the ease of USDT Payments , but also reinforcing the core principles of the crypto movement. This Tether Grant provides essential resources that will enable BTCPay Server to continue developing, enhancing security, and expanding its capabilities, ultimately benefiting merchants, users, and the entire ecosystem striving for greater crypto adoption. It’s a positive development that highlights the potential for collaboration between large entities and grassroots open-source initiatives to build a stronger foundation for the future of finance.

Dogecoin ‘Looks Incredible’ The DOGE/USDT pair on Binance is printing a weekly candle at $0.1828 (open 0.1705, high 0.1833, low 0.1643), up 7.2% on the week. Two long-term moving averages frame the current structure: the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA-50) at $0.203 in blue and the rising 200-week EMA (EMA-200) at $0.138 in red. Price sliced below the EMA-50 earlier this year, but—crucially in Maelius’ view—never lost the EMA-200, which now sits inside a broad, slate-coloured demand zone running roughly from $0.11 to $0.20. A second layer of support comes from an ascending red trend-line that links the October 2023, August 2024 and April 2025 swing-lows. The most recent pullback, labelled “2” on the chart, bounced almost precisely where that diagonal meets the EMA-200 and the lower edge of demand—an area of triple confluence that technicians often see as a textbook springboard for the next advance. Related Reading: 72% Of Binance Traders Go Long On Dogecoin, What Does This Mean For Price? Maelius’ primary thesis rests on a nested 1-2, 1-2 Elliott Wave count. The first “1-2” sequence began with a thrust to ~$ 0.2288 in March 2024, retraced to $ 0.0805 in August the same year, and then ignited a larger impulsive leg that topped near $0.4843 in December last year (labelled the second “1”). The corrective follow-through to $0.1298 in April completed the second “2”. In Elliott terminology, two consecutive 1-2 structures “wind the spring” for wave 3 of (3)—historically the longest and steepest portion of an impulse. Maelius places the coming third wave, its subsequent fourth-wave consolidation, and a final fifth wave in the blank area above current price. He predicts DOGE to reach roughly $1 as part of the third wave, followed by a correctional fourth wave below $0.70. The fifth wave is forecasted to reach its climax somewhere between $1.30 and $1.70. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bounce Expected By Analyst Who Called Bitcoin Bottom Beneath the price action sits the WaveTrend Oscillator (WTO), a momentum indicator closely related to the TSI that measures the distance between an asset’s price and its own smoothed values. The WTO prints two lines and a histogram; a bullish cycle begins when the faster line crosses above the slower one from oversold territory (–60/–53 in the standard settings). That cross has just fired on the 1-week timeframe for the first time since the August 2024 low. The histogram has shifted from deep red to neutral grey, echoing similar transitions that preceded Dogecoin’s previous vertical advances. Put together, the chart describes a market that is holding a multi-year demand block, trading above its 200-week EMA, testing—though not yet reclaiming—its 50-week EMA, and exhibiting a fresh bullish momentum cross. From a pure-chart standpoint, those ingredients satisfy many of the conditions technicians look for when hunting the start of a primary trend leg. Maelius concludes: “DOGE looks incredible here, despite the fact it went lower as I initially expected (was expecting EMA50 to hold).Respecting major demand area, EMA200 as well as diagonal support and it seems like 1,2,1,2 is completed and now we head for 3rd EW (within larger 3rd). 1W WTO recently crossed, which is also supportive of bottom being in.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.18445.

While these two dominant memecoins continue to dominate social sentiment, analysts and early investors are increasingly eyeing a new altcoin on the rise: MAGACOINFINANCE , which recently secured a significant $7.8 million in early-stage funding . Dogecoin Faces Key Resistance Dogecoin, which rallied over 15% in late April alongside Bitcoin’s breakout above $90,000, is now encountering a familiar resistance zone around the $0.20 mark . Despite strong social media presence and high engagement among retail traders, momentum has started to taper, with price forecasts suggesting a tight trading range in the near term. While some bullish models point to targets above $0.22 or even $0.65 later this year, these depend heavily on broader market catalysts and meme coin cycles. Shiba Inu’s Short-Term Forecasts Remain Volatile Similarly, Shiba Inu has delivered sharp short-term gains, with recent projections indicating potential spikes of up to 125% , but volatility remains extreme. Analysts caution that SHIB’s upward trajectory could stall without sustained adoption of its layer-2 solution, Shibarium , and meaningful developments within its ecosystem. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE Gains Ground as a Fresh Entry In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is beginning to emerge as an under-the-radar contender in 2025’s altcoin landscape. Following its $7.8M raise , investor sentiment has shifted toward this newer entrant, particularly as it positions itself outside the noise typically associated with legacy meme coins. Backed by a growing community and early-stage momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE is now being flagged by some traders as a potential “sleeper” asset — one that may offer greater stability and long-term upside compared to older, more saturated plays. Investors Explore Altcoin Rotation Opportunities What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart is the timing. With traditional meme coins showing mixed signals, there is growing appetite among investors for alternative low-cap projects with strong early backing. MAGACOINFINANCE appears to be capitalizing on this sentiment by appealing not only to retail communities but also to analysts tracking capital rotation ahead of mid-year altcoin shifts. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion: Focus Shifts to MAGACOINFINANCE While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to command headlines, the narrative is clearly evolving. As market conditions reset and momentum strategies change, investors seeking fresh opportunities are watching what comes next — and for many , MAGACOINFINANCE i s increasingly where that attention is going.

While our focus is often on the digital asset space, understanding the broader financial markets is absolutely key. Today brings some significant news from across the pond, as the US stock market has kicked off the trading day on a decidedly positive note. What’s Driving This US Stock Market Rally? The opening bells on Wall Street today were met with enthusiasm, leading to a notable market rally across the major indices. Here’s a quick look at how the key players are performing early on: S&P500: Up +0.57% NASDAQ: Up a strong +1% Dow: Up +0.5% This broad-based upward movement suggests positive investor sentiment prevailing in the early hours of trading. Several factors could be contributing to this optimism. Market participants are often reacting to recent economic data releases, corporate earnings reports, or anticipating future moves from central banks like the Federal Reserve. Positive news on any of these fronts can fuel buying activity. Why Does Positive Investor Sentiment in the US Stock Market Matter to Crypto? You might be asking, “Why should I care about the Nasdaq S&P Dow when I’m focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum?” That’s a great question! The truth is, the world of finance is interconnected. What happens in traditional financial markets , particularly in the dominant US market, can often have ripple effects on other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s how it works: Risk Appetite: When traditional markets like stocks are performing well, it often signals increased risk appetite among investors. They are more willing to put money into assets perceived as having higher growth potential, which can include tech stocks (heavily represented in the Nasdaq) and, yes, sometimes even cryptocurrencies. Capital Flows: Strong performance in one market can free up capital or encourage investors to rebalance portfolios, potentially leading to flows into other assets. Macroeconomic Signals: The factors driving the stock market rally (like inflation data, employment numbers, or interest rate expectations) are often the same macroeconomic forces that influence the crypto market. Understanding the stock market’s reaction can provide clues about the broader economic environment. Correlation (Sometimes): While not always perfectly correlated, there have been periods where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown a correlation with tech stocks, especially those in the Nasdaq. A strong day for tech can sometimes translate into a strong day for crypto, and vice versa. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of This Market Movement? Benefits: Positive Spillover: A sustained US stock market rally fueled by strong economic fundamentals or easing inflation concerns could potentially create a favorable environment for risk assets like crypto. Improved Confidence: A rising tide lifts all boats, as they say. Positive momentum in major markets can boost overall investor sentiment . Economic Health Indicator: A strong stock market is often seen as a barometer for the health of the economy, which indirectly affects the crypto landscape. Challenges: Decoupling Risk: While correlations exist, crypto can also move independently or even inversely to traditional markets. Relying solely on stock market performance is not a sound crypto investment strategy. Volatility: Both stock markets and crypto markets are prone to volatility. Today’s gains in the Nasdaq S&P Dow could be followed by declines tomorrow based on new information. Sector-Specific Drivers: The reasons for a stock market rally might be specific to certain sectors (e.g., tech earnings), which don’t directly translate to the drivers of crypto prices (e.g., regulatory news, adoption rates). Looking Ahead: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you take away from today’s positive opening in the US stock market ? Firstly, it’s a good reminder to keep an eye on the broader economic landscape. While crypto has unique drivers, it doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Pay attention to major economic indicators and central bank commentary, as these influence all financial markets . Secondly, understand that positive investor sentiment in one market can spill over, but don’t assume it’s a guaranteed correlation. Use this information as one data point among many when assessing the overall market mood. Finally, continue to focus on the fundamentals of the crypto projects you are interested in. While macro trends matter, the long-term success of cryptocurrencies depends on technology, adoption, regulation, and community. Today’s positive start for the Nasdaq S&P Dow is certainly noteworthy, reflecting a hopeful tone in traditional finance. Whether this momentum continues and how it ultimately influences the crypto market remains to be seen, but staying informed across all asset classes is crucial for any savvy investor. Summary In conclusion, the US stock market opened higher today, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow posting solid early gains. This development signals positive investor sentiment and highlights the interconnectedness of global financial markets . While not a direct predictor of crypto prices, understanding the drivers behind this market rally in the Nasdaq S&P Dow provides valuable context for navigating the broader investment environment. Keep watching how these traditional market movements unfold and consider their potential, albeit indirect, impact on the world of digital assets.

With $8 million already raised , investors are now asking the critical question: how far can this presale go before listings take it mainstream? While Trump Coin ($TRUMP) continues to dominate media cycles, analysts are increasingly pointing to a different politically charged token — one that’s still under the radar but showing signs of massive potential. That token is MAGACOINFINANCE , and it’s built for exponential growth with a narrative-first approach and smart presale design. CLICK HERE – SECURE YOUR SPOT BEFORE 25x DISAPPEARS Trump Coin’s Wild Ride — But Is It Topping Out? Associated with former President Donald Trump, Trump Coin reached a peak of $16.42 in April before pulling back into a consolidation zone between $11.79 and $11.20 . While some analysts remain cautiously bullish, others suggest the explosive gains may be behind it. The token is currently testing major support near $10.69 , and failure to hold that zone could trigger a deeper correction. Despite its national media visibility, many traders believe the majority of Trump Coin’s parabolic upside has already been priced in — leaving limited room for fresh investors chasing large returns. Why This New Token Still Holds Massive Upside Potential In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is still priced under $0.001 , offering enormous upside as it moves through the advanced stages of its presale. With Stage 7 now live and a projected listing target of $0.007 , the base ROI sits at 25x potential , and that’s before bonuses are applied. Early buyers using promo code MAGA50X receive 50% extra tokens , effectively compounding potential returns even further. But this isn’t just a bonus play, it’s a strategically designed launch framework. Key features include: Narrative-aligned virality with political meme energy Referral-powered expansion via reward-based promotion Presale-only access , ensuring controlled token distribution Stage-by-stage scaling , creating urgency and buyer momentum Tokens launched under similar mechanics — like DOGE and SHIBA in past cycles — have delivered up to 18,500% gains , according to analysts tracking early-stage altcoin ROI patterns. LISTINGS COULD DROP ANY MOMENT –ACT NOW Final Verdict: Trump Coin May Lead Headlines — But This New Crypto Could Lead 2025’s Gains While Trump Coin captured the first wave of political meme energy, MAGACOINFINANCE appears poised to dominate the second. With a carefully controlled presale, untapped CEX listing momentum, and growing analyst coverage, it’s one of the most strategically positioned cryptocurrencies of 2025 .

44351210,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158695,1746753615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,OpenAI Data Residency: Securely Expanding Across Asia,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-data-residency-asia/,"For anyone invested in the cryptocurrency space, the principles of data control, privacy, and sovereignty are fundamental. These concepts are becoming increasingly critical in the world of Artificial Intelligence as well. Recognizing the growing need for organizations to manage where their data resides, especially in diverse regulatory environments, OpenAI has announced a significant expansion of its data residency efforts, bringing the OpenAI data residency program to Asia. OpenAI Data Residency Program Arrives in Asia Following the successful rollout of a similar initiative in Europe earlier this year, OpenAI is now offering data residency options specifically for customers in Asia. This new program is designed to help organizations operating within the region meet their local data sovereignty requirements while leveraging OpenAI’s powerful AI models and services. The program is available to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and customers utilizing the OpenAI API. Eligible API customers, as well as new ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu subscribers, now have the ability to choose to have their data stored at rest within specific supported countries in Asia. The initial list of countries includes key economic and technological hubs in the region: Japan India Singapore South Korea This provides organizations in or dealing with these countries a crucial option for managing their data locations, a capability that is becoming increasingly important for legal and compliance reasons. Why is Data Sovereignty Crucial for the Asia AI Market? The concept of data sovereignty refers to the idea that data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the nation in which it is collected or processed. In the context of the rapidly expanding Asia AI market , this is particularly relevant. Asia is home to a wide range of countries, each with its own unique set of data protection laws, privacy regulations, and governmental requirements regarding data storage and access. For businesses and educational institutions operating across multiple Asian jurisdictions, navigating this complex landscape can be challenging. Storing data in the country where it originates or is primarily used helps organizations align with local regulations, which can mandate that certain types of sensitive data (such as personal information, financial records, or government data) must remain within national borders. Non-compliance can lead to significant legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss of trust from customers and stakeholders. OpenAI’s move directly addresses this challenge, providing a technical solution that supports organizations’ efforts to respect national data laws and maintain control over where their data is physically located when using OpenAI services. Enhancing AI Compliance and Trust in Asia The introduction of data residency options is a significant step towards enhancing AI compliance for organizations in Asia. Compliance is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s also about building trust with users, partners, and regulatory bodies. By offering the ability to store data locally, OpenAI is helping its customers meet a variety of compliance needs: Meeting Local Regulations: Directly supports adherence to specific national data protection laws and residency mandates in Japan, India, Singapore, and South Korea. Industry-Specific Requirements: Helps organizations in regulated sectors like finance, healthcare, and government meet stringent data handling requirements that often include local storage mandates. Building Customer Trust: Demonstrates a commitment to protecting user data by keeping it within a familiar legal jurisdiction, which can be a key factor for customers when choosing AI service providers. Facilitating Government Adoption: Makes it easier for government agencies and public sector organizations, which often have the strictest data sovereignty rules, to consider using OpenAI’s enterprise-grade products. OpenAI emphasized this point, stating in a blog post, “For the API platform and ChatGPT business products, data remains confidential, secure, and entirely owned by you. Data residency further enhances data control for organizations.” This reinforces the message of user ownership and control over their data, a principle that resonates strongly with data-conscious users. What Does This Mean for ChatGPT Enterprise Asia Users? For businesses and educational institutions that rely on ChatGPT Enterprise Asia or ChatGPT Edu, or who integrate OpenAI models via the API, this program offers tangible benefits. Beyond the critical aspect of regulatory compliance, having data stored closer to the point of use can potentially offer performance advantages, such as reduced latency, although the primary benefit highlighted is data control and security. Enterprise clients often handle sensitive proprietary information, customer data, or research materials. Knowing that this data, when used with OpenAI services, can be confined to a specific geographic region provides an added layer of security assurance and simplifies their internal data governance policies. This is particularly appealing to large corporations, research institutions, and universities operating in the supported Asian countries. Data Residency: A Key Step Towards Global AI Expansion The debut of the Asia data residency program is not an isolated event but part of OpenAI’s broader strategy for accelerated global expansion. This move follows closely on the heels of the company announcing “OpenAI for Countries,” an initiative aimed at building out the necessary infrastructure and localized approaches to better serve international clientele. By establishing data residency options in key regions like Europe and now Asia, OpenAI is demonstrating its commitment to becoming a truly global AI provider capable of meeting diverse local needs and regulatory landscapes. This positions them competitively in international markets where data control is a major consideration for potential enterprise and government clients. As the AI arms race continues globally, providing robust data management options like residency will be crucial for winning over large, security-conscious customers in the thriving Asia AI market . Navigating the Complexities While offering data residency in these four countries is a significant step, the regulatory environment across Asia remains incredibly diverse. Organizations operating in other Asian countries or dealing with data from multiple jurisdictions will still need to carefully consider their overall data architecture and compliance strategy. However, for those focused on Japan, India, Singapore, and South Korea, this program provides a direct and valuable tool for enhancing their data governance and AI compliance efforts. A Positive Development for Data Control In conclusion, OpenAI’s launch of a data residency program in Asia is a positive and necessary development for organizations seeking greater control over their data while utilizing advanced AI. By enabling data to be stored at rest in Japan, India, Singapore, and South Korea, OpenAI is directly addressing the critical need for data sovereignty and facilitating AI compliance in these key markets. This move benefits users of ChatGPT Enterprise Asia , ChatGPT Edu, and the OpenAI API, fostering trust and enabling wider adoption of AI within the region’s complex regulatory environment. It underscores OpenAI’s commitment to global expansion and catering to the specific needs of the dynamic Asia AI market .

While cryptocurrency markets operate on decentralized principles, they are not immune to the effects of macroeconomic shifts and significant government policies. A recent announcement regarding a major US UK Trade Deal serves as a prime example of how decisions at the national level can influence the broader environment in which all assets, digital or otherwise, exist. Understanding the Announced US UK Trade Deal Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently announced what he described as the first ‘fair and reciprocal’ trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom. This declaration, reported by sources like Walter Bloomberg on X, marked a significant moment in post-Brexit UK US Relations , aiming to redefine the economic partnership between the two long-standing allies. The specifics of the deal, particularly concerning tariffs and trade flows, offer a glimpse into the intricate negotiations that shape international commerce. Key points highlighted in the initial announcement include: The U.S. maintaining a 10% tariff on certain British goods. Projections for substantial revenue generation for the U.S. government from these tariffs. Anticipated creation of new export opportunities for American industries. Specific tariff reductions on British automobiles entering the U.S. market. A significant planned purchase of U.S. aircraft by the UK. These details paint a picture of a negotiated outcome designed to benefit specific sectors and generate revenue, reflecting the strategic considerations often at play in high-level trade discussions. The Nuances of Trump Tariffs and Expected Revenue A central element of the announced agreement is the continuation of a 10% tariff on certain British goods. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are a classic tool of Economic Policy used by governments for various reasons, including protecting domestic industries, generating revenue, or as leverage in trade negotiations. According to the announcement, this specific 10% tariff is expected to generate approximately $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. government. The decision to maintain this tariff level, rather than eliminating it entirely, indicates a strategic approach focused on securing financial benefits while simultaneously pursuing broader trade liberalization in other areas. The concept of ‘fair and reciprocal’ trade often involves balancing access to markets with measures designed to ensure perceived equitable benefits for both sides. Understanding the role and impact of Trump Tariffs , both during his presidency and as they persist in subsequent agreements, is crucial for grasping the administration’s trade philosophy and its potential effects on international markets. Boosting Exports and Shifting Global Trade Dynamics Beyond revenue generation, the agreement is also projected to create significant export opportunities for American businesses. The announcement specified an expectation of $5 billion in new export opportunities for American farmers and producers. This highlights a key objective of many trade deals: opening foreign markets to domestic goods and services, thereby stimulating economic growth and supporting specific industries. Furthermore, the deal includes specific provisions impacting key sectors: Automobiles: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick noted that tariffs on British automobiles imported into the U.S. would see a significant reduction, dropping from 25% to 10%. This change could potentially make British cars more competitive in the U.S. market and represents a tangible benefit for that industry. Aerospace: A major component of the agreement involves the UK’s commitment to purchase $10 billion worth of Boeing aircraft. This large-scale purchase provides a substantial boost to the American aerospace sector and underscores the strategic economic ties between the two nations. These specific examples illustrate how trade agreements can directly impact industries and reshape patterns of Global Trade . Such shifts can influence everything from supply chains to currency valuations, factors that investors across all asset classes, including those focused on digital currencies, often monitor for their potential indirect effects on market sentiment and capital flows. Analyzing Economic Policy and Its Wider Impact This US UK Trade Deal is a prime example of how governments utilize Economic Policy to achieve national objectives. Trade agreements are complex instruments designed to balance competing interests, promote specific industries, and foster international relationships. The decisions made within these policies – such as setting tariff levels, defining market access, and facilitating large-scale purchases – have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the directly impacted goods and services. For individuals involved in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these traditional economic maneuvers is important. While crypto markets are decentralized and often react to different catalysts than traditional stocks or bonds, they do not exist in a vacuum. Major shifts in Global Trade , changes in tariff structures, or significant bilateral agreements can influence the overall health and stability of national economies, impact inflation rates, affect investor confidence, and alter capital movements. These macroeconomic factors can, in turn, indirectly influence the demand for and sentiment surrounding digital assets. Paying attention to these developments provides a more holistic view of the financial ecosystem. Examining UK US Relations Through a Trade Lens This agreement also holds significant weight in the context of ongoing UK US Relations , particularly in the wake of the UK’s departure from the European Union. Forging independent trade deals is a critical aspect of the UK’s new global economic strategy. A comprehensive agreement with the United States, a major trading partner, is a key objective. While this announcement details specific aspects rather than a full free trade agreement, it signifies progress in solidifying the economic ties between the two nations outside the EU framework. The negotiation and announcement of such a deal reflect the strategic importance both countries place on their bilateral relationship. The terms agreed upon can set precedents for future trade discussions and influence the UK’s position in the global economy. For investors, observing the trajectory of UK US Relations through the lens of trade provides insight into the stability and potential growth areas within these major economies. Key Takeaways from the Announcement: A new ‘fair and reciprocal’ trade agreement announced between the U.S. and UK. U.S. maintains a 10% tariff on certain UK goods, projected to yield $6 billion in revenue. Expected creation of $5 billion in new U.S. export opportunities (farmers, producers). U.S. auto tariffs on British cars reduced from 25% to 10%. UK plans a significant $10 billion purchase of Boeing aircraft. Implications for Investors (Including Crypto Holders): Macroeconomic events like trade deals influence overall market sentiment. Changes in tariffs and trade flows can impact industries and potentially currency valuations. Monitoring traditional Economic Policy provides context for the broader financial environment. Diversification and understanding market interconnectedness remain crucial. Challenges and Future Outlook: While framed positively, the continuation of tariffs means this is not a move towards complete free trade. Future negotiations will likely address remaining barriers. The success of the deal will depend on its implementation and the actualization of the projected benefits for both nations. It represents a step in redefining post-Brexit UK US Relations economically. In conclusion, the announced US UK Trade Deal , with its specifics on Trump Tariffs , export opportunities, and strategic purchases, is a significant development in traditional international commerce. While seemingly distant from the world of digital assets, it underscores the constant shifts occurring within the global economy driven by Economic Policy and Global Trade dynamics. For any investor navigating the complex financial landscape, including those primarily focused on cryptocurrency, keeping informed about such major agreements in UK US Relations and beyond is vital for understanding the broader forces that shape market conditions and investor behavior.

44351872,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158711,1746754808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Market Reaction: Trump Signals Hope for Lower China Tariffs Amidst Crucial Trade Talks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-china-crypto-impact/,"In the ever-watchful world of cryptocurrency markets, investors are always scanning the horizon for macroeconomic signals that could sway asset prices. One such significant signal recently emerged from Washington: President Donald Trump’s indication that existing China Tariffs Impact could be reduced if ongoing trade negotiations with Beijing prove successful. This isn’t just about soybeans or semiconductors; shifts in Global Trade Tensions have a ripple effect that reaches digital assets. Understanding the Context: The US-China Trade Deal Saga For several years, the relationship between the United States and China has been defined, in part, by a tit-for-tat tariff war. The U.S. imposed significant tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods, citing unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft, and market access issues. China retaliated with its own tariffs on American products. This trade friction created considerable uncertainty for businesses globally, disrupted supply chains, and weighed on Market Sentiment . While trade talks have occurred intermittently, a comprehensive US-China Trade Deal has remained elusive. During a recent White House press conference, President Trump offered a glimpse of potential de-escalation. He stated: Tariffs currently in place could be lowered. This reduction is contingent upon a successful trade agreement being reached. He reiterated the U.S. desire for greater access for American companies and products within Chinese markets. This conditional offer injects a degree of optimism into the complex negotiations, suggesting a willingness from the U.S. side to use tariff reduction as a key incentive for China to meet U.S. demands. Why Do Global Trade Tensions Matter for Crypto? You might wonder, what do tariffs on Chinese goods have to do with Bitcoin or Ethereum? The connection lies in broader economic stability and investor behavior. Here’s how: Risk Appetite: When global trade tensions are high, it creates economic uncertainty. Investors tend to become risk-averse, moving capital away from potentially volatile assets (like stocks and sometimes crypto) towards safer havens (like gold or government bonds). Reduced tensions can increase risk appetite. Economic Growth: Trade wars can slow down global economic growth by increasing costs for businesses and consumers, reducing exports, and decreasing investment. A positive resolution could boost economic forecasts, which generally supports asset markets, including crypto. Currency Impact: Trade imbalances and tensions can affect currency values. While cryptocurrencies operate outside traditional forex, significant shifts in major fiat currencies can indirectly influence crypto trading pairs and overall market dynamics. Market Sentiment: News headlines about trade wars heavily influence overall Market Sentiment . Positive news, like the prospect of lower tariffs, can lead to a general bullish mood across financial markets, which often spills over into the crypto space. Conversely, negative news can trigger sell-offs. Therefore, monitoring developments in the US-China Trade Deal is crucial for anyone tracking the factors influencing the overall financial landscape and, by extension, the Crypto Market Reaction . Potential Upsides: What Lower China Tariffs Impact Could Bring Should the trade talks succeed and tariffs be significantly reduced or removed, several positive outcomes could materialize: Reduced Costs: American businesses importing goods from China would see lower costs, potentially leading to lower prices for consumers or increased profit margins. Boosted Exports: If China grants greater market access or reduces its retaliatory tariffs, U.S. exporters could see increased sales. Supply Chain Stability: Businesses could operate with greater certainty, making long-term planning and investment easier. Increased Investment: Reduced uncertainty could encourage both domestic and international investment. Improved Market Sentiment: A resolution would likely be met with enthusiasm by global financial markets, potentially driving asset prices higher. This positive sentiment often correlates with upward movement in the crypto market. A successful US-China Trade Deal leading to lower tariffs is generally viewed by economists and market analysts as a positive development for the global economy. Challenges and Uncertainties Facing the Trump Trade Deal Despite the glimmer of hope, significant hurdles remain in securing a comprehensive agreement: Complex Demands: The U.S. has sought structural changes in China’s economy, not just increased purchases of American goods. These demands (like intellectual property protection, state subsidies, forced technology transfer) are complex and difficult for China to agree to. Verification and Enforcement: Ensuring China adheres to any agreement is a major challenge, requiring robust verification and enforcement mechanisms. Political Considerations: Domestic politics in both countries can influence the negotiation process and willingness to compromise. Past Failures: Previous rounds of talks have broken down, highlighting the deep divisions and mistrust that exist. The path to a final US-China Trade Deal is fraught with potential pitfalls, and the outcome is far from guaranteed. This lingering uncertainty contributes to ongoing Global Trade Tensions and can keep markets volatile. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Market Impact For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, staying informed about these macroeconomic developments is key. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Headlines: Pay attention to news regarding U.S.-China trade talks, tariff statements, and economic data releases from both countries. Assess Market Sentiment: Observe how traditional markets (stocks, bonds, commodities) react to trade news, as this often provides clues about overall investor confidence that can influence the Crypto Market Reaction . Understand Correlation vs. Causation: While crypto often reacts to macro news, its price is also driven by unique factors (adoption, technological developments, regulatory news). Don’t assume a direct, one-to-one correlation with every trade headline. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Macro uncertainty underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term market fluctuations driven by news cycles can be significant, but a long-term investment strategy focused on fundamentals often helps weather volatility. The potential for reduced China Tariffs Impact is a positive sign, but the journey to a final agreement is likely to involve more twists and turns, continuing to influence Global Trade Tensions and broader Market Sentiment . Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope Amidst Lingering Global Trade Tensions President Trump’s recent comments suggesting a willingness to lower China tariffs upon the successful conclusion of trade talks offer a significant, albeit conditional, ray of hope. This development is closely watched by global markets, including the cryptocurrency space, where the Crypto Market Reaction is often tied to shifts in overall Market Sentiment and the resolution of major macroeconomic uncertainties like the US-China Trade Deal . While the prospect of reduced China Tariffs Impact is generally seen as bullish for the global economy and risk assets, the complexities of reaching a comprehensive agreement mean that Global Trade Tensions are unlikely to disappear overnight. Investors should remain vigilant, keeping an eye on negotiation progress and understanding how these macro forces can shape the investment landscape.

One such notable instance occurred during the presidency of Donald Trump, whose candid remarks often sent ripples through financial markets and political circles alike. A particularly memorable quote captured the essence of his frustration with the nation’s top monetary authority: the Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Jerome Powell. During a press conference at the White House, Donald Trump expressed his profound dissatisfaction with the pace and direction of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. His words painted a vivid picture of a communication breakdown, stating bluntly that talking to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was akin to “talking to a wall.” This strong metaphor highlighted the perceived lack of responsiveness from the central bank to the President’s calls for lower Interest Rates . Understanding the Role of the Federal Reserve and Presidential Expectations To fully grasp the tension described by Donald Trump, it’s crucial to understand the fundamental roles of the Federal Reserve and the President. The Federal Reserve, often called the Fed, is the central banking system of the United States. Its primary mandates are to maximize employment, stabilize prices (control inflation), and moderate long-term interest rates. It operates with a degree of independence from the executive and legislative branches of government, a structure designed to insulate monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures. Presidents, on the other hand, are typically focused on economic growth, job creation, and maintaining a strong economy during their term. Lower interest rates can stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, potentially leading to increased investment, spending, and hiring. Conversely, higher interest rates can cool down an overheating economy, helping to prevent inflation but potentially slowing growth. During his presidency, Donald Trump consistently advocated for lower interest rates. He argued that the Fed’s policies were too restrictive and hindered economic expansion, especially in the context of his administration’s trade policies and global economic headwinds. He often compared the U.S. economic situation favorably to other nations, questioning why the Fed wasn’t cutting rates more aggressively when other major Central Banks were doing so. Why Did Trump Feel Talking to Jerome Powell Was “Like a Wall”? The feeling of talking to a wall suggests a lack of influence or impact on the other party’s decisions. For President Trump, this sentiment likely stemmed from the Fed’s adherence to its data-dependent approach and its commitment to making policy decisions based on its economic analysis, rather than presidential requests. The Fed, under Jerome Powell, maintained that its decisions were guided by its dual mandate – maximum employment and price stability – and assessments of the economic outlook, not political considerations. Key points contributing to this perception of a “wall” included: Fed Independence: The institutional independence of the Federal Reserve is a cornerstone of its credibility. Chairman Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) make decisions based on economic data and their mandate, not on directives from the White House. This independence, while crucial for long-term economic stability, can sometimes put the Fed at odds with a President seeking specific economic outcomes within their term. Differing Economic Outlooks: While President Trump saw room for aggressive rate cuts to boost growth further, the Fed’s perspective might have been more cautious, perhaps seeing underlying inflation risks or assessing the economy as already operating near full employment. Communication Style: The Fed typically communicates its policy decisions and rationale through official statements, meeting minutes, and congressional testimony. This structured, often cautious, communication style can feel unresponsive compared to the more direct and immediate communication style favored by President Trump. Pace of Action: Monetary policy decisions are often made deliberately, after careful consideration of various economic indicators. President Trump’s desire for quick and significant rate cuts may have clashed with the Fed’s more measured approach to adjusting interest rates. The Global Context: Comparing Central Banks and Interest Rates President Trump’s frustration was amplified by observing the actions of other major central banks around the world. He specifically mentioned the European Central Bank (ECB) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) as examples of central banks that were actively lowering their benchmark interest rates. This comparison was central to his argument that the Fed was out of step with global monetary policy trends. Let’s briefly look at the situation of other major central banks during the period when Trump made these comments: European Central Bank (ECB): The Eurozone economy faced slower growth, low inflation (at times even deflationary fears), and external risks like trade tensions. The ECB had already implemented negative interest rates on bank deposits and was considering or implementing further stimulus measures, including rate cuts and asset purchases, to support the economy and push inflation towards its target. People’s Bank of China (PBOC): China’s economy was also experiencing some slowdown, partly due to structural factors and partly impacted by the trade dispute with the U.S. The PBOC utilized various tools, including adjusting its benchmark rates and reserve requirement ratios for banks, to inject liquidity and support lending, aiming to stabilize growth. Other Central Banks: Many other central banks globally were also easing monetary policy or signaling a readiness to do so, reacting to a synchronized slowdown in global growth, trade uncertainty, and subdued inflation pressures in many regions. President Trump viewed these actions as competitive advantages for other economies. Lower interest rates can potentially weaken a country’s currency, making its exports cheaper and more competitive on the global market. He felt the Fed’s relatively higher rates were strengthening the U.S. dollar, making American goods more expensive abroad and potentially undermining his trade objectives. Implications of the Fed’s Stance vs. Global Trends for the Economy and Markets The divergence in monetary policy between the Federal Reserve and other major central banks had several potential implications: Currency Strength: As mentioned, higher relative interest rates typically attract foreign investment seeking better returns, increasing demand for the currency and potentially strengthening it. A strong dollar can be a double-edged sword – it makes imports cheaper for U.S. consumers and businesses but makes U.S. exports more expensive for buyers abroad. Capital Flows: Differences in interest rates and economic prospects influence where international capital flows. If the U.S. offers relatively higher returns (through interest rates or economic growth), capital tends to flow into the U.S., affecting asset prices and exchange rates. Global Coordination: Divergent policies can complicate international economic coordination. While central banks prioritize their domestic mandates, their actions have spillover effects globally. Market Volatility: Uncertainty about monetary policy direction, especially when it clashes with political desires, can increase volatility in financial markets as investors try to anticipate future actions. President Trump’s public criticism of the Fed was unusual and broke with the norm of respecting the central bank’s independence. While presidents often privately express their views on the economy, direct public pressure on the Fed regarding specific rate decisions is generally avoided to protect the institution’s non-political standing. Connecting the Dots: Monetary Policy, Economic Uncertainty, and the Rise of Alternatives (Including Crypto) The environment of global economic uncertainty, trade tensions, and diverging central bank policies provides a fascinating backdrop for understanding the broader financial landscape. While the direct link between a President’s comments on the Fed and cryptocurrency might not be immediately obvious, the underlying themes resonate within the crypto space. Consider these points: Loss of Faith in Traditional Systems: Public disagreements between political leaders and central bankers, coupled with unconventional monetary policies (like negative interest rates and massive asset purchases), can erode public confidence in traditional financial institutions and fiat currencies. Search for Alternatives: When traditional assets and currencies face uncertainty or potential devaluation due to aggressive monetary easing, investors and individuals may seek alternative stores of value or mediums of exchange. “Hedge” Narrative: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as a potential hedge against inflation and economic instability caused by central bank actions. The finite supply of Bitcoin, for instance, is contrasted with the ability of central banks to increase the supply of fiat currency. Global Liquidity: While the Fed might have been slower to cut rates than others at a specific point, the overall trend among global central banks towards lower rates and increased liquidity contributes to a search for yield and investment opportunities, some of which flow into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Therefore, while President Trump’s comments were about traditional monetary policy, the frustration he voiced and the global economic context he described are part of the larger narrative that sometimes drives interest in decentralized alternatives like cryptocurrencies. The perceived inflexibility of traditional institutions (the “wall”) and the differing approaches of major Central Banks highlight the complexities and potential fragilities within the global financial system. Challenges and Insights from the Trump-Powell Dynamic The public dynamic between Donald Trump and Jerome Powell brought several challenges and offered insights: Challenge: Undermining Independence: Persistent public criticism from the President risks undermining the perceived independence and credibility of the Federal Reserve, which could make its job of managing the economy harder in the long run. Challenge: Market Confusion: Conflicting signals from political leaders and the central bank can create confusion and uncertainty in financial markets. Insight: Transparency (of Disagreement): While contentious, the public disagreement provided unusual transparency into the differing perspectives on economic policy between the White House and the Fed. Insight: Importance of Communication: It underscored the critical importance of clear and consistent communication from the Federal Reserve to manage expectations and maintain confidence. Insight: Global Interconnectedness: The comparison with other Central Banks highlighted how interconnected the global economy and monetary policies are. Conclusion: The Enduring Tension Between Politics and Monetary Policy Donald Trump’s memorable description of talking to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as being “like talking to a wall” encapsulated a period of significant tension between the White House and the U.S. central bank. It stemmed from differing views on the appropriate level of Interest Rates and the pace of monetary policy adjustments, set against a backdrop of global economic shifts and the actions of other major Central Banks like the ECB and PBOC. This episode served as a stark reminder of the delicate balance required to maintain the independence of the Federal Reserve while acknowledging the President’s legitimate interest in the nation’s economic health. While the direct impact on cryptocurrencies is indirect, the underlying themes of trust in institutions, the search for stable value in uncertain times, and the consequences of global monetary policy divergences continue to be relevant factors observed by participants in the crypto market. Ultimately, the dynamic between Donald Trump and Jerome Powell highlighted the inherent friction that can arise when political goals meet the data-driven, mandate-focused approach of an independent central bank, a tension that remains a key feature of economic governance worldwide.

This came a day after he told lawmakers he wanted $1 billion more than the administration had requested. According to Patel’s argument , they would accept this budget as is and modify it to meet the operational requirements of the FBI. Patel added that he was asking for more funding because, as FBI director, he could do more with it. Lawmakers press FBI for clarity as budget cuts threaten national security and staffing levels A day earlier, speaking to the House Appropriations Subcommittee, Patel had already alerted that proposed cuts would impede the FBI’s ability to tackle violent crime and terrorism, equating the reduced funding like it would be returning to the 2011 level. He emphasized that an $11.1 billion budget was what it would take to keep the current operations without eliminating positions. The White House asked Congress for a cut of $163 billion in overall federal spending, with departments and programs trimmed across the board as part of its budget proposal. The FBI’s proposed reductions have prompted bipartisan concern among lawmakers who worry that budget cuts could hinder the country’s national security and law enforcement capabilities. Patel’s reversal drew backlash from some senators, partly over the FBI’s non-inclusion of a budget plan. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said that not coming up with a complete budget request was “not only inadequate and deeply disturbing” but also indicated that the bureau failed to give the kind of transparency needed “to show the full picture of the direction the Bureau is headed.” “The Bureau owes the public a clear answer on how they plan to make do with less, and a comprehensive proposal should be the minimum,” she said. Furthermore, the size of the proposed cut, according to Republican U.S. Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, “may force the FBI to eliminate vacant positions and leave positions unfilled.” Though it mentions diversity policies, “pet projects” of the former Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration, and what it refers to as redundant intelligence operations, the budget proposal, which was made public last week, gave little information about what would be cut at the FBI. Patel urged lawmakers to ignore Trump’s proposed FBI budget cuts Earlier, Patel requested lawmakers to disregard Trump’s suggested budget cuts for the FBI. This all began when Patel urged appropriators to reject a proposed cut of more than $500 million in favor of an increased budget, stating that the Trump administration’s budget request would not be enough to fund the agency . Additionally, he declared the “skinny budget” was a proposal and asserted that he was working through the appropriations process to justify why they required more than what had been proposed. Patel’s resistance to the proposed cuts first left some scratching their heads. His comments surprised some lawmakers, including Representative Rosa DeLauro, who said she was surprised by his position. She challenged Patel in the hearing to reveal which jobs would be lost in the pared-back budget. DeLauro asked whether a $500 million or more cut — more than 5% under the current FBI operating budget — would affect enforcement and/or national security-related functions. She prodded the FBI to define what specific positions could be lost, noting, “The agency should know what positions it’s willing to fund or cut,” given that the bureau put together the budget proposal.

The move comes amid a broader crypto market rally that coincided with bitcoin BTC soaring past $100,000 for the first time in three months. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, its most substantial overhaul since the 2022 Merge, represents a sweeping protocol hard fork, as CoinDesk previously reported . The upgrade consolidates validator operations by raising the staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ETH (via EIP-7251), advances wallet usability through account abstraction mechanisms allowing temporary smart contract functionality (via EIP-7702), and implements nine other Ethereum Improvement Proposals. ""ETH is finally catching up after lagging behind BBTC for most of the year. While BTC is nearing its all-time high, ETH is still down nearly 50% from its 2024 peak,"" Ming Jung from Presto Research wrote to CoinDesk in a note. The Pectra upgrade, Jung said, ""helped restore some confidence, and with ETHBTC down nearly 40% year-to-date at 0.02, it's not surprising to see buyers stepping in at these levels."" In a recent research report, CryptoQuant wrote that weak network activity on the Ethereum blockchain, which hasn't grown since 2021, suggests that a recovery to prior highs isn't imminent despite the rally. In a market update, Flowdesk wrote that they see the crypto market broadly regaining momentum, with bitcoin passing $100K and a return to risk appetite, with investors shifting from caution to chasing higher-yield altcoins and structured products. ""We're seeing a recycling of sell flow into higher-momentum plays, a shift from the caution that’s defined the last two months. While still below Q4 2024 levels, beta appetite is clearly building,"" Flowdesk wrote. March Zheng, General Partner of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk in a message that traders should remember that Ethereum has typically been the main on-chain altcoin indicator for risk-on, and its sizable upticks generally lead to broader altcoin rallies. Elsewhere in crypto, bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $102.5K as ETF inflow continues to be positive. In a recent note, Standard Chartered said that its second quarter target of $120,000 might be ""too conservative. Other market observers consider current upside targets to be ""too low.""

Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have officially settled their long-running legal battle. Following this announcement, XRP’s price surged by 8%, reaching $2.31. What Happened? After years of courtroom drama, both Ripple and the SEC filed a joint motion in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, confirming that they’ve reached a settlement. As part of the agreement: Ripple will pay $50 million to the SEC. Another $125 million, currently held in escrow, will be released — with a portion going to Ripple. Crypto experts and XRP supporters believe this is a game-changing moment for the entire financial system. Now that the legal battle is behind it, XRP can more easily be adopted by banks, financial institutions, and investors without the cloud of uncertainty hanging over it. Legal experts like James K. Filan, a former federal prosecutor, called this moment “huge,” while XRP community leaders celebrated the victory, reminding everyone about the ups and downs of the crypto journey. Will XRP Price Hit $3? XRP saw a strong and unexpected breakout, pushing above the key levels. The breakout above $2.17 is important because it shows that buyers are stepping in again. If this level continues to hold, XRP is likely back in its previous trading range — and from here, the next price target could be breaking $2.30 with confirmation. If momentum continues and Bitcoin also remains strong, XRP could even push beyond that toward $2.40 and higher in the coming days or weeks. Experts also predict that XRP could soon climb above the $3 level.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 01:54:12
44352567,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158717,1746756001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump Tariffs: Urgent Warning on Future US Trade Policy and Economic Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariffs-trade-policy/,"A significant statement from former U.S. President Donald Trump is sending ripples through discussions about future US trade policy . According to reports from Solid Intel on X, Trump indicated that a previously mentioned 10% tariff baseline is not a fixed template for future trade agreements. Instead, he suggested that future rates could, and likely would, be higher. This declaration signals a potentially more aggressive stance on trade should he return to office, with profound implications not just for international commerce but also for global financial markets, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency market reaction . Understanding the Potential Scale of Trump Tariffs What exactly does a potential move towards higher Trump tariffs mean? Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. They can be used as a tool to protect domestic industries, generate government revenue, or exert pressure in international negotiations. During his previous term, Trump implemented tariffs on various goods, notably from China, leading to trade disputes that impacted supply chains and market stability. The mention of the 10% figure previously was seen by some as a potential starting point for negotiations or a general floor. The latest comments suggest that this floor might be removed, allowing for potentially much higher rates on specific imports or across broader categories of goods. This uncertainty regarding the scale and targets of future tariffs creates a complex environment for businesses, consumers, and investors worldwide. The Economic Impact of Tariffs: More Than Just Import Costs The direct economic impact of tariffs is felt by importers, who pay the tax. However, these costs are often passed down the line, affecting consumers through higher prices on imported goods. This can contribute to inflation. Beyond direct costs, tariffs can trigger a cascade of effects: Increased Costs for Businesses: Companies relying on imported raw materials or components face higher operational costs, potentially reducing profitability or forcing price increases. Reduced Consumer Spending: Higher prices for goods can reduce consumer purchasing power, dampening overall demand. Retaliation from Trading Partners: Other countries often respond to tariffs by imposing their own tariffs on exports from the tariff-imposing nation. This can harm domestic industries that rely on exports. Supply Chain Disruption: Businesses may need to find new suppliers, which can be costly and time-consuming, leading to inefficiencies and potential shortages. Reduced Global Trade: A cycle of escalating tariffs can slow down international trade, impacting global economic growth. These potential outcomes paint a picture of increased economic friction and uncertainty on a global scale. Markets dislike uncertainty, and significant shifts in US trade policy can lead to volatility across various asset classes. How Might the Cryptocurrency Market React to Trade Tensions? While tariffs and trade policy might seem distant from digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, macroeconomic shifts have a significant influence on investor sentiment and capital flows into the cryptocurrency market reaction . Here’s how potential trade escalations could play out: 1. Safe-Haven Narrative for Bitcoin: In times of increased global economic uncertainty and potential currency devaluation (due to trade wars or inflation), assets perceived as ‘digital gold’ or hedges against traditional financial instability can see increased interest. Bitcoin and tariffs could become linked if investors view BTC as a non-sovereign store of value less susceptible to the direct impacts of national trade disputes or currency manipulation. 2. Increased Volatility: Macroeconomic news, especially related to major economies and trade, often correlates with volatility in both traditional and crypto markets. Heightened trade tensions could contribute to sharper price swings in the crypto space as investors react to the changing global landscape. 3. Impact on Risk Appetite: If trade wars lead to a broader economic downturn or significant stock market corrections, this could decrease overall risk appetite. Crypto, still largely considered a risk asset, might see outflows as investors move towards safer havens (though some might argue Bitcoin *is* the safer haven in this specific scenario). 4. Capital Flows and Liquidity: Changes in global trade patterns and economic health can affect international capital flows. While the direct link to crypto is complex, major shifts in liquidity or investor focus due to trade policy could indirectly impact the crypto market. 5. Government Focus and Regulation: A potential shift in administration and economic policy could also bring changes in regulatory focus towards digital assets. While not a direct consequence of tariffs, it’s part of the broader political and economic platform that could impact the crypto space. Bitcoin and Tariffs: Is There a Historical Link? Examining past periods of significant tariff action, such as during 2018-2019, can offer some clues, though the crypto market was less mature then. During those trade tensions, Bitcoin did experience significant price movements, but disentangling the impact of tariffs from other factors (like market cycles, regulatory news, and technological developments within crypto) is challenging. However, the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against economic instability and traditional financial system risks gained traction during those periods of uncertainty. The core argument linking Bitcoin and tariffs rests on the idea that policies disrupting traditional trade and potentially leading to inflation or currency instability make decentralized, hard-capped assets like Bitcoin more attractive as alternative stores of value. Challenges and Opportunities for Crypto Amidst Trade Policy Shifts The potential for increased tariffs presents both challenges and opportunities for the cryptocurrency market : Challenges: Broader market downturns could drag crypto prices down regardless of its potential as a hedge. Increased economic hardship globally could reduce discretionary income available for crypto investment. Regulatory uncertainty could increase under a new administration, potentially overshadowing macro factors. Opportunities: Enhanced narrative for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic instability caused by trade wars. Potential for increased adoption in regions heavily impacted by currency fluctuations or trade restrictions. Growing awareness of decentralized assets as alternatives to traditional financial systems tied to national policies. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Given the potential for shifts in US trade policy and their subsequent economic impact of tariffs , what should crypto investors consider? 1. Stay Informed on Macro News: Pay attention not just to crypto-specific news but also to global economic indicators, trade policy developments, and political statements regarding tariffs. These factors are increasingly influencing market sentiment. 2. Evaluate Your Portfolio’s Sensitivity: Consider how different assets in your portfolio might react to increased economic uncertainty. Bitcoin might perform differently than smaller altcoins heavily tied to specific tech narratives. 3. Understand the Narrative: Be aware of the ‘digital gold’ or ‘inflation hedge’ narratives surrounding Bitcoin and other assets. While not guaranteed outcomes, these narratives gain strength during periods of economic instability. 4. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is possible due to news events like tariff announcements, maintaining a long-term perspective based on the underlying technology and adoption trends of promising crypto projects is crucial. 5. Diversification: As always, diversification remains a key strategy. This includes diversifying within the crypto space and considering how crypto fits into your overall investment portfolio alongside traditional assets. The Broader Picture: US Trade Policy and Global Economic Stability Trump’s comments underscore a potential future direction where trade policy remains a central and potentially aggressive tool. This approach can lead to unpredictable outcomes for global markets. The interconnectedness of the modern economy means that shifts in US trade policy do not happen in a vacuum. They affect currency exchange rates, commodity prices, international relations, and ultimately, investor confidence. The discussion around Trump tariffs is therefore not just about trade figures; it’s about the potential for a fundamental shift in how the world’s largest economy interacts with others, creating ripples that touch everything from manufacturing jobs in the Midwest to the price of imported electronics, and yes, even the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating Uncertainty The statement from Donald Trump about the 10% tariff baseline not being a future template is a clear signal of potential intent. Higher tariffs could significantly alter the landscape of international trade, bringing about notable economic impacts globally. For the cryptocurrency market reaction , this introduces another layer of macro-driven uncertainty, but also potentially reinforces narratives around decentralized assets as hedges against traditional economic and political risks. As these policy discussions evolve, monitoring their potential effects on market dynamics, including the specific interplay between Bitcoin and tariffs , will be essential for anyone involved in the digital asset space. The coming months could see these macro factors play an increasingly important role in shaping the crypto narrative and market movements.

While some tokens are navigating choppy waters, others are moving steadily toward potential breakout moments. The top cryptos to buy now are less about hype and more about adoption, use cases, and long-term direction. This piece covers four standout coins in the spotlight this year: Cardano, seeing growing whale interest and signs of a breakout, Ripple’s XRP, riding the wave of ETF speculation and possible futures trading, Solana, inching toward a key technical level, and BlockDAG, the presale contender gaining serious momentum with strong fundamentals and huge upside. If you’re building a portfolio with the future in mind, these are the picks worth looking at. Here’s why they rank as the top cryptos to buy now. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Hidden Presale Gem with Big Potential BlockDAG is quickly establishing itself as one of the top cryptos to buy now, and time is running short. At a special price of $0.0019 in Batch 28 of its presale, BDAG is offering a huge potential return, with a listing price locked at $0.05. That’s a 2,531% upside for early participants who join before the May 13 deadline. Already, over $229 million has been raised, and more than 19.8 billion coins have been sold, showing strong early demand. What sets BlockDAG apart isn’t just the presale value. It’s a fully EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain made for fast, low-cost, and scalable smart contracts. The focus on developer ease and user performance is backed by partnerships with HackerEarth and SpaceDev, two respected names in tech. Meanwhile, the X1 Miner app has been downloaded over a million times, helping grow a user base even before the coin hits public markets. Analysts are already talking about a potential $1 target, and news of upcoming exchange listings is starting to circulate. If you’re looking for an early, high-upside utility coin, BlockDAG is among the top cryptos to buy now that deserves close attention. 2. Cardano (ADA): Strong Recovery Points to Breakout Setup Cardano has been quietly gaining strength. It’s trading near $0.69 after rebounding from April lows and holding key support levels. Technical patterns suggest a breakout could happen if ADA crosses the $0.74 resistance zone. Adding to the bullish view, whales have accumulated more than 420 million ADA in April alone. This level of buying points to confidence in the project’s long-term potential and growing utility. If current momentum continues, analysts see a path toward $1.30. Cardano’s steady progress and expanding ecosystem keep it in the conversation for leading smart contract platforms. With institutional support and a loyal community, ADA remains a consistent name among the top cryptos to buy now for anyone prioritizing stability and long-term growth. 3. Ripple (XRP): Market Buzz Builds as ETF Speculation Grows Ripple’s XRP is back in the headlines. It’s currently trading around $2.22 and has risen 7% recently as anticipation builds around a potential spot ETF. The upcoming launch of XRP futures on the CME this May is also adding fuel to the fire. Analysts expect XRP to test $3.40 by mid-2025, with projections reaching as high as $5 if ETF approval comes through. A rejection, however, could pull the price back to support near $1.61. Still, XRP’s role in cross-border payments and global finance gives it staying power. For those eyeing regulated, use-case-driven crypto assets, XRP continues to be one of the top cryptos to buy now, offering real-world adoption and institutional upside. 4. Solana (SOL): Closer to Breaking a Key Resistance Level Solana is once again attracting investor interest, now trading at about $150.07 after bouncing back from April’s low of $115. It’s approaching a crucial resistance band between $153 and $155, and breaking through this range could kick off the next rally. With long-term estimates placing SOL around $191.85 by 2030, the coin offers meaningful upside. Solana’s reputation for speed, low fees, and a strong developer community continues to drive its adoption and support. As it gains both technical and market momentum, Solana remains one of the top cryptos to buy now, especially for investors who want exposure to a high-performance, scalable blockchain project. Watch These Projects Closely as the Market Evolves As crypto transitions into its next growth phase, winners will be those with strong fundamentals, not flashy headlines. Cardano is showing reliable chart setups. XRP is riding a wave of institutional interest and solid use cases. Solana continues to impress with network speed and developer activity. But BlockDAG may be the most undervalued of the group. Priced at $0.0019, supported by real tech and strategic partnerships, and backed by $229 million in raised funds, it’s gaining attention fast. With EVM compatibility and a growing user base already in place, it’s more than just a presale, it’s a breakout waiting to happen. For anyone planning their next move, BDAG stands out as the top crypto to buy now . Smart investors are already positioning themselves!

44352969,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158720,1746756657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump China Tariffs: Crucial Shift Offers Hope for Economic Stability and Crypto Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-china-tariffs-impact/,"In a development that has captured the attention of global markets, including the ever-watchful cryptocurrency community, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly made a significant statement regarding China trade relations. According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, President Trump indicated that Trump China tariffs, currently mentioned with a cap at a striking 145 percent, are anticipated to decrease. While seemingly rooted in traditional economics and international trade, such pronouncements carry weight that often extends into the volatile world of digital assets. But how exactly does a comment on trade tariffs between two global superpowers potentially influence your crypto portfolio? Understanding the connection requires looking beyond the surface-level news and delving into the intricate ways global economic policies, geopolitical tensions, and market sentiment intertwine. The US China trade war has been a defining feature of recent economic history, demonstrating how trade friction can create waves felt across various asset classes. This latest statement, hinting at a potential de-escalation or shift in strategy regarding Trump China tariffs, could signal a change in the global economic climate, which in turn, can have an economic impact crypto investors need to consider. Decoding the Statement: 145% Cap and Expected Decrease The specific mention of a 145 percent cap on China tariffs is noteworthy. While the context of this particular figure isn’t fully detailed in the initial report (it could pertain to specific goods, a maximum potential rate, or be related to a particular negotiation point), the key takeaway highlighted is the expectation that these tariffs are “likely to decrease.” This suggests a potential softening of the aggressive tariff stance that characterized much of the previous administration’s trade policy with Beijing. Walter Bloomberg on X is a widely followed source for rapid-fire financial news updates, often aggregating reports from various outlets. The fact that this statement is being reported indicates it holds significance within financial circles. For investors, including those in the crypto space, such news is analyzed for its potential to influence market sentiment and economic forecasts. A decrease in Trump China tariffs, should it materialize, could be interpreted in several ways: Economic Boost: Lower tariffs can reduce costs for importers and consumers, potentially stimulating economic activity. Reduced Uncertainty: Easing trade tensions can lower geopolitical risk, which is often a factor driving market volatility. Shift in Strategy: It might indicate a different approach to China trade relations in the future. However, it’s also important to consider the context. Is this statement part of a political campaign? Is it a conditional statement? The nuances matter, and markets will watch closely for further details and confirmation. The US China Trade War: A Recent History To appreciate the potential significance of a shift in tariff policy, it’s essential to recall the origins and impact of the US China trade war. Initiated largely in 2018, it involved the imposition of escalating tariffs by both the United States and China on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods. The stated goals from the U.S. side included reducing the trade deficit, protecting American intellectual property, and encouraging China to make structural reforms to its economic practices. Key phases of the trade war included: Initial Tariffs (2018): The U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, followed by tariffs on specific Chinese goods. China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products. Escalation (2019): Tariffs were increased and expanded to cover more categories of goods, leading to significant disruption for businesses and supply chains. Phase One Deal (2020): A partial agreement was reached, where China agreed to purchase more U.S. goods and services, and the U.S. agreed to roll back some tariffs, though many remained in place. The US China trade war had tangible effects: Increased costs for businesses and consumers. Disruption of global supply chains as companies sought to move production outside of China. Reduced trade volumes between the two countries. Increased market volatility as investors reacted to escalating tensions and unpredictable policy changes. This historical context underscores why any potential change in Trump China tariffs is seen as a significant economic signal. Economic Impact Crypto: How Tariffs Ripple Through Markets The connection between traditional trade policies like tariffs and the cryptocurrency market might not be immediately obvious to everyone. However, global economics are interconnected. Tariffs, especially between major economic powers like the U.S. and China, don’t just affect the price of imported goods; they have broader macroeconomic consequences that can influence investor behavior across all asset classes, including digital ones. Here’s how the economic impact crypto relationship plays out: Market Sentiment and Risk Appetite: Trade tensions increase global economic uncertainty. When investors are uncertain, they often reduce their exposure to riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and altcoins, are often perceived as risk assets, similar to growth stocks. Easing trade tensions, like a decrease in Trump China tariffs, could potentially improve market sentiment and increase risk appetite, leading to inflows into crypto. Conversely, escalating tensions can lead to sell-offs. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imports. These costs are often passed on to consumers, contributing to inflation. Central banks may respond to inflation by tightening monetary policy (raising interest rates), which can make risk assets like crypto less attractive compared to interest-bearing investments. A decrease in tariffs could potentially ease some inflationary pressures, influencing monetary policy expectations and indirectly affecting crypto. Supply Chain Disruptions: The US China trade war forced companies to rethink their supply chains, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs. Stable trade relations, potentially signaled by lower tariffs, could lead to more efficient global supply chains, supporting economic growth. Economic growth and increased liquidity in the system can be positive for asset markets, including crypto. Currency Strength: Trade policies can influence currency valuations. For instance, a trade deficit might weaken a currency. While crypto is decentralized, its price is often quoted against fiat currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar. Shifts in major currency strengths due to trade policies can indirectly affect crypto trading dynamics and perceived value. Therefore, while not a direct causal link in the same way that supply and demand within the crypto market function, macroeconomic shifts driven by policies like tariffs create the broader financial environment in which crypto operates. An improved outlook on China trade relations could contribute to a more stable or optimistic global economic picture, which is generally favorable for risk assets. How Tariffs Impact Crypto Volatility: Looking at Past Trends Examining historical periods of heightened US China trade war tensions reveals how these events have coincided with periods of increased volatility in the crypto market. While correlation doesn’t equal causation, the timing suggests that global economic uncertainty is a significant factor for crypto investors. During peaks of tariff escalation in 2018 and 2019, traditional markets experienced downturns, and the crypto market often followed suit or saw increased price swings. Bitcoin, sometimes touted as a potential hedge against traditional financial instability, didn’t consistently act as a safe haven during these specific trade war episodes; its price movements were often correlated with broader market risk sentiment. Consider these potential scenarios related to how tariffs impact crypto: Scenario Potential Impact on Global Economy Potential Impact on Crypto Market Tariffs Decrease (as suggested by Trump) Reduced costs, potentially lower inflation, improved business confidence, supply chain stability. Increased risk appetite, potential positive sentiment spillover, possible upward price pressure as global liquidity improves. Tariffs Remain High or Increase Continued high costs, potential inflation, ongoing supply chain disruption, reduced business confidence. Decreased risk appetite, potential negative sentiment spillover, possible downward price pressure or increased volatility as investors seek perceived safety. Uncertainty/Mixed Signals Market indecision, difficulty in long-term planning for businesses. Heightened volatility, choppy price action as crypto reacts to conflicting news and sentiment shifts. The statement about Trump China tariffs being likely to decrease falls into the first scenario, suggesting a potentially positive backdrop for risk assets like crypto, assuming this direction is confirmed and implemented. China Trade Relations Beyond Tariffs: The Broader Context Discussions around China trade relations extend beyond just tariffs. The economic rivalry between the U.S. and China involves technology competition, investment flows, and increasingly, digital currencies. China’s progress on its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan (e-CNY), is sometimes viewed within the context of challenging the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global trade and finance. While the digital yuan is primarily intended for domestic use initially, its potential role in facilitating international trade outside the traditional SWIFT system (which is largely dollar-denominated and influenced by U.S. policy) is a topic of ongoing discussion. Any significant shift in China trade relations could, in the long term, influence the pace and manner in which digital currencies are integrated into global commerce. This adds another layer of complexity to the economic impact crypto equation, as it touches upon the future of money and cross-border transactions. A de-escalation of tariff disputes could potentially create a more stable environment for discussing and potentially integrating digital currency frameworks into international trade, though this is a long-term prospect. Challenges and Opportunities for Crypto Investors Navigating the crypto market based on macroeconomic news like trade tariff statements presents both challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Correlation vs. Causation: It’s difficult to isolate the exact impact of a single piece of news on the complex crypto market, which is influenced by numerous factors (adoption, regulation, technological developments, internal market dynamics). Uncertainty and Follow-Through: A statement about potential policy change is not the same as enacted policy. The path from announcement to implementation can be long and subject to political shifts. Speed of Information: News travels fast, especially on platforms like X. Reacting impulsively to every piece of information can be detrimental. Opportunities: Informed Decision Making: Understanding how global economic trends *can* influence crypto allows investors to make more informed decisions rather than trading purely on speculation or hype. Identifying Potential Trend Shifts: Major shifts in international trade policy can signal broader changes in the global economic outlook, potentially indicating periods where risk assets might become more or less favorable. Diversification Strategy: Recognizing the external factors influencing crypto reinforces the importance of a well-thought-out diversification strategy. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Given the potential for tariffs impact crypto, what should crypto holders and prospective investors consider? Stay Informed, But Skeptical: Follow reliable news sources reporting on global trade and economic policy, but be critical. Understand the source (like Walter Bloomberg on X) and look for confirmation from official channels or multiple reports. Monitor Market Sentiment: Observe how traditional markets (stock indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones) react to trade news. Crypto often shows correlation with these indices, especially during significant shifts in sentiment. Understand Crypto’s Role: Reflect on your personal investment thesis for crypto. Are you treating it purely as a speculative asset, a long-term technology investment, or a potential hedge? Your view will shape how you react to macroeconomic news. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term volatility can be influenced by external news, the long-term value of many crypto projects depends on their underlying technology, adoption rates, and development progress. Don’t let short-term news distract entirely from fundamental analysis. Prepare for Volatility: Recognize that the crypto market is inherently volatile. News like potential shifts in Trump China tariffs can add another layer of potential price swings. Ensure your risk management strategy is robust. Summary: A Glimpse of Potential Change The report indicating former President Trump’s view that Trump China tariffs, capped at 145%, are likely to decrease is more than just traditional trade news. It’s a signal that could potentially influence the global economic environment. The history of the US China trade war shows how trade policies can create significant uncertainty and impact markets worldwide. While the direct link might not be obvious, the economic impact crypto experiences is real, largely through shifts in market sentiment, inflation expectations, and overall risk appetite. A potential easing of tensions in China trade relations, as hinted by the statement on tariffs, could contribute to a more positive global economic outlook, which is generally supportive of risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, investors should remain cautious, verify information, and understand that crypto’s path is influenced by a multitude of factors.

The SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) is reportedly looking into a potential exemption order that could significantly impact how securities are issued, traded, and settled using Distributed Ledger Technology ( DLT ). This move, highlighted by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and reported by Wu Blockchain, signals a growing recognition within regulatory bodies of the potential benefits and unique characteristics of Digital Assets and Tokenized Securities . What Exactly is the SEC Considering? According to the report citing Commissioner Hester Peirce, the SEC is exploring the possibility of creating an exemption. This order would specifically allow companies to leverage DLT for key functions related to securities, including: Issuance: Creating and distributing securities directly onto a distributed ledger. Trading: Facilitating transactions of these securities on innovative trading systems built on DLT. Settlement: Finalizing the transfer of ownership and value on the ledger, potentially speeding up the traditional multi-day process. Furthermore, the exemption would aim to permit the operation of novel trading systems designed specifically for eligible Tokenized Securities . This suggests the SEC is grappling with how existing securities laws apply to assets represented digitally on a blockchain and is seeking pathways to accommodate this technological shift. Why is the SEC Looking at a DLT Exemption Now? The financial landscape is evolving rapidly with the advent of blockchain and Digital Assets . Traditional systems for issuing and trading securities, while robust, can be slow, costly, and complex. DLT offers the promise of greater efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. Regulatory bodies like the SEC are under pressure to understand and respond to these innovations. A tailored exemption could provide a legal framework for companies to experiment and build in this space while still maintaining necessary investor protections. Commissioner Peirce, often referred to as ‘Crypto Mom’ for her relatively pro-innovation stance compared to some of her peers, has long advocated for regulatory clarity and safe harbors for blockchain projects. Her comments suggest that internal discussions within the SEC are progressing towards finding practical ways to integrate DLT into the existing securities market structure rather than trying to fit square pegs into round holes. What are Tokenized Securities and Why Use DLT? Tokenized Securities are essentially traditional financial assets (like stocks, bonds, real estate, or private equity) whose ownership and transfer rights are represented by digital tokens on a blockchain or other DLT. Think of it like creating a digital certificate for an asset that lives on a shared, secure ledger. Using DLT for securities offers several potential advantages: Increased Efficiency: Automating processes like clearing and settlement through smart contracts can drastically reduce time and manual effort. Reduced Costs: Lower reliance on intermediaries can cut fees associated with issuance, trading, and administration. Greater Transparency: Transactions recorded on a public or permissioned ledger can be more easily audited and verified (depending on the specific DLT design). Improved Liquidity: Tokenization can make illiquid assets (like real estate or private company shares) more easily divisible and tradable. Faster Settlement: Atomic swaps and on-chain settlement can reduce settlement times from days to minutes or even seconds. The SEC’s consideration of an exemption acknowledges these potential benefits but also implies that the unique nature of DLT and Tokenized Securities doesn’t fit neatly into current regulations designed for paper certificates and centralized ledgers. How Could This Impact Crypto Regulation and the Broader Market? This potential exemption is a significant development for Crypto Regulation . While the focus here is on traditional securities being tokenized on DLT, a clear regulatory path for DLT-based securities could have ripple effects across the broader digital asset ecosystem. It could: Provide Clarity: Offer a clearer regulatory framework for projects looking to issue tokenized versions of real-world assets. Encourage Institutional Adoption: Make it easier and safer for traditional financial institutions to explore and use DLT for securities. Spur Innovation: Incentivize the development of new trading systems and platforms built on DLT. Influence Global Standards: As a major financial regulator, the SEC’s approach could influence how other jurisdictions handle Tokenized Securities . However, it’s crucial to note that this is an exemption for securities specifically. It doesn’t necessarily change the regulatory status of other Digital Assets , such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which the SEC might view differently. What Challenges Remain for DLT and Tokenized Securities? While the prospect of an exemption is positive, significant challenges persist. The SEC must carefully consider: Investor Protection: How to ensure adequate safeguards for investors trading on new DLT-based systems. Market Integrity: Preventing manipulation and ensuring fair and orderly markets. Cybersecurity: Addressing the unique security risks associated with DLT platforms. Interoperability: How different DLT systems will interact with each other and with traditional financial infrastructure. Legal and Custodial Issues: Clarifying ownership rights and secure custody of Tokenized Securities . An exemption order would need to address these complex issues to be effective and maintain confidence in the market. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For anyone interested in the intersection of finance, technology, and regulation, this development is key. Keep an eye on: Details of the Exemption: The specific scope, conditions, and limitations of any proposed order will be critical. Which types of Tokenized Securities are eligible? What requirements will DLT trading systems need to meet? SEC’s Timeline: When might a formal proposal or order be released? Regulatory processes can be lengthy. Industry Response: How will financial institutions, blockchain companies, and market participants react to and potentially utilize such an exemption? Other Jurisdictions: Will this move influence regulatory approaches in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere? This consideration by the SEC is a clear signal that regulators are actively working to understand and potentially integrate DLT into the mainstream financial system, moving beyond just focusing on Crypto Regulation in a punitive sense towards enabling innovation. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point for Digital Assets and Finance The SEC’s reported consideration of a DLT exemption for Tokenized Securities is more than just regulatory jargon; it’s a potential turning point. It acknowledges the transformative power of distributed ledger technology and its application to traditional finance. While significant hurdles related to Crypto Regulation , investor protection, and market structure remain, this step indicates a willingness by at least parts of the SEC to create a viable path for innovation in Digital Assets . Should this exemption come to fruition, it could unlock new levels of efficiency and accessibility in capital markets, paving the way for a future where traditional securities and blockchain technology are seamlessly integrated.

Analysts Emphasize Its Unique Position in the Altcoin Landscape,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-magacoinfinance-the-best-coin-to-buy-in-2025-analysts-emphasize-its-unique-position-in-the-altcoin-landscape/,"MAGACOINFINANCE As the cryptocurrency market heads into a new altcoin cycle, MAGACOINFINANCE has entered the spotlight as a politically themed asset drawing increased attention from analysts and traders. More than just a culturally recognizable token, it arrives at a time of heightened interest in altcoins, meme tokens, and politically charged narratives—historically a combination that has delivered outsized returns. Thematic Relevance with Historical Precedent Political memecoins have demonstrated strong performance during election cycles and moments of intensified public discourse. Over the past few years, assets with branding linked to prominent political figures, particularly Donald Trump or MAGA-related themes, have experienced substantial market surges. Data from earlier cycles suggests these tokens often outperform broader memecoin sectors during peak periods, fueled by retail interest, media amplification, and sociopolitical events. MAGACOINFINANCE enters the market with a comparable narrative , one that benefits from strong thematic relevance and timely alignment with the 2025 U.S. presidential race. The project’s positioning resonates with a broad audience and mirrors the trajectory of earlier political tokens that saw notable appreciation during their launch windows. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Market Positioning and Early Momentum Unlike many memecoins that rely solely on viral appeal, MAGACOINFINANCE has paired its brand identity with strategic execution. The ongoing token sale is progressing rapidly, driven by strong investor interest and a growing community of early participants. The structured tokenomics and tiered sale stages have helped build early momentum while maintaining a sense of exclusivity for new entrants. This launch phase has already demonstrated high demand, with investors responding to both the coin’s cultural relevance and its perceived potential within the broader altcoin landscape. As market conditions continue to favor speculative narratives, MAGACOINFINANCE is well-positioned to benefit from capital rotation into thematic and narrative-driven assets. Unique Timing in a Resurgent Altcoin Season Altcoin market cycles tend to coincide with renewed retail participation and narrative shifts—and 2025 appears to be shaping into just such a period. With major blockchain upgrades, ETF approvals, and political developments intersecting, the macro environment is supportive of renewed growth across alternative digital assets. MAGACOINFINANCE’s release timing is notable. It comes amid a resurgence in meme and altcoin interest and during a time of geopolitical attention. The overlap of election-year dynamics and crypto market optimism provides a unique backdrop that could drive significant capital flows into tokens with clear narratives and cultural impact. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Analyst Outlook and Investor Perspective Several analysts have pointed to MAGACOINFINANCE’s similarities with early-stage political memecoins that later produced exceptional returns. While every project carries inherent risk, the structural setup, market timing, and branding of MAGACOINFINANCE distinguish it from a crowded field of short-lived tokens. Investor sentiment around the project reflects this recognition. Participation in the current token sale stage continues to accelerate, with many seeing this as one of the few early-phase opportunities in a market where established assets already command high valuations. Conclusion MAGACOINFINANCE represents more than a thematic play—it is a reflection of the market’s evolving interest in culturally resonant, narrative-backed digital assets. With a historically proven category, robust early participation, and favorable macro conditions, the project stands as a compelling option for traders looking to position ahead of potential momentum.As 2025 continues to unfold, and political headlines take center stage globally, MAGACOINFINANCE is one of the few tokens that appears to capture the moment.

44353626,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158730,1746757800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump Market Comment: Why His ‘Buy Stocks Now’ Remark Excites Investors (and What it Means for Crypto),https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-market-comment-outlook/,"A recent remark from former U.S. President Donald Trump has captured significant attention across financial markets. According to Solid Intel on X, Trump urged the public to invest, stating, “Better go out and buy stocks now.” This Trump market comment signals a strong level of confidence in the current financial landscape, particularly regarding the stock market outlook. While the comment is directed at traditional equities, understanding its potential ripple effects is crucial for investors across all asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Analyzing the Significance of the Trump Market Comment When a figure as prominent and influential as Donald Trump makes a public statement about the market, it’s rarely just casual advice. His words carry weight, especially among his supporters and those who view his previous administration favorably regarding economic policy. The directive to “go out and buy stocks now” is a clear and bullish signal. It suggests he believes the market is either undervalued, poised for significant growth, or both. This kind of statement can directly influence investor confidence, potentially encouraging hesitant individuals to enter the market or existing investors to increase their positions. Why does this matter? Investor confidence is a powerful, albeit intangible, force in financial markets. When confidence is high, people are more willing to take risks, invest capital, and drive asset prices upward. Conversely, low confidence can lead to panic selling and market downturns. Trump’s comment is a deliberate attempt to bolster that confidence, painting a picture of a healthy and promising economic future. Decoding the Stock Market Outlook Implied by the Remark The core of Trump’s statement lies in his view of the stock market outlook. By advising people to buy *now*, he implies that current prices represent an opportunity that shouldn’t be missed. This bullish perspective could be based on various factors, real or perceived, such as: Expectations of favorable economic policies, especially if he were to return to office. Belief that inflation is under control or that interest rates will move in a market-friendly direction. A positive assessment of corporate earnings and future growth potential. A political strategy to highlight potential economic prosperity under his influence or a critique of current conditions by suggesting *now* is the time to act despite present challenges. Regardless of the underlying reasons, the message is unequivocally positive for equities. For investors in traditional markets, this serves as a high-profile endorsement, potentially reinforcing existing bullish sentiment or challenging bearish views. It adds another layer to the complex analysis of market timing and future performance. The Role of Investor Confidence in Broader Markets As mentioned, investor confidence isn’t confined to just one asset class. While Trump’s comment specifically named stocks, a general uplift in market optimism tends to have spillover effects. When investors feel good about the economy and traditional investments like stocks, they may become more open to other asset classes, including those perceived as higher risk, like cryptocurrencies. High confidence often fuels a ‘risk-on’ environment, where capital flows into assets with higher potential returns. Consider the psychological aspect: if prominent figures are signaling strong market potential, it can create a positive feedback loop. People who were on the sidelines might decide to invest. Those already invested might invest more. This increased participation and capital injection can drive valuations across different markets. It’s a sentiment-driven phenomenon where belief in market growth can, to some extent, become a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, it’s crucial to remember that confidence can be fragile and influenced by many factors beyond a single statement, including: Economic data releases (inflation, jobs, GDP). Geopolitical events. Central bank policies (interest rates, quantitative easing). Corporate performance. Regulatory developments. While Trump’s comment is a notable data point, it’s part of a much larger mosaic of factors shaping investor psychology. Connecting the Dots: Economic Forecast and Market Sentiment Trump’s call to buy stocks is intrinsically linked to his underlying economic forecast. Such a bold statement suggests he foresees conditions that will be highly favorable for businesses and asset values. A positive economic forecast typically includes expectations of: Robust GDP growth. Low unemployment. Stable or manageable inflation. Supportive government policies (e.g., tax cuts, deregulation). If this optimistic forecast holds true, it creates a fertile ground for investment. Businesses thrive in such environments, leading to higher profits and, consequently, higher stock prices. Furthermore, a strong economy often means more disposable income for individuals, some of which might find its way into investment markets, including both traditional and digital assets. Conversely, if the actual economic trajectory deviates significantly from this optimistic forecast, the sentiment driven by such statements could quickly reverse. Market participants constantly weigh public statements against hard economic data. A sustained rally requires more than just encouraging words; it needs fundamental economic strength to back it up. Potential Implications for Crypto Market Sentiment Now, let’s address the crucial question for our audience: what does a bullish Trump market comment about stocks mean for crypto market sentiment? The relationship between traditional markets (like stocks) and the crypto market is complex and evolving. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies sometimes acted as uncorrelated assets or even safe havens. However, in recent years, particularly with increased institutional adoption and the rise of derivatives, the correlation between crypto (especially Bitcoin and Ethereum) and tech stocks (like the Nasdaq) has grown significantly. Here’s how a bullish signal in the stock market *could* influence crypto: Risk-On Appetite: As discussed, increased investor confidence and a positive stock market outlook often foster a ‘risk-on’ mentality. If investors are comfortable buying stocks, they might also be more willing to allocate capital to higher-volatility assets like cryptocurrencies. Capital Flow: A rising tide lifts all boats. If significant capital is flowing into the broader financial system due to increased confidence and investment, some of that capital is likely to find its way into the crypto market, either directly or indirectly through diversified funds and institutional strategies. Macro Narrative Alignment: If the prevailing narrative is one of economic growth and increasing asset values (as implied by Trump’s comment), this positive macro backdrop generally supports speculative assets like crypto, which perform well when liquidity is high and investors are seeking growth. Psychological Contagion: Positive sentiment in one major market can psychologically influence others. Seeing traditional markets perform well might make investors feel more optimistic about their entire portfolio, including crypto holdings. However, it’s vital to acknowledge the nuances and differences: Crypto-Specific Factors: The crypto market is also driven by its own unique catalysts, such as technological developments (e.g., Ethereum upgrades), regulatory news (positive or negative), adoption rates, and halving events (for Bitcoin). These factors can sometimes decouple crypto’s movement from traditional markets. Volatility: Crypto is inherently more volatile than stocks. While positive sentiment can amplify gains, negative news (either macro or crypto-specific) can lead to sharper downturns. Trump’s Stance on Crypto: It’s worth noting Trump’s past comments on crypto have been varied, sometimes expressing skepticism about Bitcoin specifically, while more recently showing openness or even launching NFTs. His direct stance on crypto doesn’t align as clearly as his recent statement on stocks, adding a layer of complexity. Therefore, while a bullish crypto market sentiment might receive a boost from a strong signal regarding the stock market outlook and overall investor confidence, it’s not a guaranteed one-to-one correlation. Crypto investors should view this Trump market comment as one piece of data in a much larger, interconnected global financial puzzle. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor So, what should you, as a crypto investor, take away from this Trump market comment and the subsequent discussion on investor confidence and the broader economic forecast? Here are a few points to consider: Monitor Broader Market Sentiment: Pay attention to major indicators and sentiment signals from traditional markets. Positive sentiment in stocks can be a tailwind for crypto, while negative sentiment can be a headwind. Understand Correlations: Be aware that Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies often show correlation with risk assets like tech stocks. This means they might move in tandem during periods of significant market shifts driven by changes in investor confidence or the economic forecast. Focus on Crypto Fundamentals: While macro factors matter, don’t ignore the specific developments within the crypto space. Project updates, regulatory clarity (or lack thereof), technological advancements, and adoption metrics remain crucial drivers. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on a single comment from any figure, no matter how prominent. Evaluate the statement within the context of the overall market, economic data, and your own investment strategy. Diversify (Carefully): Consider how different asset classes might perform under various scenarios. While this article discusses the link, stocks and crypto serve different roles in a portfolio. Trump’s remark is a high-profile piece of market commentary, signaling strong confidence in the stock market outlook. This contributes to the overall market sentiment and the prevailing economic forecast narrative. For the crypto market, this generally positive backdrop can be supportive, potentially boosting crypto market sentiment through increased risk appetite and capital flow. However, crypto’s unique characteristics and drivers mean its path won’t always mirror traditional markets perfectly. Savvy investors will consider such high-profile comments as part of a broader analysis, combining macro understanding with crypto-specific insights to navigate the market effectively.

The cryptocurrency has recovered by 2% in the past 24 hours, even reaching an intraday peak of $2.2, which has allowed it to maintain a strong position above its critical support zone despite recent downward pressure. Notably, an interesting technical analysis on the TradingView platform shows that XRP is about to enter the path into a bullish continuation to $4. Low Volatility Points To Shift From Bearish Momentum Recent price action has seen bullishness slowly creeping back ito XRP’s price action. Interestingly, crypto analyst MasterAnanda on the TradingView platform noted a strange XRP signal on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. Although strange, the strangeness is not in a bad way, as this is a bullish signal. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals When The XRP Price Will Reach $25 – It’s Not Far Off According to his analysis on TradingView, the chart has transitioned from periods of high volatility and sharp swings, particularly noticeable from December through early April, to a phase characterized by increasingly small candles and narrowing price action. From April 13 to April 21, XRP’s daily candlesticks became significantly smaller, indicating minimal volatility even as the price moved upward. Nonetheless, this upward movement was enough to break above a downward sloping resistance trendline that has led to the creation of lower highs since January. A similar phenomenon occurred around April 28, with the price drifting slightly lower over seven days but refusing to form new lows. This kind of behavior, where price consolidates without breaking down, is often interpreted as a bullish continuation pattern. MasterAnanda sees this as a bullish signal. It is confirmation that bearish momentum has faded. No bearish action, no bearish momentum; just consolidation before additional growth. Consolidation Before Expansion: The Bullish Case For XRP The chart accompanying MasterAnanda’s analysis reinforces this outlook. XRP has repeatedly bounced from a clearly defined support zone around the $2.00 mark since April 16. The highlighted accumulation area on the chart shows that buyers have consistently stepped in when the price dips toward this region. Related Reading: XRP Price Approaching Next Major Liquidity Zone, Main Levels To Watch Out For More importantly, each consolidation phase since the $1.61 low on April 7 has resulted in a higher low, further confirming a bullish structure. As the price continues to respect this zone, it lays the foundation for a strong upward breakout. The analyst projected a move toward $4, referencing a steep upward trajectory once the current range resolves to the upside. The green arrow marked on the chart above points directly toward this level. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.17, up by 2% in the past 24 hours.

While the XRP community is celebrating this major development, legal experts warn that the case isn’t fully over yet. According to attorney James K. Filan, even though both parties have agreed to the settlement terms, Judge Analisa Torres must first decide if the deal serves the public interest. Only after that decision will the case finally come to a close. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: The @SECGov has filed the Settlement Agreement Letter. https://t.co/eXuWjyQECc — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) May 8, 2025 What Happens Next? The 4 Key Steps Remaining Here’s a breakdown of the four big steps that still need to happen before Ripple can claim total victory: Judge Torres will review the settlement and give an initial decision on whether to dissolve the existing injunction, release the escrow funds — with $50 million going to the SEC and the rest returning to Ripple. If the judge agrees, both Ripple and the SEC will ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for a limited remand, sending the case back to Judge Torres to finalize the agreed-upon actions. Once the remand is granted, the two parties will file a joint motion requesting the official actions — dissolving the injunction and distributing the funds. After these steps are completed, Ripple and the SEC will ask the Court of Appeals to dismiss both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal, officially closing the case. XRP Community Stands Strong Attorney Bill Morgan pointed out that the vast majority of the public impacted by this case are XRP holders. He said that over 80,000 XRP holders joined attorney John Deaton in representing their interests during this legal fight, and there’s no record of even one XRP holder supporting the SEC’s position. The settlement process that has happened in SEC v Ripple over the last several weeks and will continue over the next few months is apparent from the details of the rule 62.1 motion filed today asking for an indicative ruling from Judge Torres. 1. Settlement agreement signed by… — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 8, 2025 Morgan believes this overwhelming public support could help convince the judge that dissolving the injunction and settling with a $50 million fine is in the public interest. Will the Judge Agree? While many XRP supporters are excited, not everyone is sure about the outcome. Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel stated that Judge Torres’ earlier ruling on Ripple’s institutional sales is likely to be upheld by higher courts. He warned that if the judge rejects the settlement, it’s unclear whether the SEC would continue to defend the case on appeal. Still, others in the XRP community feel confident that Judge Torres is likely to approve the settlement.

A significant move is underway regarding the future of stablecoins in the United States, with a key stablecoin bill now at the center of a political debate. Understanding the GENIUS Act Stablecoins Proposal At the heart of the current legislative effort is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act. This proposed legislation aims to create a much-needed regulatory framework specifically for issuers of stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, like the US dollar, making them a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto market. The GENIUS Act seeks to provide: Regulatory Clarity: Defining who can issue stablecoins and under what rules. Consumer Protection: Implementing safeguards to protect users and their funds. Financial Stability: Establishing requirements to ensure stablecoin reserves are sound. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures: Integrating robust controls to prevent illicit use. Supporters argue that passing this bill is essential for fostering innovation responsibly and maintaining the U.S.’s competitive edge in the global digital economy. Why Senate Republicans Are Pushing for US Crypto Regulation Now Senate Republicans , led by figures like Senate Majority Leader John Thune, are actively advocating for the advancement of the GENIUS Act. This push signals a growing urgency within the Republican party to establish a federal framework for digital assets, particularly stablecoins, which are seen as potentially systemically important. Senator Thune has emphasized that the legislation would bring much-needed certainty to the market. According to reports, he stated that the bill would provide “clarity for innovators, establish anti-money laundering safeguards and protect consumers.” This marks Thune’s first major public involvement in US crypto regulation efforts, highlighting the increasing prominence of this issue on the legislative agenda. The bill saw initial success, passing the Senate Banking Committee with significant bipartisan support, a vote of 18-6. This indicated a shared understanding across the aisle regarding the need for stablecoin rules. The Democratic Stall: Political Hurdles for Crypto Legislation US Despite the initial bipartisan support in committee, the path forward for this crucial piece of crypto legislation US is now facing resistance from Democrats. While previously supportive, some Democrats are reportedly hesitant to proceed with further debate or votes on the bill. The primary concern cited for this resistance revolves around former President Trump’s reported business interests in the cryptocurrency space. This political consideration appears to be creating a roadblock, overshadowing the policy merits of the GENIUS Act itself. The dynamic illustrates how broader political narratives and election-year considerations can impact even seemingly technical or financial legislation. The Crucial Vote: What’s Next for the Stablecoin Bill? The immediate fate of the stablecoin bill rests on an upcoming procedural vote. A cloture vote is scheduled, which is a mechanism used to end debate and bring a bill to a final vote. For the GENIUS Act to proceed, this cloture vote requires a supermajority of 60 votes in the Senate. Given the current Democratic resistance, securing the necessary 60 votes presents a significant challenge. The outcome of this vote will be a critical indicator of whether stablecoin regulation can move forward in the current political climate or if it will be delayed further. Summary: The push by Senate Republicans for the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at creating a regulatory framework for GENIUS Act stablecoins and advancing US crypto regulation , faces a significant hurdle due to Democratic concerns tied to former President Trump’s crypto interests. Despite initial bipartisan committee support, the path forward for this crucial piece of crypto legislation US now hinges on a cloture vote requiring 60 votes. The outcome will determine if clear stablecoin rules can be established soon or if the political deadlock will continue.

The premier cryptocurrency has not only solidified its position as a major player but has now surpassed established giants in both the traditional commodity and modern tech sectors. Understanding Bitcoin Market Cap Milestones Market capitalization, or market cap, is a simple yet powerful metric. It’s calculated by multiplying the current price of an asset by its total circulating supply. For Bitcoin, this figure represents the total value of all Bitcoins currently in existence. Reaching a high Bitcoin market cap signifies growing investor confidence, increased adoption, and a larger overall footprint in the global economy. The journey to a multi-trillion-dollar valuation hasn’t been linear, marked by volatility and significant price swings. However, recent upward trends have propelled Bitcoin past several notable assets and companies, capturing headlines worldwide and fueling discussions about the future of finance. Bitcoin vs Silver: A Clash of Eras One of the most symbolic milestones is Bitcoin’s market cap surpassing that of silver. Silver has been valued as a precious metal and store of value for millennia, often playing second fiddle only to gold. Its market cap reflects centuries of mining, industrial use, and investment. When considering Bitcoin vs silver , we’re essentially comparing a 21st-century digital asset born from code to an ancient physical commodity dug from the earth. This comparison highlights the increasing acceptance of digital scarcity and decentralized value stores in the modern investment landscape. While silver’s value is tied to industrial demand, jewelry, and traditional investment, Bitcoin’s value is driven by its technological properties, network effects, and its role as a potential hedge against inflation and traditional financial system risks. This shift isn’t just about numbers; it represents a fundamental change in how investors perceive and allocate value. It signals a growing belief that digital assets can serve functions traditionally reserved for physical commodities like silver. Bitcoin vs Google (Alphabet): Digital Disruptor Meets Tech Giant Another remarkable achievement is Bitcoin’s market cap exceeding that of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Alphabet is one of the most influential and valuable technology companies globally, with diverse interests spanning search engines, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and more. Its market cap reflects its vast profitability, market dominance, and future growth potential in the digital age. The comparison between Bitcoin vs Google (Alphabet) is equally fascinating. On one hand, you have a centralized corporate behemoth that derives its value from services, data, and advertising. On the other, you have a decentralized, open-source network asset with no single CEO or headquarters, whose value is derived from its protocol rules, network security, and adoption as a store of value and medium of exchange. Surpassing Alphabet underscores Bitcoin’s emergence as a major force in the digital economy, not just as a currency or commodity, but as an asset class that can command valuations comparable to the world’s largest tech corporations. This isn’t to say Bitcoin operates like Google; their fundamental structures and value propositions are vastly different. Rather, it signifies Bitcoin’s arrival in the top tier of global assets by valuation, standing alongside companies that define the modern digital landscape. The Current Landscape: What the Numbers Say According to the data that sparked this news, Bitcoin’s market cap recently stood at approximately $1.986 trillion . This valuation placed it above both silver and Alphabet in the global asset rankings. While these rankings are dynamic and fluctuate with market prices, holding a position among the top 10 or even top 6 global assets is a powerful statement. Let’s look at a simplified comparison based on the figures mentioned and general understanding: Asset/Entity Approximate Market Cap (at time of milestone) Type Key Value Driver Bitcoin ~$1.986 Trillion Digital Asset/Cryptocurrency Scarcity, Decentralization, Network Effect, Store of Value Potential Silver Below Bitcoin’s Milestone Figure Physical Commodity Industrial Demand, Jewelry, Traditional Investment Alphabet (Google) Below Bitcoin’s Milestone Figure Technology Company (Stock) Profitability, Services (Search, Cloud, Ads), Innovation This table illustrates the diverse nature of the assets Bitcoin is now being compared against by valuation. It highlights Bitcoin’s unique position bridging the gap between a potential digital store of value and a significant player in the digital economy. Why Does This Matter for the Cryptocurrency Market? These market cap milestones have several important implications for the broader cryptocurrency market : Increased Legitimacy: Reaching such high valuations and surpassing well-known traditional assets and companies lends significant credibility to Bitcoin and, by extension, the entire crypto space. It’s harder for skeptics to dismiss an asset worth nearly $2 trillion. Institutional Interest: Large market cap figures attract institutional investors who require liquidity and scale. As Bitcoin grows, it becomes a more viable allocation option for pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries. Mainstream Awareness: Headlines about Bitcoin surpassing Google or silver grab public attention. This increased visibility can lead to greater awareness, understanding, and potentially adoption by retail investors. Network Effect: A higher market cap often correlates with increased network security (due to more mining power) and utility, creating a positive feedback loop that can attract more users and developers. Paving the Way for Other Digital Assets: While Bitcoin leads, its success can pave the way for increased acceptance and investment in other legitimate digital assets within the cryptocurrency market . Challenges and Considerations Ahead Despite these impressive milestones, it’s crucial to remember that the path forward for digital assets like Bitcoin is not without challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin remains significantly more volatile than traditional assets like silver or established stocks like Alphabet. Its price can experience dramatic swings in short periods. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can introduce risks and uncertainty for investors. Scalability and Technology: While the core Bitcoin protocol is robust, ongoing discussions about scaling solutions and technological advancements continue. Competition: Bitcoin faces competition from other cryptocurrencies and emerging blockchain technologies. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, misconceptions and skepticism about Bitcoin and digital assets persist among some segments of the population and traditional finance. Actionable Insights for Readers What does Bitcoin’s market cap surge mean for you? Stay Informed: These milestones are indicators of significant shifts. Continue learning about Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market . Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not view market cap milestones as a guarantee of future returns. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, technology, and risks before considering any investment. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Given its volatility, Bitcoin may not be suitable for all investors. Assess your personal financial situation and risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: Many Bitcoin proponents view it as a long-term store of value or a revolutionary technology. Short-term price movements, while significant, should be viewed within this broader context. Diversification: As with any investment class, diversification is key. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. This is not financial advice, but rather an interpretation of what these market cap achievements signify in the evolving world of finance and technology. The Future Trajectory of Digital Assets Where does Bitcoin go from here? With a market cap approaching $2 trillion, the next significant target by valuation is likely gold, which has a considerably larger market cap (several times that of Bitcoin). Surpassing gold would be the ultimate symbolic flip, positioning Bitcoin as the dominant global store of value in the digital age. The continued growth of the cryptocurrency market depends on various factors, including technological development, regulatory clarity, macroeconomic conditions, and increasing adoption by both institutions and individuals. Bitcoin’s journey past silver and Google is a powerful testament to the potential of digital assets and their increasing integration into the global financial fabric. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin and Digital Assets Bitcoin’s recent achievement of surpassing both silver and Alphabet (Google) in market capitalization is a landmark event. It signifies more than just price appreciation; it represents a profound shift in how the world perceives and values digital assets. By exceeding the value of an ancient store of value like silver and a modern tech titan like Google, Bitcoin reinforces its position as a legitimate, significant, and rapidly maturing global asset class. While challenges and volatility remain inherent to the cryptocurrency market , these milestones provide compelling evidence of Bitcoin’s growing influence and its potential to reshape the future of finance.

For those tracking the intersection of venture capital, artificial intelligence, and business growth, the latest development surrounding the sales automation startup Clay is particularly noteworthy. This burgeoning company recently closed a substantial tender offer , providing a unique opportunity for its employees and signaling strong investor confidence. What is a Tender Offer and Why Does it Matter for Employee Liquidity? A tender offer is essentially an offer by a company or an outside investor to buy back shares from existing shareholders, often employees, at a specific price and within a limited time frame. This differs from a traditional funding round where new shares are issued. For startup employees, who often hold a significant portion of their compensation in company stock options or equity, a tender offer is a crucial pathway to achieving employee liquidity . Many startup employees trade lower salaries for the potential upside of equity. However, this equity remains illiquid until a major event like an IPO or acquisition. A tender offer provides an earlier opportunity for employees to cash out some of their hard-earned shares, realizing a return on their commitment without waiting years for a large exit event. Clay’s co-founder and CEO, Kareem Amin, emphasized this point, noting that while many startups don’t succeed, Clay is, and they wanted to ensure employees had a liquidity option. Sequoia’s Role and the Impressive Startup Funding Leading this significant transaction is Sequoia , a prominent venture capital firm with a long history of investing in successful technology companies. Sequoia has been an investor in Clay since its Series A round in 2019. In this latest move, Sequoia agreed to purchase up to $20 million worth of employee stock as part of the tender offer. This isn’t just about providing employee liquidity; it also allows Sequoia to increase its ownership stake in Clay, demonstrating their continued belief in the company’s future potential. The tender offer values Clay at an impressive $1.5 billion. This represents a notable increase from the $1.25 billion valuation the company achieved during its Series B funding round in January. This rapid increase in valuation underscores Clay’s explosive growth since its product gained traction in 2022. The company has scaled its team significantly, now employing over 200 people, up from low double digits just a few years ago. Beyond Employees: A Unique Community Round Clay’s commitment to sharing its success extends beyond its employees. In a move that highlights the company’s innovative approach, Clay also offered its direct users the opportunity to invest in the startup through a community round in February. This allowed community members worldwide to invest at the same valuation offered to Series B investors. Clay successfully raised about $3 million through this initiative, enabling customers who rely on Clay’s sales automation and AI tools to directly participate in the company’s growth journey. Kareem Amin views both the tender offer and the community round as a way to reinforce the idea that building Clay is a collective effort. It’s a deliberate decision to ensure that the financial gains from the company’s success are not concentrated among just a few individuals but are shared with those who contribute most to its growth – its employees and its customers. Looking Ahead: More Liquidity Opportunities? While the current tender offer allows eligible current and former employees with at least a year of tenure to sell a portion of their equity (typically equivalent to about one year’s salary), Clay’s founders, Kareem Amin and Varun Anand, are not selling any of their shares in this offering. This decision further signals their long-term commitment and confidence in the company’s trajectory. Interestingly, Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia , suggested that the demand from employees looking to sell might be less than the $20 million Sequoia is willing to buy. This indicates that many employees are optimistic about the future value of their shares and may choose to hold onto them. Amin is also forward-thinking, suggesting that given Clay’s rapid growth, he would like to launch tender offers annually, potentially setting a trend for other startups to provide regular employee liquidity options. This development for Clay, powered by its effective sales automation technology leveraging AI, represents a significant milestone not just for the company itself but also potentially for broader trends in startup funding and employee compensation structures in the tech industry.

Surprisingly, it is not just retail traders entering a growing number of seasoned XRP and Cardano (ADA) holders are beginning to reposition into this fast-rising asset. With $7.8 million already raised , MAGACOINFINANCE has captured market attention not through hype, but through a disciplined rollout, transparent tokenomics, and a roadmap that analysts are beginning to take seriously. In contrast, while ADA and XRP remain in consolidation zones, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground offering a fresh alternative with clear upside and short-term actionability. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! The Context: What’s Going On With XRP and Cardano? Both XRP and Cardano remain headline tokens in May 2025, but for different reasons: Cardano (ADA) is showing bullish reversal patterns, fueled by speculation over a possible Cardano ETF , and a growing list of real-world partnerships ahead of the LAOS protocol upgrade . However, despite recent gains, ADA is still trading between $0.70–$0.72 , with resistance levels at $0.81 and $1.17 yet to be broken. XRP sits near $2.22 , following recent volatility tied to ETF filing delays and a dip in trading volume. Bloomberg analysts still give an 85% chance of a 2025 XRP ETF approval, but market sentiment remains mixed due to the SEC’s postponed decision and lack of a spot ETF approval. Both tokens are still seen as high-potential assets — but limited short-term catalysts and broader market fatigue are driving capital to emerging high-ROI alternatives . That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE enters the equation. 3,000%+ Upside and 50% Bonus Fuel Early Demand MAGACOINFINANCE is currently offering what many analysts view as a rare early-stage setup, especially when compared to saturated Layer 1 ecosystems: Over 3,000% ROI potential projected from current entry to listing 50% bonus tokens available during the current round A fixed supply of 100 billion tokens , with 45% allocated to presale Bonuses decreasing and pricing rising hourly as demand accelerates This disciplined structure — with no vague promises or open-ended timelines — is what sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart from the typical meme-driven noise. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE Is Positioned for 25x–35x Returns by Year-End Current projections suggest MAGACOINFINANCE could reach its target listing price of $0.007 , which would represent a 25x to 35x return from today’s levels — making it one of the most potentially lucrative early altcoin plays of 2025. Backing this forecast is more than speculation: A global marketing campaign is set to launch Agency partnerships are confirmed Exchange listing discussions are already underway Unlike traditional token sales that offer little more than ambition, MAGACOINFINANCE is executing on all fronts — drawing attention from crypto analysts, early-stage investors, and now, capital rotation from ADA and XRP whales. Why Analysts Say MAGACOINFINANCE Could Outperform in 2025 MAGACOINFINANCE is increasingly being referred to as a strategic early entry , particularly for investors who missed prior runs in Ethereum , SHIBA INU , or DOGE . While ADA and XRP continue to trade within structured ranges, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in a price discovery phase — and momentum is building fast. With institutional-grade branding , real-time traction , and a growing community of over 20,000 supporters, Project is quickly climbing up the 2025 altcoin watchlist. This is not a question of potential anymore — it’s a question of timing . The window to secure the 50% bonus and enter before mass exposure begins is rapidly narrowing.

T-Rex , a purpose-built blockchain for entertainment, content, and cultural virality, today announced a $17 million fundraise and Incubation Fund to revolutionize online content publishing by seamlessly rewarding consumers for everyday interactions on social platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, or X (formerly Twitter) and reshape how consumer-facing decentralized applications (dApps) are discovered, published, distributed and scaled across Web3. Backed by strategic investors including Portal Ventures, North Island Ventures, Framework Ventures, Arbitrum Gaming Ventures, ArkStream Capital, Mindfulness Capital, Hypersphere, SNZ, and Arche Fund, and developed by EVG, Asia’s prominent product builder and publisher, known for driving mass adoption, T-Rex directly addresses the critical “ghost town” and “mercenary users” challenges in blockchain. “Arbitrum Gaming Ventures recognizes the transformative potential of platforms like T-Rex that are expanding Web3 beyond DeFi. EVG’s strong regional influence and deep understanding of the Southeast Asian market, projected to reach $7 billion by 2028, provide a strategic gateway for us to significantly scale our footprint within this high-growth region. Combining our robust scaling capabilities with EVG’s extensive ecosystem expertise, we are strategically positioned to penetrate the entertainment industry and broader consumer market in a pivotal and rapidly expanding part of the world,” said Dan Peng, Partner at Arbitrum Gaming Ventures . ??T-Rex leverages Arbitrum’s powerful Layer-2 scaling solution, delivering ultra-fast, secure, and low-cost transactions essential for consumer-scale adoption. Arbitrum Gaming Ventures has specifically identified T-Rex as key to its regional growth strategy. T-Rex: A New Kind of Blockchain for the Culture-First Internet (UI screenshot: A user earning rewards while browsing YouTube with T-Rex’s browser extension.) While Web3 holds the promise of revolutionary change, the current landscape is fragmented, user-unfriendly and often empty with underutilized dApps. Despite all its innovation, most chains lack real users, real culture, and real reasons to stay. T-Rex flips the model with its simple first principle: stop trying to reinvent user habits and instead enhance them invisibly. Its core innovation, Proof-of-Engagement (PoE) mechanism, automatically rewards users on apps they already use daily through a privacy-preserving browser extension, turning everyday online actions like watching videos, liking posts, and sharing memes into tangible, valuable digital ownership and offline perks. “Instead of building another blockchain pipe, we’re delivering actual water: engaging content, thriving communities, real-world rewards”, said Allen Ng, Co-Founder of T-Rex and EVG . “Users shouldn’t have to think about crypto until they want to. Our blockchain stays invisible, letting them effortlessly turn their online fun into meaningful rewards. Our vision is to let attention becomes equity, community becomes power and participation becomes currency.” Radical Simplicity: Web3 That Feels Like TikTok, Not A Crypto Wallet (UI screenshot: Home Discovery pushing relevant content and dApps to user.) At launch, users simply install T-Rex’s browser extension and continue browsing popular social media platforms. Every interaction is quietly, securely recorded via advanced zero-knowledge tech (zkTLS), and seamlessly turned into rewards, with no wallet or tech jargon required. Creators and projects benefit from instant audience discovery and viral distribution, while end users earn rewards effortlessly, redeemable both digitally and offline, such as cash back at favorite restaurants or exclusive local deals. “The next wave of breakout applications will be defined by distribution, UI / UX, and product differentiation. The team at T-Rex gets this. They’re building a protocol that seamlessly onboards social media users and allows them to monetize their data through network rewards. We’re excited to back T-Rex as they merge protocol-native network design with clean consumer product expertise,” said Evan Fisher, Founder and General Partner of Portal Ventures . “Web3 infrastructure has matured, but it still lacks consumer momentum because only a few use cases resonate with the masses. T-Rex is a strong contender to bridge this gap. By prioritizing culture and abstracting complexity, it offers a path to broad adoption,” said Travis Scher Managing Partner and Co-founder of North Island Ventures . Incubating the New Digital Metropolis The $8 million Incubation Fund backed by EVG with support from the Arbitrum Gaming Ventures will accelerate ecosystem growth, offering comprehensive developer support beyond capital, including engineering resources, media partnerships, community activations, premium events, Key Opinion Leader (KOL) networks, and strategic Intellectual Property (IP) applications. “We provide real firepower, not just capital”, Joyce Yim, Co-founder of T-Rex emphasised . “Developers gain immediate user traffic, creators grow loyal audiences effortlessly, and users become not just spectators, but stakeholders in the success of viral content.” Set to launch in Summer 2025, T-Rex’s distribution layer and browser extension create the railroads linking popular online consumer applications such as gaming, music, interactive media, and Web3. From creators rewarding top users with digital assets, to new projects gaining instant discovery, to active users earning a stake, T-Rex’s ecosystem is designed for intuitive use, cultural resonance, and economic empowerment at scale. About T-Rex T-Rex is a new blockchain ecosystem purpose-built for consumer-facing applications, designed to transform the Web3 attention layer through its innovative Proof of Engagement (PoE) mechanism. Developed by EVG and backed by leading investors including Arbitrum Gaming Ventures, Framework Ventures, North Island Ventures, and Portal Ventures, T-Rex offers creators and developers a UX-first infrastructure with built-in discovery, rewards, and distribution, enabling the next billion users to engage, earn, and build on-chain.

On Thursday, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to call Powell “a fool” who “doesn’t have a clue.” The day before, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. “Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.” The Fed has held interest rates steady since December, when it cut the rate by 0.25%. While speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump complained that talking to Powell is “like talking to a wall.” “The Bank of England cut. China cut. Everybody’s cutting but him. I don’t know, we’ll see what happens. It’s a shame. I call him ‘Too Late.’ Too Late Powell, that’s his nickname. And it’s a shame, it’s ridiculous… he’s always too late.

44355062,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158736,1746760241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Simple Bitcoin Investing: CZ’s Key to Avoiding Panic Selling,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-investing-cz-advice/,"Navigating the world of cryptocurrencies can seem daunting, but what if the key to success was surprisingly simple? According to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), it might just be. In a recent statement via X, CZ offered a concise yet powerful piece of advice regarding Bitcoin investing : success hinges on one crucial factor – not giving in to panic selling. Understanding CZ’s Insight on Bitcoin Investing CZ’s comment, while brief, cuts to the core of a major challenge faced by both new and experienced investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market . He suggested that the act of investing in Bitcoin itself isn’t inherently complex. The real difficulty, and often the source of losses, comes from emotional reactions to price swings. The idea is that if you buy Bitcoin and simply hold onto it through the inevitable ups and downs, you bypass the most common pitfall: selling at a loss during a market downturn driven by fear. This aligns with the popular ‘HODLing’ (Hold On for Dear Life) philosophy prevalent in the crypto community. Why is Avoiding Panic Selling So Crucial? Panic selling is driven by fear (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) when asset prices drop sharply. Investors worry about losing more money and sell their holdings quickly, often at a significant loss. This is the opposite of the classic investment advice to ‘buy low and sell high’. Panic sellers often end up selling low after buying high or at a peak, locking in losses instead of waiting for a potential recovery. Consider the historical performance of Bitcoin. It has experienced numerous significant price corrections throughout its history. Those who sold during these dips missed out on subsequent recoveries and all-time highs. Those who held, despite the fear, were able to weather the storm. Building a Resilient Crypto Investment Strategy If the key is to avoid panic selling , how does one build a crypto investment strategy that supports this? It requires discipline, a long-term perspective, and understanding the nature of the asset class. Here are some actionable steps to integrate into your strategy: Define Your Investment Horizon: Are you looking to invest for months, years, or even a decade? A longer time horizon makes short-term volatility less impactful. Invest Only What You Can Afford to Lose: This is perhaps the most critical rule. If the money you invest is essential for immediate needs, any price drop will cause significant stress and increase the likelihood of panic selling. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) regardless of the price. This averages out your purchase price over time and removes the emotion of trying to time the market. Research and Understand Bitcoin: The more you understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, technology, and long-term potential, the less likely you are to be swayed by short-term price movements or negative news. Set Clear Goals and Exit Strategies (But Be Flexible): Knowing why you are investing and under what conditions you might sell (e.g., reaching a specific price target, a fundamental change in Bitcoin) can provide structure. However, distinguish between a planned exit and a panic reaction. Secure Your Investment: Use strong wallets and security practices to protect your holdings from theft, which is a different kind of risk but can also lead to forced selling or loss. What are the Benefits of Sticking to a Plan? Successfully avoiding the urge to panic sell during market downturns offers several potential benefits: Potential for Long-Term Gains: Bitcoin has historically trended upwards over the long term despite significant volatility. Holding allows you to benefit from potential future price appreciation. Reduced Stress and Emotional Turmoil: Constantly watching charts and reacting to every dip is mentally exhausting. A disciplined approach based on holding reduces this stress. Compounding Effects: If you are reinvesting or holding for the long term, your gains (when they occur) can compound over time. Avoiding Locking in Losses: The most direct benefit is not realizing losses by selling at the bottom. Challenges in the Cryptocurrency Market and How to Overcome Them While CZ Bitcoin advice is simple, implementing it is challenging due to the inherent nature of the cryptocurrency market . Common challenges include: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can move dramatically in short periods, triggering fear. Constant News Cycle and Social Media Noise: The market is influenced by a flood of information, rumors, and FUD on social media. Regulatory Uncertainty: News about potential regulations in various countries can cause market jitters. Personal Financial Situations: Unexpected expenses or financial pressures can force investors to sell at inconvenient times. Overcoming these requires reinforcing the strategies mentioned earlier: focusing on the long term, using DCA, investing only what you can lose, and limiting exposure to excessive market noise. Examples: The Cost of Panic vs. The Reward of Patience Consider the market crash of March 2020, triggered by global pandemic fears. Bitcoin’s price plummeted. Many panicked and sold. However, those who held saw Bitcoin recover and go on to reach new all-time highs in 2020 and 2021. Similarly, the downturns in 2021 and 2022 tested investors. While past performance is not indicative of future results, these examples highlight the potential consequence of panic selling during a dip versus the outcome of holding through it. Actionable Insights for Your Investment Journey Based on CZ’s simple yet profound insight, here are your key takeaways: Adopt a long-term perspective for your Bitcoin investing . Build a robust crypto investment strategy that prioritizes holding over reacting to short-term price swings. Implement Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to reduce emotional influence on your purchases. Ensure the funds you invest are not needed for immediate or near-term expenses. Educate yourself about Bitcoin to build conviction. Limit exposure to sensationalist news and social media FUD. Summary: Embracing Simplicity in a Complex Market CZ’s statement serves as a powerful reminder that sometimes, the most effective strategy is the simplest one. While the cryptocurrency market is complex and subject to rapid changes, the core challenge for many investors isn’t understanding blockchain technology or market analysis; it’s managing their own emotions. By focusing on the long term and committing to avoid panic selling , investors can significantly improve their chances of navigating the volatility and potentially benefiting from their Bitcoin investing journey. It’s a lesson in patience, discipline, and trusting in the long-term potential of the asset.

PEPE has overtaken Dogecoin in daily trading volume, becoming the most traded memecoin and the sixth most traded cryptocurrency globally (excluding stablecoins). Why is PEPE Surging? The pepe coin price surge is fueled by a combination of whale accumulation, technical breakouts, and increasing open interest in the derivatives market.

On April 30, this whale—who holds $147 million in crypto assets— withdrew 1.5 trillion PEPE from Binance , and earlier today, they added another 500 billion PEPE tokens , bringing their total holdings to 2 trillion tokens . This accumulation, totaling roughly $4.36 million , signals strong long-term confidence in PEPE. Derivatives Market Heating Up According to data from CoinGlass , trader interest in PEPE is rising fast . The amount of money locked into PEPE futures — known as open interest — has gone up by 6.6%, reaching more than $434 million . That means more traders are betting on PEPE’s next move. In the past 24 hours alone, around $1.57 million worth of trades were liquidated , and $1.45 million of that came from people betting against PEPE . In simple terms, a lot of traders who expected the price to fall got caught off guard — a classic sign of a short squeeze . What Next For PEPE Price? According to analyst , PEPE recently broke out of a Descending Broadening Wedge pattern—a bullish signal—confirming a shift in momentum with a strong daily close. This could lead to a 120% to 140% midterm rally . If the market remian bullish and PEPE Price maintain the uptrend we can see 1,200%+ gain , with a price target of $0.000080 (a 10x from current levels) within the next bullish cycle.",News|Altcoins|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 03:11:38

Some community members express concerns that RLUSD might diminish XRP’s utility, especially in areas like cross-border payments and liquidity provision.

One community member particularly highlighted Ripple’s shift to minimize XRP’s role, focusing it mainly on transaction fees, since RLUSD can be used for everything else. However, others pointed out XRP’s status as a liquidity engine rather than a gas token, meaning XRP facilitates efficient value transfer across the XRPL, not just covering transaction fees like Ethereum’s gas. There were also some rude words thrown in, but what else can you expect… The post Understanding the Difference: Why Ripple Needs Both XRP and RLUSD appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|Altcoin News|XRP (Ripple) News,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-05-09 03:15:00

The SHIB price rallied back to $0.000014 on Thursday, a 12% jump on the day, taking the meme coin to nearly 40% above its early April lows. Despite recent price turbulence, data from IntoTheBlock shows that 78% of current Shiba Inu investors have been holding onto the meme coin for more than 1 year. That’s shows impressive resolve, over the course of the last year, the SHIB price has seen huge volatility, swinging from highs around $0.000033 all the way down to lows around $0.000010. HODLing over the long-term in the face of such volatility shows that investors must have a lot of belief in Shiba Inu. And the HODLers might be about to receive a major reward for their patience, with a massive SHIB price reversal higher potentially brewing. SHIB Price Prediction: Is a Massive Reversal Brewing? The USA/UK trade deal announced on Thursday was a major moment for the market. It sent Bitcoin (BTC) back above $100,000 for the first time in months, and signaled to the market that the we could be entering the end phase of Trump’s “trade war season”. US-UK Deal Summary: •US slashes tariffs on UK cars & metals •UK opens doors to US beef & ethanol •$10B Boeing deal locked •UK to review its digital tax on Big Tech Trump & Starmer call it a “reset” for economic ties. This is great! China won’t like this pic.twitter.com/YLzLynbL6r — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) May 8, 2025 That potentially removes, or at least reduces, a major downside risk for the economy and markets more broadly. If the US and global economy can rebound from recent uncertainty, risk appetite could continue to improve. And meme coins like Shiba Inu could be some of the best placed assets to benefit. The SHIB price’s impressive 12% rally on Thursday sent the meme coin back towards the top of its recent $0.000010-15 range, and back above its 21 and 50DMA. A break above here, especially if its coupled with continued progress higher for Bitcoin, could signal the start of a bigger recovery back towards the SHIB price’s late 2024 highs above $0.30. In other words, a massive rally of more than 2x could be coming in the near-term. Could the SHIB price then proceed to rally back to the 2021 record highs? Well, the macro conditions that have historically facilitated altcoin / meme coin seasons aren’t quite there yet. Prior meme seasons have come at a time when interest rates have been very low, and central banks have been pumping markets with liquidity. Its unlikely the Fed will axe interest rates to zero and restart QE any time soon. So a full-blown meme season will need to wait. That said, the medium-term outlook for the SHIB price is very strong, and now is certainly a good time to add the asset to portfolios. Is SUBDD (SUBDD) A Better Alternative to Consider? SUBDD (SUBDD) , a decentralized platform blending AI and blockchain for content creators, offers a compelling case over Shiba Inu (SHIB). Unlike SHIB, a meme coin reliant on community hype, SUBDD empowers creators with tools for monetized, transparent content via subscriptions and gated posts. Its presale has raised over $300,000, with tokens priced at $0.0551, signaling strong early interest. SUBDD’s 1 billion token supply and focus on AI-driven utility suggest scalability, with projections of $0.301 by 2025. SHIB’s ecosystem, while established, faces dilution risks. SUBDD’s innovative approach and staking rewards make it a promising, grounded investment.

But while these large caps continue to attract investor attention, the analyst points to one lesser-known altcoin that could outperform them all heading into 2025 — MAGACOINFINANCE . LISTINGS COULD DROP ANY MOMENT –ACT NOW Ethereum: Solid Momentum With ETF and Staking Tailwinds Ethereum remains the foundation of Web3 infrastructure and is regaining bullish momentum following its Dencun upgrade and rising validator activity. Analysts expect price targets between $2,800–$3,500 by Q1 2025, especially if ETH ETF approval materializes in the U.S. With nearly $190B in market cap, gains may be steady but not exponential. Cardano: Bullish Reversal Toward $1.10 After a long consolidation period, Cardano is showing clear signs of strength. ADA recently broke resistance at the $0.80 level, backed by rising DeFi TVL and ecosystem expansion. Analysts believe a breakout to $1.00–$1.10 is likely by year-end, with ADA gaining traction again as a scalable smart contract network. XRP: Legal Clarity Unlocking Institutional Flows XRP’s sideways action is masking a bigger story — ETF products tied to XRP and new XRPL integrations are fueling long-term accumulation. A break above $2.46 could open up a path to $5 , according to technical models. With court battles settling and regulatory frameworks solidifying, XRP may retake its top-three ranking in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Altcoin With 25x Potential While major coins might double or triple, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to multiply far beyond that. With over 50,000 community members and viral demand driving daily presale inflows, it’s now being tracked as one of the top altcoins to watch this year. Backed by narrative momentum, structured tokenomics, and strong early engagement, MAGACOINFINANCE has what Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP no longer offer: a low entry point with massive upside still ahead . The project is featured by major crypto publishers , trending across social platforms , and has a CMC listing around the corner — all while still being priced under $0.0003 . 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Final Word: Big names are moving.

The landscape is constantly shifting, and recent news from the Middle East highlights a significant pushback against unauthorized digital asset activities. Specifically, Kuwait crypto mining operations are facing intense scrutiny, leading to a major crackdown by authorities. What’s Behind Kuwait’s Crypto Mining Crackdown? Kuwait has taken decisive action against what it deems illegal crypto mining . The core issue, according to officials, is the immense strain these operations place on the nation’s power grid. Unlike traditional computing tasks, cryptocurrency mining, particularly using proof-of-work algorithms like Bitcoin’s, consumes vast amounts of electricity. This becomes a critical concern, especially as summer temperatures rise, pushing energy demand to peak levels. Here’s a breakdown of the recent actions: Authorities questioned 116 individuals suspected of involvement in illegal mining activities. A total of 31 investigations have been launched. These investigations span across 59 different properties identified as housing unauthorized mining setups. This isn’t a sudden development. Kuwait implemented a nationwide crypto mining ban back in 2023. This ban was part of a broader regulatory move to control digital assets within the country, citing risks associated with market volatility, potential misuse in illicit activities, and the significant energy consumption. The Impact of Illegal Crypto Mining on Power Grids The primary justification for the crackdown is the impact on the national power grid strain . Cryptocurrency mining requires powerful computers (often ASICs or GPUs) running continuously. A single, large-scale mining farm can consume as much electricity as a small town. When numerous such operations are running illegally, bypassing official metering or operating in residential areas not equipped for such loads, it can lead to: Increased demand, potentially causing blackouts or brownouts during peak times. Damage to local infrastructure not designed for constant, heavy loads. Higher energy costs for legitimate consumers due to increased overall demand and system stress. Environmental concerns related to the increased carbon footprint from energy generation. Reports have suggested the scale of the problem in Kuwait is considerable, with some estimates pointing to over 1,000 illegal mining sites operating before the current enforcement push. The summer heat only exacerbates the issue, as air conditioning demand skyrockets, putting additional pressure on the grid. Navigating the Crypto Mining Ban in Kuwait For individuals or entities considering or currently engaged in crypto mining in Kuwait, the message from authorities is clear: it is prohibited. The 2023 crypto mining ban makes any such operation illegal, regardless of scale. The current crypto crackdown serves as a strong deterrent and shows that the government is serious about enforcing this regulation. What does this mean for the cryptocurrency scene in Kuwait? Legitimate cryptocurrency trading and investment might still be possible, but the act of validating transactions through mining within the country is not. Those caught operating illegal sites face potential legal consequences, including fines, equipment confiscation, and possibly imprisonment, as evidenced by the ongoing investigations and questioning. The focus shifts towards compliance and understanding the specific regulations governing digital assets in Kuwait. The risks associated with operating illegally have significantly increased. Authorities are actively identifying and shutting down these sites, often tipped off by unusual power consumption patterns. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community If you are in Kuwait or involved in the regional crypto space, here are some key takeaways: Understand the Law: Be fully aware of Kuwait’s 2023 crypto mining ban and other regulations concerning digital assets. Ignorance is not a defense. Avoid Illegal Activities: Do not engage in cryptocurrency mining within Kuwait’s borders. The risks of being caught and facing severe penalties are high. Monitor Regulatory Updates: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is dynamic globally. Stay informed about any changes in Kuwait and neighboring countries. Consider Compliant Alternatives: If interested in crypto, explore legal avenues like trading on regulated exchanges (if available and permitted) or investing in crypto-related businesses outside of mining within the country. Assess Regional Differences: Regulations vary significantly from country to country. What is legal in one Gulf nation may be illegal in another. The ongoing crypto crackdown in Kuwait is a stark reminder that energy consumption and regulatory compliance are major factors influencing the legality of crypto mining worldwide. As more countries grapple with the energy demands of mining and seek greater control over digital assets, similar enforcement actions may become more common. Conclusion: A Clear Message from Kuwait Kuwait’s recent actions, questioning 116 individuals and launching numerous investigations, send a clear and unequivocal message: illegal crypto mining will not be tolerated. Driven by concerns over power grid strain and operating under a nationwide crypto mining ban , the government is actively working to dismantle unauthorized operations. This aggressive crypto crackdown highlights the significant challenges that energy-intensive digital activities face in regions prioritizing grid stability and regulatory control, especially as seasonal demands like summer heat intensify the pressure. For anyone involved or interested in the crypto space in Kuwait, compliance with the established laws is paramount to avoid severe consequences.

US District Judge John Koeltl handed down the ruling on Thursday in Manhattan, marking one of the most significant penalties to emerge from the wave of crypto collapses in 2022. Prosecutors Demanded 20 Years, Calling Mashinsky’s Actions Deliberate and Dishonest Mashinsky, 59, pleaded guilty in December to two counts of fraud. Prosecutors had urged the court to impose a 20-year sentence , calling him “unrepentant” and accusing him of downplaying his misconduct after entering a guilty plea. BREAKING: Celsius founder, Alex Mashinsky, sentenced to 12 years in prison pic.twitter.com/kwwvgvQHZh — Autism Capital (@AutismCapital) May 8, 2025 In contrast, his attorneys requested a one-year sentence, claiming he had accepted responsibility and that the company’s failure stemmed from wider market turmoil. Judge Koeltl rejected that argument and delivered a sentence that reflected the scale of the deception. Celsius Claimed to Disrupt Banks, but Met Its End in a Classic Bank Run Founded in 2017, Celsius positioned itself as a people-first alternative to traditional banks, offering unusually high yields on crypto deposits. Customers could earn double-digit returns by allowing Celsius to lend their assets to institutions. The business attracted billions in crypto deposits, but cracks emerged when the broader market began to falter in mid-2022. As crypto prices fell and a series of scandals rattled investor confidence, Celsius customers rushed to withdraw their funds. The firm was unable to meet the demand. In June 2022, it froze withdrawals and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month, revealing a massive hole in its finances. Celsius Used Investor Money to Prop Up Token and Pay Promised Returns Prosecutors accused Mashinsky of knowingly misleading customers about how safe and profitable Celsius really was. They said he directed employees to use customer deposits to pay the high yields the company had promised. At the same time, Celsius was quietly making risky, unsecured loans behind the scenes. In addition, Mashinsky misled investors about the company’s crypto reserves. He also falsely claimed he was not selling his personal CEL token holdings. According to prosecutors, Celsius manipulated the token’s price to maintain the illusion that the company was financially strong. Mashinsky ultimately admitted to lying about Celsius’s financial health to attract Bitcoin deposits and misleading CEL token investors about the token’s value and his personal stake. His sentencing follows the 25-year prison term handed to former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried , who is currently appealing his conviction.

44355718,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158739,1746761434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking: Wellgistics Health Announces XRP Treasury and Ripple Real-Time Settlement Initiative,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wellgistics-xrp-ripple-settlement/,"Prepare for a potentially game-changing move in the world of corporate finance and cryptocurrency! A significant announcement from a Nasdaq-listed company is poised to send ripples (pun intended) through both traditional markets and the crypto space. Wellgistics Health, a major player in pharmaceutical distribution and healthcare infrastructure, has revealed plans that could see them become the first publicly traded company to hold XRP as a treasury reserve asset. Why is Wellgistics Health Looking at XRP and Ripple? In a recent press release, Wellgistics Health outlined a bold new initiative. Their goal is twofold: first, to incorporate XRP into their corporate treasury holdings, and second, to leverage Ripple’s real-time settlement infrastructure for their operations. This isn’t just about dabbling in crypto; it’s a strategic exploration into how digital assets and blockchain technology can be integrated into the core financial operations of a large, established company. The potential implications are vast. If successful, Wellgistics Health would indeed make history as the first listed company to publicly announce holding XRP as a reserve asset. This move signals a growing interest among traditional businesses in exploring cryptocurrencies beyond speculative trading, viewing them instead as potential tools for treasury management and operational efficiency. What is Ripple Real-Time Settlement and How Could Wellgistics Use It? Beyond just holding XRP , Wellgistics Health’s initiative includes adopting Ripple’s real-time settlement infrastructure. Ripple’s technology, particularly its solutions like RippleNet, aims to facilitate faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments and settlements. For a company like Wellgistics Health, which likely deals with numerous suppliers, partners, and potentially international transactions, efficient settlement is crucial. Imagine the current process for international payments or even large domestic settlements. It can involve multiple intermediaries, take days to clear, and incur significant fees. Ripple’s technology, utilizing digital assets like XRP for liquidity (though their core RippleNet doesn’t *require* XRP for all transactions, it’s designed to leverage it for speed and cost efficiency via On-Demand Liquidity), could potentially streamline these processes dramatically. Wellgistics Health could see benefits such as: Increased Speed: Settlements could occur in seconds, rather than days. Reduced Costs: Lower transaction fees compared to traditional banking methods. Enhanced Transparency: Greater visibility into the payment flow. Improved Liquidity Management: Potentially easier access to funds globally. The press release suggests Wellgistics Health sees these potential efficiencies as key drivers for the initiative. Adopting real-time settlement could significantly impact their operational bottom line and improve relationships with partners by enabling faster payments. Funding the Initiative: The $50 Million ELOC To support this ambitious undertaking, Wellgistics Health plans to launch a $50 million equity line of credit (ELOC) program. An ELOC allows a company to borrow funds as needed, up to a certain limit, by issuing shares. This provides Wellgistics Health with flexible access to capital, which could be used for various purposes related to the initiative, such as: Acquiring the initial XRP holdings for the treasury. Investing in the necessary technology and infrastructure to integrate with Ripple’s network. Covering initial operational costs associated with the transition. Providing working capital flexibility during the implementation phase. The decision to use an ELOC indicates that Wellgistics Health is committed to funding this exploration without necessarily dipping into existing cash reserves heavily upfront. It allows them to scale their investment and integration efforts as the initiative progresses and demonstrates confidence from their financial partners. The Significance of Corporate Crypto Adoption by a Listed Company This move by Wellgistics Health is a significant data point in the broader trend of corporate crypto adoption . While many tech companies and financial firms have explored or adopted crypto in various ways, seeing a company from the healthcare and pharmaceutical distribution sector make such a move is noteworthy. It suggests that the potential use cases for digital assets and blockchain technology are expanding beyond the traditional crypto-native or tech industries. For corporate crypto adoption to truly go mainstream, companies in diverse sectors need to identify tangible benefits. Wellgistics Health’s focus on treasury management (holding XRP) and operational efficiency (using Ripple for settlement) highlights two key areas where traditional businesses can see value. Their success or challenges in this initiative will be closely watched by other companies considering similar moves. This development could also influence the perception of XRP and Ripple’s technology among institutional players. While Ripple has faced regulatory challenges regarding XRP’s status in the past, a successful integration by a Nasdaq-listed company for practical business use cases could bolster confidence and demonstrate the utility of the technology and the asset beyond speculative trading. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the announcement is exciting, it’s important to consider the potential challenges Wellgistics Health might face: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, including XRP , is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Wellgistics Health will need to navigate this complex environment carefully. Market Volatility: Holding XRP as a treasury asset exposes the company to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. This could impact their balance sheet value. Technical Integration: Integrating Ripple’s settlement infrastructure with existing legacy systems can be complex and require significant technical expertise and investment. Public Perception: As the first listed company to potentially hold XRP , Wellgistics Health may face scrutiny or questions from investors, analysts, and the public regarding the risks and benefits. The success of this initiative will depend on Wellgistics Health’s ability to effectively manage these challenges while realizing the potential benefits of speed, cost savings, and efficiency offered by real-time settlement and digital asset treasury. What This Means for the Future of Corporate Finance Wellgistics Health’s initiative, if successful, could serve as a blueprint for other companies considering corporate crypto adoption . It demonstrates a potential pathway for established businesses to leverage digital assets not just as investments, but as integral components of their financial and operational strategies. The focus on real-time settlement is particularly relevant for any business involved in frequent or large-scale transactions, domestically or internationally. We are likely to see more companies explore similar initiatives as the technology matures and regulatory clarity improves. The move by Wellgistics Health highlights the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset space, pointing towards a future where blockchain and cryptocurrencies play a more significant role in everyday business operations. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Wellgistics Health, XRP, and Corporate Crypto Wellgistics Health’s announcement regarding an XRP treasury and the adoption of Ripple’s real-time settlement infrastructure is a bold and potentially historic step. As a Nasdaq-listed company, their exploration into holding a major cryptocurrency like XRP as a reserve asset could pave the way for broader corporate crypto adoption across various industries. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of speed, cost, and efficiency offered by Ripple’s technology are clear drivers for this initiative, supported by a $50 million ELOC program. The coming months will be crucial in observing how Wellgistics Health navigates this new territory and whether their pioneering move inspires others to follow suit, further blurring the lines between traditional corporate finance and the innovative world of digital assets.

Coinbase Expands Global Reach With Deribit The acquisition, announced on Thursday, involves a substantial financial commitment, with $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase Class A common stock as part of the deal. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the year, a timeline that has already positively impacted Coinbase’s stock, with shares rising more than 5% toward the $206 mark following the announcement.

While Coinbase dominates the US market for cryptocurrency trading, it has historically held a smaller share in the global arena, where a significant portion of trading activity occurs on Binance. Acquisition Highlights Deribit has established itself as a powerhouse in the crypto derivatives space, facilitating over $1 trillion in trading volume last year and boasting approximately $30 billion in current open interest on its platform. “We’re excited to join forces with Coinbase to power a new era in global crypto derivatives,” said Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers in a statement. He highlighted that this acquisition will not only accelerate the growth of both companies but also provide traders with enhanced opportunities across various trading products, including spot, futures, perpetuals, and options, all under the Coinbase brand. Tusar noted that Deribit’s consistent track record of generating positive adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in the acquisition, suggesting that the combined entity will likely see increased profitability. “One of the things we liked most about this deal is that it’s not just a game changer for our international expansion plans — it immediately diversifies our revenue and enhances profitability,” he told CNBC.

Ethereum has gained more than 19% and altcoins have followed suit. XRP price is trading above the $2.30 level and adding to the bullish sentiment, the SEC has filed the settlement agreement letter. Bearish Trend Still in Place – For Now According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, on the larger 3-day chart, XRP is still technically showing signs of a bearish trend. This has been the case for months, and it is still seeing lower highs and lower lows — which is typical of a downtrend. While there have been small short-term price increases along the way, the bigger trend hasn’t flipped bullish yet. Market Conditions Could Change the Picture However, that could soon change. XRP is closely linked to the overall crypto market, especially top coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. If those continue to rise, XRP might finally break out of this downtrend as well. Key Resistance Level at $2.45 To confirm a real trend reversal, XRP would need to break above a key resistance level around $2.45. If we see a strong daily candle close above that level, followed by a higher low on the chart, it could signal the start of a new uptrend. All-Time Highs Possible If Breakout Happens If XRP confirms this bullish breakout, there’s a good chance it could start heading back toward its all-time highs. But until that happens, it’s important to expect resistance around $2.33 to $2.45. XRP Still Following Bitcoin’s Lead Like most altcoins, XRP tends to move in the same direction as Bitcoin.

44355851,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158740,1746761728,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Trump Crypto Post Linked to Lobbyist Removed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-post-lobbyist/,"The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency is always a hot topic, and a recent incident involving a Truth Social post allegedly from Donald Trump has ignited significant discussion. This particular post, which appeared to endorse specific altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA, has since been attributed not directly to the former president, but to a lobbying group. The fallout? The lobbyist reportedly responsible has been removed from their position linked to the White House. Understanding the Alleged Trump Crypto Post Reports from sources like Solid Intel on X detailed a Truth Social post that seemed to come from Donald Trump’s account. The post discussed the concept of a ‘Crypto Strategic Reserve’ and notably included a positive mention of XRP, SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) as potential candidates for inclusion. For many in the crypto community, seeing these specific assets highlighted in a post from a prominent political figure was surprising and generated immediate buzz. However, the nature of the post quickly came under scrutiny. The core of the controversy lies in the claim that this wasn’t a personal endorsement or statement directly drafted by Donald Trump himself. Instead, it is alleged that the content originated from a lobbying group working on behalf of clients within the cryptocurrency industry. This suggests an attempt to use a high-profile political platform to promote specific digital assets, raising questions about transparency and influence. Why would a lobbying group pursue such a strategy? Lobbying in politics is a common practice where groups represent specific interests to influence policy and public opinion. In the rapidly evolving crypto space, various companies and protocols employ lobbyists to advocate for favorable regulations, promote understanding of their technology, and sometimes, to simply increase visibility and perceived legitimacy. Targeting a platform like Truth Social, associated with a potential presidential candidate, could be seen as a highly effective, albeit potentially misleading, way to achieve these goals. The Role of the Crypto Lobbyist and Their Removal The narrative took a significant turn with the revelation that a specific crypto lobbyist was reportedly behind the content of the controversial Truth Social post. While the identity of the lobbyist and the specific lobbying group weren’t explicitly detailed in the initial report from Solid Intel, the implication is clear: a professional advocate for crypto interests drafted or influenced the message, which was then posted under the guise of coming directly from Donald Trump. Following the exposure of the alleged true authorship, the lobbyist in question was reportedly removed from their position or association with the White House. This swift action suggests that the incident was taken seriously within political circles, likely due to concerns about misrepresentation, the appearance of improper influence, or potentially violating protocols regarding political communications and endorsements. The removal of the lobbyist serves as a stark reminder of the ethical lines that can be blurred when political influence meets specific industry interests. It highlights the need for clear disclosure regarding the origin of political communications, especially when they touch upon financial assets or policy positions that could have significant market impact. Examining the Coins: XRP, SOL, and ADA The specific mention of XRP, SOL, and ADA in the alleged Trump crypto post is noteworthy. These are three distinct and prominent altcoins, each with its own ecosystem, technology, and regulatory considerations. Let’s briefly look at what makes them stand out: XRP: Associated with Ripple Labs, XRP is designed for fast and low-cost international payments. It has been at the center of a long-standing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its classification as a security. An endorsement, even indirect, from a political figure could be seen as potentially favorable, especially given its regulatory challenges. SOL (Solana): Solana is known for its high throughput and scalability, making it a popular platform for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi. It competes with Ethereum and other layer-1 blockchains. Its inclusion might reflect its growing prominence and adoption in the crypto space. ADA (Cardano): Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform known for its research-driven and peer-reviewed approach to development. It aims to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for dApps and smart contracts. Its focus on formal verification and sustainability appeals to a specific segment of the crypto community. For a lobbying group representing crypto clients, strategically naming these specific coins could serve multiple purposes: appealing to broad segments of the crypto investor base, highlighting assets with different use cases (payments, smart contracts, dApps), or perhaps representing the specific interests of their clients who hold or are involved with these particular projects. Regardless of the specific motivation, the explicit mention drew significant attention to XRP, SOL, and ADA in a political context. The Broader Implications of Political Influence in Crypto This incident underscores the increasing entanglement of cryptocurrency with traditional politics and lobbying efforts. As the crypto market grows and regulatory frameworks are debated globally, various stakeholders are actively seeking to influence policy decisions and public perception. Why is Crypto Lobbying Becoming More Prominent? Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear regulations in many jurisdictions creates a strong incentive for crypto companies to lobby for favorable rules that support innovation while providing clarity. Protecting Interests: Specific protocols, exchanges, and investment firms lobby to protect their business models and assets from potentially harmful legislation or enforcement actions. Promoting Adoption: Lobbying efforts can aim to educate policymakers and the public about the benefits of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, encouraging broader adoption. Defining Classification: A major focus is often on how different cryptocurrencies and activities are classified (e.g., as securities, commodities, or currency), which has significant legal and operational consequences. The alleged Trump crypto post incident highlights a potentially problematic aspect of this lobbying: the risk of using political platforms for what could be perceived as market manipulation or undisclosed promotion. While lobbying itself is a legal activity, the methods used and the transparency surrounding them are crucial. Challenges and Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community This event presents several challenges and offers valuable lessons for individuals involved in the cryptocurrency space: Challenges: Misinformation: Political endorsements, especially when their true origin is obscured, can easily spread misinformation and mislead investors. Market Manipulation Risk: Perceived endorsements from influential figures, regardless of authenticity, can potentially impact market prices, creating volatility based on potentially false premises. Trust Erosion: Incidents like this can erode trust in both political figures and the lobbying process, as well as cast a shadow over the crypto industry’s efforts to engage with policymakers. Regulatory Backlash: Aggressive or opaque lobbying tactics could potentially lead to stricter regulations rather than the desired favorable ones. Actionable Insights: Verify Sources: Always scrutinize the source of information, especially political statements about specific assets. Look for official announcements and reputable news outlets rather than relying solely on social media posts. Understand Lobbying: Educate yourself on how lobbying works and which groups represent different interests in the crypto space. Websites like OpenSecrets.org track lobbying expenditures and activities. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on perceived endorsements or social media hype. Conduct thorough research into the technology, use case, team, and fundamentals of any cryptocurrency. Advocate for Transparency: Support initiatives and regulations that call for greater transparency in political lobbying and campaign finance, particularly concerning emerging industries like crypto. The incident serves as a case study in the complexities arising as crypto becomes mainstream enough to attract significant lobbying attention. It’s a reminder that political endorsements, real or alleged, should be viewed with caution and not as financial advice. The Future of Crypto and Political Influence As the 2024 election cycle progresses, the interaction between political campaigns, potential administrations, and the crypto industry is expected to intensify. Candidates are increasingly being asked about their stance on digital assets, and lobbying efforts will likely ramp up. This recent event involving the alleged Trump crypto post and the subsequent removal of a crypto lobbyist highlights the potential pitfalls. While the crypto industry seeks to educate policymakers and advocate for supportive regulatory environments, the methods employed must be transparent and ethical to build long-term trust and credibility. The focus keywords – Trump crypto post, XRP endorsement, SOL endorsement, ADA endorsement, and crypto lobbyist – are central to this evolving narrative. Understanding how political influence attempts intersect with specific assets like XRP, SOL, and ADA is crucial for navigating the market and the political landscape surrounding it. Moving forward, expect more headlines involving politicians, crypto, and lobbying. The industry’s maturity will be partly judged by its ability to engage constructively and transparently with the political process. Compelling Summary A recent Truth Social post, appearing to be from Donald Trump and endorsing XRP, SOL, and ADA for a ‘Crypto Strategic Reserve,’ has caused a stir. It was quickly alleged that the post’s content originated not from Trump directly, but from a lobbying group representing crypto clients. The lobbyist reportedly linked to the incident has since been removed from their position connected to the White House. This event starkly illustrates the increasing, and sometimes controversial, intersection of political influence and the cryptocurrency market. It serves as a critical reminder for the crypto community to verify sources, understand the role of lobbying, and conduct independent research before making investment decisions based on political rhetoric or perceived endorsements.

But now, with the full implementation of the EU’s MiCA (Market in Crypto Assets) legislation and speculation about what Trump’s supposed crypto-friendly regulatory outline may look like, there is an air of optimism across the industry. Despite the positivity echoing from the US, turbulent prices, economic obstacles and crypto’s natural volatility counterweight any favorable developments, leaving the industry in a familiar polarized state. Crypto exchanges – as the backbone of the entire ecosystem, providing access to thousands of different types of tokens – face the challenge of navigating a patchwork of vague or non-existent legal statuses. How they handle this unpredictable period will have major implications for the entire industry. Is enough being done Whether centralized or decentralized, crypto exchanges serve as a gateway to the Web 3.0 economy – from facilitating market activity and ensuring liquidity to executing token launches and offering fiat on/off-ramps, exchanges serve as an irreplaceable infrastructure piece. Because exchanges are the primary mechanism granting access to assets with less-than-clear regulatory statuses, they bear the brunt of regulatory scrutiny. As such, exchanges – particularly CEXs (centralized exchanges) – have been consistently in the crosshairs of national regulators, especially in the US, EU and UK. Despite a promising outlook resonating from the US, both exchanges must take a more proactive approach toward regulatory compliance. By and large, the industry has gradually embraced some standard regulatory procedures such as KYC (know your customer). This is a promising development, but it likely won’t be enough to appease regulators across all markets, especially as some explore how to reel in DeFi. While the industry has been increasingly open to the more complex and strenuous AML (anti-money laundering) enforcement, this too is often overlooked. Proper AML enforcement, in addition to KYC, will soon be something exchanges can’t ignore. When operating within a given jurisdiction, bypassing one or both of these measures is no longer acceptable. Currently, MiCA doesn’t explicitly regulate full DEXs (decentralized exchanges). However, DEXs with a degree of centralization can be targeted under MiCA, and the European Commission is investigating how to apply existing financial laws to DeFi protocols, including those governed by DAOS (decentralized autonomous organizations). Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape represents a thorn in the side of most crypto organizations, but tackling these challenges head-on will provide much-needed stability. All types of crypto exchanges must understand that the initial challenge of compliance will, in time, bear fruit and that they should view it as a down payment on the future. Staying ahead of the regulatory curve CEXs would benefit from actively engaging with regional regulators to demonstrate their willingness to comply with local laws. This would also help them stay in the loop as new rules emerge, affording them valuable time to make any necessary adjustments. In addition to ensuring the robustness of KYC and AML protocols, both centralized and decentralized exchanges would be remiss not to conduct voluntary financial auditing to enhance trust. DEXs would be wise to use reputable third-party services to audit their smart contracts and security frameworks to ensure they are properly protected against increasingly sophisticated threats. Despite DEXs operating in a legal gray area, implementing on-chain compliance tools and forming self-regulatory coalitions to establish unofficial standards will reduce any potential obstacles if governments take tough stands. This can be done without undermining decentralization by leveraging cryptographic solutions, and for DAO-operated DEXs, this could be done through hybrid models that embed automated compliance decisions in smart contracts. In response to crypto’s shifting regulatory environment, exchanges that embrace technological innovations to assist with compliance procedures position themselves for long-term sustainability. Rapid advances in AI have led to numerous solutions that can help resource-strapped projects and larger blockchain organizations make the necessary regulatory preparations. Powerful AI tools can be used to monitor transactions and detect suspicious activities in real time, helping to drastically reduce threats that target exchanges and associated wallets. While the industry has seen a decline in scams and hacks, the recent massive ByBit hack is a cruel reminder of why regulatory processes can’t be ignored. Combatting fraud and crimes is paramount to the industry’s sustainability, and anticipating future developments requires prioritizing compliance prep. Without proper readiness for the unpredictability factor of regulatory developments across the globe, crypto exchanges will waste the industry’s recent momentum, ultimately disrupting its potential. To ensure exchanges maintain their crucial role as Web 3.0 gatekeepers, they must acknowledge that regulatory uncertainty will remain for now. Amid this speculation and uncertainty, risks should be minimized, and flexibility and adaptability should be maximized to ensure exchanges are ready for any potential scenario. By staying on top of compliance trends, fostering transparency and implementing strategic legal frameworks, crypto exchanges won’t only remain a pivotal Web 3.0 component but also be in a position to facilitate innovation.

ADA is consolidating just under $0.74, with analysts closely watching for a breakout toward $1. Meanwhile, SOL is pushing against resistance around $153–$155, with forecasts suggesting a potential move to $175 or even $190 if momentum holds. But as both assets navigate these key levels, some holders are already shifting their attention to MAGACOINFINANCE —a fast-moving altcoin project that many now see as a breakout candidate this cycle. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT For ADA, the buzz around its upcoming “Ouroboros Leios” upgrade and ETF speculation has brought renewed optimism. Solana continues to attract institutional interest, especially after Canada approved a spot SOL ETF. Both ecosystems are strong. Yet, for short-term traders and early adopters, upside potential is what drives decisions , and that’s where MAGACOINFINANCE enters the picture. This politically themed altcoin is rapidly gaining traction, and not just because of its branding. The token sale is progressing quickly , with each stage closing faster than the last. This steady buyer demand signals serious momentum. Investors are taking positions before the broader market catches on, knowing that early token sale entries historically lead to larger gains once the project lists. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Unlike ADA and SOL, which are testing resistance levels with limited near-term movement, MAGACOINFINANCE is in acceleration mode . Its token sale structure rewards early entry, and traders who’ve already seen this cycle’s narrative forming—memes, politics, and culture—are moving in early. In short, while Cardano and Solana remain strong long-term projects, a growing number of traders believe MAGACOINFINANCE is the token with breakout energy in May 2025 .

I am upgrading the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF to a buy due to strong technicals, bullish momentum, and a supportive macro backdrop. BITB offers low-cost exposure to Bitcoin, with significant inflows and strong performance metrics, making it an attractive investment for diversification. Bitcoin's seasonal trends and technical indicators suggest further upside, with key support at $75,000 and potential to surpass $110,000. After three long months, Bitcoin finally recaptured the $100,000 level on news that the US and UK reached a trade deal. It was a general risk-on sentiment that helped lift the world’s biggest cryptocurrency to multi-month highs, a more than 30% rally from its April lows. What I have found particularly interesting is that bitcoin has traded, at times, like a defensive asset. It and gold have traded places as the major macro asset to own amid uncertainty about where the global economy is headed. For now, though, bitcoin may be turning back to its risk-on status as volatility has subsided in equities. I was cautious about the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) last July . Technicals were concerning, in my view, back then, and the fund went on to tag key support and a long-term buy point that I had outlined on the chart. With shares up 78% since then (and much of that gain coming just in the last handful of weeks), I am upgrading BITB to a buy based on sanguine momentum factors and a macro backdrop that could support bitcoin writ large. Bitcoin Rallies Through $100,000, a Three-Month High TradingView According to the issuer , BITB allows investors to gain convenient, low-cost exposure to bitcoin through a professionally managed ETF. This may avoid the cost, complexity, and custody concerns of owning Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin has distinct return patterns and historically low correlations to traditional stocks and bonds. As a result, Bitcoin can offer long-term diversification and risk management benefits to an overall investment portfolio. BIT is a medium-sized ETF, now with $3.7 billion in assets under management as of May 7, 2025. That’s up significantly from just $2.3 billion at the start of the second half of last year. Indeed, money has poured into crypto lately. BofA points out that as of late April, flows have climbed markedly. Crypto Inflows Coming Back BofA Global Research BITB features a low annual expense ratio of 20 basis points and, of course, does not pay a dividend . Its share-price momentum is very strong right now, and I think that will persist. I’ll outline later that if we see the all-time high eclipsed on both BITB and bitcoin, then a major leg higher could ensue. BITB is volatile , as prospective investors probably would surmise, as a result of the large daily swings in what is generally among the more stable tokens (sans stablecoins). BITB scores well with its ETF liquidity grade , according to Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system—average daily volume is above 1.3 million shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is tight at just four basis points, per Bitwise. Mentioned previously, bitcoin and gold are doing a bit of a dance right now. Bitcoin has clearly gained the lead step as it notches multi-month highs and gold settles in below $3,500 per ounce. So, I expect BITB’s Sharpe Ratio to improve as the second quarter progresses. Gold Had A Huge Rally, But Bitcoin With Emerging Relative Strength Lately Jurien Timmer, Fidelity Seasonally, there’s reason to be bullish over the months ahead, too. According to price data going back to 2010, the May through July stretch has historically been very strong. While calendar trends should not be taken in isolation, it’s a sanguine factor to weigh. Bitcoin: Bullish Seasonal Trends Through July Barchart The Technical Take Since Bitcoin does not produce cash flow and there are no financial statements to parse through, the chart should be analyzed closely. Notice in the graph below that Bitcoin itself held key long-term support with precision in early April. The $75,000 level just about matched the March 2024 peak—a time that marked the start of a long consolidation. After an upside breakout following President Trump’s win last November, a fast rally to near $110,000 ensued. But take a look at where support initially emerged—in the low $90k zone. Once it was breached, the bears took control, bringing bitcoin to the early 2024 mark. The token also dropped below its long-term 200-day moving average and the 50dma. The key, however, was that the 200dma remained trending higher, suggesting that the long-term trend was not damaged. Today, with a new high in the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart, we find that the price thrust has confirmed with momentum, which I like to see. It’s also consistent that a bullish RSI divergence occurred at the April nadir, helping to cement a bottom. A key risk is that there remains a high amount of bitcoin traded between $100,000 and $110,000—I boxed the volume increase around the turn of the year, and that could be bearish supply. Thus, the bulls still have some work cut out for them. Bitcoin: $110,000 All-Time High In View, $74,000 Long-Term Support, Bullish RSI Confirmation, Rising 200dma Stockcharts.com Looking closer in on BITB, a downtrend resistance line was broken in April. Then, a bull flag pattern emerged—the subsequent breakout just this week creates a measured move upside price objective to about $63 based on the height of the pole and depth of the flag. Near-term support is between $50 and $51. BITB: Targeting $63 As Momentum Builds, $50 Support Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on BITB.

This significant event, centered around the status of XRP, brings a degree of closure to a case that has cast a long shadow over the industry. What Does the SEC Ripple Settlement Entail? After years of intense legal sparring, the SEC and Ripple have reportedly reached a settlement agreement. According to James K. Filan, a former federal prosecutor who has closely followed the case, the proposed settlement has been submitted to the court for approval. This development marks a pivotal moment, signaling an end to the uncertainty that has surrounded Ripple and XRP. Key terms of the reported settlement include: A significant reduction in Ripple’s fine. The initial figure discussed was around $125 million, but the settlement reportedly brings this down to $50 million. Both the SEC and Ripple agree to withdraw their respective appeals. This means neither party will challenge previous court rulings related to the case. The SEC is expected to request the court to lift any remaining sales restrictions on Ripple, particularly concerning institutional sales of XRP. This agreement, if approved by the court, effectively concludes the formal legal dispute between the two entities. A Look Back at the Lengthy XRP Lawsuit Update To fully appreciate the significance of this settlement, it’s important to remember the history of the XRP lawsuit update . Filed in December 2020, the SEC’s complaint alleged that Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. Ripple maintained that XRP is not a security. The case proceeded for years, involving extensive discovery, expert testimony, and various court filings. A crucial turning point came in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres issued a summary judgment ruling that provided partial clarity: Institutional Sales: The court found that Ripple’s direct sales of XRP to institutional investors constituted unregistered securities offerings. Programmatic Sales: The court ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP on public exchanges did not constitute securities offerings because buyers typically did not know they were buying directly from Ripple. Other Distributions: Distributions to developers and charities were also deemed not to be securities offerings. While hailed as a partial victory for Ripple and the broader crypto industry, the ruling left some questions open and led to both parties considering appeals. The settlement now addresses these remaining issues and the potential for further protracted litigation. The Impact of the Reduced Ripple Fine Reduction The reported Ripple fine reduction from a potentially higher figure (initially, the SEC had sought closer to $2 billion in penalties) to $50 million is a major win for Ripple financially. While $50 million is still a substantial sum, it is significantly less than what the company might have faced if the case had gone to trial or if appeals had resulted in a less favorable outcome. This reduced financial burden allows Ripple to allocate more resources towards its business operations, expansion plans, and the development of the XRP Ledger ecosystem, rather than being tied up in legal costs and potential penalties. What’s Next for XRP News and the Market? The conclusion of the lawsuit is undoubtedly the biggest piece of XRP news in years. For XRP holders and enthusiasts, it removes a major cloud of regulatory uncertainty that has suppressed the asset’s price and adoption in certain markets, particularly in the United States. Potential implications include: Exchange Re-listings: While many exchanges relisted XRP after the 2023 ruling on programmatic sales, some platforms might now feel more comfortable fully supporting XRP services, including potentially institutional trading products, assuming the sales ban is lifted. Increased Adoption: Clarity on XRP’s regulatory status in the U.S. could encourage financial institutions and businesses to utilize Ripple’s ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) service and the XRP Ledger for payments and other use cases. Market Sentiment: The settlement is likely to be viewed positively by the market, potentially leading to increased investor confidence in XRP. However, it’s crucial to remember that regulatory environments vary globally, and the U.S. settlement doesn’t dictate the stance of regulators in other countries. Also, the broader crypto market sentiment and macroeconomic factors will continue to influence XRP’s price performance. Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation While specific to Ripple and XRP, this settlement holds significant implications for the broader landscape of crypto regulation . The case was seen as a bellwether for how the SEC might approach other cryptocurrencies and their issuers. Key takeaways for the industry include: Judicial Scrutiny: The court’s distinction between different types of XRP sales (institutional vs. programmatic) highlights that courts may take a nuanced approach to applying existing securities laws to novel digital asset structures. This challenges the SEC’s broad assertion that many tokens are inherently securities. Settlement Precedent: While not a binding legal precedent like a court ruling, a settlement between a major crypto company and the SEC can influence future negotiations and enforcement actions. It provides a potential framework for resolving similar disputes, possibly encouraging other projects under SEC scrutiny to seek settlements. Calls for Legislation: The protracted nature and complexity of the SEC vs. Ripple case underscore the need for clearer legislative frameworks for digital assets in the U.S., rather than relying solely on enforcement actions using decades-old laws. This settlement provides some level of clarity, but the path forward for crypto regulation in the U.S. remains subject to potential new legislation and future court cases involving other entities. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Ripple and XRP The reported settlement between the SEC and Ripple marks the end of a nearly four-year legal saga that has been closely watched by the entire cryptocurrency industry. The agreement, involving a significantly reduced fine for Ripple and the withdrawal of appeals, offers a path forward for the company and brings much-needed regulatory clarity for XRP in the United States market. While the full impact will unfold over time, this development is undeniably a major milestone, potentially paving the way for renewed focus on innovation and adoption within the Ripple ecosystem and influencing the broader conversation around crypto regulation globally.

The bill, which had bipartisan support, was critical in giving the U.S. a strong foothold in digital asset regulation. In a vote on Thursday, only 49 senators voted to advance the bill to a full vote, falling short of the 60 votes needed to end debate on the bill formally. Notably, two Republican senators – Senator Josh Hawley and Senator Rand Paul – voted alongside Democrats against moving forward with the bill. Democrats, who had once supported the GENIUS Act , withdrew their support after media reports connected President Donald Trump to a new cryptocurrency project. A company believed to be linked to Trump’s family, World Liberty Financial, had introduced its stablecoin two months earlier, USD1, and netted a $2 billion investment from the United Arab Emirates. This raised red flags. Democrats charged that Trump was shaping public policy to his financial benefit. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading voice on the Senate Banking Committee, said the GENIUS Act — which was approved last week — failed to have serious safeguards to guard against money laundering, foreign interference, and conflicts of interest. She believes the bill would clear the way for what she called “ crypto corruption ” and that it could be used to hide corrupt financial practices in the name of innovation. Ten Democratic senators previously in support of the bill switched their votes. They called for more stringent anti-money laundering rules and national security protections. They cast their votes against moving the bill forward when those changes could not be promised to them. Republicans blame democrats for derailing stablecoin bill Republicans were quick to seize on the Democrats’ reversal. Senator Tim Scott, a senior member of the Banking Committee, said Democrats were allowing their animus toward President Trump to get in the way of making progress. He called it “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and said Democrats would go so far as to damage the US’s digital future to prevent Trump from scoring what they imagined was a win. The pro-crypto Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis said she was “ deeply disappointed “ by the outcome. She said it had been a significant bipartisan bill that was thoughtfully designed to regulate stablecoins, protect consumers, and help the US remain competitive. In an X post, Senator Bill Hagerty, who introduced the bill, stated that Democrats just unilaterally ceded American leadership capability in the digital asset industry to the CCP because they fear the far-left radicals of their party. Congress stalls progress on stablecoin framework Senate majority leader John Thune said he would offer a motion to reconsider the bill next week. That means the GENIUS Act could come up for another debate. But it’s unclear whether the current political climate will allow a second round to survive. The bill had initially been slated for a final vote by May 26. It would have been the first significant US cryptocurrency regulation if passed — a milestone for the industry. Now, the entire process may have to start over. The bill may return to the committee level. At this point, lawmakers would likely try reintroducing trust and a new balance. Another high-profile crypto proposal was recently derailed by a powerful Democrat, Representative Maxine Waters, who described the plan as “Trump’s corruption in disguise.” It’s a turning point for US crypto policy. Crypto regulation became a political battleground during the 2024 presidential race. The vote’s aftermath suggests digital asset legislation is also almost certainly contentious, with deep lines drawn and more than a little political math set to be done. Tensions on Capitol Hill over President Donald Trump’s various cryptocurrency ventures escalated on Tuesday and threatened to derail the digital asset sector’s hope of legislation by the end of this year as a top Democratic lawmaker stalled efforts to debate a bill. Although Congress had appeared likely earlier this year to pass legislation governing digital assets for the first time, Democrats have grown increasingly frustrated as Republican Trump and his family members have promoted their personal crypto projects.

44356398,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158796,1746762632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Kimchi Premium Neutral: Unlocking Insights for South Korea Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kimchi-premium-south-korea/,"Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever heard of the Kimchi Premium ? It’s a fascinating quirk of the crypto world, particularly relevant to the South Korea crypto market . Essentially, it measures the difference in cryptocurrency prices, most notably Bitcoin, between exchanges in South Korea and those elsewhere in the world. For a long time, this premium was a hot topic, often indicating strong local demand or regulatory hurdles. But right now, the buzz is about its current state: neutral. That’s right. According to recent checks comparing the Bitcoin price Korea offers on a leading local exchange like Upbit with global platforms such as Binance, the prices are currently matching, sitting around $101,719. This neutrality is noteworthy because the Kimchi Premium has historically fluctuated significantly, sometimes soaring to double-digit percentages. What Exactly is the Kimchi Premium ? Let’s break it down. The Kimchi Premium is the phenomenon where the price of a cryptocurrency, typically Bitcoin (BTC), is higher on South Korean exchanges compared to international exchanges. The name comes from ‘Kimchi’, a staple of Korean cuisine. This premium arises due to several factors, primarily driven by the unique dynamics of the South Korea crypto market . Historically, South Korea has seen immense retail investor interest in cryptocurrencies. Combined with strict capital controls and regulations that make it difficult and costly to move funds in and out of the country, this often leads to a supply-demand imbalance within the Korean market, pushing prices higher locally. Think of it like this: high demand domestically, coupled with barriers to easily importing crypto from cheaper international markets, creates a localized price bubble. When the price on Korean exchanges is significantly higher than on global ones, we say the Kimchi Premium is positive. If the price is lower, it’s a negative premium (or ‘Kimchi Discount’), though this is less common and usually short-lived. How the South Korea Crypto Market Creates Price Differences The unique environment of the South Korea crypto market is the primary driver behind the Kimchi Premium. Several factors contribute to this: High Retail Adoption: South Korea has one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency adoption per capita globally. This strong retail interest translates into significant buying pressure on local exchanges. Capital Controls: South Korea has regulations in place to manage the flow of currency across its borders. These controls make it challenging and expensive for individuals and institutions to easily transfer large sums of Korean Won (KRW) to foreign exchanges or foreign currencies into Korean exchanges. Regulatory Landscape: While the government has at times expressed caution regarding crypto, the legal framework requires exchanges to adhere to strict KYC/AML rules and work with local banks. This creates a somewhat isolated market ecosystem. Exchange Infrastructure: Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb dominate local trading volume, often facilitating KRW-denominated trading pairs. This local liquidity pool can sometimes become disconnected from global USD or USDT-denominated markets. These factors combined can lead to situations where local supply struggles to keep up with local demand at global price levels, forcing the Bitcoin price Korea sees upwards relative to international benchmarks. Understanding the Bitcoin Price in Korea vs. Global Rates Comparing the Bitcoin price in Korea to global rates is how the Kimchi Premium is calculated. It’s a simple percentage difference: ((Price on Korean Exchange - Price on Global Exchange) / Price on Global Exchange) * 100% For example, if Bitcoin is $105,000 on Upbit and $100,000 on Binance, the premium is (($105,000 – $100,000) / $100,000) * 100% = 5%. When the prices are both $101,719, as reported, the calculation is (($101,719 – $101,719) / $101,719) * 100% = 0%, indicating a neutral premium. While the concept is simple, calculating the premium accurately requires comparing prices at the exact same moment across reliable exchanges and considering exchange rates if converting between currencies. The current neutrality makes this comparison straightforward. The Appeal and Risks of Crypto Arbitrage The existence of the Kimchi Premium historically presented a significant opportunity for crypto arbitrage . Arbitrage is the practice of simultaneously buying an asset in one market where the price is lower and selling it in another market where the price is higher, pocketing the difference as profit. When the Kimchi Premium was high, traders could theoretically buy Bitcoin on a global exchange like Binance, transfer it to a Korean exchange like Upbit, and sell it for Korean Won at a higher price. They would then need to convert the KRW back to a foreign currency (like USD) and transfer it out of Korea to repeat the process. However, this is where the challenges and risks come in: Execution Risk: Prices can change rapidly. By the time you transfer assets between exchanges (which can take time), the premium might shrink or disappear. Transfer Fees: Moving crypto and fiat currency incurs fees, eating into potential profits. Capital Controls & Regulations: As mentioned, getting large amounts of fiat in and out of South Korea is difficult and subject to strict regulations and reporting requirements, making large-scale arbitrage complex and potentially illegal if not done correctly. Liquidity Risk: Large arbitrage trades might impact the price on the exchanges themselves, reducing the premium before the trade is fully executed. Exchange Risks: Relying on multiple exchanges means being exposed to potential technical issues, withdrawal delays, or even exchange failures. While the potential profits from crypto arbitrage during periods of high premium were enticing, the practical difficulties and risks involved were substantial, often limiting this activity to well-capitalized and sophisticated players who could navigate the regulatory and logistical hurdles. Comparing Prices: Upbit vs Binance The report specifically highlights the comparison between Upbit vs Binance , two giants in the crypto exchange world. Upbit is one of the largest and most dominant exchanges in South Korea, facilitating the bulk of KRW-denominated trading. Binance is the world’s largest global exchange by trading volume, offering a vast array of trading pairs, including those denominated in USD, USDT, and other major currencies. The fact that the Bitcoin price Korea sees on Upbit is currently matching the price on Binance indicates a significant convergence. This suggests that the factors causing a divergence – primarily excess local demand and capital controls – are either less impactful at this moment or are being counterbalanced by other market forces. Historically, the price chart comparing Upbit vs Binance for Bitcoin would often show a noticeable gap during premium spikes. The current state reflects a rare period of equilibrium between these two major platforms. Why is the Kimchi Premium Currently Neutral? The neutrality of the Kimchi Premium isn’t necessarily a sign of zero activity in the South Korea crypto market , but rather a balance of forces. Several factors could contribute to this equilibrium: Reduced Retail Hype: Market cycles play a big role. During periods of intense bull runs, retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in South Korea can be exceptionally strong, driving the premium up. A period of consolidation or bearish sentiment globally might dampen this specific local buying pressure. Increased Market Efficiency: While capital controls exist, the market may have found ways to become slightly more efficient, perhaps through limited legitimate channels for fund transfers or reduced volume of attempted arbitrage trades that could otherwise push the premium. Global Market Influence: Strong directional moves in the global market can sometimes overpower local dynamics, keeping prices more aligned. Regulatory Clarity/Uncertainty: Changes or uncertainty in local regulations can also impact trading behavior and the willingness of participants to engage in activities that rely on price differences. Pinpointing a single cause is difficult, but it’s likely a combination of these macroeconomic and market-specific factors that have led to the current state where the Bitcoin price in Korea is in line with global rates. Implications of a Neutral Premium A neutral Kimchi Premium has several implications for market participants: Limited Arbitrage Opportunities: The most obvious implication is the lack of profitable crypto arbitrage between South Korea and global markets based purely on the price difference. Indicator of Balanced Sentiment: It could suggest that local Korean market sentiment is currently in line with global sentiment, rather than being excessively bullish or bearish in isolation. Reduced Regulatory Scrutiny (Potentially): High premiums have sometimes drawn negative attention from regulators concerned about speculative bubbles or illicit capital flows. A neutral premium is less likely to be a regulatory flashpoint. Focus Shifts: Traders and investors in the South Korea crypto market may shift their focus away from premium-based strategies towards other forms of trading and analysis. While a high premium signals intense local activity and potential arbitrage, a neutral premium suggests a period of relative calm or integration with global price discovery. Navigating Challenges and Risks Even when the premium is neutral, participating in the South Korea crypto market or attempting cross-border activities involves risks. Regulatory changes can happen quickly. Capital controls remain a significant hurdle for moving large sums. Market volatility means prices can diverge again rapidly, turning a neutral situation into one with a premium or discount before transactions settle. Understanding these persistent challenges is crucial. Actionable Insights for Traders What does the neutral Kimchi Premium mean for you? If you were hoping for easy crypto arbitrage profits, the opportunity isn’t currently there. Instead, focus on fundamental and technical analysis of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For those trading within the South Korea crypto market , monitor local news and regulatory developments closely, as these can quickly influence the premium. Keep an eye on the price difference between Upbit vs Binance ; any significant divergence could signal changing market dynamics. Conclusion The Kimchi Premium is a fascinating indicator of the unique forces at play in the South Korea crypto market . Its current neutral state, with the Bitcoin price Korea offers on Upbit matching global rates on Binance, signifies a period of equilibrium. While this eliminates immediate crypto arbitrage opportunities, it offers valuable insight into market sentiment and the current balance between local demand, capital controls, and global price action. Monitoring this premium remains essential for understanding the nuances of one of the world’s most active crypto trading nations.

Forget 3-day wire transfers and piles of paperwork. Wellgistics is betting big that Ripple’s XRP will be the backbone of next-gen medical finance. Goodbye Slow Payments: With XRP Healthcare has long been criticized for its slow payments, high fees, and outdated systems. For pharmacies, suppliers, and patients, delayed payments and confusing bills can make it harder to get the care they need. But Wellgistics is hoping to change that, as they’ve locked in a $50 million credit facility to upgrade their infrastructure By integrating XRP and Ripple’s blockchain network, the company aims to speed up vendor payments, automate pharmacy reimbursements, and improve financial access across its supply chain. Instead of waiting days for payments to clear, Wellgistics will use XRP to send money in just 3 seconds. That means less delay, fewer mistakes, and a much smoother process. Why Wellgistics Picked XRP Only? XRP was picked for a reason. Unlike traditional bank wires that take 1- 3 days and charge high fees in between $10 – $30, XRP can settle in seconds at a fraction of a $0.0002. That kind of speed and cost efficiency could be a game-changer in medical logistics, where every delay affects lives. But it’s not just about speed & efficiency. By using blockchain, every payment can be tracked. This brings more clarity and trust to a system that’s often full of confusion. Wellgistics is not just upgrading tech—it’s building a smarter, faster way to move money in healthcare. CEO’s Vision: Outrun the Old System According to Wellgistics CEO Brian Norton, the healthcare industry doesn’t need more paperwork or bigger buildings. He says it best, the winners in healthcare won’t be the biggest, they’ll be the fastest. A healthcare world that runs on clean data, instant liquidity, and blockchain-powered rails. With XRP as the backbone, Wellgistics is laying the foundation for a faster, more transparent healthcare ecosystem, one where money moves as quickly as the medicine it supports.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 03:51:06

44356577,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158798,1746762924,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,ChatGPT GitHub Connector Unveiled: Powerful AI Code Analysis Arrives,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-github-connector-analysis/,"In the rapidly evolving world of AI, where tools are becoming increasingly specialized and powerful, a significant development has just landed that’s set to change how developers interact with code. OpenAI has introduced a groundbreaking feature, the ChatGPT GitHub connector, integrating its AI-powered deep research capabilities directly with code repositories. What is the OpenAI Connector for GitHub? OpenAI is rolling out the first “connector” for its ChatGPT deep research feature, and it’s specifically designed for GitHub. This integration allows ChatGPT to access and analyze codebases and associated documentation hosted on GitHub. Think of it as giving ChatGPT the ability to “read” and understand the intricacies of your code repository. The deep research tool itself is designed to compile comprehensive reports by searching across various sources. Adding the GitHub connector significantly expands its utility, particularly for technical users. It moves beyond just analyzing web content to understanding complex code structures and engineering documents. Accessing the Deep Research Tool with GitHub This new functionality is being rolled out progressively. Initially, the deep research tool with the GitHub connector is available in beta for users on ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team plans. Support for Enterprise and Edu tiers is planned to follow soon. This tiered rollout suggests OpenAI is prioritizing its most engaged user bases for this powerful new capability. For developers already leveraging ChatGPT for various tasks, this direct link to their code workflow represents a substantial efficiency gain. Unlocking AI Code Analysis The primary benefit of the GitHub connector is enabling sophisticated AI code analysis . Instead of manually sifting through large codebases or documentation, developers can now ask ChatGPT direct questions. The AI can then process the relevant GitHub content to provide answers. Specific use cases highlighted by OpenAI include: Breaking down product specifications into technical tasks and dependencies. Summarizing complex code structures and identifying common patterns. Explaining how to implement new APIs using real code examples found within the repository. This capability has the potential to drastically reduce the time spent understanding unfamiliar code or planning new features within an existing project. Why ChatGPT for Developers? OpenAI has long viewed programming and development as a key area for its AI models. The introduction of the ChatGPT for developers connector for GitHub reinforces this focus. By making ChatGPT a more integral part of the development workflow, OpenAI aims to make developers more productive. This isn’t the only recent move in this direction. OpenAI also recently launched Codex CLI, an open-source coding tool for terminals, and upgraded the ChatGPT desktop app to handle code analysis in popular developer applications. The reported $3 billion agreement to acquire AI coding assistant Windsurf further underscores OpenAI’s commitment to this space. Addressing Risks and Ensuring Security As with any AI model, the risk of hallucination (confidently making up incorrect information) exists with the deep research tool. OpenAI is positioning the GitHub connector as a time-saving assistant, not a replacement for human expertise and code review. Security is also a critical consideration. OpenAI states that ChatGPT will respect an organization’s existing GitHub permissions. Users will only be able to see and query content they are already authorized to access on GitHub. Codebases must also be explicitly shared with ChatGPT for the connector to function. Broader Context: Integrations and Fine-Tuning The move to add connectors like the GitHub one reflects a broader trend among AI companies to integrate their models with external platforms and services. Anthropic’s recent Integrations feature for Claude is another example. In other recent OpenAI news, the company also announced expanded fine-tuning options. Developers can now fine-tune the o4-mini model using reinforcement fine-tuning and the GPT-4.1 nano model. This allows for greater customization of models for specific applications, although some options, like o4-mini fine-tuning, are gated behind organizational verification processes implemented to prevent abuse. Conclusion: A Powerful Step for AI and Development The launch of the ChatGPT GitHub connector is a significant step forward in making AI tools more directly applicable to complex technical tasks like code analysis and understanding. By bridging the gap between conversational AI and code repositories, OpenAI is providing developers with a powerful new way to research, understand, and interact with their projects. While not without risks like hallucination, the potential for time savings and increased productivity makes this a compelling addition to the developer toolkit. As AI integrations continue to grow, expect more seamless workflows between AI models and the platforms developers use every day.

Federal Judge David Novak sentenced Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa to 30 years and four months in prison on May 7 for sending over $185,000 to the Islamic State, the Department of Justice said on May 8. Prosecutors said that from around October 2019 until October 2022, the 35-year-old Chhipa collected and sent money to female Islamic State members in Syria, which helped them escape prison camps and funded fighting. The Justice Department said Chhipa would raise funds for the United Nations-designated terror organization through social media — receiving money online, or traveling hundreds of miles to accept donations in person. He’d convert the money into crypto and send it to Turkey for it to be smuggled to Islamic State members across the border in Syria, prosecutors said. A federal jury convicted Chhipa in December , finding him guilty on a charge of conspiracy to provide support to a terrorist organization and four charges of providing and attempting to provide support to a terrorist organization.

According to a motion for detention filed in August, FBI agents searched Chhipa’s house on Aug. 2, 2019, and that night Chhipa drove to a bank, withdrew $1,800 from an ATM, and then went to a Taco Bell, where he paid a stranger for a ride to a relative’s house. The relative then drove him to a grocery store.

A Politico article, citing anonymous sources, suggests a fascinating moment involving former President Donald Trump, a proposed crypto strategic reserve , and the prominent blockchain company, Ripple Labs. This incident sheds light on the growing intensity of crypto lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. and raises questions about how information flows to policymakers. What Sparked the Latest Buzz Around Trump Crypto ? The focal point of the Politico report is a post made by Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform in early March. The post reportedly promoted the idea of establishing a cryptocurrency strategic reserve. While the concept itself isn’t entirely new in theoretical discussions within the crypto space, its mention by a former U.S. President, and a potential future candidate, immediately grabbed headlines. However, the plot thickened shortly after. According to Politico’s sources, Trump later felt he had been misled by a lobbyist regarding the post. This feeling reportedly arose after he learned that Ripple Labs, the company behind the Ripple XRP digital asset, was a customer of a lobbying firm that had played a role in getting the topic onto his radar. Understanding the Concept: A Crypto Strategic Reserve The idea of a strategic reserve is familiar in traditional commodities, like the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It’s a stockpile intended for use during emergencies to stabilize markets or ensure national security. Applying this concept to cryptocurrencies is complex and raises many questions: What would be stored? Bitcoin? Ethereum? A basket of different cryptocurrencies like Ripple XRP ? What would be its purpose? National security? Economic stability? Countering sanctions? Facilitating international payments? How would it be managed? Given crypto’s decentralized nature (for many assets) and volatility, management would be a significant challenge. What are the benefits? Potential benefits could include providing a level of national security in a digital economy, offering a new tool for monetary policy (though highly controversial), or establishing the U.S. as a leader in digital asset adoption. What are the challenges? Significant hurdles include market volatility, security risks (hacking, loss of keys), regulatory uncertainty, technical complexities, and potential political opposition. The very mention of such a reserve by a figure like Trump suggests that novel, and perhaps speculative, ideas from the crypto world are making their way into political discussions, sometimes through channels influenced by industry stakeholders. The Rise of Crypto Lobbying in Washington The cryptocurrency industry has rapidly increased its lobbying efforts in recent years. As digital assets have grown in value and prominence, so too has the industry’s desire to influence regulation and legislation in its favor. This is where crypto lobbying comes into play. Key aspects of crypto lobbying include: Significant Spending: Millions of dollars are now spent annually by crypto companies, foundations, and advocacy groups to lobby Congress and regulatory agencies. Diverse Goals: Lobbyists advocate for a range of outcomes, from clear regulatory frameworks that foster innovation to specific carve-outs or definitions that benefit particular types of digital assets or business models. Preventing overly burdensome regulations is a common goal. Access and Information: Lobbyists aim to gain access to policymakers and their staff to educate them about complex crypto technologies and markets, and to present arguments favorable to their clients’ interests. Political Contributions: Political Action Committees (PACs) funded by the crypto industry are becoming increasingly significant donors in U.S. elections, seeking to support candidates favorable to their cause. The incident reported by Politico underscores the effectiveness, and perhaps the potential pitfalls, of this burgeoning lobbying power. Getting a concept like a crypto strategic reserve, or a specific asset like Ripple XRP , mentioned by a high-profile political figure can be seen as a lobbying success, regardless of the follow-up sentiment. Ripple XRP and Its Deep Dive into Advocacy Ripple Labs, the company associated with the Ripple XRP digital asset and the RippleNet payment network, is known to be a significant player in the crypto lobbying space. Their intensive lobbying efforts are, in large part, driven by their ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC lawsuit, which alleges that XRP was sold as an unregistered security, has been a major cloud hanging over Ripple and XRP for years. In this context, advocating for clear regulatory definitions, potentially through legislation that distinguishes certain digital assets from securities, is a critical strategic priority for Ripple. Given this backdrop, it is not surprising that Ripple Labs would engage lobbying firms to promote ideas and assets that could potentially benefit their position or highlight the utility of XRP in areas like international payments or, perhaps, even a theoretical strategic reserve. Challenges and Implications for US Crypto Policy This Politico report, if accurate, highlights several challenges inherent in the formation of US crypto policy : Information Asymmetry: Policymakers often have limited time and expertise to fully grasp the nuances of complex technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. This can make them reliant on information provided by external parties, including lobbyists. Influence of Special Interests: Lobbying is a legal and legitimate part of the political process, but incidents like this raise concerns about whether policy discussions are being unduly influenced by specific corporate or asset-specific interests rather than broader economic or technological considerations. Transparency: While lobbying activities are disclosed, the specifics of conversations and the precise information conveyed are often not public, leading to questions about transparency. Rapid Pace of Change: The crypto market evolves incredibly quickly, making it difficult for policy and regulation to keep pace, and potentially leaving room for outdated or incomplete information to shape views. The alleged feeling of being misled by a lobbyist could potentially make politicians, including Trump, more cautious about adopting positions on complex crypto topics without thorough independent vetting. It underscores the need for policymakers to seek diverse perspectives beyond those presented by well-funded lobbying efforts. Actionable Insights for the Engaged Reader For those interested in the intersection of crypto and politics, this incident offers valuable lessons: Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources covering both cryptocurrency and U.S. politics. Look Beyond the Headlines: Understand the various players involved – companies, lobbyists, politicians, regulators – and their potential motivations. Research Lobbying Disclosures: Public databases track lobbying expenditures and registered lobbyists, offering insights into who is spending money to influence policy. Engage with Policymakers: Contact your elected representatives to share your views on crypto policy and encourage them to seek balanced information. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Influence Game The Politico report detailing former President Trump’s alleged experience with lobbyists regarding a crypto strategic reserve and the mention of Ripple XRP offers a rare glimpse into the high-stakes world of crypto lobbying in Washington. It underscores how industry stakeholders are actively working to shape US crypto policy , bringing complex and sometimes controversial ideas directly to influential figures. While lobbying is a standard part of the political process, this incident raises important questions about the transparency and potential for specific interests to disproportionately influence policy discussions. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the interplay between its advocates and the policymakers who regulate it will undoubtedly remain a critical area to watch, shaping the future trajectory of digital assets in the United States.

Can the TRUMP Coin Price Rally to New Record Highs? So does that mean a new rally back to, or beyond, record highs is on the cards? Well, ahead of the private Gala event for TRUMP coin holders in the White House, scheduled for May 22, hype could continue rising. Per an article from Bloomberg , 76% of the top holders vying for a spot at the diner table are non-US based buyers, given the wallets used exchanges not available to US residents. As the competition to be in the top 220 spots rises, that could result in fresh TRUMP coin price upside in the near-term. And that upside could be compounded if Bitcoin and the broader crypto market continues to see gains. BTC burst back above $100,000 on Thursday and is eyeing a retest of its $108,000 record highs from earlier in the year. Bitcoin $100.000 pic.twitter.com/XTs3nri6U2 — naiive (@naiivememe) May 8, 2025 In the world of meme coins, setting precise price targets is all but impossible. But the bulls should not rule out a near-term retest of mid-February highs around $23.50, or even a retest of the crypto’s record highs above $70. That could mean gains of more than 5x for TRUMP holders in the coming weeks. TRUMP – A Good Long-term Investment? Proponents of Trump Coin as a long-term investment argue that its association with the Trump brand, amplified by Donald Trump’s global political influence and social media presence, could drive sustained demand among loyal supporters and speculative investors, potentially increasing its value over time. Additionally, strategic partnerships, such as those with World Liberty Financial , which reported $500 million in token sales, and potential institutional investments from hedge funds or private equity firms, could enhance price stability and market adoption, positioning Trump Coin as a unique politically branded asset with cultural staying power. Conversely, critics highlight the coin’s lack of inherent utility beyond speculative trading, noting that its value heavily relies on transient hype and Trump’s personal brand, which may wane or face regulatory scrutiny, as evidenced by concerns over conflicts of interest raised by ethics experts and congressional Democrats.

A wallet associated with Binance’s Stellar deposits, which had already been used in Pi Coin transactions, has exhibited fresh activity. That was enough to ignite rumors that Binance might be quietly gearing up for a Pi Chain integration or even a future listing of $PI. Related Reading: Tether’s $1 Billion Mint Powers Tron — Is A Breakout Brewing? No official announcement has been made by Binance. But according to what blockchain monitors have observed, a number of small test-like transactions have been passed through the same wallet that was responsible for processing previous Pi-connected movements. The timing is what actually made people speculate. Is $PI finally coming to Binance? The Binance stellar deposit wallet which is the same as their $PI wallet has started testing transactions on the $PI chain.

On May 14, the Pi Core Team will consider and perhaps approve a number of third-party apps to list on its ecosystem. It is one of the steps being taken towards integrating more use cases within the network, particularly following the release of its open mainnet in February. A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14. Tune in to find out what’s coming next! pic.twitter.com/5jn7m5mlmD — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) May 7, 2025 That launch was a watershed moment for Pi, which now boasts more than 60 million users globally. Nevertheless, the project continues to need to resolve important concerns such as inadequate smart contract functionality, slow transaction speeds, and stringent liquidity constraints. Those vulnerabilities have rendered it difficult for Pi to garner meaningful developer attention for creating apps and services. Pi Price Remains Stable PI coin has been having a decent performance of late. The coin sustained a solid run in the last seven days with a 2% increase, data from Coingecko shows. The ongoing rumors of a Binance listing may lift the coin price up further, or it could go sideways. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebounds After Sharp Drop As Whales Fuel Push Toward $100K Binance Silence Keeps Market Guessing While some in the crypto community are optimistic, others are standing by. Binance has said nothing about Pi Coin. That has not deterred online whispers, but it certainly leaves a great many questions unasked. There is no evidence that Binance is looking to list Pi Coin – at least when this report was made – and the wallet movement could prove to be a coincidence. Eyes On Binance And Pi Network Ahead Of Key Date Meanwhile, the Pi community stands by for fresh scoop. May 14 might usher in significant changes. If the Binance wallet activity is the tip of a larger iceberg, and if PI does indeed get listed, that would shift the course of the project.

44357060,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158751,1746763813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Google AI Deploys Powerful Scam Protection in Chrome,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-ai-chrome-protection/,"In an era where digital threats, including sophisticated online scams targeting everyone from casual browsers to crypto enthusiasts, are constantly evolving, Google is stepping up its defense. The tech giant recently announced a significant rollout of new Google AI -powered tools aimed at fortifying Chrome security and providing robust protection against online scams . Leveraging Gemini Nano for Enhanced Chrome Security A key component of this enhanced security push is the integration of Gemini Nano , Google’s on-device large language model (LLM). Initially deployed on desktop versions of Chrome, Gemini Nano is set to provide an additional layer of defense, particularly for users who have opted into Chrome’s Enhanced Protection mode. This mode already offers a higher level of security, doubling the protection against phishing and other online threats compared to the standard mode. Google highlights that the on-device nature of Gemini Nano allows for immediate analysis of potentially risky websites. This means it can identify and warn users about scam sites even if they haven’t been previously cataloged. Google stated in a blog post that Gemini Nano’s ability to understand the complex nature of websites makes it ideal for adapting quickly to new scam tactics. Currently, this AI-powered defense is being used to protect users from remote tech support scams, a common tactic where malicious actors impersonate support staff to gain access to systems or steal information. Google has plans to expand this protection to Android devices and cover an even wider range of scam types in the future. AI-Powered Warnings for Spammy Notifications The risk from malicious sites doesn’t always end when you leave the page. Scammy websites often try to push persistent notifications if you’ve enabled them. To combat this, Google is also launching new AI-powered warnings specifically for Chrome on Android. Chrome will now use an on-device machine learning model to flag notifications that appear malicious, spammy, or misleading. When a potentially scammy notification is detected, users will receive a warning. They can then choose to block the notification or view the content that was flagged. If a warning is believed to be incorrect, users have the option to allow future notifications from that specific site. Fighting Online Scams Beyond the Browser Google’s use of AI to combat scams isn’t limited to Chrome. The company also shared that it has been employing AI in Google Search to detect and block hundreds of millions of scammy results daily. These AI-powered systems have significantly increased the detection rate, catching 20 times the number of scammy pages compared to previous methods. For example, Google noted a rise in scams where bad actors impersonate airline customer service agents. By using AI, Google has managed to reduce the appearance of scammy phone numbers in Search results for these queries by over 80%, significantly decreasing the risk of users falling victim to this specific type of scam. Why This Matters for Digital Security The deployment of advanced Google AI models like Gemini Nano represents a significant step forward in scam protection . As online threats become more sophisticated, leveraging the power of AI allows for more dynamic and proactive defenses. Key benefits include: Faster Detection: On-device AI can analyze threats in real-time without needing to send data to external servers. Adaptability: LLMs can better understand the nuances of new scam tactics, allowing defenses to evolve quickly. Broader Coverage: AI can help identify scam patterns across different platforms, from websites to search results and notifications. For users navigating the digital world, especially those involved in areas like cryptocurrency where scams are unfortunately prevalent, these enhanced security measures offer a welcome layer of protection. Enabling Enhanced Protection in Chrome is a simple step users can take to benefit from these new AI capabilities. Summary: A Stronger Defense Against Digital Threats Google’s integration of Google AI , including Gemini Nano , into Chrome and Search demonstrates a commitment to enhancing Chrome security and providing robust scam protection . By leveraging AI to analyze web content, identify malicious notifications, and filter search results, Google is building a stronger defense against the ever-present threat of online scams . These advancements aim to make the online experience safer for everyone, helping users avoid deceptive content and protect their personal information and assets.

While legacy tokens like SHIBA INU and XRP remain widely held and discussed, their growth trajectories appear to be slowing. In contrast, a new project— MAGACOINFINANCE —is quickly positioning itself as one of the most talked-about hidden gems of the year. MAGACOINFINANCE: Momentum Behind the Rising Star CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT MAGACOINFINANCE has entered the spotlight with a mix of rapid token sale activity, robust infrastructure, and a theme that resonates with a wide audience. Analysts are paying close attention due to its similarities to early-stage breakouts like SHIBA and DOGE in past market cycles. Why Investors Are Watching MAGACOINFINANCE Smart Contract Deployed : The token contract is already live on-chain, reflecting transparency and operational readiness. Audited by HashEx : A comprehensive security audit by a leading blockchain auditor enhances investor trust. Investor-Centric Tokenomics : With 45% of supply allocated to public buyers , MAGACOINFINANCE prioritizes accessibility. Limited Supply + Growing Demand : Stage-based pricing and token scarcity are creating a natural urgency for early participants. High ROI Potential : Though speculative, some analysts forecast 25x–35x upside potential based on the project’s early momentum, branding strategy, and market entry timing. With these fundamentals in place, MAGACOINFINANCE has carved out a place among the most promising low-cap tokens currently in circulation. SHIBA INU and XRP: Still Strong, But Slower Paths Ahead? SHIBA INU continues to hold cultural cachet but is currently consolidating around $0.00001340 . Without new ecosystem catalysts, major price acceleration may be limited. XRP , now trading near $2.22 , recently resolved its SEC case and enjoys ETF speculation. While its fundamentals are strong, the size of its market cap makes 10x or greater returns less likely compared to newer, nimble entrants. These tokens are viewed as reliable large-cap holds, but for traders targeting asymmetric upside , many are shifting toward early-stage plays. Final Outlook: Where Opportunity May Be Greatest in 2025 LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X For investors seeking a fresh opportunity with high potential and strong early momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out. It offers: A verified smart contract and audit-backed credibility Market-tested tokenomics favoring early participants Political Memecoin relevance that has historically driven viral adoption in crypto Active demand fueling steady price movement and traction In short, while SHIBA and XRP continue to hold their place in the market, MAGACOINFINANCE may represent the next breakout narrative for those looking to catch a rising wave before it peaks.

Altcoins like Solana, Ethereum, and XRP are also surging, making it a big day for crypto traders. Pi Coin Breaks Resistance, Eyes $1 Target Pi Coin’s price has managed to break above a key resistance zone between $0.66 and $0.67. This breakout came with strong trading volume, a sign that buyers are stepping in. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 56.68, showing growing bullish momentum. If the price stays above this resistance, it could target between $0.85 and $1.00 in the short term. Source: Coinpedia Markets However, if the breakout fails, the price might consolidate in the current range before making another move. Token Unlock Sparks Supply Concerns According to analyst Dr Altcoin , Pi Coin’s circulating supply suddenly jumped by 5 billion tokens — from 7 billion to 12 billion — earlier today. However, the supply available on crypto exchanges didn’t change. This sudden increase likely came from a 5 billion Pi liquidity pool, possibly to prepare for a major exchange listing. And when Dr Altcoin says major, he means Binance, BitMart, and HTX. Interestingly, the extra supply appeared and disappeared within an hour, hinting at a successful stress test. This suggests that Pi Network is testing its liquidity before the tokens officially go live on exchanges. Dr Altcoin said that the price could stay around $1 until May 14. If the announcement lives up to the hype, Pi might rise to $2 by the end of August . From there until the end of 2025, it could trade anywhere between $2 and $5, depending on how the ecosystem develops and how the market responds. Source: Pi Scan However, according to Pi Scan, 9.3 million Pi tokens are unlocking today, which could add pressure on the price. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Set for Major Announcements at Consensus 2025 , Big Announcement Scheduled for May 14 Adding to the excitement, the Pi Network team has confirmed a major ecosystem announcement for May 14, 2025.

Could Binance List Pi Soon? There’s also speculation that Binance might list Pi Network soon . While there’s no official announcement yet, blockchain activity hints at behind-the-scenes tests. A Binance-linked wallet recently processed over 294,000 test transactions with Pi tokens. This kind of activity usually signals preparations for a new token listing. Interestingly, Pi Network’s blockchain is built similarly to Stellar (XLM) — a cryptocurrency already listed on Binance, making a listing technically easier. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Will XRP vs. SEC case resurface?,https://crypto.news/sec-files-to-settle-ripple-lawsuit-amid-internal-opposition-will-xrp-vs-sec-case-resurface/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a motion seeking court approval for a settlement with Ripple Labs, even as one SEC commissioner opposes the move over investor protection concerns. According to the May 8 court SEC filing , both Ripple and the SEC have agreed to withdraw their respective appeals pending before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, effectively ending a legal battle that began in December 2020. Under the proposed deal, Ripple would be able to resume sales without breaking any securities laws and recover $75 million of the $125 million that was held in escrow. The move comes after a key court ruling in 2023 by Judge Analisa Torres, who found that although sales of XRP ( XRP ) to public exchanges did not violate securities laws, sales to institutional investors did. If approved, the court would release the $125 million civil penalty held in escrow, with $50 million going to the SEC and the remainder back to Ripple. The settlement explicitly states that neither party will seek to amend the 2023 summary judgment, preserving the court’s finding that only institutional XRP sales violated securities law. However, not everyone within the SEC is on board. You might also like: XRP’s positive 6-month cost basis defies macro weakness but indicators show slowing momentum SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw criticized the settlement as “a tremendous disservice to the investing public” in a strongly worded dissent posted on the agency’s website. She argued that it weakens the SEC’s ability to hold crypto companies accountable and sends the wrong message to the market. Crenshaw warned that despite the court’s previous decision, the SEC may not take any action if Ripple starts selling XRP to institutions again without registering the tokens. She also expressed concern that this settlement could be part of a broader pullback in the SEC’s crypto enforcement efforts, which could leave investors less protected. Despite this, the SEC insists the agreement is fair and serves the public interest. It pointed to the fact that the case already helped define legal boundaries around token sales, giving the crypto industry more clarity. If the court approves the request, Ripple and the SEC will move to formally dismiss their appeals, ending one of the longest-running and most closely watched crypto cases to date. But Crenshaw’s criticism could spark new debates about how the SEC should regulate digital assets going forward.

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $600 support zone. The price is now trading above $612 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $622 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $612 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes More Gains After forming a base above the $600 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $605 and $612 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . The bulls even pushed the price above the $625 level. A high was formed at $629 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $597 swing low to the $629 high. The price is now trading above $622 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $622 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $628 level. The next resistance sits near the $630 level. A clear move above the $630 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $642. A close above the $642 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $655 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $630 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $622 level. The next major support is near the $620 level. The main support sits at $612 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $597 swing low to the $629 high. If there is a downside break below the $612 support, the price could drop toward the $605 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $600 level.

44359231,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158804,1746767455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase’s Massive Deribit Acquisition Reshapes Crypto Derivatives Landscape,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-deribit-acquisition/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news of a potential seismic shift. Reports indicate that Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, is making a massive move with the proposed Coinbase Deribit acquisition . This isn’t just another deal; it could fundamentally alter the competitive landscape, particularly in the rapidly growing sector of crypto derivatives . Understanding the Scale of the Coinbase Deribit Acquisition According to CoinDesk, citing analysis from KeyBanc, Coinbase is reportedly set to acquire Deribit, a dominant player in the cryptocurrency options market, for a staggering $2.9 billion. This figure alone highlights the immense value and strategic importance Coinbase places on this deal. Deribit isn’t just any exchange; it’s a powerhouse specifically focused on options and futures trading for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This acquisition is poised to catapult Coinbase into a leading position within the crypto derivatives space. KeyBanc analysts suggest that post-acquisition, Coinbase could become the world’s largest cryptocurrency derivatives platform when measured by open interest (OI) and options trading volume. This immediate scaling is a direct challenge to established giants in the derivatives market. Deribit’s Unmatched Dominance in Deribit Options Why is Deribit so valuable? The numbers speak for themselves. Deribit currently commands an estimated 95% of the global cryptocurrency options market. This near-monopoly status in a specific, high-value segment makes it an incredibly attractive target for an exchange looking to diversify and expand its offerings beyond spot trading. Options trading, unlike simple spot trading, involves contracts that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on or before a certain date. It’s a more complex form of trading often used by sophisticated investors and institutions for hedging or speculating on price movements. Deribit has built a robust platform and liquidity pool specifically for these advanced financial instruments. Consider its trading volume: last year alone, Deribit facilitated $1.2 trillion in trading volume. This immense activity underscores the platform’s liquidity and its central role in price discovery and risk management within the crypto options market. By integrating this volume and user base, Coinbase instantly gains a deep foothold in a market segment where it previously had limited presence. Bridging the Gap: Enhancing Coinbase International Presence Another crucial aspect highlighted by financial institutions like Barclays is how the Deribit acquisition is expected to significantly expand Coinbase’s presence overseas. Coinbase has historically generated the majority of its revenue from its operations in the United States. Currently, only about 20% of Coinbase’s revenue originates from international markets. Acquiring Deribit, which has a strong global user base and operates outside the U.S. regulatory environment (though subject to others), provides Coinbase with an established international infrastructure and customer base. This helps bridge a significant geographic gap and is vital for Coinbase’s long-term growth strategy. Expanding internationally diversifies Coinbase’s revenue streams and reduces its reliance on a single market, mitigating regulatory risks associated with operating predominantly in one jurisdiction. This strategic move aligns with Coinbase’s ambition to become a truly global financial institution in the crypto space, offering a wider range of products to a broader audience worldwide. The Competitive Edge: Coinbase vs Binance in Crypto Derivatives Perhaps the most significant implication of the Coinbase Deribit acquisition is the direct challenge it poses to Binance, currently a dominant force in the broader crypto derivatives market (which includes futures, perpetual swaps, and options). While Binance has a massive overall derivatives volume, Deribit’s near-monopoly in options gives Coinbase a specific, powerful advantage in that niche. KeyBanc’s analysis suggesting Coinbase could surpass Binance in options volume and open interest post-acquisition indicates a major shift in market dynamics. This competition is likely to intensify as Coinbase integrates Deribit’s platform and leverages its brand and user base to attract more derivatives traders. What does this mean for the market and users? Increased competition often leads to innovation, better pricing, and improved services. As Coinbase and Binance vie for market share in derivatives, traders could benefit from more sophisticated tools, lower fees, and greater liquidity across various derivatives products. Potential Impacts: Benefits and Challenges Like any large acquisition, this deal comes with potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Market Dominance: Instantly becomes a leader in crypto options. Revenue Diversification: Adds a significant high-volume revenue stream beyond spot trading. Global Expansion: Accelerates international reach and reduces reliance on the U.S. market. Product Offering: Expands Coinbase’s suite of financial products for advanced traders and institutions. Increased Liquidity: Combining user bases and platforms could enhance liquidity for all participants. Potential Challenges: Integration Complexity: Merging platforms, technology, and teams can be difficult and time-consuming. Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating different regulatory environments globally presents challenges. Maintaining Deribit’s Niche: Integrating a highly specialized platform like Deribit into a broader exchange structure requires careful management to avoid disrupting its core strength. Competition: Facing off directly against an entrenched giant like Binance requires sustained effort and innovation. A Game-Changing Move for the Crypto Landscape The reported $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit by Coinbase is far more than just a large corporate transaction. It’s a strategic maneuver that positions Coinbase as a major force in the burgeoning crypto derivatives market, directly challenging the existing hierarchy led by Binance. By acquiring Deribit’s dominant market share in options and its established international presence, Coinbase is setting the stage for intensified competition and significant growth in global markets. While integration and regulatory challenges lie ahead, this deal has the potential to reshape where and how traders access crypto derivatives, ultimately impacting the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Roubini, a senior advisor at Hudson Bay Capital, said technological advances would offset the impact of trade tariffs. He said the U.S. is a leader in future fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and green technology. “Technology outweighs tariffs,” he said. According to Roubini, this technological superiority could increase the potential growth rate of the United States from 2% to 4% by 2030. In contrast, the economist stated that the impact of tariffs and immigration restrictions could only reduce growth by 0.5%, and that technological progress would more than compensate for this loss. Roubini, who believes that the high tariffs that Donald Trump plans to impose will also be limited by the market, said: “Bond investors will force Trump to back down. The most powerful parties are the market disciplinarians.” Related News: BREAKING: US Senate Rejects Crypto-Friendly GENIUS Act – Here Are the Details In the short term, Roubini predicts a slowdown in the economy. He said that cost increases due to customs duties could push inflation to 4%, which could restrict consumer spending and lead to a loss of confidence in both the consumer and business world. In this context, he said a “short and shallow” recession could occur in the last quarter of 2025. Roubini also responded to the question of how the FED would act in this situation, saying that the central bank would want to see clear signs of a recession before cutting interest rates. “Inflation expectations are still under control. The Fed will be patient and wait for the data,” Roubini said, adding that he thought lessons had been learned from mistakes made in previous periods. Roubini also said that the weakening of the dollar could put additional pressure on inflation by increasing import prices, and therefore the Fed should not make sudden interest rate cuts. He added that long-term bond yields could diverge from the Fed policy due to reasons such as the increasing budget deficit. Roubini stated that despite the short-term difficulties in the economy, the US has a strong growth potential in the long term thanks to its innovative structure, and said, “Customs duties are temporary, but technology is a permanent advantage.” *This is not investment advice.

A May 8 report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company is working on new processors to power its future devices, including its first smart glasses to rival Meta’s Ray-Bans, more powerful Macs, and artificial intelligence servers. The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said. Apple’s smart glasses will initially be non- augmented reality versions that will include cameras, microphones and integrated AI, much like rival offerings from Meta . They would presumably have similar functions like snapping photos, recording video and offering translation options, the report added. The product may also integrate a visual intelligence feature for scanning the environment and describing objects, looking up information about products and providing directions. Mass production targeted for late 2026 or 2027, suggesting a product launch within approximately two years, they added. Apple is targeting rival Meta’s smart Ray-Bans. Source: Ray-Ban The Bloomberg sources added that other semiconductors were also developing chips to power future Macs and AI servers that can power the firm’s “Apple Intelligence” platform. Related: Apple softens crypto-related app rules, ‘hugely bullish’ for crypto industry Meanwhile, MacRumors reported that chips codenamed “Komodo” will likely be M6 chips that will follow this year’s M5 chips, while chips codenamed “Borneo” will be Apple’s future M7 processors with another more advanced chip that will debut in the future codenamed “Sotra.” Dedicated Apple AI chips Apple is also working on its first dedicated AI server chips in a project codenamed “Baltra” to power its Apple Intelligence platform, according to Bloomberg. The firm’s Baltra chips could have up to eight times the processing and graphics cores of the current M3 Ultra chips, the report added. Apple has targeted completion by 2027 to make its AI services faster and more competitive. In late April, it was reported that Chinese tech giant Huawei has developed a powerful AI chip that could rival high-end processors from US chip maker Nvidia.

For those following the intersection of tech, security, and the broader digital landscape, news from Microsoft’s leadership sheds light on the cautious approach being taken towards certain generative AI services. This includes a notable Microsoft DeepSeek ban for its internal workforce, citing critical security and data handling issues. Why the Microsoft DeepSeek Ban? Urgent Concerns Highlighted Microsoft’s decision to prohibit its employees from using the DeepSeek application stems from explicit concerns over data security and the potential for state influence. During a recent Senate hearing, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith stated clearly, “At Microsoft we don’t allow our employees to use the DeepSeek app.” He elaborated that this restriction applies to the application service, accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. The primary reasons articulated for this significant step are: Data Storage Location: The risk that sensitive data processed through the app could be stored on servers located in China. Potential for Propaganda: Concerns that the AI model’s outputs could be influenced by or spread “Chinese propaganda.” Legal Compliance Risks: DeepSeek’s privacy policy confirms user data is stored on Chinese servers, making it subject to Chinese law, which can mandate cooperation with intelligence agencies. Censorship: The model is known to heavily censor content considered sensitive by the Chinese government. While many organizations and governments have implemented restrictions on various technologies, this public statement from a tech leader like Microsoft regarding a specific AI app is noteworthy and underscores the growing complexity of managing AI data security in a global context. Employee AI Use: A Distinction Between App and Model It’s crucial to understand the nuance in Microsoft’s position. While the DeepSeek app is banned for Employee AI use , Microsoft has offered DeepSeek’s R1 model on its Azure cloud service. This distinction is significant: Using the DeepSeek App : Involves sending data directly to DeepSeek’s servers. Data is stored in China, subject to Chinese law. Directly utilizes DeepSeek’s potentially unfiltered service. Using the DeepSeek Model on Azure : Since DeepSeek is open source, the model can be downloaded. Organizations can host the model on their own servers (like Azure). User data stays within the organization’s controlled environment (e.g., Azure), not sent back to DeepSeek’s servers in China. This highlights that the core concern for the app ban is primarily data residency and control, rather than the AI model itself being inherently unusable in all contexts. However, hosting the model locally doesn’t eliminate all risks, such as the potential for the model to generate insecure code or biased content, linking back to broader Generative AI security considerations. China AI Risks and Microsoft’s Mitigation Efforts The concerns raised by Microsoft directly point to the unique China AI risks associated with data handling and potential governmental influence. Brad Smith mentioned that Microsoft has taken steps to mitigate some of these risks when offering the model on Azure. He claimed Microsoft was able to “go inside” the DeepSeek AI model and “change” it to remove “harmful side effects.” While Microsoft did not provide specific details on these modifications, they stated that DeepSeek underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before being made available on Azure. This suggests an attempt to address potential biases, safety issues, or the risk of spreading propaganda at the model level, separate from the data security concerns of the app. This situation also brings into focus the competitive landscape. DeepSeek’s app is a competitor to Microsoft’s own Copilot. However, Microsoft doesn’t ban all competing apps; for instance, Perplexity is available in the Windows app store. This suggests the ban is specifically tied to the identified security and geopolitical risks of DeepSeek, rather than merely competitive reasons, though the competitive aspect is hard to ignore entirely when discussing restrictions on Employee AI use . Conclusion: Navigating the Complexities of Generative AI Security Microsoft’s public stance on the DeepSeek app ban for its employees serves as a clear indicator of the complex security and geopolitical challenges tech companies face with the proliferation of generative AI tools. The distinction made between using a third-party app and hosting an open-source model on controlled infrastructure like Azure highlights different facets of AI data security and risk management. As AI becomes more integrated into daily work, organizations must carefully evaluate the origins, data handling practices, and potential influences embedded within the tools they permit for Employee AI use , especially when navigating the landscape of China AI risks and broader Generative AI security concerns.

The latest price surge came amid the market-wide surge, but also after the US SEC filed to settle the lawsuit against Ripple Labs. XRP to $2.6 Next? Ever since Ripple’s cross-border token reclaimed the crucial $2 line in mid-April, it has been stuck within a trading range between the aforementioned level, which became psychological support, and $2.26. The latter turned into key resistance, which withheld the bulls’ attempt at a breakthrough in late April. In the past ten days, XRP failed to move outside of either one of those lines. The bears unsuccessfully challenged the lower boundary on May 6, but the asset remained well above it. The subsequent bounce-off has been rather gradual but seems sustainable as of now. Earlier today, XRP surged to an 11-day peak of over $2.33 before it faced some resistance and was pushed south to the current $2.3. Nevertheless, it’s still 5% up on the day, and, more importantly, it has surged past the upper boundary of $2.26. Ali Martinez told his over 135,000 followers on X that if XRP managed to close above that line, it could head toward $2.6 next. If $XRP breaks through the $2.26 resistance, it could trigger a bullish breakout toward $2.60! pic.twitter.com/2bdG315vgi — Ali (@ali_charts) May 8, 2025 Although XRP is yet to close above that level on the daily, the community was quick to pick up the move and celebrate with some big price predictions for the following weeks and months. Also, you can check why another popular analyst believes the current price levels are an “ absolute gift .” SEC Files to Settle The first obvious reason behind XRP’s surge is the overall market resurgance as the entire industry has added roughly $300 billion within the past few days. However, there seems to be another, and it involves the legal case between the company behind the token and the US regulator that sued it for over four years. The SEC has filed a motion to receive court approval to settle with Ripple Labs. This could be considered a confirmation of previous statements by Ripple’s CEO and CLO, as both claimed that the case has effectively ended. The agency’s filing requests a $50 million settlement, which is far off the previously ordered $125 million and way less than the $2 billion the SEC initially sought.

Gaming and DeFi are both sitting on 21% dominance in April, judged by percentage of unique active wallets, while AI has climbed to 16%, up from the 11% recorded in the February report, data in DappRadar’s April industry report shows . “As user interest in artificial intelligence tools grows across industries, AI-powered DApps are steadily carving out their place in the decentralized ecosystem,” DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said. “If this trend continues, AI could soon challenge the traditional dominance of DeFi and Gaming, signaling a new era in the DApp landscape.” AI DApps have seen a jump in market dominance this month, while market leaders have declined slightly. Source: DappRadar At the same time, AI DApp activity surged over 26% to reach 3.8 million daily unique active wallets (dUAW), up from the 2.6 million dUAW recorded in February. In contrast, DeFi activity dropped by 16%, settling at 4.8 million dUAW, which is equal to the gaming sector, which saw a 10% decline as well. Source: DappRadar Gherghelas said most of the top AI DApps being tracked by DappRadar have remained the same, with many tied to AI agent infrastructure and those building utility. LOL, a project that styles itself as an AI-powered mining system, is the top AI DApp on DappRadar’s list in dUAW. LOL encourages users to send a voice recording of laughter to Telegram groups that use the LOL AI bot, which then uses factors like pitch and frequency to calculate the number of LOL tokens paid out in rewards. Coming in second is AI-powered decentralized messaging service Dmail Network. Rounding out the top three is World.‎‎‎Fun, a launchpad that allows users to deploy AI agents into massive multi-agent simulations. “This month, the top AI DApps on our platform remain largely unchanged, reinforcing the staying power of early leaders in this space. These projects are not just riding the hype: they’re building utility,” she added. Last December, crypto industry execs told Cointelegraph they expected AI agents to transform Web3 in 2025 , flagging crypto staking and onchain trading as emerging early use cases. However, there was also speculation that AI would face headwinds , including technical challenges, regulatory hurdles, and centralization. Social DApps rise as Web3 holds ground Social DApps also saw a spike in activity for April, with an 18% increase to 3.6 million dUAW. Social DApp market dominance also grew to over 15% for the month. Related: Crypto users cool with AI dabbling with their portfolios: Survey Gherghelas said overall that “Web3 is holding its ground,” despite wider market turbulence in the wake of sweeping US tariffs , with 23 million daily active wallets recorded in April, compared to the 24 million recorded in February. “April’s top performers underscore a key narrative: utility and narrative-driven hype, especially around memecoins and AI, are major drivers of user engagement,” Gherghelas said.

The deal comes as the company reported a weak first quarter, with revenue and net income falling due to reduced trading volumes and a broader market downturn. Despite the financial dip, Coinbase is betting on derivatives and institutional growth to drive its next phase of development. Coinbase Acquires Deribit in $2.9 Billion Deal, Expanding Footprint in Global Crypto Derivatives Market Coinbase Global has officially announced the acquisition of Deribit, one of the world’s leading crypto derivatives exchanges, for approximately $2.9 billion. The landmark deal signals Coinbase’s biggest step yet toward expanding its global influence in institutional cryptocurrency trading. The announcement, made public on May 8, confirmed that Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States by trading volume, will acquire Deribit through a combination of $700 million in cash and approximately 11 million shares of Coinbase Class A common stock. The deal is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close before the end of 2025. Coinbase share chart (Source: Google Finance ) With this acquisition, Coinbase gains a significant foothold in the derivatives market — a sector that has grown increasingly lucrative in recent years as institutional investors seek hedging tools and more sophisticated trading instruments. Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s vice president of institutional product, emphasized the significance of the deal in a public statement, saying, “With Deribit’s strong presence and professional client base, Coinbase is making its most substantial move yet to accelerate our international growth strategy.” Deribit’s Founders to Exit After Deal Completion Deribit, originally founded in 2014 by brothers John and Marius Jansen, has long been a dominant force in the crypto options space, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum options. The Jansens are expected to step away from the company following the deal’s completion, marking the end of more than a decade of hands-on leadership. In its own announcement, Deribit assured users that the exchange would maintain business as usual until the transaction officially closes. Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers expressed optimism about the future under Coinbase’s umbrella, saying, “As the leading crypto options platform, we’ve built a strong, profitable business, and this acquisition will accelerate the foundation we laid while providing traders with even more opportunities across spot, futures, perpetuals, and options — all under one trusted brand.” Integration Promises Enhanced Efficiency One of the key advantages of the acquisition, according to both firms, will be the seamless integration of Deribit’s technology stack with Coinbase’s broader ecosystem. This could significantly improve client onboarding, boost capital efficiency, and strengthen fiat payment infrastructure — especially critical for institutional clients navigating cross-border transactions. The acquisition follows months of speculation and behind-the-scenes regulatory maneuvering. Reports in March indicated that both Coinbase and Deribit had notified financial regulators in Dubai about the potential transaction. Deribit currently holds a regulatory license in Dubai, and that license would need to be transferred or renewed under Coinbase’s name for the deal to proceed smoothly. Earlier industry speculation had placed Deribit’s valuation between $4 billion and $5 billion. While the final purchase price of $2.9 billion is below those estimates, analysts say the valuation reflects Coinbase’s leverage as a public company and the increasingly competitive nature of crypto mergers and acquisitions. A Wave of Consolidation in the Crypto Derivatives Space Coinbase’s acquisition of Deribit follows another major derivatives market development — Kraken’s announcement on May 1 that it would acquire NinjaTrader, a platform known for its futures trading capabilities, in a deal reportedly worth $1.5 billion. The flurry of M&A activity points to a growing consolidation trend in the crypto industry, where large centralized exchanges are racing to secure licenses, expand product offerings, and capture institutional flows in an increasingly regulated global market. The derivatives market has become a critical battleground. With average daily trading volumes in crypto options and futures surpassing those in spot markets, exchanges are under pressure to provide the tools, liquidity, and compliance necessary to serve sophisticated traders and institutions. For Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and his executive team, the acquisition is part of a larger plan to scale the company’s international footprint and attract a broader institutional clientele. Coinbase has recently stepped up its efforts to diversify revenue streams away from spot trading, and Deribit’s derivatives expertise fits neatly into that vision. While the acquisition is still subject to approval, the move is part of Coinbase’s long-term ambition to become the go-to platform for every layer of crypto finance — from retail traders buying Bitcoin to hedge funds managing complex derivatives strategies. Coinbase Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates Amid Market Slowdown, But Deribit Acquisition Fuels Strategic Expansion The acquisition comes as Coinbase posted mixed financial results for the first quarter of 2025, missing revenue expectations and reporting a sharp drop in net income. The Q1 report , released on May 8, revealed a 10% quarter-over-quarter decline in total revenue, which fell to $2 billion. That figure came in 4.1% below industry expectations, weighed down by a general downturn in crypto trading activity and market valuations. Despite the overall miss, earnings per share (EPS) of $1.94 managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85, thanks in part to continued growth in subscription-based services. The most eye-catching figure in Coinbase’s Q1 earnings was the drastic 95% plunge in net income — from a near-record $1.29 billion in Q4 2024 to just $66 million this quarter. The bulk of the drop was attributed to a $596 million unrealized loss stemming from Coinbase’s crypto asset holdings, reflecting the volatile market environment triggered in part by geopolitical and economic uncertainty. https://x.com/coinbase/status/1920577548922003668 The downturn coincided with a broader slump in the digital asset market, driven by double-digit drops in market capitalization across major cryptocurrencies. Analysts point to recently enacted tariffs under the newly re-elected Trump administration as a contributing factor to the downturn, dampening investor sentiment and reducing cross-border trading volumes. Trading Activity Falls Sharply, But Services Revenue Climbs Transaction revenue for Coinbase — which historically accounts for the majority of its earnings — fell by 18.9% from Q4, landing at $1.26 billion. This mirrored a 10.5% decline in trading volume, which dropped to $393 billion for the quarter. These declines underscore how sensitive Coinbase’s core business remains to overall market activity. However, a bright spot in the report was Coinbase’s growing revenue from subscriptions and services, which climbed 8.9% to $698.1 million. The company cited its stablecoin services as the largest contributor to this segment, demonstrating how Coinbase is successfully diversifying away from volatile spot trading income. Despite the Q1 slump, Coinbase reported gains in global market share for both spot and derivatives trading. The firm also highlighted its expanding presence in high-growth emerging markets such as Argentina and India, where it recently secured critical regulatory approvals and operational licenses. On the regulatory front, Coinbase touted the recent dismissal of its lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a pivotal legal win.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-09 05:30:00

44359950,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158810,1746768637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,FTX Collapse: Shocking Allegations Emerge in Michelle Bond Campaign Finance Case,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ftx-collapse-michelle-bond/,"The legal saga stemming from the dramatic FTX collapse continues to unfold, bringing new and often surprising twists. At the heart of the latest development is Michelle Bond, the wife of former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame. Bond is currently facing federal campaign finance charges, but she is now seeking a complete dismissal of her case, making serious allegations about the circumstances surrounding her husband’s plea deal . Who is Michelle Bond and What Are the Campaign Finance Charges? Michelle Bond is perhaps best known publicly as the spouse of Ryan Salame , a key figure within the FTX empire who oversaw its Bahamian operations. However, Bond also has her own history, particularly her unsuccessful bid for a U.S. congressional seat in New York in 2022. It is in connection with this campaign that she faces legal trouble. The charges against her are centered on alleged violations of federal campaign finance laws. While the specific details can be complex, such charges often involve accusations related to illegal contributions, straw donor schemes, or misreporting of funds. These types of allegations have been a recurring theme in the broader legal actions following the FTX collapse , as prosecutors have scrutinized how funds from the crypto exchange and its associated entities may have been used for political purposes. The charges against Bond paint a picture of financial maneuvering tied to her political ambitions, allegedly involving funds or individuals connected to the FTX ecosystem. The Core Allegation: Prosecutorial Misconduct in Ryan Salame’s Plea Deal The central argument in Michelle Bond’s motion to dismiss hinges on explosive claims regarding her husband’s legal situation. Ryan Salame was indicted alongside Sam Bankman-Fried and others and eventually pleaded guilty in September 2023 to charges including conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. As a result of his plea deal , Salame received a significant seven-year prison sentence earlier this year. According to the May 7 court filing by Bond’s legal team, prosecutors allegedly used unethical tactics to secure Salame’s guilty plea. Bond’s lawyers claim the government promised Salame that if he pleaded guilty, they would refrain from charging Michelle Bond. This, they argue, constitutes prosecutorial misconduct, effectively using Bond as leverage to coerce Salame’s plea. The filing reportedly accuses the government of using “stealth and deception” in handling the plea negotiations, suggesting a deliberate strategy to pressure Salame by putting his wife’s freedom on the line. If proven true, such actions could potentially undermine the validity of Salame’s plea agreement and, critically for Michelle Bond, provide grounds for the dismissal of the charges against her. Why This Matters: The Intersection of Campaign Finance and Crypto The case against Michelle Bond, and particularly the allegations regarding the tactics used to secure Ryan Salame ‘s plea deal , highlights the intense scrutiny placed on the political activities funded by individuals connected to the FTX collapse . Federal campaign finance laws are designed to ensure transparency and prevent undue influence in elections. Allegations of using corporate funds or straw donors to bypass contribution limits or obscure the source of political donations are taken very seriously by prosecutors. In the context of FTX, prosecutors have alleged that significant political contributions were made using funds that originated from FTX or Alameda Research, sometimes through intermediaries, blurring the lines between personal wealth and customer/company assets. This is a key aspect of the wider fraud charges brought against FTX leadership. Bond’s case, while focused on her own campaign, is inevitably linked to this larger narrative. The source and nature of the funds allegedly involved in her campaign finance violations are likely tied back to the financial web of FTX and its executives. The defense’s strategy appears to be to attack the very foundation of the prosecution’s case against her, arguing that it is tainted by misconduct related to her husband’s separate, but connected, legal troubles. Legal Challenges and What Comes Next Seeking dismissal of federal charges based on prosecutorial misconduct is a challenging legal maneuver. Bond’s lawyers must convince the judge that the government’s alleged actions were severe enough to violate her due process rights or otherwise render the charges invalid. Key aspects the court will consider include: Evidence of the alleged promise: Did the government explicitly or implicitly promise Salame that Bond wouldn’t be charged if he pleaded guilty? Proving such an agreement, especially if not formally documented, can be difficult. Impact on Salame’s Plea: Did the alleged promise actually induce Salame’s plea? Would he have pleaded guilty otherwise? Severity of Misconduct: Does the alleged conduct rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct warranting dismissal? Courts typically require a high bar for this. The government will have an opportunity to respond to Bond’s motion, likely denying the allegations of misconduct and arguing that the charges against Bond are valid and based on evidence independent of Salame’s plea negotiations. The judge will then review the filings and arguments before making a decision on whether to dismiss the case, allow it to proceed, or perhaps order an evidentiary hearing to investigate the claims further. This legal battle adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing fallout from the FTX collapse . It puts the actions of federal prosecutors under the microscope and could have implications not just for Michelle Bond’s case, but potentially for how other FTX-related legal matters, including existing plea deal s like Ryan Salame ‘s, are viewed. Timeline of Key Events To put this development into perspective, here is a simplified timeline: Date Event Late 2022 FTX Collapse occurs; Investigations begin. September 2023 Ryan Salame pleads guilty to federal charges. Early 2024 Michelle Bond is charged with campaign finance violations. May 2024 Ryan Salame is sentenced to 7 years in prison. May 7, 2024 Michelle Bond files motion to dismiss case, alleging plea deal misconduct. As this timeline shows, Bond’s charges and her current motion to dismiss come well after her husband’s plea and sentencing, but her defense is directly linking the two legal processes. Conclusion: A New Front in the FTX Legal War Michelle Bond’s motion to dismiss her campaign finance case opens a new and contentious front in the sprawling legal battles following the FTX collapse . By alleging prosecutorial misconduct in her husband Ryan Salame ‘s plea deal , her defense team is launching a direct challenge to the government’s methods. This development underscores the high stakes and aggressive legal strategies employed by all parties involved in the fallout of one of the largest financial frauds in recent history. The court’s decision on this motion will be a critical moment, potentially impacting not only Michelle Bond’s future but also shedding more light on the behind-the-scenes tactics used in prosecuting individuals connected to FTX.

That’s the estimated average cost for publicly-listed companies to mine a single Bitcoin during the fourth quarter of 2024. This figure, reported by cryptocurrency market insight platform Unfolded based on CoinShares data, highlights a significant shift in the economics of digital gold production. If you’ve been following the crypto mining scene, you’ll know costs fluctuate. But this jump is substantial. Compared to the third quarter of 2024, when the average cost hovered around $55,950, the Q4 figure represents a steep 47% increase. So, what’s driving this surge in the Bitcoin mining cost ? What Drives the High Bitcoin Mining Cost? Mining Bitcoin isn’t just about plugging in a machine. It involves a complex interplay of factors, each contributing to the overall expense of verifying transactions and minting new coins. For large-scale operations, especially publicly listed Bitcoin miners , these costs are amplified due to scale and infrastructure requirements. The primary components typically include: Electricity: This is almost always the single largest expense. High-powered Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners consume significant amounts of energy. The price of electricity varies dramatically by location and contract type. Hardware (ASIC Miners): The machines themselves are expensive capital investments. Newer, more efficient models come with higher price tags but offer better performance per watt. Infrastructure and Hosting: This includes the cost of building or leasing data centers, cooling systems, security, and internet connectivity. Many public miners operate their own facilities or utilize co-location services. Personnel: Running a large mining operation requires staff for maintenance, monitoring, management, and security. Overhead: Administrative costs, insurance, compliance, and other operational expenses. Financing Costs: For companies that take out loans to purchase hardware or build infrastructure, interest payments add to the cost base. Understanding these components is crucial to grasping why the average cost can reach figures like $82,162 per Bitcoin. Understanding Publicly Listed Bitcoin Miners Why specifically look at publicly listed companies? These aren’t your garage miners. They operate at an industrial scale, managing vast fleets of machines across multiple locations. Being publicly traded means they have reporting requirements, offering a degree of transparency into their operations, finances, and, critically, their operating costs. Analyzing their average cost provides insights into the economics of large-scale mining and the pressures they face, which can differ from smaller, private operations. The Impact of Bitcoin Mining Difficulty on Costs One of the most significant factors influencing the cost per Bitcoin is the network’s mining difficulty. This is an automatically adjusting measure of how hard it is to find a new block (and earn the block reward). As more computing power (hash rate) joins the network, the difficulty increases to keep the average block time around 10 minutes. Conversely, if hash rate leaves the network, difficulty decreases. When Bitcoin mining difficulty increases, miners need to expend more computing power and, consequently, more electricity and operational effort to find a block and earn the same amount of Bitcoin. This directly translates to a higher cost per coin mined, assuming other factors like electricity price and hardware efficiency remain constant. The period leading up to and including Q4 2024 saw significant shifts in network hash rate and difficulty, contributing substantially to the reported cost increase. Electricity: The Miner’s Biggest Variable Cost As mentioned, electricity is paramount. Its cost varies wildly depending on geographical location, time of day, energy source (renewable vs. fossil fuels), and contractual agreements (like Power Purchase Agreements or PPAs). Miners are constantly seeking out locations with cheap and reliable power. However, global energy markets have seen volatility, and increased demand from various sectors can drive prices up, directly impacting the bottom line for miners. A surge in global electricity costs, cited as a reason for the Q4 increase, can unilaterally push up the cost to mine, even if difficulty remains stable. When combined with rising difficulty, the effect on the average Bitcoin mining cost is compounded. Beyond Q3: Why the 47% Jump in Bitcoin Mining Cost? The leap from an average of $55,950 in Q3 to $82,162 in Q4 2024 is steep. The report points to increased mining difficulty and rising global electricity costs as the primary culprits. Let’s break that down: Difficulty Spike: The network’s hash rate saw significant growth post-Bitcoin Halving as new, more efficient machines came online and operations optimized. This increased competition made it harder for individual miners to earn rewards, driving up the cost per Bitcoin mined. Electricity Price Hikes: Regional or global increases in energy prices directly inflate the operational expenditure for miners, raising the dollar cost to produce each coin. It’s also crucial to remember the context of the Bitcoin halving impact . The fourth Bitcoin halving occurred in April 2024, cutting the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. While the halving doesn’t directly change the *operational* cost (electricity, hardware), it halves the Bitcoin revenue per block found. This fundamentally changes the economics. To maintain profitability, miners must become significantly more efficient, or the price of Bitcoin must rise. If neither happens sufficiently, the *effective* dollar cost to produce a Bitcoin (relative to the reward received) increases dramatically, forcing less efficient miners offline and potentially leading to a higher average cost for the remaining, more efficient players who still face high input costs. Navigating the Landscape: Strategies for Crypto Mining Profitability Given these pressures, how do publicly listed Bitcoin miners stay afloat and aim for crypto mining profitability ? They employ various strategies: Hardware Upgrades: Investing in the latest, most energy-efficient ASIC miners is crucial to reduce electricity consumption per terahash. Energy Sourcing & Strategy: Securing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) at favorable rates, utilizing renewable energy sources (which can sometimes be cheaper or offer incentives), and strategically locating operations in regions with low electricity costs. Operational Efficiency: Optimizing cooling systems, minimizing downtime, and streamlining management. Hedging and Financial Management: Employing financial strategies to manage exposure to Bitcoin price volatility and energy price fluctuations. Vertical Integration: Some miners are exploring generating their own power or manufacturing components. Diversification: Mining other cryptocurrencies or providing high-performance computing services. These strategies are vital in a post-halving world where the revenue side of the equation has been significantly altered. The Post-Halving World: How It Reshaped Bitcoin Mining Economics The Bitcoin halving impact is perhaps the most profound long-term factor influencing mining economics. By cutting the block reward, the halving immediately reduces the amount of new Bitcoin miners receive. This means that even if the dollar cost to run their machines stays the same, the cost *per Bitcoin mined* effectively doubles from a revenue perspective, assuming no change in hash rate or electricity cost. This event acts as a stress test for the industry, pushing out inefficient miners and rewarding those who have invested in the latest technology and secured low-cost energy. The high $82,162 average cost in Q4 2024 is a direct consequence of the industry adjusting to this new reality, compounded by the external factors of rising difficulty and energy prices. Miners need the Bitcoin price to be significantly above this operational cost to be profitable and cover capital expenditures. Challenges and Opportunities for Publicly Listed Bitcoin Miners The Q4 2024 figures highlight the significant challenges facing publicly listed Bitcoin miners : intense competition, volatile input costs (electricity, hardware), and the fundamental change in revenue structure post-halving. However, challenges also present opportunities. Challenges: High operational expenditures. Need for continuous capital investment in newer hardware. Reliance on favorable energy markets. Sensitivity to Bitcoin price fluctuations. Regulatory uncertainty in some regions. Opportunities: Gaining market share as less efficient miners exit. Leveraging access to capital for strategic expansion and technology upgrades. Innovating in energy procurement and efficiency. Potential for significant profitability if the Bitcoin price rises above the cost basis. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Network and Price? High mining costs for large players have several implications. If the cost to mine consistently exceeds the Bitcoin price, it puts significant pressure on miners. This could lead to: Increased Sell Pressure: Miners may need to sell a larger portion of the Bitcoin they mine to cover their operational costs, potentially adding selling pressure to the market. Hash Rate Migration/Reduction: Less profitable miners might shut down operations or move to regions with cheaper power, potentially causing temporary dips or shifts in the network’s total hash rate. Network Security: While the network is designed to be resilient, a significant and sustained drop in hash rate could theoretically impact security, though this is less likely with the current scale and distribution. Conversely, the fact that miners are incurring such high costs suggests a belief in future profitability, likely tied to an expectation of a higher Bitcoin price. The market needs to support a price level that makes mining economically viable for the network to remain secure and grow. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin Mining Costs The Q4 2024 figure is a snapshot. Future Bitcoin mining cost will depend on several factors: Technological Advancement: Development of even more efficient ASIC miners. Energy Market Trends: Global energy prices and the adoption of renewable energy sources. Network Hash Rate: Continued growth or consolidation in mining power. Regulatory Landscape: Policies affecting mining operations and energy use. While costs may fluctuate, the trend towards increasing difficulty (as hash rate grows) and the reduced block reward post-halving mean that efficiency and access to low-cost power will remain paramount for sustained crypto mining profitability . Conclusion: Navigating the High-Stakes World of Bitcoin Mining The average $82,162 Bitcoin mining cost for publicly listed companies in Q4 2024 serves as a stark reminder of the capital-intensive and competitive nature of the industry, particularly in the wake of the Bitcoin halving. The near 50% jump from the previous quarter underscores the significant pressures from rising mining difficulty and electricity prices. While the figure appears high, it reflects the operational reality for large-scale miners navigating a post-halving environment. Their ability to adapt through technological upgrades, strategic energy sourcing, and efficient operations will determine their success and continued contribution to the security of the Bitcoin network. For investors and observers, these cost figures provide crucial insights into the health and profitability of the mining sector and its potential impact on the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.

Russian MP Anatoly Aksakov has boldly suggested that this geopolitical instability presents a perfect buying opportunity for Bitcoin, positioning it as a safe-haven asset during times of global conflict. Bitcoin Price Jumps Above $100K Amid Geopolitical Tensions As tensions escalate between India and Pakistan, Chinese defense stocks saw a significant rise, with some gaining up to 20% on Thursday and 36% over two days. However, the spotlight is on Bitcoin price, which recently surpassed the much-anticipated $100K target, trading at $102,758. As Bitcoin’s price continues to climb, the market sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish. Investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a secure investment amid growing global unrest. Russian MP Links India-Pakistan Conflict to Bitcoin Demand Anatoly Aksakov, a key figure in Russia’s cryptocurrency policy , stated that geopolitical instability like the India-Pakistan war often drives investors toward safe-haven assets such as Bitcoin . He suggested that in times of conflict, Bitcoin offers a discreet and efficient way to move money across borders, especially when traditional banking systems are blocked or under heavy scrutiny. Aksakov even speculated that Bitcoin might already be used in some regions for military and weapons deals, though he refrained from naming specific countries. In Aksakov’s view, Bitcoin acts much like gold—a store of value during times of political or economic uncertainty. With India and Pakistan’s tensions intensifying, Aksakov believes that more individuals and institutions could turn to Bitcoin as a means of safeguarding their wealth in volatile times. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Prices Up Today? , Bitcoin’s Growing Role in International Finance Aksakov’s comments come at a time when Russia is increasing its involvement in the cryptocurrency space. As one of the main architects of Russia’s crypto policy, Aksakov has helped shape the country’s digital asset regulations. Russian banks and businesses are actively exploring crypto-based payment solutions, such as Promsvyazbank’s A7 platform , designed for international transactions. This platform is particularly geared towards trade involving both civilian and military goods.Aksakov’s remarks underscore Bitcoin’s evolving role not just as a safe-haven asset but also as a strategic tool in global finance. With rising geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing India-Pakistan conflict, Bitcoin could soon play a more prominent role in international financial systems, allowing for transactions that bypass traditional banking channels. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Regulatory Clarity: Recent ETF approvals and favorable regulatory shifts in major markets like the U.S. and Europe are boosting investor confidence. Supply Dynamics: With only a small fraction of Bitcoin left to be mined, the fixed supply and increasing demand are creating a classic supply squeeze. Bitcoin Key Levels to Watch in 2025 Bitcoin’s technical outlook remains bullish, with critical support around $100,000 and resistance near $110,000. Immediate Support: $100,000 – a psychological level and former resistance turned support. Major Resistance: $110,000 – the next key hurdle for bulls, reflecting Fibonacci extensions and historical price patterns. Long-Term Target: $120,000 – a potential upside target if bullish momentum continues. Conclusion: Why BTC Could Lead the Next Bull Run With the crypto market now worth over $3.22 trillion, Bitcoin’s path to $110,000 seems increasingly likely. Institutional inflows, regulatory clarity, and fixed supply dynamics could fuel the next major breakout, positioning Bitcoin as the centerpiece of the digital asset revolution. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin leads the $3.22T crypto market surge, eyeing $110K next. Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and fixed supply are key drivers. Key levels to watch: $100K support, $110K resistance, $120K long-term targ BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.47M as Flexible 78% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction, crossing $5.47 million in funds raised as it nears its $6.14 million presale cap.

She added that the settlement joined a line of dismissals that collectively eroded the credibility of the agency’s lawyers in court, who were being asked to take legal positions today contrary to the ones taken just months ago. U.S. SEC’s Crenshaw argued that the agency’s settlement with Ripple, alongside the programmatic disassembly of its crypto enforcement program, did a ‘tremendous disservice’ to the investing public and was likely to create a regulatory vacuum that undermined the court’s role in interpreting U.S. securities laws. She pointed out that she could not support the settlement. Crenshaw said the agreement, which stated that neither the SEC nor Ripple would seek to vacate or amend any part of the district court’s summary judgment ruling, undermined the court’s order and it ‘razed’ the civil penalty ruling as well as the court-imposed injunction. She pointed out that the Commission could do absolutely nothing if Ripple decided to sell unregistered XRP tokens to institutional investors—in plain defiance of the court’s order, rendering the hundreds of hours spent by the court in this matter meaningless. Crenshaw says the U.S. SEC’s settlement with Ripple could create a regulatory gap SEC’s Crenshaw slams Ripple settlement, warns of ‘regulatory vacuum’ #Norque #NOQ #Bitcoin #ETH #AI #Blockchain #Blockchain #Law #Policies #Regulation #Crypto — NORQUE-NOQ (@NorqueNoq) May 9, 2025 Crenshaw criticized the proposed SEC-Ripple settlement, warning it could harm investor protections and weaken crypto regulation by creating a regulatory vacuum. The Commission and Ripple submitted a settlement that included dissolving an injunction and returning to Ripple roughly $75 million from escrow. The Commissioner also claimed that the settlement undermined the U.S. SEC and its enforcement program because it subverted the clear and honest application of the facts to the law–a cornerstone of any effective law enforcement program. She added that even if the Crypto Task Force re-wrote registration rules for crypto securities in the future, that did not somehow alter the rules that were in place at the time that Ripple violated them. “We are today accepting a diluted settlement that erases the investor protections we already won, based on a non-existent framework that may or may not come to fruition potentially years from now…This creates a regulatory vacuum with no end in sight.” – Caroline Crenshaw , Commissioner at the U.S. SEC Crenshaw argued that by allowing Ripple to continue operating without admitting wrongdoing or significantly altering its behavior, the U.S. SEC may have set a precedent that weakened its regulatory position and could ultimately harm investors in the long term. Pierce expresses doubt about the terms of the settlement U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (Crypto Mom) also expressed skepticism about the terms of the settlement, claiming that the SEC’s actions against Ripple had caused uncertainty in the crypto market and could have far-reaching implications for the industry as a whole. She was particularly concerned that the agency’s approach to regulating crypto was ‘stifling innovation’ and driving projects overseas. Peirce called for more transparency from the U.S. SEC when it came to regulating the crypto market. She stated that clear guidelines were essential for companies operating in the space to comply with regulations and avoid costly legal battles. Peirce’s criticism of the proposed settlement highlighted the ongoing debate within the agency about how to approach crypto and blockchain technology. The U.S. SEC ’s enforcement actions against Ripple were being watched closely by the crypto community as they could set a precedent for how the agency regulated other digital assets.

Bitcoin has jumped to $104,000, returning to its highs from February. Ethereum surprised everyone by rising 20% in just one day, while XRP also moved up by 7%. So, what’s pushing these top cryptocurrencies higher today? So, what’s driving the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices up? Let’s find out the reason behind this sudden rally. Fed Kept Interest Rate Unchanged Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies started rising after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates the same on May 7. They kept the rates between 4.25% and 4.50% because of worries about slow growth and high inflation. Jerome Powell also said that tariffs could hurt the economy. As a result, investors turned to crypto as a safety net. Global Trade Agreement Is Easing Adding to the optimism, the U.S. and U.K. announced a major trade agreement that not only reduces tariffs but also improves access between markets. And there’s more to come, U.S. and Chinese leaders are getting ready to talk about trade again, which could lead to even lower tariffs. That would be another win for the crypto world. Bitcoin Dominating the Surge Bitcoin’s rise is not just from news, it’s also backed by strong support. U.S. states like Missouri, Arizona, and Oregon passed new crypto-friendly laws. Missouri even removed taxes on Bitcoin gains , making it easier for people to invest. At the same time, Bitcoin ETF saw a consistent inflow of funds pouring into it. On May 8, BTC ETF saw an inflow of $117 million, leading the charge was BlackRock with $69 million, followed by Fidelity & ARK Investment with $35.3 million & $13.1 million .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : India-Pakistan Conflict Will Fuel Bitcoin Price, Says Russian Politician Anatoly Aksakov , Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade While Bitcoin saw an overall 5% surge, Ethereum, on the other hand, stole the spotlight with its Pectra upgrade , improving wallet access and increasing staking limits. This technical leap pushed ETH above $2,220, making it the day’s biggest gainer in the top 25 coins. Despite the rally, Ethereum’s price is still almost 55% down from its all-time high of $4721. Ripple XRP Growing at Faster Paces Meanwhile, the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, XRP, also saw a boost, up nearly 7%, currently trading around $2.29. An additional push in the price came right after the news that Ripple and the SEC might be nearing a settlement . Along with this, Ripple’s new deals with Hidden Road and Wellgistics Health adopting XRP for payments have helped boost its price further. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44360617,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158815,1746769823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Rootstock Unleashes Explosive Growth: Expanding Bitcoin DeFi Ecosystem,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/rootstock-defi-expansion/,"Are you interested in the exciting world of Bitcoin DeFi? A recent report from Messari highlights significant strides made by Rootstock, the leading Bitcoin sidechain, in rapidly expanding its crypto ecosystem . This expansion is driven by key blockchain integrations and strategic partnerships, signaling a bullish trend for DeFi built on Bitcoin’s robust security layer. What is Rootstock and Why Does Bitcoin DeFi Matter? Rootstock (RSK) is a smart contract platform built as a sidechain to the Bitcoin network. It allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi protocols, leveraging Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security while offering smart contract functionality similar to Ethereum. Why is this important? Bitcoin, despite being the largest and most secure cryptocurrency, doesn’t natively support complex smart contracts needed for DeFi. Rootstock solves this by creating a bridge, allowing Bitcoin holders to use their BTC (as rBTC, a 1:1 pegged asset) within a vibrant DeFi environment without selling their original Bitcoin. This unlocks immense potential for Bitcoin’s vast market cap to participate in lending, borrowing, trading, and other DeFi activities. Messari’s Take: Accelerating Rootstock Ecosystem Expansion According to the recent evaluation by Messari, the first quarter of this year marked a period of accelerated expansion for the Rootstock crypto ecosystem . The report points specifically to the growth fueled by strategic partnerships and integrations. This isn’t just organic growth; it’s a deliberate strategy to connect Rootstock with the broader blockchain world and bring more liquidity and users into Bitcoin DeFi. Messari’s analysis underscores the increasing maturity and connectivity of the Bitcoin sidechain, positioning it as a key player in the evolving multi-chain landscape. The focus on blockchain integrations is a clear indicator of Rootstock’s ambition to become a central hub for Bitcoin-backed DeFi. Fueling Growth Through Extensive Blockchain Integrations One of the most compelling points from the Messari report is the significant number of blockchain integrations Rootstock has achieved. The report highlights that Rootstock now supports bridging with over 20 major blockchain networks. This was made possible through collaborations with key cross-chain infrastructure providers like Layer Zero and Stargate. What does this mean in practice? It means users and assets can move more freely between Rootstock and popular chains, including: Ethereum Solana Arbitrum Base And many others… This extensive bridging capability is crucial for attracting liquidity and users from other ecosystems into the Bitcoin DeFi space powered by Rootstock . It lowers the barrier to entry for those already active in DeFi on other networks. Strategic Partnerships Expanding the Rootstock Crypto Ecosystem Beyond cross-chain bridges, Rootstock has also been busy forming strategic partnerships with various projects and protocols. These collaborations aim to bring new services, tools, and users into the crypto ecosystem built on the Bitcoin sidechain. The Messari report specifically mentions partnerships with: Meson Finance: Likely enhancing stablecoin swaps and cross-chain liquidity. Anon Market: Suggesting expansion into privacy-preserving or unique market functionalities. Eisen Labs: Potentially related to infrastructure, development tools, or specific dApps. Gelato: Often involved in automation of smart contracts, improving reliability and efficiency for dApps on Rootstock. These partnerships are vital for building a diverse and functional crypto ecosystem that offers a wide range of DeFi services, moving beyond just basic asset transfers. Record Merged Mining Participation: A Sign of Strength Another key metric highlighted in the Messari report is Rootstock’s merged mining participation rate. In the first quarter, this rate reached an impressive 81%, hitting an all-time high. Merged mining allows Bitcoin miners to simultaneously mine Rootstock blocks without expending additional hash power. Why is a high merged mining rate significant for the Bitcoin sidechain? It directly contributes to Rootstock’s security. The higher the participation rate, the more Bitcoin’s hash power is securing the Rootstock network, making it incredibly robust and resistant to attacks. The 81% figure demonstrates strong support from the Bitcoin mining community, reinforcing Rootstock’s position as the most secure platform for Bitcoin DeFi. Looking Ahead: Boosting Transaction Speed The Messari report also touches upon Rootstock’s future plans. One significant development on the horizon is the planned introduction of a new protocol aimed at improving transaction processing speed. This is anticipated in the second half of this year. Transaction speed and cost are critical factors for user experience in DeFi. While Rootstock transactions are already significantly faster and cheaper than on the main Bitcoin chain, further improvements would make the platform even more competitive and user-friendly, potentially attracting a larger user base to the Rootstock crypto ecosystem. Benefits and Actionable Insights What does this accelerated expansion mean for users and developers? For Users: More options to use their BTC in DeFi via rBTC, access to a wider range of dApps and services, easier movement of assets between Rootstock and other chains thanks to enhanced blockchain integrations. For Developers: A growing crypto ecosystem with increasing liquidity and user activity, robust security inherited from Bitcoin, and potentially improved infrastructure with future speed upgrades. Actionable Insight: If you hold Bitcoin and are curious about DeFi, now might be a good time to explore the dApps available on Rootstock and understand how you can securely participate using your BTC. Look into bridging services supported by the Bitcoin sidechain. Are There Challenges? While the report is overwhelmingly positive, like any growing ecosystem, Rootstock faces ongoing challenges. Increasing user adoption requires continuous education about how sidechains and rBTC work. Competition from other layer-2 solutions and alternative DeFi platforms is also a factor. However, the strong focus on blockchain integrations and security via merged mining are significant advantages. Conclusion: A Promising Future for Rootstock and Bitcoin DeFi The Messari report paints a clear picture: Rootstock is not standing still. By aggressively pursuing blockchain integrations and strategic partnerships, the Bitcoin sidechain is successfully accelerating the expansion of its crypto ecosystem.

Meanwhile, Ripple is also entangled in political controversy after a lobbyist allegedly tricked Donald Trump into promoting XRP for his proposed national cryptocurrency reserve. Trump shared that he felt misled, and reportedly severed ties with the lobbyist, although he later signed an executive order establishing a national “Digital Asset Stockpile.” Despite the turmoil, Ripple gained a win in the private sector with Wellgistics Health announcing it will integrate XRP into its payment system for real-time healthcare settlements. XRP’s price surged by almost 7% after the settlement news and the announcement from Welligistics Health. However, resistance to crypto innovation is still very strong. Ripple Settlement Could Undermine Investor Protections A crypto-skeptical commissioner at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voiced strong opposition to the agency’s proposed settlement with Ripple. In a joint letter that was filed in a New York court, the SEC and Ripple requested the dissolution of a 2024 injunction and the return of $75 million of the $125 million in penalties held in escrow to the crypto firm. The move was revealed in a May 8 statement , and caused backlash from SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. She argues that the deal weakens the regulator’s authority and undermines investor protections. Statement from Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw Crenshaw warned that the agreement could erode the credibility of the SEC’s legal team and destabilize the interpretation of securities laws. She is especially concerned about the regulator’s shifting stance under the Trump administration after the hardline approach of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. She believes this signals a retreat from meaningful crypto enforcement. “This settlement, alongside the programmatic disassembly of the SEC’s crypto enforcement program, does a tremendous disservice to the investing public and undermines the court’s role in interpreting our securities laws,” Crenshaw stated. Crenshaw added that the deal threatens to create a “regulatory vacuum” and diminish previous legal victories that were meant to protect investors. Her comments shed some light on the growing internal division at the agency as it grapples with how to regulate the crypto industry. The SEC originally sued Ripple Labs in December of 2020, alleging it sold XRP as an unregistered security. In August 2024, a judge ruled XRP sales to institutional investors fell under securities laws, and ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in penalties. Despite the joint settlement agreement, former federal prosecutor James Filan said that the legal saga is not yet over. Judge Analisa Torres must issue an indicative ruling signaling her agreement with the deal. If she does, both parties will then ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for a limited remand to proceed with formalizing the settlement. Only after the injunction is officially lifted, the funds returned, and both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal are dismissed, will the case officially be over. Ripple Lobbyist Duped Trump Into Promoting XRP Ripple is facing controversy from other political fronts as well. US President Donald Trump was reportedly misled by a lobbyist with ties to Ripple Labs into endorsing XRP as part of a proposed national cryptocurrency reserve. Trump post (Source: Truth Social ) According to a May 8 report from Politico , a staff member working for pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard suggested language for a social media post promoting a strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Trump shared the post on his platform on March 2, but later discovered that Ripple was a client of Ballard. Trump ended up expressing anger over being manipulated. Two sources close to the matter said that Trump felt used and declared Ballard unwelcome in future activities. The relationship between Ripple and Trump’s circle reportedly extends back years. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty contributed more than $300,000 to Trump-affiliated campaign and political action committees during the 2024 election cycle . Both Alderoty and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also attended meetings with Trump during his transition into office and participated in inauguration events. Ripple itself also contributed $5 million worth of XRP to Trump’s inaugural fund and is still a major donor to Fairshake, a PAC supporting pro-crypto political candidates. Fairshake stated that it will continue these efforts during the 2026 midterm elections. Despite the controversy, Trump still proceeded with crypto-related policymaking just days after the social media post. On March 6, he signed an executive order establishing a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” formalizing his administration’s move toward a national crypto reserve. The March 2 post was still visible on his social media at press time. XRP price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Over the past 24 hours of trading, the price of XRP shot up by close to 7%, likely due to the settlement news with the SEC. As a result, XRP was trading hands at $2.32. The altcoin was also in the green by over 4% on its weekly time frame. XRP Powers New Healthcare Payment System Despite the tensions surrounding Ripple and its token, there are still some positive developments related to the project. Wellgistics Health, a healthcare infrastructure company, announced on May 8 that it will integrate XRP and related blockchain technologies into its payment network to streamline financial transactions across the healthcare supply chain. Wellgistics Health announcement The company plans to use XRP to facilitate instant, low-cost settlements between pharmacies, medical suppliers, and prescription drug manufacturers. CEO Brian Norton believes that future success in healthcare will depend on speed, data integrity, and platform efficiency, and added that Wellgistics is investing in next-generation infrastructure rather than relying on outdated systems. The company is especially impressed with XRP’s near-instant finality and transaction fees that cost fractions of a cent. This is a lot different than legacy systems like ACH payments and wire transfers. By leveraging blockchain payment rails, Wellgistics wants to eliminate cross-border friction and create real-time settlement capabilities, enabling new business models and expanding access to global markets, particularly for underserved regions and developing economies. Unfortunately, the broader financial industry still pushes back against crypto-based innovations. Traditional banks criticized the GENIUS stablecoin bill that was introduced in March 2025, and warned that it could undercut their market dominance by allowing stablecoin providers to offer similar services without the same level of regulation. US Senator Elizabeth Warren wanted to impose strict provisions in the bill, requiring any stablecoin issuers operating in the US to do so under the oversight of established financial institutions. Despite initial bipartisan support, the GENIUS bill failed to move forward after meeting resistance from Democratic lawmakers.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-09 05:58:20

The rise in prices is linked to various factors like Bitcoin’s rise above $100,000 and Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade among others. Ethereum led the surge with a 20% surge, while XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano are all following with 5-7% gains. Ethereum Hits $2000 Ethereum saw its biggest gain since 2021 as it crossed the $2,000 mark. This rise follows Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade , which went live yesterday. The Pectra Upgrade is its biggest since the 2022 Merge, which has brought some major changes. It has increased the staking limit, improved the wallet usability with smart contract features, and implemented nine other EIPs Ethereum’s on-chain metrics also look strong, as its total value locked rose to $57.9 billion, as per data from DefiLama . Its daily transactions also grew 22% over the last month. But a 95% drop in Ether’s fees shows that Ethereum’s rise to $3,000 might take longer than traders expect. Its network activity has been weaker since 2021, so a full recovery may still be far away. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : India-Pakistan Conflict Will Fuel Bitcoin Price, Says Russian Politician Anatoly Aksakov , Key Levels To Watch Analysts are predicting that Ethereum could surge up to $3,000 , with some even expecting it to hit as high as $3,500 in the future. Analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that Ethereum’s big hurdle is at $2,380. It is struggling to break past this level, where it has faced tough resistance in the past. If it manages to break through that level, then it could spark a fresh rally. Source: Ali X Post Analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that Ether’s recent jump above $2,100, a $300 increase in just one day, is a significant move. Expanding liquidity, the business cycle, and easing fiscal policies are acting as major tailwinds for the broader crypto market and Ethereum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44361024,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158816,1746770416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Transfer: $346M BTC Movement Hits Major Crypto Exchanges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/large-bitcoin-transfer-exchanges/,"Big news just hit the wires! In a significant move that’s catching the eye of market watchers, a large Bitcoin transfer totaling hundreds of millions of dollars has landed on some of the biggest crypto exchanges globally. This kind of activity often sparks debate and speculation about potential market movements. Let’s dive into the details of this massive inflow and what it might signal for the Bitcoin price . Unpacking the Massive Bitcoin Transfer Details According to data tracked by the CryptoQuant Alert channel, a substantial amount of Bitcoin changed hands recently. Over a period of just seven hours, a total of 3,444.83 Bitcoin (BTC) was transferred to three prominent exchanges. At the time of the transfers, this amount was valued at approximately $346 million. These aren’t small retail movements; this points to significant players in the market. Here’s a breakdown of where the Bitcoin went: Binance: 1,269.22 BTC (approximately $131 million) Gemini: 1,087.99 BTC (approximately $110 million) Coinbase Pro: 1,087.62 BTC (approximately $105 million) Seeing such large sums arrive on exchanges is noteworthy. While the exact reasons behind the transfers aren’t always immediately clear, these movements are closely monitored by analysts looking for clues about market sentiment and potential future actions by large holders. Why Does a Bitcoin Transfer to Crypto Exchanges Matter? Transfers of Bitcoin onto crypto exchanges are often interpreted as a potential signal that the holder intends to sell. When large amounts of BTC move from private wallets (like cold storage or custodial services) to exchange hot wallets, it increases the supply available for trading on those platforms. If the incoming Bitcoin is indeed sold, it adds selling pressure to the market, which could potentially impact the Bitcoin price . Conversely, large withdrawals of Bitcoin from exchanges are often seen as a bullish sign, suggesting that holders are moving their assets into long-term storage, indicating an intention to hold rather than sell. However, it’s crucial to understand that a transfer to an exchange doesn’t automatically mean a sale is imminent. The Bitcoin could be moved for various reasons, such as: Preparing for potential trading opportunities (buying or selling). Using exchange services like staking, lending, or derivatives trading. Consolidating funds. Meeting regulatory requirements or internal treasury management. Despite the ambiguity, the sheer size of this particular large Bitcoin transfer makes it a data point worth considering when assessing the current market landscape. Understanding the Role of BTC Whales Individuals or entities holding vast amounts of Bitcoin are often referred to as BTC whales . Their movements can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of their holdings. A single whale’s decision to buy or sell a large amount of BTC can impact liquidity and price volatility. Tracking the activity of BTC whales is a key part of on-chain analysis, which studies transactions recorded on the public blockchain. Services like CryptoQuant specialize in aggregating and interpreting this data to provide insights into whale behavior and overall market trends. This recent inflow highlights the continued presence and potential influence of these large holders on the market structure facilitated by crypto exchanges . Potential Impact on Bitcoin Price? As mentioned earlier, large inflows to exchanges are typically viewed as potentially bearish signals because they increase the readily available supply for selling. If a significant portion of this $346 million worth of Bitcoin is indeed sold, it could exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price in the short term. However, the market’s reaction depends on many factors, including overall market sentiment, trading volume, and other macroeconomic news. It’s also possible that the market has already absorbed or anticipated such movements. Furthermore, the Bitcoin could be used for purposes other than immediate selling, mitigating the direct selling pressure. Traders and analysts will be closely watching the order books and subsequent price action on Binance, Gemini, and Coinbase Pro to see if this inflow translates into actual sell orders. Tracking Significant Bitcoin Transfer Events Events like this Bitcoin transfer underscore the value of on-chain monitoring tools. Services that track movements of large amounts of crypto provide a layer of transparency into market activity that isn’t always visible through price charts alone. While interpreting these movements requires expertise and context, they offer valuable clues about the intentions of major market participants. Staying informed about significant transfers and whale activity can be an important part of a comprehensive market analysis strategy, alongside technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and monitoring news developments. It helps build a more complete picture of the forces potentially influencing the Bitcoin price . Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Exchange Flows The recent transfer of over 3,400 BTC, valued at $346 million, to major crypto exchanges is a notable event in the crypto space. While not a guaranteed predictor of future price movements, such a large Bitcoin transfer is often seen as increasing the potential for selling pressure. It highlights the ongoing activity of BTC whales and the importance of monitoring on-chain data. Market participants should remain vigilant and consider this inflow as one piece of the larger puzzle when evaluating the short-term outlook for the Bitcoin price .

Bitcoin Only 6% Off Its All-Time High Over the past months, aggressive tariff strategies implemented by Trump negatively impacted cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant correction. The digital asset dropped to as low as $74,000, marking a 25% decline from its record high of $109,000 reached in January. However, the President’s decision to pause his so-called “tariff war” has led to a remarkable rebound in crypto prices boosted by a $6 billion trade deal with the UK announced on Thursday.

In the thirty-days time frame, the market’s largest cryptocurrency has recorded a staggering 31% price surge, positioning it just 6.7% below its all-time high. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of the crypto exchange Nexo, remarked: Bitcoin has not only reclaimed $100,000 for the first time in three months but has also reaffirmed its status as the ultimate bouncebackable asset as the prospects for US trade deals brighten. Other major cryptocurrencies have also benefited from this shift. Ethereum (ETH) has regained the $2,000 mark for the first time since late March, experiencing a 12% surge in just 24 hours, while Dogecoin (DOGE) followed closely with an 11% increase. Trenchev pointed out that Bitcoin’s recent performance is bolstered by a supportive pro-crypto administration and increased buying interest from spot-exchage-traded fund (ETF) investors. He noted that Bitcoin’s outperformance against US equity benchmarks in 2025 reinforces its status as a resilient and safe-haven asset. Analysts Warn Of Challenges Ahead Amid Global Uncertainty Despite the current bullish sentiment, Trenchev cautioned that Bitcoin’s resilience will be tested amid an uncertain global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Rising tensions between India and Pakistan pose potential risks, while the US Federal Reserve (Fed) remains cautious about cutting interest rates amid concerns over unemployment and inflation.

In order to confirm its upward trend, analysts predict that Bitcoin will need to break above its January high of over $109,350. According to Trenchev, the cryptocurrency’s price might stay between $70,000 and $109,000 for the months following the election. Nevertheless, he emphasized that reclaiming the $100,000 milestone is a significant achievement for Bitcoin. “Buying during peak fear—just last month Bitcoin was languishing around $74,000—can be exceptionally lucrative,” he concluded.

At the time of publication, Ether ( ETH ) is trading at $2,230, up 19.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said it was a “pretty insane candle.” Over the same 24 hours, Ether Open Interest (OI) spiked 21%. Ether price pump caught traders offside The surge followed the long-awaited Pectra Upgrade, which went live on May 7 , introducing new wallet features, increased staking limits and scalability improvements to Ethereum. Popular crypto trader Alex Kruger said on May 8 that Ether’s price spike was primarily due to “new longs.” If Ether were to fall back to $2,000, approximately $2.06 billion in long positions would be at risk of liquidation, according to CoinGlass data. The price surge caught many traders offside, with approximately $328 million in Ether short positions liquidated over the same period. Crypto trader Bob Loukas said , “ETH holders thinking this might finally be the turning point.” 2025 has not been a strong year for Ether’s price, which fell 56% from its Jan. 1 price to $1,472 by April 9 — its lowest point this year — as sentiment weakened throughout the year. Ether is up 52% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Ether’s recent rally coincides with Bitcoin ( BTC ) gaining 3.59% over the same period and nearly 6% over the past seven days, reclaiming the $100,000 mark on May 8 for the first time in over three months. In comments to Cointelegraph, onchain options protocol Derive founder Nick Forster said Ether’s recent price surge was due to a combination of factors, beyond just the Pectra hard fork. Forster pointed out the US trade deal with the UK, where US President Donald Trump “slashed tariffs on British cars and steel.” He also pointed to the crypto exchange Coinbase, which announced the acquisition of Deribit for $2.9 billion.

For the third day running, spot Ether ETFs posted outflows on May 8, totaling $16.1 million, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, the overall crypto market also saw an uptick in prices and sentiment following Bitcoin’s surge.

The rally was backed by a sharp rise in trading activity, especially in the derivatives market, whose volume jumped 184%, as per Coinglass data . Open interest in Ethereum ( ETH ) futures has climbed 20% in the past 24 hours, signaling a wave of fresh capital entering the market. Rising open interest alongside price usually points to the start of a new trend, as traders build long positions rather than simply covering shorts. Meanwhile, more than $265 million in short positions were liquidated, adding fuel to the upward momentum. Even though Ethereum has risen 54% in the last month, it’s down 26% so far this year, but there’s still potential for a recovery if momentum continues. The rally coincides with the ongoing decline in the ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value ratio. On a May 8 post on X, analysts at CryptoQuant noted that, based on this ratio, Ethereum is now at its most undervalued level relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ) since 2019. ETH is now extremely undervalued compared to BTC, the first time since 2019. Historically, this led to Ethereum outperforming. However, supply pressure, weak demand, and flat activity could stall a rebound. pic.twitter.com/QqU2Xh3vo9 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 8, 2025 You might also like: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is a game changer, staking infrastructure firm P2P.org explains The MVRV ratio indicates whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market cap to its realized capitalization, or the average price at which tokens last moved. Currently, the ETH/BTC MVRV ratio has fallen into a historically low range of 0.4–0.8, levels last seen in 2019. In past cycles, such undervaluation zones preceded prolonged ETH outperformance against BTC, including in 2017, 2019, and 2021. Although the signal appears bullish on paper, macro and on-chain data indicate Ethereum might not be able to easily repeat its past. The current cycle is marked by stagnant network activity, rising token supply, and underperforming ETFs, all of which have a significant effect on ETH’s potential price. Ethereum’s circulating supply recently hit an all-time high, reversing the previous deflationary trend. Lower mainnet fees and a decline in ETH burns have altered its supply dynamics since EIP-1559. Active addresses are also flat, and decentralized finance activity has leveled off. Even institutional flows appear muted , with major Ethereum ETFs like Grayscale’s ETHE seeing billions in outflows. Although the ETH/BTC MVRV appears to be flashing a bottom at the moment, it is unclear if this will signal another altseason led by Ethereum. Ethereum may require a fresh catalyst, such as the approval of staking in ETH ETFs or renewed DeFi interest, to sustain its momentum.

Price surged past resistance near $1,910, reaching above $2,200. RSI at 77.90 signals overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term pullback. However, momentum remains strong with the 9-day SMA acting as dynamic support. If bulls sustain control, further upside is likely to $2,350. In contrast, traders need to watch out for the support at $1,850. High Price : $2,350 Low Price : $1,850 Average Price : $2,050 Why ETH Price Will Surge in Q2-2025? Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V : Ethereum’s co-founder has suggested replacing the EVM bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set, making Ethereum more adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 If Ethereum manages to stay above this support, it could gradually rise towards $2,400 or more. However, Ethereum will face resistance around $2,500, so it may take time to break through this level. The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925.

This move adds to Sui’s latest integrations and partnerships, which already include those with Circle ( USDC ), Stacks ( STX ), and Mastercard. SUI’s price rallied over 20% in the wake of the announcement but has seen a modest pullback from its 24-hour high of $4.07. Now trading at $3.86, the asset is still up 6% over the last day, with trading volume surging 119% to $3.3 billion. The long/short ratio is at 1.0008, indicating a balanced attitude among leveraged traders, while open interest is up 10%, according to Coinglass’s derivatives data .

The relative strength index, which is at 69, is just below the overbought level, suggesting that momentum is slowing down. SUI price analysis. Credit: crypto.news However, SUI is trading comfortably above all of the major moving averages in the 10–200 day range, which continue to support a bullish trend. The MACD remains in positive territory while other momentum indicators, such as the Stochastic RSI, display neutral signals. The uptrend might continue if SUI can stay above the $3.70 support level. A decisive move above the recent high could open the door to new levels around $4.40. On the flip side, a failure to maintain current levels might trigger a retest of the $3.30 zone, where several moving averages converge. As fundamentals continue to solidify following expanding partnerships and integrations, Sui’s technical setup currently points to a healthy consolidation phase rather than a breakdown.

44361264,https://crypto.news/?p=14377640,1746770943,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/44361264.jpeg,Meta may be eyeing stablecoin payments for Instagram creators,https://crypto.news/meta-may-be-eyeing-stablecoin-payments-for-instagram-creators/,"Meta could be looking to re-enter the cryptocurrency space by integrating stablecoin payments across its platforms. On May 8, five sources familiar with the development t o ld Fortune that the tech giant is in early talks with crypto infrastructure firms to explore stablecoin use cases, potentially for small-scale creator payouts on platforms like Instagram. Executives involved in the talks suggest that Meta is considering a multi-token strategy and may remain agnostic about which stablecoins it supports. Options under consideration reportedly include major players like USDT and USDC, with the primary focus being cost-efficiency and ease of integration across global markets. Stablecoins could allow Meta to reduce transaction fees and streamline cross-border payments, especially in countries where traditional payout systems are slower or more expensive. However, sources noted that discussions were at a preliminary stage, and described Meta as being in “learn mode.” As part of its renewed crypto push, Meta recently hired Ginger Baker as Vice President of Product. Baker, a former Plaid executive and current board member of the Stellar Development Foundation, brings deep fintech and blockchain experience. Sources say she is helping shape Meta’s stablecoin initiatives internally and is involved in the company’s outreach to crypto partners.

The project sought to create a global digital currency backed by a basket of fiat currencies and supported by a consortium that included major names like Uber and PayPal. However, it quickly ran into intense political and regulatory resistance , both in the U.S. and abroad. By early 2022, Meta abandoned the initiative entirely and sold off Diem’s assets to crypto-friendly bank Silvergate. Stablecoins have gained significant traction since then, especially among fintechs and institutional players, especially in the United States. Under the Trump administration, stablecoins have been positioned as a key element of U.S. financial strategy. As previously reported by crypto.news, Stripe, for example, recently launched stablecoin-based financial accounts in over 100 countries on May 7. Last month, payments giant Visa partnered with Bridge and invested in stablecoin startup BVNK, while Fidelity is developing a stablecoin of its own. But as corporate adoption accelerates, Washington remains divided on how to regulate the booming stablecoin market. On May 8, the U.S. Senate voted against advancing the GENIUS Act, a key piece of legislation aimed at establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. The procedural cloture vote failed 48–49, falling short of the 60 votes needed to begin formal debate. Although the bill had previously cleared the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support, it ultimately stalled after several Senate Democrats raised last-minute objections. Their concerns focused on the lack of robust protections against illicit financial activity and potential risks associated with stablecoins issued by foreign entities.

Known for blending decentralized technology with dynamic gaming experiences, MTT is using this global stage to showcase its evolution into a more mature, utility-driven ecosystem—moving beyond the era of free token incentives and into a future built on precision, deflation, and community empowerment. From Free Mining to Precision Rewards: The Launch of “Trial Tickets” MTT Sports is officially closing the chapter on its free mining competition model, a strategy that served well in bootstrapping early user growth. While effective in drawing wide attention, the model is being retired in favor of a smarter, more targeted approach to token distribution. Introducing the “Trial Ticket” system —a new incentive mechanism designed to reward genuine engagement and platform contributions . This move shifts the platform’s focus from casting a wide net to laser-focused value delivery , ensuring that only active, contributing users receive token benefits. It’s a bold step toward aligning token utility with user behavior, ensuring long-term sustainability and meaningful growth. “We’ve always believed in evolving with our users. The Trial Ticket system helps us reward the real players—the ones building with us,” said a representative from MTT Sports. Burning for the Future: A 1 Billion Token Destruction Plan In one of the most impactful tokenomics moves of 2025, MTT Sports is initiating a massive token burn of 1 billion MTT , nearly 50% of its total supply . This strategic burn will drastically reduce the circulating token volume, enhance long-term value, and build greater confidence among investors and users. This isn’t just about scarcity—it’s about signaling a clear transition. MTT is shifting gears from the high-speed pursuit of expansion to a more measured, sustainable growth model . This aligns with broader market expectations of value-driven Web3 projects in the next bull cycle. “We’re not here for hype. We’re here to build a long-lasting, value-rich platform that evolves with its community.” Enter the Club Era: Social Play Meets Decentralized Customization To further enrich the platform’s social fabric, MTT Sports is rolling out a powerful new Club System —a feature that will empower users to create clubs , organize tournaments , and engage in multi-currency settlement competitions . This flexible system allows for highly customizable events , tailored to user preferences, regional trends, and community needs. This is more than a feature—it’s a decentralized ecosystem builder , giving the MTT community tools to co-create the future of Web3 sports competition. Key highlights of the club system: Create and manage clubs with ease Host competitions using various tokens Design event formats and rules based on member preferences Promote decentralized governance in community-led events This innovation reinforces MTT’s commitment to user empowerment and ecosystem co-construction , making it not just a platform, but a movement in the decentralized sports world. Conclusion: Leading Web3 Sports into the Next Chapter As MTT Sports steps onto the global stage at TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025 as a Platinum Sponsor, it’s doing more than showcasing technology—it’s signaling the next phase of its mission.

44361342,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158799,1746771058,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking: Coinbase Earnings Miss as Crypto Trading Volume Plummets 10%,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-earnings-crypto-volume/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, earnings reports from major players like Coinbase often provide crucial insights into the health of the market. Recently, the leading cryptocurrency exchange released its Q1 earnings report, and the results fell significantly short of Wall Street’s expectations, sending ripples through the investment community and impacting Coinbase stock . What Happened with Coinbase Earnings in Q1? Coinbase reported revenue of $2 billion for the first quarter, a figure that unfortunately missed analyst expectations and marked a decline from the $2.27 billion reported in the previous quarter (Q4). This revenue miss was accompanied by a stark difference in profitability, with earnings per share coming in at a mere $0.24, drastically lower than the estimated $1.93 per share analysts had projected. The primary driver behind this performance was a noticeable slowdown in trading activity: Trading Volume Dip: Total crypto trading volume on the platform decreased by 10% to $393.1 billion compared to the prior quarter. Transaction Revenue Hit: Consequently, transaction revenue, which is heavily dependent on trading volume and a core part of Coinbase’s business model, dropped by a significant 19%. These numbers highlight the direct correlation between market volatility, investor sentiment, and the financial performance of exchanges like Coinbase. Why Did Crypto Trading Volume Decline? Coinbase attributed the softer performance and reduced crypto trading volume to several key factors: Declining Crypto Prices: A general downtrend or sideways movement in cryptocurrency prices can often lead to reduced trading activity as speculative interest wanes. U.S. Tariff Policies: While perhaps less direct, broader economic policies, including tariffs, can contribute to macroeconomic uncertainty, influencing investor risk appetite across all asset classes, including crypto. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical events all play a role in shaping the investment landscape. When the macro environment is uncertain, investors may pull back from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. These external pressures combined to create a less favorable environment for high-volume trading, directly impacting Coinbase’s top and bottom lines. What Does This Mean for Coinbase Stock and Investors? The immediate reaction from the market was negative. According to CoinDesk, Coinbase stock saw a decline of 2.7% in post-market trading following the earnings announcement. While not a massive single-day drop, it reflects investor disappointment and concern about the company’s ability to navigate the current market conditions. For investors holding or considering Coinbase stock , this report serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility tied to the crypto market cycle. Coinbase’s profitability is closely linked to trading volume, which itself is highly sensitive to price movements and market sentiment. When the market is booming, Coinbase thrives; when it cools off, its financial performance can suffer. Key Takeaways for Investors: Volatility is Key: Coinbase’s financials are a barometer for retail and institutional crypto trading activity. Diversification Efforts: While trading fees are dominant, watch Coinbase’s efforts to diversify revenue streams (e.g., staking, subscriptions, blockchain services) to mitigate the impact of trading volume swings. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Evaluate whether the Q1 results are a temporary setback due to market conditions or indicative of deeper challenges for the cryptocurrency exchange . Understanding these nuances is crucial for anyone tracking the performance of major crypto-native companies. Beyond the Numbers: The Role of a Leading Cryptocurrency Exchange Despite missing Q1 earnings targets, Coinbase remains a pivotal player in the global crypto ecosystem. As a regulated and publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange , it often sets standards for compliance and security. Its performance is watched not just by stock market investors but also by those interested in the broader adoption and maturation of cryptocurrencies. The challenges faced by Coinbase in Q1 are not unique to the platform; they reflect the broader state of the market during that period. Reduced volatility and price consolidation often lead to lower trading volumes across the board. However, as a market leader, Coinbase’s results are a high-profile indicator of these trends. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Market Cycles Coinbase’s Q1 performance, marked by missed Coinbase earnings and a dip in crypto trading volume , underscores the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. While disappointing for investors focused on short-term gains and analyst targets, it reflects the current phase of market activity influenced by macro factors and price consolidation. The reaction in Coinbase stock highlights how closely tied the company’s valuation is to trading activity. As the market evolves, the ability of major exchanges like Coinbase to adapt, diversify, and maintain user trust during quieter periods will be key to their long-term success.

The San Francisco-based company said revenue rose 24% year-on-year to $2b . However, that figure was down about 10% from the previous quarter and fell short of analyst estimates of $2.1b, according to LSEG data. Transaction revenue remained a key contributor, increasing 17.3% to $1.26b. Meanwhile, revenue from the firm’s growing subscription and services business jumped 37% to $698.1m. This unit includes offerings such as staking and custodial services, which are less dependent on trading activity. Our Q1 2025 financial results are now live. pic.twitter.com/qyIufvpEvB — Coinbase (@coinbase) May 8, 2025 Heavy Marketing Spend and Asset Losses Drag Down Coinbase Profit Net income for the quarter plunged 94% to $66m, or 24 cents per share, as the firm booked losses related to the declining value of its crypto holdings. Coinbase marks these assets to market each quarter, exposing its earnings to the volatile swings in cryptocurrency prices. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a net income of $526.6m, or $1.94 per share, compared to $2.53 a year ago. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3b, driven by heavier marketing spend and losses on held crypto assets. The stock dipped around 2% in after-hours trading and is down 17% so far this year. Coinbase Bets on Derivatives as User Base Grows Beyond Trading Despite the earnings miss, the platform logged its second-highest monthly transacting user count in company history. Chief financial officer Alesia Haas said many customers are now engaging with a broader range of services beyond trading. “We are gaining share, we are driving utility,” she said. “We are seeing a healthy maturation of the products.” Coinbase also announced the acquisition of Deribit in a deal valued at $2.9b. The move signals the company’s ambition to expand deeper into the crypto derivatives market, a sector where Deribit handled nearly $1.2t in volume last year. Looking ahead, Coinbase said it expects second-quarter revenue from subscriptions and services to fall between $600m and $680m. The company also disclosed that it generated about $240m in transaction revenue in April. While revenues from Circle’s USDC stablecoin rose 32% sequentially to $298m, growth was partially tempered by lower average interest rates.

But a new titan is silently emerging in the shadow of the giants: Rexas Finance (RXS) , a powerhouse project currently valued under $0.25 that is positioned as one of the most explosive altcoins of the current cycle. And should its present momentum keep, it might not only surpass XRP—it could completely eclipse Ripple’s story of comeback. From $0.20 to $50: A Reasonable Leap? At the time of writing, RXS is at $0.20 in its Stage 12 presale, with a launch price of $0.25 already locked in. This presale is a phenomenon in motion, with over $48 million raised and 92% of tokens sold. Though some might dismiss the thought of a token skyrocketing from $0.20 to $50, let’s not forget what crypto has repeatedly taught us: Anything is possible when demand matches narrative, and actual utility supports the excitement. Thousands of meme coins we have seen have no use. Imagine now a project combining actual applications with tremendous growth potential. That corresponds with Rexas Finance. What gives Rexas its explosive quality? Rexas Finance is a real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing ecosystem, not another DeFi platform or NFT tool. On the blockchain, it lets consumers tokenize, own, and trade almost any real-world asset—from real estate and commodities to intellectual property and fine art. Consider the ramifications: from your mobile wallet, fractional ownership of a beautiful home in Bali or a share in a Picasso masterpiece is all available. This disrupts the established financial industry, not only an invention. This is the reason why RXS has excellent explosive capability. Rexas enables people unlike XRP, which mainly targets banks and institutional payments. Through sites like, tokenizing gives regular users, producers, and business owners hands-on control. Rexas Token Builder lets anyone design and distribute tokens in minutes without using any code. Perfect for startup initiatives, Rexas Launchpad is a dispersed token funding ecosystem. An AI-powered engine producing premium digital art and NFTs is Rexas GenAI. Rexas is creating a digital economy rather than just a token since this end-to-end ecosystem is both user-friendly and scalable. Certified by CertiK, Audited and Verified to inspire confidence in security Security and trust are among the main problems afflicting newly launched cryptocurrency projects. Investors have grown rightly dubious after many rug pulls and smart contract abuses. Rexas Finance expected this issue and decided strategically to have a complete security audit by CertiK, among the most reputable blockchain security companies worldwide. The outcome is that Rexas gives investors institutional credibility and peace of mind as it is 100% secure and verified. This action alone puts Rexas in a class above several speculative coins fighting for market attention. It’s a tremendous benefit over XRP’s early years, when security analysis and regulatory uncertainty sometimes overshadowed its potential. Why Rexas Selected Presale Over Investment in Venture Capital? Rexas’s refusal to provide conventional venture capital funding is one of the most indicative of his long-term perspective. The company chose a fair, community-driven presale instead of early power and large token distributions to VCs, immediately handing the tokens to users. This choice fosters trust and natural development, enhancing decentralization rather than only promoting it. It tells Rexas that it is a movement fueled by real people who trust in the platform, not just another token for institutional flipping. By lowering early dump pressure, this grassroots method also provides RXS with a far more steady and hopeful path following launch. This plan is working thus far. With almost 460 million tokens sold already, the community is showing up in waves, and interest is rising quickly as presale venues dry out. RXS against XRP: The Emerging Story Ripple has come a long way—winning significant legal successes, advocating institutional collaborations, and constantly expanding its payment system. The terrain of cryptocurrencies has changed, though. Investors are searching for decentralized, scalable, user-first platforms that can define the future financial era rather than merely for the next great centralized solution. That is the platform used by Rexas Finance. Rexas lives in the hands of the regular investor, while XRP depends on banks to embrace its tech. Built for scale, inclusive design, and future expansion, it is meant. And the upside is astonishing, given a starting price under $0.25. Though it sounds ambitious, let’s put it in context. A move to $50 is not. That is a 25,000% rise, which would draw questions in conventional finance but is not unheard of in cryptocurrency. Given that the whole addressable market for real-world assets is over $300 trillion, even some of the market entering Rexas’s habitat might propel RXS beyond present forecasts. Conclusion Rexas Finance is creating a country of its own, brick by brick, block by block, as XRP struggles to recover her throne and reputation. It’s writing a daring new narrative about global asset democratization, blockchain innovation, and community empowerment—not riding on old stories or lawsuits. Rexas Finance demands your full attention for those considering the next 10x, 100x, or even 250x altcoin. In 2025, the cryptocurrency everyone wants to buy at $0.20 might not be XRP but RXS.

44363620,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158823,1746774902,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Stablecoin Legislation: Brian Armstrong’s Crucial Concerns Over Yield Restrictions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stablecoin-legislation-warning/,"The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and with that evolution comes the increasing need for clear and effective regulation. One area drawing significant attention from lawmakers and industry leaders alike is stablecoins. These digital assets, pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, are seen by many as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto economy. However, finding the right regulatory balance is proving to be a complex challenge. What’s Happening with US Stablecoin Legislation? Recent weeks have seen movement on the legislative front regarding US stablecoin legislation . The Senate has been discussing potential frameworks, including a bill known as the GENIUS Act. While this engagement is a positive step towards regulatory clarity, the details of the proposed legislation are sparking debate within the industry. One prominent voice weighing in on the discussion is Brian Armstrong Coinbase CEO. Armstrong, who leads one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, took to social media platform X to share his perspective on the recent progress and express specific concerns. He acknowledged the Senate’s first vote on the GENIUS Act , even though it ultimately failed to pass. Armstrong framed this as a normal part of the legislative process, indicating that while this specific attempt didn’t succeed, the conversation and efforts towards regulation are ongoing. He anticipates another vote relatively soon, potentially early next week, highlighting the continued momentum. Why is Brian Armstrong Coinbase Concerned About Yield? While welcoming the legislative attention, Armstrong pointed out a significant issue within the current draft of the GENIUS Act: the proposed prohibition on stablecoins offering yield or interest. This particular restriction is a major point of contention for the Coinbase CEO and many others in the crypto space. Here’s a breakdown of why this is a concern: Core Functionality: For many users and protocols, the ability to earn yield on stablecoins is a fundamental aspect of their utility within decentralized finance (DeFi) and other crypto applications. Competitiveness: Prohibiting yield could make US-issued stablecoins less attractive compared to those issued in other jurisdictions or traditional financial products that offer interest. Innovation Stifling: Restricting yield could hinder innovation in how stablecoins are used and integrated into broader financial systems. Economic Impact: Yield generation is often linked to the underlying assets backing the stablecoin (e.g., T-bills), and prohibiting yield could disconnect stablecoin holders from potential returns generated by these assets. Armstrong believes that while regulation is necessary to ensure stability and consumer protection, a blanket ban on yield is overly restrictive and could have negative consequences for the growth and utility of regulated stablecoins in the US. What are the Stakes in US Crypto Regulation? The debate over stablecoin legislation is a critical piece of the larger puzzle of Crypto regulation US . The outcome will significantly impact how stablecoins are used, who can issue them, and how they interact with the traditional financial system. Getting this right is crucial for several reasons: Consumer Protection: Effective regulation can protect users from risks associated with stablecoin issuers, such as lack of reserves or mismanagement. Financial Stability: As stablecoins grow, their potential impact on financial stability increases, necessitating clear rules and oversight. Innovation and Competitiveness: A well-designed framework can foster innovation and ensure the US remains competitive in the global digital asset landscape. Overly burdensome rules, like a yield ban, could push activity offshore. Market Integrity: Regulation can help prevent illicit activities and manipulation within the stablecoin market. The concerns raised by figures like Brian Armstrong Coinbase highlight the industry’s desire for regulation that is not only clear but also practical and forward-thinking, allowing for innovation while mitigating risks. What Does the GENIUS Act Mean for Stablecoin Yield? The specific language within the GENIUS Act regarding yield is what has drawn Armstrong’s criticism. While the exact details can be complex, the core issue appears to be a broad prohibition on stablecoin issuers or associated entities from offering interest or yield directly to stablecoin holders. The rationale behind such a restriction might be to simplify the regulatory treatment of stablecoins and differentiate them clearly from interest-bearing deposits or securities. However, critics argue that this approach fails to recognize the diverse ways stablecoins are used and the potential for yield generation from the underlying reserve assets in a safe and transparent manner. Finding a middle ground that allows for responsible yield generation under clear regulatory guidelines is seen as essential by many in the industry. What’s Next for Stablecoin Legislation and Brian Armstrong Coinbase’s Advocacy? The legislative process is often lengthy and involves multiple rounds of debate, revisions, and votes. The failure of the initial vote on the GENIUS Act is not necessarily the end of the road for stablecoin legislation this session, but it underscores the need for further discussion and potential amendments. Industry leaders like Brian Armstrong Coinbase are expected to continue engaging with policymakers, advocating for changes they believe are necessary for the healthy development of the crypto ecosystem in the US. Their input, alongside that of other stakeholders, will be crucial in shaping the final form of any enacted stablecoin bill. The coming weeks will be important to watch as lawmakers potentially revisit the GENIUS Act or introduce alternative proposals aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for US stablecoin legislation . The debate over issues like Stablecoin yield will likely remain at the forefront of these discussions. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Crypto Regulation US The path to clear and effective Crypto regulation US is filled with challenges, as evidenced by the ongoing debate surrounding stablecoins and the concerns raised by figures like Brian Armstrong. While progress is being made with bills like the GENIUS Act being considered, the details matter significantly. The prohibition on Stablecoin yield is a key point of contention that highlights the need for careful consideration of the practical implications of proposed rules on innovation and the utility of digital assets. As the legislative process continues, the industry and policymakers must work together to craft a framework that protects consumers and financial stability without stifling the potential of stablecoins and the broader crypto economy. The outcome of this debate will have lasting effects on the future of finance in the United States.

Upbit Lists Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) for Trading on KRW, BTC and USDT Markets Its inclusion on this list is the latest sign of growing market support for meme coins with strong community support and brand awareness. According to Upbit’s announcement, PENGU deposits and trading will commence shortly, and certain precautions and temporary restrictions will be implemented to ensure a smooth market entry. Upbit reminds users to carefully check network compatibility before depositing PENGU, noting that incorrect deposits may require a lengthy recovery process. Under South Korea's Travel Rule, PENGU transfers are only accepted from verified virtual asset service providers (VASPs) or whitelisted personal wallets linked to a verified user.

Traders are brushing off recession concerns, as renewed optimism around a potential U.S.–UK trade deal and surging institutional activity breathe fresh life into the market. While Bitcoin hovers near the critical $100,000 level, it’s the altcoins that are grabbing headlines, delivering double-digit gains and triggering a wave of crypto liquidations not seen since 2023. Why Crypto Market is Up Today? Several key factors are fueling this crypto market recovery: Record ETF Inflows: U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $40.62 billion in cumulative inflows, hitting an all-time high and signaling strong institutional demand. Pro-Crypto Regulation: Arizona passed a Bitcoin reserve bill , becoming the second U.S. state to back BTC investments and even claim ownership of unclaimed coins. This legislative move reinforces the growing regulatory acceptance of crypto assets. Macro Tailwinds: News of a potential U.S.–UK trade deal and easing global trade tensions are supporting risk-on sentiment across financial markets. Ethereum Price Surge Ethereum (ETH) surged 20% , reclaiming the $2,000 mark for the first time since March. The spike triggered over $310 million in liquidations tied to ETH short positions, according to Coinglass. The surge is largely credited to renewed institutional momentum and growing excitement around Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : India-Pakistan Conflict Will Fuel Bitcoin Price, Says Russian Politician Anatoly Aksakov , Dogecoin, Cardano, and Solana Follow Suit The altcoin rally didn’t stop with ETH. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) each soared over 10%, while Solana (SOL), XRP, and Binance Coin (BNB) also posted gains of at least 7%. These rapid price movements blindsided bearish traders, contributing to the largest daily crypto liquidation event this year. Crypto Liquidations Wipe Out the Bears According to coinalyze data , More than 84% of liquidations on Thursday were from short positions , marking a brutal day for bearish traders. The $800 million liquidation wave is the largest since the $500 million short squeeze in April, underscoring the current bullish momentum. Market Outlook: Bulls Back in Control? The crypto market now shows signs of strong risk appetite. As macroeconomic uncertainty lingers, traders remain watchful—but current momentum suggests bulls have reclaimed dominance, at least in the short term. If Bitcoin decisively crosses the $100K barrier, the next phase of this crypto market recovery could see even more explosive gains. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SpacePay, on the other hand, is building something different. It does not focus only on the tech or the crypto crowd; it’s tackling the payment problem from both sides: users and merchants, offering a system that feels natural for everyone involved. Platform’s native token is right now in presale, but let’s first understand what SpacePay actually has to offer. What Is SpacePay and What Problems Does It Solve? SpacePay aims to make cryptocurrency payments seamless. Users can get transactions settled as fast as paying with a regular card. It uses an easy-to-use APK that works with existing card machines. This allows merchants to accept crypto as they would fiat. The platform bridges the gap between blockchain innovation and the point-of-sale systems most businesses already use. With just a simple integration, businesses can start accepting crypto from over 325 supported wallets. SpacePay isn’t trying to replace the traditional payment system overnight. It is rather enhancing it. The solution makes existing payment models smarter, faster, and more inclusive. Why SpacePay Could Become a Leader in the Payment Space SpacePay offers wide compatibility and focuses on ease of use. Individuals can pay with their preferred cryptocurrencies by scanning a QR code. This eliminates the complicated processes that often discourage crypto payments in physical settings. For merchants, the platform brings instant settlement and ultra-low fees. With just 0.5% in transaction costs, SpacePay offers a clear alternative to high-fee credit card processors. Plus, transactions settle immediately, with no delays or hidden costs, giving businesses a more predictable and transparent experience. Another major edge is how SpacePay handles crypto’s biggest challenge: volatility. Merchants get paid in fiat equivalent, locked at the moment of transaction. This means they’re shielded from price swings, while still opening their doors to crypto-paying customers. SpacePay also brings decentralization into the mix. Transactions are secured through cryptography, and users retain full control over their private keys and funds. That adds an extra layer of trust and security—two things people care about deeply in any financial ecosystem. The infrastructure itself is designed to scale. Their Android-compatible APK can integrate with different platforms and devices, supporting high transaction volumes without clogging the system or slowing down performance. This ensures SpacePay can keep up with demand as adoption grows. SPY Token: The Fuel Behind the Ecosystem SPY token plays a vital role in powering the platform and rewarding its users. The token comes with several benefits. These include monthly loyalty airdrops, voting power on key decisions, early access to new features, and even a share of the platform’s revenue. The tokenomics are carefully structured to support long-term growth. Of the 34 billion total supply, allocations are split among public sales, loyalty programs, development, partnerships, and marketing. This ensures the ecosystem has the resources it needs to keep growing while rewarding early adopters and active users. The token also adds a layer of community governance. Holders get to vote on important decisions once a month, influencing the platform’s future. There are also charitable initiatives built into the system, where SpacePay matches donations to pre-selected causes, showing they’re thinking beyond just profit. SPY holders get exclusive access to quarterly webinars with the SpacePay leadership team, offering a transparent look into what’s next for the project. SpacePay’s Early Success and Recognition SpacePay isn’t just an idea on paper. It has already raised $750,000 from private investors and completed development on its MVP. The project has even won the “New Payment Platform of the Year” award at the CorporateLiveWire Global Awards. That’s a big nod of confidence from the fintech community. The team is also working on securing intellectual property and meeting global regulatory standards. This means they’re preparing for a future where their system can be used in virtually every unsanctioned region in the world. Joining the Ongoing SPY Token Presale The presale for the SPY token is currently live and gaining traction fast. More than $1 million has already been invested, and the token is selling at $0.003181 in this stage of the presale. As interest grows, this price is expected to increase, making early participation potentially more rewarding. To join the presale, users can connect their MetaMask or other supported wallet directly on the official SpacePay website. Payment can be made using ETH, BNB, USDT, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDC, or even a debit or credit card. Once connected to the presale website, it’s a simple swap to receive SPY tokens and join the ecosystem.

Bitcoin surges past $100k as market recovery continues Just a day prior, Bitcoin broke through the $100k threshold, marking the first time it reached six figures since February 2025. At press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has gone up by 4.16%. BTC is currently trading hands at $103,017. Hinting at Bitcoin payment options Steak ‘N Shake first brought up the possibility of facilitating BTC payments on March 8, when it asked its followers whether the restaurant should start accepting BTC. The question drew engagement from major industry figures including, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who replied with a simple “yes.” Later on March 13, the account posted an intergalactic spaceship delivering beef tallow on Mars with a giant Bitcoin logo attached to its side. Before Steak ‘N Shake, there have been a number of popular fast-food chain outlets that have leaned towards cryptocurrency payments in the U.S. One of them is the Mexican fast-food chain Chipotle which partnered with digital payment provider Flexa in 2022 to accept crypto payments. Since then, nearly 3,000 Chipotle restaurants across the United States have accepted payments in 98 different crypto assets from customers. The sandwich shop Subway actually trialed accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies early on in 2013, but only in certain franchises.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining firm Hut 8 Corp. posted a sharp downturn in its first-quarter financials, swinging to a significant loss as revenue plunged over 50%, Bloomberg reported . The company generated $21.8 million in revenue for the quarter, representing a year-over-year decline of nearly 58%. It also posted a net loss of $134.3 million, a stark reversal from the $250.7 million in profit recorded during the same period last year. According to CEO Asher Genoot, the decline stems from the cumulative effects of the last Bitcoin halving , which cut mining rewards in half. While the halving itself took place last April, its financial impact has only recently fully set in for mining companies, including Hut 8 . As a result, reduced revenue per mined coin, coupled with increased operational downtime related to ongoing upgrades of mining hardware, have squeezed Hut 8’s margins and pushed the company deep into the red.

During the company’s latest earnings call on Thursday, Genoot reiterated that its new mining venture American Bitcoin Corp . will go public. Hut 8 announced it’s launching American Bitcoin Corp. after it has acquired a majority stake in American Data Centers Inc., a company backed by Donald Trump’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The market responded positively to the announcement, with Hut 8 shares surging 17% on the day. Meanwhile, Hut 8 continues to develop computing infrastructure to support AI workloads, particularly at its sites in Louisiana. This move reflects a growing industry trend in which Bitcoin miners are diversifying into AI and high-performance computing to mitigate the financial strain caused by reduced block rewards following the halving.

44363971,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158824,1746775505,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Surging Sentiment Reaches 73, Signaling Greed",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-greed-5/,"Are you feeling optimistic about the crypto market lately? You’re not alone. The latest reading from the Crypto Fear and Greed Index shows a significant shift in sentiment, potentially offering valuable insights for your trading and investment decisions. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, Anyway? Provided by software development platform Alternative, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a popular tool designed to gauge the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Emotions can significantly influence market behavior, often leading to irrational decisions. This index attempts to quantify these emotions, presenting them on a simple scale. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This typically suggests investors are overly worried. It could signal a potential buying opportunity for those who believe the market is oversold. 25-49: Fear – Still cautious sentiment, but less intense than extreme fear. 50-74: Greed – This indicates increasing optimism and potentially aggressive buying. While positive, it can also suggest the market is becoming overheated. 75-100: Extreme Greed – This is often seen when the market is experiencing euphoric rallies. It can be a warning sign of an impending correction, as sentiment might be unsustainably high. As of May 9th, the index stands at 73, an increase of eight points from the previous day. This places it firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, suggesting that positive crypto market sentiment is currently dominant among participants. How Does the Index Calculate Crypto Market Sentiment? The index isn’t based on just one factor. It aggregates data from six different sources, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view of market psychology: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): Compares the current market volume and momentum to the long-term averages. High buying volume in a rising market can signal greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes tweets for specific hashtags and checks the speed and volume of posts. High levels of enthusiastic chatter can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users to gather their sentiment (this factor is currently paused by Alternative). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear (as investors flee riskier altcoins) or greed (if BTC is leading a strong rally). Google Trends (10%): Looks at search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might signal fear, while terms like “buy crypto” could signal greed. By combining these factors, the index aims to provide a balanced snapshot of current crypto market psychology . What Does a Reading of 73 (Greed) Mean for You? A reading of 73 is high and signifies strong optimism. Historically, periods of extreme greed (above 75) or even just high greed (above 50) have sometimes coincided with market tops or preceded significant pullbacks. The underlying principle here aligns with contrarian investing: when others are greedy, it might be time to be cautious. Think about it: When everyone is rushing to buy, prices are likely already elevated. The pool of potential buyers might be shrinking, and any negative news could trigger a wave of selling as optimistic investors quickly turn fearful. For Bitcoin sentiment specifically, a high index reading often reflects strong positive price action and bullish news surrounding the leading cryptocurrency. Given Bitcoin’s influence on the broader market, its sentiment heavily impacts the overall index. Is ‘Greed’ Always a Sell Signal? Navigating Trading Psychology Crypto Not necessarily. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a tool, not a crystal ball. A market can remain in the ‘Greed’ zone for an extended period during a strong bull run. Simply seeing a high number shouldn’t be your only reason to sell or avoid buying. However, it serves as a valuable warning sign. It tells you that the emotional temperature of the market is high. This is where understanding trading psychology crypto becomes crucial. High greed means many participants might be acting on FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) rather than careful analysis. Benefits of using the index: Provides a quick snapshot of market sentiment. Can act as a contrarian indicator (buy when fearful, be cautious when greedy). Helps you manage your own emotional response by showing you the prevailing mood. Challenges and limitations: It’s backward-looking; it reflects *current* sentiment, not future price movements. The market can stay in extreme zones for longer than expected. It doesn’t replace fundamental or technical analysis. The weighting of factors might not perfectly capture all market dynamics. Actionable Insights: Using the Index in Your Strategy How can you practically use this information? Here are a few ideas: As a Confirmation Tool: If your technical analysis suggests the market is overbought, a high Greed index reading can add weight to that signal. As a Contrarian Prompt: When the index is in Extreme Greed, it might prompt you to reconsider adding new positions or to take some profits off the table, especially in riskier assets. Conversely, Extreme Fear might be a time to look for buying opportunities if your research supports it. For Risk Management: High greed often correlates with increased volatility. This might be a time to tighten stop-losses or reduce position sizes. Understanding the Narrative: A high index suggests the dominant market narrative is bullish. Be aware of this but question whether the optimism is justified by fundamentals. Remember, the rise to 73 suggests sentiment has improved rapidly. This could be fueled by recent positive price movements in Bitcoin and altcoins, favorable news headlines, or increasing retail interest. While this optimism is positive, the proximity to the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone warrants careful observation. Summary: Stay Informed, Stay Rational The Crypto Fear and Greed Index reaching 73 is a clear signal that optimism and ‘Greed’ are currently dominating the crypto market sentiment . While this reflects positive momentum, historical data suggests that periods of high greed can be precarious. Use this index as one piece of your analytical puzzle. Combine it with thorough research, technical analysis, and a strong understanding of your own trading psychology crypto to make informed decisions and avoid getting swept up in the market’s emotional tides.

While founder Charles Hoskinson avoids direct claims of replacing fiat, his consistent narrative positions Cardano as foundational plumbing for a future financial system. This grand vision, coupled with ambitious technological upgrades, fuels extreme speculation, including analyst whispers of ADA reaching $50 by 2028 – a target that demands scrutiny given Cardano ‘s current market position. Can its methodical construction justify such hyper-bullish long-term forecasts? Cardano’s Foundational Ambitions: Building Beyond Bitcoin From its genesis, Cardano differentiated itself through a commitment to peer-reviewed research and formal methods, aiming to overcome the perceived limitations of earlier blockchains like Bitcoin. This philosophy continues to guide its development towards becoming a versatile, multi-asset settlement layer. Recent moves underscore this ambition: the Lace wallet’s integration of native Bitcoin support allows seamless management across chains. Discussions with Ripple about incorporating the RLUSD stablecoin signal intent to bridge different blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, successful demonstrations like BitcoinOS transferring BTC directly onto Cardano without traditional bridges showcase its potential as an interoperable hub, laying the necessary groundwork for handling diverse financial assets on a global scale. Scaling for Global Finance: Ouroboros Leios Upgrade A cornerstone of Cardano ‘s potential to underpin a future financial system is its approach to scalability. Recognizing the limitations of its current transaction throughput compared to rivals, the network is gearing up for the Ouroboros Leios upgrade . This isn’t just an incremental tweak, it can be seen as a fundamental redesign aimed to boost the capacity. By decoupling key processes like transaction transmission, validation, and ordering, and introducing parallel processing, Leios targets speeds potentially exceeding 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with theoretical limits pushing towards one million TPS. Achieving such scale is non-negotiable if Cardano hopes to handle the kind of volume associated with global finance, lending a sliver of plausibility to the long-term vision of challenging traditional infrastructures. This scalability piece, combined with other planned enhancements like Hydra (Layer 2) and Midgard (rollups), forms the technical bedrock of Cardano’ s grand ambition. Path to $50 ADA: Examining the Bold 2028 Prediction While the long-term vision is grand, the current market reality grounds expectations. Cardano trades around $0.65-$0.70, significantly below its $3.10 all-time high. Near-to-mid-term analyst targets, based on current technical patterns (like bull flags and potential double bottoms) and fundamental catalysts (like potential ETF approval or BTC staking features via Lace), typically range from reclaiming $1.00, pushing towards resistance at $1.30, or optimistic calls reaching $5 or even $10 during a peak bull market phase. The $50 target by 2028, however, exists in a different stratosphere. Requiring roughly a 70x increase from today’s price, this hyper-bullish forecast likely assumes near-perfect execution of Cardano ‘s entire roadmap, including the successful deployment and mass adoption of Leios and other scaling solutions. It implies Cardano not only thrives technologically but also captures immense market share, becoming a dominant global platform for DeFi, RWA tokenization, and potentially even challenging traditional settlement systems – implicitly fulfilling the “replace the dollar” narrative. While not impossible in the volatile world of crypto, $50 remains an extremely speculative fringe prediction for Cardano within the next four years. Cardano is doing well, but nowhere near that $50 mark. Source: CoinMarketCap While Cardano meticulously constructs its complex infrastructure for a potential long-term systemic role, other projects focus on immediate solutions bridging crypto with today’s financial reality. Remittix (RTX), for example, targets the present-day friction in cross-border payments using its PayFi protocol for efficient crypto-to-fiat transfers. Its ongoing, successful presale (over $14.8M raised, ~$0.0757 price) highlights investor appetite for practical applications offering tangible utility now, presenting a different investment thesis focused on near-term market penetration.

Trading at $99,705, Bitcoin’s surge is fueled by renewed optimism surrounding US-China trade talks and significant institutional investments. While Bitcoin works its way toward key resistance levels, an emerging contender, Ruvi , offers an unbeatable opportunity for exponential growth, especially for early adopters. Bitcoin’s latest rally and market dynamics Bitcoin’s recent price increase of 2.7% in a single day can be attributed to several key factors: 1. US-China trade talks: Renewed discussions between these major economies to ease trade barriers have sparked a wave of optimism among investors, lifting sentiment for risk assets like Bitcoin. 2. Institutional endorsements: Institutions continue to show confidence in Bitcoin. For instance, Metaplanet, a prominent Japanese firm, recently acquired 555 BTC worth $53.5 million. Similarly, Strategy Inc. has announced plans to raise $21 billion to further expand its Bitcoin holdings. 3. Anticipation of Federal Reserve announcements: Investors are eagerly awaiting signals from the Federal Reserve, as dovish monetary policies could further elevate Bitcoin’s value. Despite these market catalysts, Bitcoin faces critical resistance levels near $100,000, with some analysts forecasting a potential rise to $250,000 by the year’s end, should market conditions persist. While Bitcoin’s position as the flagship cryptocurrency remains unchallenged, its growth trajectory is notably slower compared to newer projects like Ruvi, which offers groundbreaking advancements at an accessible entry point. Ruvi’s groundbreaking potential Ruvi is breaking the mold in the cryptocurrency space by launching with AI-driven solutions and real-world applications. While Bitcoin continues to dominate as a store of value, Ruvi is carving its niche by delivering utility and innovation from the start. Currently priced at $0.01 during its presale phase , Ruvi represents a golden investment opportunity for forward-thinking individuals. What makes Ruvi stand out? Its limited token supply of 1.5 billion ensures scarcity, a key factor in driving long-term value. Additionally, its early-stage entry offers monumental growth opportunities compared to Bitcoin, which has already achieved widespread adoption. Investment scenarios with Ruvi Here’s a snapshot of what Ruvi’s investors stand to gain depending on their level of investment: $500 Investment With $500, you can secure 50,000 tokens during the presale phase. Ruvi’s 40% bonus brings your total to 70,000 tokens. If Ruvi reaches $2 per token, your investment grows to an astounding $140,000. $3,000 investment A $3,000 stake buys 300,000 Ruvi tokens, boosted by an 80% bonus, giving you 540,000 tokens. With a price surge to $3, your portfolio could increase to $1.62 million. $10,000 investment For larger investors, $10,000 delivers 1,000,000 tokens, doubling to 2,000,000 tokens thanks to the 100% bonus. If Ruvi hits $3, you’re looking at an extraordinary return of $6 million. Why timing matters Bitcoin’s recent rally highlights the growing appetite for cryptocurrencies, but its current price point may limit the upside potential for new investors. By contrast, Ruvi’s presale phase offers a rare opportunity to invest at the ground level, securing massive bonuses before public demand drives prices higher. Investors who recognized the potential of Bitcoin and Ethereum during their early days reaped unmatched rewards. Ruvi offers a similar chance to capitalize on early-stage growth, harnessing innovation and a scarcity-first model to distinguish itself in a crowded market. Seize your opportunity with Ruvi Bitcoin’s rise to $96,805 proves there’s enduring potential in the cryptocurrency market, but emerging projects like Ruvi show where the next wave of opportunities lies. Whether you’re investing $500, $3,000, or $10,000, Ruvi delivers the tools and timing to transform your financial future. Don’t be a spectator when you could be a participant in Ruvi’s groundbreaking success story. Act now to secure your stake before the presale window closes and prices soar.

The presale stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to surge forward as investors purchase over 450 million tokens that have amassed $7.9 million. The price level of $0.025 in Phase 4 currently stands at 65% sold out while maintaining heightened investor attraction. The market demands high-yielding prospects and these recent developments match this demand through direct associations. But why are investors on alert over the two altcoins? Solana’s Steady Ascent The crypto market is witnessing Solana forge a strong pathway through volatility while maintaining composure. The currency stands at $147.76 right now while experts project an upcoming rise to $160 before establishing $130 as a protective level against market fluctuations. Mutuum Finance draws investors with its pioneering stage development rather than Solana’s mature steady progress. Analysts project Solana value to reach $400 at year’s end but regulatory frameworks might limit it to $250 given positive market conditions. The flourishing DeFi ecosystem which draws numerous developers creates an optimistic outlook. The crypto market receives a new access point through Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which allows investors to pursue aggressive market returns. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) energizes the market through phase 4 presale at $0.025 while selling 65% of its tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured the interest of 9,600 token holders who purchased 450 million tokens to raise $7.9 million. The project’s upcoming phase will boost the token price by 20% to $0.03 while giving users quick profit at phase 5 kickoff. The platform builds trust by actively seeking Certik to audit their smart contracts while providing scheduled information through social networks. The early-stage attraction of Mutuum’s proposition stands out more distinctly than Solana’s established progress which appeals to uninhibited investors. The project’s value exceeds that of most highly valued DeFi projects in the crypto space. Mutuum’s High-Yield Blueprint Numerous investors now choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its well-planned DeFi system design. Phase 4 purchasers stand to gain 140% returns on their investment at the token’s anticipated $0.06 listing price. Experts predict the MUTM token will reach $2.50 after launch which represents an astounding 9,900% return compared to present prices. The newly-launched Mutuum Finance dashboard enables users to monitor the top 50 token holders who receive additional MUTM tokens when sustaining their rank positions. The gamified reward system generates substantial demand which drives phase 4 to achieve a rapid completion of token sales. Since Mutuum is still developing the investor investing during its early stages can achieve higher returns than the already established Solana platform. Riding the Bullish Wave Mutuum Finance (MUTM) together with Solana create bright spots within the crypto market space through their individual unique asset qualities. Investors looking for opportunities from the bullish indicators should immediately examine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its dwindling presale period to witness DeFi’s upcoming development. Insiders propelling Mutuum’s initial value 140% higher than what Solana can deliver while providing the opportunity for $2.50 peak price. Smart investment capital is currently rushing towards Mutuum’s phase 4 because investors expect its impending $0.03 price increase. During its ongoing presale phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents investors with direct access to DeFi’s upcoming advancements.

Authorities, including the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor’s Office (ZIT) and the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), seized €34 million in digital assets and eight terabytes of data, marking the country’s third-largest crypto seizure. Why Was €34 Million Seized? Operating since 2014, eXch was allegedly a central node in global cybercrime. On-chain sleuth ZachXBT exposed its ties to high-profile crypto hacks, including the Bybit multi-signature exploit and the $243 million Genesis Creditor heist. The platform’s refusal to freeze stolen assets or cooperate with authorities made it a haven for cybercriminals. eXch operated with no oversight, no KYC, and full anonymity, making it a hotspot for illicit activity. It was mainly advertised on the darknet and allowed users to convert stolen or scammed coins into legitimate assets. Before the takedown, investigators estimated $1.9 billion had flowed through the platform. Though eXch announced a voluntary shutdown on May 1, law enforcement moved swiftly, coordinating with Dutch authorities to secure evidence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : North Korea’s Crypto Heists May Force G7 to Launch Global Security Overhaul , A New Era of Proactive Crypto Enforcement This operation signals a new phase in international crypto enforcement. German authorities emphasized that cybercrime has become an industrial operation, and they are now targeting criminals before they act. With eXch’s takedown, enforcement agencies across borders are showing that the blockchain leaves a trace—and so does justice. This case sets a precedent for proactive, data-driven action against crypto laundering, sending a strong message to those using digital currencies for illicit purposes. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This represents a 200% increase in liquidations over the previous day, according to Coinglass data . Bitcoin ( BTC ) shorts accounted for $321 million in liquidations. At the same time, open interest increased by 5% to $133 billion, indicating that new leveraged bets are entering the market.The average crypto relative strength index has also risen to 70, signaling overbought conditions. The spike in liquidations followed a rapid market rebound. With risk-on sentiment returning to international markets, the total value of the crypto market reached $3.3 trillion, its highest level since early March. Bitcoin reached a peak of $103,460 during Friday’s Asian trading hours, up more than 6% in the past day. Ethereum ( ETH ) led the altcoin surge, climbing over 20% to reclaim $2,200 for the first time in two months, while Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ) gained 8% and 5%, respectively. A tentative U.S.-U.K. trade agreement that President Donald Trump hinted at on May 8 sparked the rally and gave international markets new hope. This is the case even though the Federal Reserve did not change interest rates on Wednesday, May 6. But according to the CME FedWatch tool , markets are pricing in a 70% chance of a rate cut by July and a 95% chance of at least one cut by October. You might also like: What tariff shock?

44364527,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158826,1746776415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Rumble Crypto Wallet: Exciting Q3 Launch with Tether Support Announced,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/rumble-crypto-wallet-launch/,"Get ready for a significant development in the world of online platforms and digital assets! Rumble, the popular video sharing and streaming service, is making a bold move into the cryptocurrency space. This isn’t just a minor feature addition; it’s a strategic step aimed at integrating digital asset management directly within their ecosystem. The announcement came straight from the top, with CEO Chris Pavlovski confirming the plans on X (formerly Twitter), signaling Rumble’s serious intent to embrace Web3 technologies. What is the Rumble Crypto Wallet and Why Now? At the heart of this news is the planned introduction of the Rumble crypto wallet . Scheduled for a Q3 launch this year, this wallet is designed to be a non-custodial service. This means users will have direct control over their private keys and, consequently, their digital assets. It’s a crucial distinction from custodial wallets, where a third party holds the keys on your behalf. Rumble’s decision to enter the crypto arena with its own wallet suggests a desire to offer its user base a seamless way to interact with cryptocurrencies, potentially enabling new forms of engagement, monetization, and community building on the platform. The timing is interesting. As more online platforms explore ways to leverage blockchain technology and digital assets, Rumble’s move positions it alongside others looking to innovate user experience and creator economics. By providing a native wallet, Rumble aims to lower the barrier to entry for its users who may be new to crypto, offering them a familiar interface within a platform they already use. Understanding the Non-Custodial Wallet Advantage The choice of a non-custodial wallet is a significant one, aligning with core principles of cryptocurrency ownership: sovereignty and self-custody. But what exactly does that mean for the user? Here’s a simple breakdown: Custodial Wallet: Think of this like keeping your money in a bank. The bank holds your funds and your account keys. You trust the bank to keep it safe and accessible. If the bank fails or freezes your account, you might lose access. Non-Custodial Wallet: This is like keeping cash in your physical wallet or a safe at home. You hold the keys (usually represented by a ‘seed phrase’). You have complete control and responsibility. If you lose your keys/seed phrase, you lose access to your funds. The primary advantage of a non-custodial wallet is enhanced security against third-party risks (like exchange hacks or platform failures) and greater privacy. However, it places the full burden of security and backup on the user. Rumble’s implementation will need to balance this user autonomy with educational resources to help newcomers manage this responsibility effectively. The Role of Tether Stablecoin in Rumble’s Strategy One of the key assets supported by the upcoming wallet will be the Tether stablecoin (USDT). The inclusion of USDT is particularly strategic. As the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, Tether is pegged to the US dollar, aiming to maintain a stable value. This stability makes it incredibly useful for transactions, remittances, and holding value without the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Integrating Tether could open up several possibilities for Rumble: Easier Payments & Tipping: Creators and users could potentially send and receive value in a stable currency, avoiding the complexities of fluctuating crypto prices. On-Ramp/Off-Ramp Potential: While details are scarce, supporting a widely used stablecoin could simplify the process of converting traditional currency into crypto and vice-versa, depending on future features and partnerships. Global Accessibility: Stablecoins offer a way to transact value across borders relatively easily and quickly compared to traditional banking methods. Tether’s widespread adoption and liquidity make it a practical choice for a platform looking to facilitate value exchange within its ecosystem. Bitcoin Wallet Integration: What to Expect Alongside Tether, the Bitcoin wallet functionality is a cornerstone of Rumble’s upcoming service. Bitcoin (BTC) is the original and most well-known cryptocurrency. Its inclusion is almost a necessity for any platform serious about entering the crypto space. What might a Bitcoin wallet on Rumble enable? Holding BTC: Users could securely store their Bitcoin directly within their Rumble-associated wallet. Sending/Receiving BTC: Standard wallet functionality allowing users to send Bitcoin to and receive Bitcoin from external wallets or services. Potential Future Uses: While speculative, integration could eventually lead to features allowing users to use Bitcoin for platform services, creator support, or even interacting with Bitcoin-based protocols if Rumble expands its crypto integration. The inclusion of both Bitcoin (as a store of value and primary crypto asset) and Tether (as a stable medium of exchange) provides a foundational crypto offering that caters to different user needs within the digital asset spectrum. Impact of the Crypto Wallet Launch: What’s Next? The upcoming crypto wallet launch by Rumble could have several significant impacts, both for the platform and the broader crypto ecosystem. For Rumble, it could: Attract users interested in crypto who are looking for integrated platforms. Provide new monetization avenues for creators and the platform itself. Strengthen its position as a technology-forward platform. For the crypto space, it represents another large mainstream platform adopting digital assets, potentially introducing a new wave of users to Bitcoin, Tether, and the concept of non-custodial wallets. Educating this new audience will be key to successful adoption and ensuring users understand the responsibilities that come with self-custody. While the initial announcement is exciting, many details remain to be seen. How will the user interface work? What will the security features be? Will there be integrated services like buying crypto directly within the app? These questions will likely be answered as the Q3 launch window approaches. Actionable Insights: For Current Rumble Users: Keep an eye out for official announcements regarding the wallet launch and educational resources on how to set it up and use it safely. Understand the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets. For Crypto Enthusiasts: Monitor the launch to see how Rumble integrates crypto and whether it creates new opportunities for interaction or value exchange on the platform. For Developers/Businesses: Observe how a large platform like Rumble implements crypto features; it could provide insights into mainstream adoption strategies. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Rumble and Crypto Adoption Rumble’s plan to launch a non-custodial wallet supporting Bitcoin and Tether in Q3 is a bold and exciting move. It signals a growing trend of major online platforms exploring direct integration with digital assets. By offering users control over their funds through a non-custodial model and supporting key assets like Bitcoin and the Tether stablecoin, Rumble is positioning itself at the intersection of online content and the burgeoning crypto economy. The success of this initiative will likely depend on user adoption, the ease of use of the wallet, and Rumble’s ability to educate its audience on the principles of self-custody. It’s a development worth watching closely as Q3 approaches.

According to emerging sources , lobbyist Brian Ballard allegedly influenced Trump behind the scenes to include XRP in the plan. Was Trump Misled About XRP? In January 2025, President Trump signed an executive order forming the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets . On March 2, he announced via Truth Social that XRP, Solana, Cardano, Ethereum, and Bitcoin would be part of the official US Crypto Strategic Reserve . Days later, on March 6, Trump issued another executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile for select altcoins. However, reports now claim XRP wasn’t originally part of Trump’s plan and was added due to Ballard’s lobbying efforts. Ripple Lobbying Scandal: What’s the Buzz? Political insiders allege that Brian Ballard, a well-known lobbyist , used his close ties with Ripple to influence the decision. Documents reveal Ballard received at least $60,000 from Ripple in 2024 . The move has sparked widespread speculation in both political and crypto circles. While the White House has yet to comment , sources suggest Trump has cut ties with Ballard after realizing he was misled. Will XRP Be Dropped from the Strategic Reserve? Experts believe that while Trump is reportedly unhappy about the situation, he’s unlikely to remove XRP immediately . The president maintains strong ties with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , who was a major donor to Trump’s campaign and inauguration fund. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Recovery: Bitcoin Breaks $100K, Ethereum Tops $2K, $800M Liquidation , XRP Price Performance in 2025 January: +46% February: –29.3% March: –2.52% April: +4.98% May (so far): +5.33% to $2.31 30-Day Growth: +2.1% 24-Hour Surge: +6.3% Despite political turbulence, XRP continues to trade bullishly , suggesting that market confidence remains intact, at least for now. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, the announcement on Truth Social has caused some controversy. It reportedly infuriated the President as the announcement was drafted by a lobbyist with ties to Ripple. Did Ripple Influence the President’s Announcement? A recent report from Politico drew attention to this announcement, as it identified XRP, Solana, and Cardano as the digital assets to be included in the cryptocurrency reserve. This announcement did not include Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump claimed in the post that the initiative would fall under an executive order aimed at securing American leadership in cryptocurrency. According to Politico, the language used in that post had been drafted by an employee of Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm that counts Ripple among its clients. Trump reportedly had no knowledge at the time that the suggestion came from a group representing Ripple’s interests. Once briefed, he felt blindsided. Those close to the situation told Politico that the revelation made the president furious, as he saw the move as a manipulation of his public platform. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Lobbyist Fallout and White House Tensions Brian Ballard, the head of the lobbying firm involved, saw his standing in Trump’s political circles decline sharply following the incident. Though Ballard had enjoyed a reputation as a trusted insider and prolific fundraiser, sources say his connection to Ripple and the post resulted in his marginalization within Trump’s orbit. Despite this, Politico noted that Ballard Partners has continued to expand its client roster because of its reputation. It has secured over a hundred new contracts since the 2024 election, including major corporations such as Netflix, Bayer, and JP Morgan, and over $14 million in revenue since the start of 2025. Ripple, XRP, and Market Impact Although Ripple does not control XRP, some in the crypto space may see the post as an endorsement because of the company’s connection to the asset. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty also met with the president in January, adding to this perceived endorsement. The crypto market responded quickly to Trump’s original message, with the prices of XRP, Solana, and Cardano seeing noticeable gains in the aftermath of Trump’s statement. When approached, Ripple did not comment on the matter, and Ballard Partners also declined to respond to Politico’s requests. Following the incident, Trump amended his position, indicating that the proposed reserve would include Bitcoin and Ethereum. Later that month, he signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , signaling continued interest in digital assets.

A significant event is on the horizon that often captures the attention of traders and analysts alike: a major crypto options expiration . On May 9th, billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin options and hundreds of millions in Ethereum options are set to mature, potentially introducing volatility or at least providing insights into market sentiment leading up to that date. Let’s break down the key figures and what they might signify. What’s Happening with Bitcoin Options? According to data from crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, a substantial amount of Bitcoin options contracts are scheduled to expire. Here are the specifics: Total Value: Approximately $2.66 billion USD Expiration Date & Time: May 9th, 2024, at 08:00 UTC Put/Call Ratio: 1.02 Max Pain Price: $94,000 A value of $2.66 billion is certainly noteworthy and represents a significant open interest nearing settlement. The put/call ratio of 1.02 is very close to 1, suggesting a relatively balanced sentiment between put options (bets on price going down) and call options (bets on price going up) among traders holding these specific contracts. It’s slightly leaning towards puts, but not strongly bearish. Ethereum Options Also Nearing Expiration It’s not just Bitcoin; Ethereum options are also set for their expiration on the same day and time: Total Value: Approximately $361.8 million USD Expiration Date & Time: May 9th, 2024, at 08:00 UTC Put/Call Ratio: 1.39 Max Pain Price: $1,850 While the dollar value is smaller than Bitcoin’s, $361.8 million is still a considerable sum. More interestingly, the put/call ratio for these ETH options stands at 1.39. This ratio is significantly above 1, indicating that there is a notable bias towards put options among holders of these contracts compared to call options. This could suggest a more bearish sentiment specifically within this segment of the Ethereum market. Demystifying the Max Pain Price You might have noticed the term “ max pain price ” mentioned for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. But what exactly does it mean? The max pain price is the strike price at which the underlying asset (BTC or ETH) would cause the maximum financial loss to the largest number of options holders if the price settles there at expiration. Think of it as the price point where the highest aggregate value of options contracts would expire worthless. It’s important to understand that the max pain price is not a price prediction or a target price . Instead, it’s a historical observation and a point of interest for analysts. Some market theories suggest that large players or market makers might have an incentive to try and push the price towards the max pain point near expiration, as it benefits them by maximizing losses for the majority of options holders they have traded against. However, this is a speculative theory and market forces are complex. Looking at the specific max pain prices: BTC Max Pain: $94,000 – This is significantly higher than Bitcoin’s current price. This suggests a large number of call options were opened at strike prices well above the current market value, and a large number of put options were opened at strike prices well below the current market value. If BTC stays near its current price, most of these contracts would expire worthless. ETH Max Pain: $1,850 – This is significantly lower than Ethereum’s current price. Similar to BTC, this indicates many call options are likely out of the money at current prices, and many put options were opened at strike prices well below the current market value. If ETH stays near its current price, many puts would expire worthless. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market Analysis? The expiration of a large volume of options contracts can sometimes contribute to increased volatility in the market around the expiration date. Here’s why: Hedging Unwinding: Traders and institutions who sold options (writers) often hedge their positions by buying or selling the underlying asset. As expiration approaches, these hedges may be unwound, leading to increased trading volume and potential price swings. Sentiment Check: The put/call ratios give a snapshot of the sentiment among options traders for those specific contracts. While not the whole market picture, it’s a valuable data point for crypto market analysis . The slightly balanced BTC ratio and the more bearish ETH ratio are points of interest. Max Pain Speculation: While not a prediction tool, some traders will watch the max pain price, leading to speculation or attempts to trade around that level, which can add to volatility. For traders and investors, understanding these upcoming expirations is part of staying informed. It’s a reminder that market dynamics can shift, and significant events like this can influence short-term price action. Actionable Insights for Traders Given the upcoming crypto options expiration , here are a few points to consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and price action as May 9th approaches. Manage Risk: If you are actively trading, be aware that volatility could increase. Ensure you have appropriate risk management strategies in place (e.g., stop-losses). Don’t Obsess Over Max Pain: Remember the max pain price is a descriptive statistic, not a predictive one. Don’t base trading decisions solely on this figure. Look Beyond Options: Options expiration is just one factor influencing the market. Global economic news, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment also play crucial roles. Conclusion The upcoming expiration of $2.66 billion in Bitcoin options and $361.8 million in Ethereum options on May 9th is a significant event on the crypto calendar. While the max pain prices of $94,000 for BTC and $1,850 for ETH are interesting data points, they should be viewed in the context of overall market dynamics rather than as price targets. The put/call ratios offer a glimpse into the sentiment of options traders, with ETH showing a more pronounced bearish bias among these specific contracts compared to BTC’s relatively balanced ratio. Options expirations can contribute to short-term volatility, making it crucial for market participants to stay vigilant and manage their risk effectively.

Top Memecoin Eyes 1 After 14% Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Is Dogecoin going to the moon? The question is making the rounds again as the crypto market sees strong gains. With Ethereum climbing faster than Bitcoin, many analysts believe an altcoin season could be starting — and Dogecoin is back in focus. The popular meme coin recently crossed the $0.20 mark, raising fresh interest about whether it can return to its 2021 peak. Its market cap has now crossed $29 billion, and with growing market optimism, traders are watching closely to see what comes next. Analysts Predict Breakout to $1 Analyst Maelius Crypto shared a chart calling Doge ‘incredible’ even though it dropped more than expected. The analyst thinks Dogecoin is showing strong signs of a breakout as price has bounced off key support levels, like the 200-week EMA and a demand zone between $0.11 and $0.20. The recent price action follows an Elliott Wave pattern, and he expects that the next big move could push DOGE to $1. After a bit of correction, he believes it could eventually reach $1.30-$1.70. Analyst Ali Martinez explained that Dogecoin has been backed by a trendline since October 2024. If the price dips to $0.14, it could be a buying opportunity before it rebounds to $0.30. Analyst Javon Marks also predicts that it could recover significantly before heading toward a target of $0.65. Dogecoin’s recent rise has sparked hopes that it could reach big market values like $500 billion, $1 trillion, or $2 trillion. If it does, each DOGE could be worth up to $13.4. Analysts predict that this could happen between 2033 and 2040.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 07:54:49

The agreement, submitted to the court on May 8, represents a decisive resolution to a case that has loomed over Ripple and the broader crypto sector for years. Key Terms of the Deal The settlement, outlined in a joint court filing , requests that New York Judge Analisa Torres dissolve an existing injunction against Ripple and release $125 million held in escrow. Under the terms, the crypto firm will pay the SEC $50 million, a fraction of the original fine meted out by Judge Torres, with the remaining $75 million returned to it. The deal also ensures that the regulatory agency and the payments company will drop their respective appeals, with the former abandoning its challenge and the latter withdrawing its cross-appeal. The saga started in December 2020, when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple and two of its top executives, Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, over allegations of raising more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering by selling Ripple’s native XRP token. Ripple disputed the claim, setting off a long-running legal battle that peaked in July 2023, when Judge Torres determined that XRP was not a security when sold to retail investors but qualified as one in institutional sales. Consequently, the company was hit with a $125 million fine in August 2024 for selling unregistered securities to institutional investors. However, the SEC threw a wrench in the works, appealing the ruling in January 2025. It argued that XRP transactions should not be treated differently between institutional and retail sales, forcing Ripple to file a counter-appeal of its own. Following changes at the SEC, including the departure of the hard-nosed Chair Gary Gensler, reports emerged that the financial watchdog would drop its appeal. However, there was no official communication from the agency regarding the issue. Next Steps in the Process According to lawyer James K. Filan, Judge Torres must issue an indicative ruling approving the proposed terms before the settlement is finalized. If she does, Ripple and the SEC will then seek a limited remand from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to formally enact the agreement. Once approved, the injunction against the crypto firm will be lifted, the escrowed funds will be distributed, and both sides will dismiss their appeals, officially ending the legal drama. News of the settlement triggered an immediate reaction across the crypto ecosystem. XRP’s price climbed 5.2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $2.29, though it has slightly lagged behind the broader crypto market’s 7% weekly gain. Still, the asset remains one of the strongest performers over the past year, boasting a 340% uptick. The XRP community, which has closely followed the case, celebrated the development, with prominent pro-Ripple attorney John E.

Wall Street investors were pumped after the three major US indexes had back-to-back winning sessions. The US already runs a trade surplus with the UK, which means it exports more to the nation than it imports. Trump imposed a 10% tariff on the UK on April 2, but there was no reduction in those levies despite both states reaching an agreement.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index climbed 0.4%, while the UK’s FTSE 100 plummeted 0.32%, giving up earlier gains after the UK and US announced a trade deal and as the Bank of England cut interest rates. The Bank of England on May 8 cut interest rates by as expected from 4.5% to 4.25%. Following a slowdown in prices, the BOE cut as expected, with annual inflation cooling to 2.6% in March, down from 2.8% the previous month. BOE’s Governor Andrew Bailey mentioned that the UK was headed for more economic uncertainty despite the country being the first to close a trade deal with the US under President Donald Trump’s heightened tariffs. He argued that the impact of tariffs on the UK economy comes not just from its trade relationship with Washington but also from those of the US and the rest of the world. UK makes a trade deal with the US on tariffs US President Donald Trump announced the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom on Thursday. Trump noted that the deal is the first with a country whose imports were subject to new tariffs he imposed in early April. As trade talks were ongoing, Trump’s Truth Social account posted a screenshot showing that U.S. tariffs on the UK will remain at 10%. The President said the figure was low when asked if that baseline tariff is a template for future trade deals. Source: Truth Social . The United Kingdom’s trade deal with the U.S. Trump revealed yesterday that the deal includes billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports. He also added that the UK will reduce or eliminate the numerous non-tariff barriers that discriminate against American products. The UK scrapped some concessions, such as a lower tariff rate on its first 100,000 vehicles exported to the US, with UK car manufacturers subject to a 10% rate and any additional vehicles facing 25% rates. The nation also secured new negotiations for Trump’s universal 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The UK also noted that it requires the US to negotiate an alternative agreement to the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, including a new trading union for both products. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined Trump remotely and argued that the country has built an incredible platform for the future. The White House acknowledged that the trade deal will create a $5 billion opportunity for new exports for US farmers, ranchers, and producers. It will also include more than $700 million in ethanol exports and $250 million in American beef and other agricultural products. Both countries also committed to working together to enhance industrial and agricultural market access. Trump also said the UK made a good deal and added that some countries will be much higher because they have massive trade surpluses. Trump’s post showed the UK duties on US goods will drop from 5.1% to 1.8%, but it was unclear how those figures were tabulated. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. AI predicts this altcoin could outshine Polkadot and Polygon by 2025, here’s why investors are watching XYZVerse. Table of Contents XYZ forecast: Could XYZVerse deliver a 30x surge? Unlocking the power of POL Polkadot: Connecting the crypto world Conclusion Recently, AI has pinpointed a specific altcoin that is expected to surpass Polkadot and Polygon by 2025. This cryptocurrency is projected to make significant strides in the market, possibly overtaking its prominent rivals. Uncover which digital asset is gaining attention and why it might be a game-changer in the crypto industry. XYZ forecast: Could XYZVerse deliver a 30x surge? XYZVerse is stepping into the memecoin scene at a time when community-backed tokens are driving some of the biggest gains in crypto. The explosive rise of PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows just how powerful branding, viral content, and a loyal community can be in today’s market. With the altcoin season on the horizon, interest in lower-cap tokens is ramping up. As XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, it stands to benefit from this momentum—especially if it locks in solid exchange listings and sustains community excitement beyond launch. Why XYZVerse stands out Powerful branding: Leveraging sports and influencer partnerships to expand its reach Deflationary supply: 17.13% token burn to reduce circulating supply Liquidity support: 15% allocated to provide post-launch price stability Community-focused: 10% dedicated to incentives that reward early backers and boost engagement Price outlook for $XYZ Presale price: $0.003333 Initial target: $0.10 (as estimated by the team) Potential high in first weeks: $0.15 – $0.25 (driven by hype and exchange listings) Long-term range (6–12 months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if key partnerships and utility are delivered) Reaching $0.10 from the current presale price would mean a 30x gain, an ambitious but plausible target if the project nails its launch strategy. Key factors that could drive this are given below. Top-tier exchange listings: Platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance would significantly boost visibility and volume. Community virality: Strong execution on sports and influencer campaigns could create the social buzz needed for FOMO. Bullish market conditions: If the crypto market remains hot, meme coins tend to outperform due to their speculative appeal. XYZVerse has the right ingredients for a breakout. But long-term success will depend on more than hype. If the team delivers on roadmap promises, secures major partnerships, and keeps its community engaged, a move beyond $0.10 could become a reality. You might also like: How a $500 stake in XYZVerse might transform over time Unlocking the power of POL The Polygon Ecosystem Token ( POL ) is more than just a digital asset; it’s the lifeblood of the expansive Polygon network. As a utility token, POL plays a crucial role in the network’s operations. Holders can stake their tokens, helping to secure the system while earning rewards. This process encourages community participation and strengthens the overall health of the network. Beyond staking, POL gives its holders a voice in the future of Polygon. By voting on proposals, they influence important decisions and the direction of the network’s development. Additionally, POL unlocks access to exclusive services and features within the ecosystem, offering unique benefits to its community. As Polygon continues to grow and add more applications, the significance of POL in the digital landscape becomes even more prominent. Polkadot: Connecting the crypto world Polkadot is a cryptocurrency that brings different blockchains together. It lets users send value or data from Bitcoin to Ethereum without middlemen. Using parachains, it boosts speed and scalability, making transactions much faster than on Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is key to this system. Holders can vote on changes and help verify transactions, keeping the network democratic. In today’s market, Polkadot stands out with its unique approach to blockchain limitations. While Bitcoin and Ethereum laid the groundwork, Polkadot builds bridges between them. This connectivity is vital as the crypto world grows more complex. With its focus on speed and governance, it offers something different from other cryptocurrencies. Conclusion Though POL and DOT are solid, XYZVerse’s blend of sports and memes could see it surpass them in 2025’s bull run as the next crypto icon.

While retail investors are increasingly sending ETH to exchanges such as Binance – typically a sign of selling pressure – large investors are steadily withdrawing ETH from these platforms, indicating accumulation and long-term confidence. Ethereum Stuck In A Tug-Of-War As ETH inches closer to the $2,000 mark for the first time since March 27, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Optimism is building around the potential for a trend reversal, but on-chain data continues to deliver mixed signals regarding Ethereum’s short- to medium-term direction. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? In his analysis, BorisVest highlighted that Ethereum metrics from Binance are sending ‘mixed signals.’ While short-term indicators reveal underlying weakness and investor indecision, longer-term metrics point to resilience and strength. Notably, mean exchange inflows have increased significantly since late 2024, suggesting growing sell pressure from retail traders. This pattern resembles the behavior seen during 2022–2023, when a surge in ETH deposits to exchanges preceded a steep price decline. Similarly, mean exchange outflows have also been rising steadily since October 2023. However, these outflows are largely linked to whale wallets – addresses holding large amounts of ETH – implying that high-net-worth individuals are accumulating rather than selling. This divergence highlights a classic tug-of-war between retail fear and institutional confidence. The analyst also pointed to funding rate trends. He noted that during ETH’s rally to $4,000 in early 2025, funding rates became overly positive as bullish sentiment took hold. This over-leveraged long positioning resulted in a sharp correction, driving ETH’s price down to $1,400 by April. At present, funding rates are hovering in neutral territory, indicating a lack of clear leverage bias. BorisVest noted that if short interest rises and funding rates fall below zero, a short squeeze could ensue – potentially driving prices higher. However, no such setup has formed yet. Meanwhile, the taker buy/sell ratio, which tracks aggressive market orders, showed heavy selling pressure in late 2024 and early 2025 – right before Ethereum’s steep decline. This ratio is now stabilizing, suggesting that sellers may be exhausted and buyers are gradually regaining strength. Change Of Fortunes For ETH? Although ETH is down 34.3% over the past year, several technical and on-chain indicators point toward a potential bullish trend reversal for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

Key On-Chain Metric Reveals Insights For instance, Ethereum recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart, a bullish indicator that typically leads to major upward moves. Further, there are signs that the cryptocurrency may have already bottomed out for this market cycle. That said, uncertainty remains.

The crypto market is always a dynamic place, constantly shifting between periods where Bitcoin (BTC) leads the charge and times when altcoins surge. Keeping a pulse on these cycles is key to navigating the volatility. One popular metric that helps us understand the current state is the Altcoin Season Index . What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index , tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is a simple yet powerful tool. It provides a snapshot of whether the market is favoring Bitcoin or the broader altcoin universe over a specific period, typically the last 90 days. It compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin. The index ranges from 1 to 100. A score of 75 or higher indicates Altcoin Season – meaning at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A score of 25 or lower indicates Bitcoin Season – meaning 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the same period. As of May 9th, at 00:32 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered 31. This score, being below 25, clearly signals that the market is currently in a phase we call Bitcoin Season . This is down four points from the previous day, reinforcing the trend. Understanding Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market So, what exactly does an index score of 31 tell us? It means that over the past three months, the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins have failed to keep pace with Bitcoin’s price performance. This is a characteristic trait of Bitcoin Season within the crypto market . During this phase, capital tends to consolidate or flow primarily into Bitcoin. There are several potential reasons for this: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin often leads market rallies and corrections. After a significant BTC price move, the market might enter a consolidation phase where altcoins lag. Post-Halving Dynamics: The recent Bitcoin Halving event often focuses narrative and attention on BTC itself, potentially drawing liquidity away from altcoins in the short to medium term. Institutional Interest: Increased institutional adoption, often seen through products like Bitcoin ETFs, can channel significant capital directly into BTC. Risk-Off Sentiment: If there is broader uncertainty in the global financial markets, investors might retreat from higher-risk altcoins back into the perceived relative safety of Bitcoin. How Does This Affect Altcoin Performance? The most direct impact of Bitcoin Season is on altcoin performance . If you hold a portfolio primarily composed of altcoins, you’ve likely noticed that they haven’t performed as well as Bitcoin recently, or perhaps have even declined while BTC held relatively stable. In this environment: Individual altcoin pumps might be short-lived. Altcoins often see larger percentage drops than Bitcoin during market pullbacks. It becomes harder for altcoins to break out and establish independent rallies against BTC. Monitoring the altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin is crucial during this phase to manage expectations and risks. Navigating the Market: Your Investing Strategy During Bitcoin Season An index reading of 31 doesn’t mean altcoins are worthless or that you should abandon them entirely. Instead, it’s a signal to adjust your investing strategy to the current market reality. Here are a few considerations: Assess Your Portfolio: How exposed are you to altcoins versus Bitcoin? Does your current allocation align with a Bitcoin Season environment? Patience is Key: Altcoin Season will likely return eventually, but forcing trades or chasing small pumps during Bitcoin Season can be detrimental. Research and Accumulate: This phase can offer opportunities to research promising projects and potentially accumulate them at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Risk Management: Consider setting tighter stop-losses or reducing position sizes on altcoins during this period of potential underperformance. Adapting your investing strategy based on the prevailing market cycle, indicated by tools like the Altcoin Season Index , can help you better preserve capital and position yourself for future growth. Challenges and Opportunities The primary challenge during Bitcoin Season is the potential for significant altcoin underperformance, leading to frustration for altcoin holders. However, there are also opportunities. This period allows investors to: Identify high-conviction altcoins that may lead the next rally. Accumulate positions in fundamentally strong projects at potentially discounted prices (in BTC terms). Refine their understanding of market cycles and how different assets perform in varying conditions. While the current altcoin performance is subdued relative to BTC, smart investors use this time for research and strategic planning. What Could Signal a Shift Back to Altcoin Season? For the index to climb back towards 75 and signal a return to Altcoin Season, we typically need to see a few things happen: Bitcoin’s price consolidates sideways after a strong run, allowing altcoins to catch up. Capital rotates from Bitcoin profits into higher-risk altcoins seeking greater percentage gains. Major positive developments occur within the altcoin space (e.g., successful network upgrades, significant adoption news). Increased retail investor interest often fuels altcoin rallies. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index for a sustained move upwards is one way to spot this potential shift in the crypto market . Actionable Insights for Investors To wrap things up, here are some actionable takeaways for navigating the current Bitcoin Season : Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index , but use it as one tool among many. Focus on researching projects with strong fundamentals and clear use cases. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into promising altcoins during this period. Prioritize risk management – don’t overextend yourself on speculative altcoin plays. Be patient. Market cycles are a natural part of the crypto market . Your investing strategy should be flexible and adapt to the signals the market provides. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 31 confirms that we are firmly in a period of Bitcoin Season . This means that, on average, altcoin performance is lagging behind Bitcoin. While this phase can be challenging for altcoin holders, it’s also a crucial time for research, strategic accumulation, and refining your investing strategy . Stay informed, manage your risk, and be prepared for the eventual shift back to Altcoin Season.

Now standing at $7.8 million raised , the project has demonstrated early traction , high-volume interest , and a clear upward momentum — all of which have analysts calling it a strategic entry point for 2025. Momentum this early in a presale phase is rare. But when you combine that with analyst insights predicting a 35x to 40x ROI post-listing, it is no surprise that smart investors are re-evaluating their portfolios. MAGACOINFINANCE’s fundamentals — a limited supply, strong U.S.-political meme appeal, and viral community growth — are turning heads in serious investor circles. Analysts Say Early-Stage Demand Shows Signs of Bigger Moves JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Industry research groups have begun to highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE’s demand curve , pointing to the consistent sellouts at every stage and increasingly tight supply pressure . According to one analyst firm covering early-stage tokens, the conversion rate for new investors has outpaced expectations by over 200% — signaling unusually strong momentum even before any centralized exchange (CEX) listing. These indicators, combined with a $0.007 projected listing price , make MAGACOIN FINANCE an appealing asymmetric bet. Analysts are treating it as a potential “Shiba-Inu-level breakout” but with a stronger underlying market narrative rooted in political and cultural relevance. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Could Be a Strategic Hold Into the 2025 Altcoin Cycle Several technical experts are calling this presale the “ low-entry, high-exit window ” that rarely appears this early in a market cycle. With Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL) continuing to stabilize at higher ranges, there is a clear rotation into smaller-cap, high-momentum tokens — and MAGACOINFINANCE is at the forefront of that move. These market dynamics are why many early-stage buyers are not just holding — they’re reloading . The possibility of a major centralized exchange announcement, combined with the community’s grassroots marketing power, points to exponential growth potential heading into the second half of 2025. CLAIM YOUR POSITION — ROI TARGET: 5000%+ Why Analysts Are Backing MAGACOINFINANCE for Major Returns From top-tier crypto analysts to presale tracking groups, the consensus is forming: MAGACOINFINANCE is more than a meme — it’s a movement. Its narrative strength, timing, and tokenomics are aligning in a way few projects manage to execute at this stage. With each new buyer, the community grows stronger — and so does the belief that this is the kind of entry investors regret missing when the listings go live. Whether it is due to tight supply mechanics or the explosive interest from politically driven holders , MAGACOINFINANCE is becoming a clear watchlist staple for analysts across the board.

His successful track record has caught the eye of many. Is XYZVerse poised to become the next big thing? This article delves into why this new digital asset is generating so much excitement. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin Gains Momentum: Bulls Eye Resistance Levels Ahead Dogecoin is trading in the $0.16 to $0.18 range, showing signs of upward momentum. Over the past month, the price has increased by 21.7%, indicating a possible bullish trend. The 10-day simple moving average sits at $0.18, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.17, suggesting short-term strength. The RSI is at 80.49, and the stochastic is at 89.47, both pointing to overbought conditions. Bulls are aiming for the nearest resistance level at $0.19. If the price breaks above this, the next target is $0.21. A rise to $0.21 would represent an approximate increase of 16% from the current price range. However, if bears take control, the support levels to watch are $0.16 and $0.14. Traders are watching these key levels as Dogecoin shows potential for continued growth during the anticipated altcoin season. Conclusion With coins like DOGE showing potential, XYZVerse emerges as a promising memecoin, uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth—the next millionaire-maker in the crypto bull run.

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-mining-company-announces-loss-as-bitcoin-rises-above-100000-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure company Hut 8 has reported a net loss of $134.3 million in the first quarter of 2025 as it undergoes a significant strategic transformation. Hut 8 Reports $134 Million Quarterly Loss Due to Strategic Transformation and Start of Subsidiary This huge loss comes amid intense investment activity and the launch of its new Bitcoin mining subsidiary, American Bitcoin. Quarterly revenue fell 58% year over year to $21.8 million, while adjusted EBITDA fell 60% to a loss of $117.7 million. Hut 8 attributed these results to its transition from traditional mining to a more integrated energy and digital infrastructure platform. “As our results show, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary investment phase. We believe the benefits of this work will become increasingly evident in the coming quarters,” said Asher Genoot, Hut 8 CEO. A key part of Hut 8's restructuring was the creation of American Bitcoin, a newly established subsidiary focused on Bitcoin mining and hoarding. This company was founded through a strategic addition of Hut 8's ASIC mining fleet to American Data Centers, Inc., which is backed by investors such as Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The company said American Bitcoin provides a “pure” mining platform and simplifies Hut 8’s capital allocation, freeing up resources to expand other lines of business such as high-performance computing (HPC). Operational Highlights Despite financial losses, Hut 8 made strong operational progress in the first quarter: Hashrate increased by 79%, reflecting aggressive infrastructure upgrades. Fleet efficiency increased by 37% thanks to a major ASIC upgrade completed in early April. The company held 10,264 Bitcoins worth $847.2 million as of March 31, 2025. Hut 8 shares closed up 11.93% at $14.17 on Thursday, buoyed by a general rally in crypto markets as Bitcoin broke through the $100,000 resistance level. The company’s strategic turnaround and increase in mining efficiency appear to have caught the attention of investors who are closely watching to see if Hut 8 can benefit from its new direction in the coming quarters. *This is not investment advice.

44365361,https://crypto.news/?p=14377664,1746777959,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/44365361.jpeg,MOODENG rallies over 130% as open interest soars and exchange balances drop,https://crypto.news/moodeng-rallies-over-130-as-open-interest-soars-and-exchange-balances-drop/,"Moo Deng price gained momentum on Friday as it soared by over 136%, making it one of the best-performing tokens in crypto. Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), the pygmy hippo-themed meme coin, surged to an intraday high of $0.104 on May 9 afternoon Asian time—its highest level since Feb. 1. The token has now gained over 300% from its yearly low. The ongoing surge coincides with a nearly 440% spike in futures open interest, hitting $125 million, the highest since Jan. 7 per CoinGlass data . Just a month ago, open interest was sitting at only $13.4 million. Rising open interest usually points to growing interest from traders and more speculative activity in the market. The rally also aligns with the altcoin’s weighted funding rate flipping positive today. A positive funding rate basically means that traders going long are paying a small fee to shorts. It’s a sign that more people are leaning bullish and willing to pay up to hold their long positions. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows investors are holding onto their tokens, with exchanges seeing seven straight days of net outflows totaling around $3.5 million. That’s generally bullish because it suggests people are moving tokens off exchanges into private wallets, reducing the immediate selling pressure. You might also like: Ethereum rallies 20% as ETH reaches its most undervalued level relative to BTC since 2019 Adding fuel to the hype, there’s growing buzz in the community that Binance might list MOODENG on its spot market. While nothing is confirmed, speculation is heating up since MOODENG is already trading on Binance Futures and has listings on big exchanges like Coinbase, OKX, Bitget, and Gate.io. MOODENG’s rally today also mirrors a wider memecoin boom, fuelled in part by Bitcoin’s rally past $100,000 for the first time since February. The bellwether’s momentum has reignited risk appetite across the market, sending the total memecoin market cap up 15% in the last 24 hours. Other big names like Pepe ( PEPE ), Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), Popcat ( POPCAT ), and Mog Coin ( MOG ) have also posted strong gains of 20–50%. Bitcoin was trading around $103,075 at press time, just shy of its all-time high, dominating market sentiment and helping pull a broad range of altcoins higher. MOODENG price analysis On the 4-hour USDT chart, MOODENG has broken above the upper boundary of a bull flag pattern, signaling a potential continuation of the uptrend based on classic technical analysis. MOODENG price, 50-day and 200-day EMA chart — May 9 | Source: crypto.news Importantly, the 50-day moving average is still holding above the 200-day, meaning the golden cross is still intact, keeping the longer-term bullish trend in play. Momentum indicators are also lining up with the bullish outlook. The MACD lines have turned upward, hinting at growing positive momentum. MOODENG MACD and RSI chart — May 9 | Source: crypto.news On top of that, the Relative Strength Index has surged deep into overbought territory, hitting 94.7. While this could signal that the rally is overheated in the short term, strong rallies in meme coins can stay overbought longer than expected. With this setup, MOODENG could continue climbing toward its next big hurdle at the $0.20 psychological resistance level. A clean break above that could pave the way for bulls to target this year’s high of $0.31, which was last seen on Jan. 4. As previously noted by analysts at crypto.news, historical trends suggest that once Bitcoin’s dominance approaches the 72.92% level, last seen in December 2022, investors could begin rotating capital into altcoins. Currently, Bitcoin Dominance sits at 64.14%. If history repeats, it could result in additional momentum for memecoins like MOODENG in the coming weeks.

What really went wrong behind the hype,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-pi-network-dead-what-really-went-wrong-behind-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"What Pi Network promised When Pi Network first hit the scene in 2019, it had a simple but compelling pitch: What if you could mine cryptocurrency straight from your phone — no expensive gear, no massive electricity bills, just a tap a day on an app? It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board , lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi ( PI ) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide. Did you know? Pi Network utilizes the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which aims for energy efficiency and decentralization, differing from Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work. What the Pi Network delivered The roadmap was supposed to be gradual: start with mobile mining, then move toward a testnet, KYC rollout and, finally, full mainnet launch with real trading and utility. But that last step took a lot longer than anyone expected. After years in limbo, the Pi Network finally opened its mainnet to external trading in February 2025. That should’ve been a big win. But it didn’t go smoothly. For one, not all users were able to migrate their balances. Know Your Customer (KYC) verification became a bottleneck, and many were left wondering when — or if — they’d ever be able to access the tokens they’d mined for years. Then there was the price. When Pi first started trading on external platforms, the price spiked, hitting as high as $2.98 in late February. But the hype didn’t last. As early adopters started selling off their tokens and real-world use cases remained thin, the price slid hard. By early May 2025, it had dropped to around $0.58, wiping out more than 70% of its value. There’s also still no real utility. You can’t spend Pi on much (only in small, community-run markets and pilot programs). And while the team talks about building a full ecosystem of apps and services, it’s unclear how fast — or how seriously — that’s progressing. Why the crypto community grew skeptical As the months turned into years, more and more red flags started popping up, and the community started asking hard questions. 1. Still waiting on the mainnet Pi launched in 2019, and for years, users kept hearing that the open mainnet was “just around the corner.” First there was the testnet. Then the “enclosed mainnet.” Then a roadmap update. The actual open network didn’t arrive until early 2025 — six years later. And by that time, a lot of early believers had started losing faith. 2. All roads lead back to the core team Despite the talk of decentralization , the reality is that the Pi Core Team has retained almost total control over the project. Every active mainnet node? Controlled by them. Most of the token supply? Still in their hands. That doesn’t sit well with crypto users who believe in distributed power and community-driven networks. Right now, Pi feels more like a private company than a decentralized protocol. 3. Where’s the transparency? Another sticking point has been the lack of detail on how Pi actually works under the hood. The white paper is vague. There’s no clear breakdown of tokenomics , no timelines on when tokens unlock, no burn mechanics and no insight into supply control. Without that info, it’s hard for anyone to judge the health or future value of the project. 4. Exchange listings Despite years of hype, Pi still isn’t listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. It is tradable on some platforms like OKX and Bitget, but even there, things are shaky. Some users have reported trouble withdrawing their tokens, with exchanges blaming “traffic spikes” and other vague technical reasons. It all feels a bit fragile. For instance, one user on Bitget reported depositing 1,500 Pi tokens but found them inaccessible, with no clear timeline for resolution. On OKX, withdrawals were suspended for over 24 hours, with users asked to provide ID and email verification but given vague responses like “Your request will be completed within 24-48 hours.” By April 2025, users reported that MEXC , another exchange listing Pi, suspended Pi withdrawals, sparking concerns about liquidity and platform reliability. This was compounded by reports of large Pi transfers from MEXC, Gate.io and Bitget to OKX wallets, raising suspicions of coordinated price manipulation or exchange-level issues. 5. Fake volume and fading hype At its peak in February 2025, Pi was trading at nearly $3 and generating billions in volume. Fast forward a few months, and that volume has dropped off a cliff — down to around $40 million. That kind of collapse raises serious questions: Was the demand real, or was it inflated by speculation, bots or internal market-making? 6. Users trapped in a closed loop Even now, many users can’t actually use or withdraw their Pi tokens. Without access to real exchanges or spending options, they’re stuck in a kind of token limbo, watching a number go up in an app but with no way to convert that into anything useful. Did you know? While Pi Network claims over 70 million users, blockchain data indicates that only about 9.11 million wallets exist, with approximately 20,000 showing daily activity. Is Pi Network a scam or just a failed vision? Not every crypto project that stumbles is a scam. Some are just ambitious ideas that don’t quite pan out. So, where does Pi Network fall? On the surface, Pi doesn’t fit the classic scam mold. There was no initial coin offering (ICO) , no upfront investment required — just an app that lets you “mine” Pi by tapping your phone daily. That’s a low bar for entry, and it attracted millions. But dig a little deeper, and things get murkier. The whole system leans heavily on referrals, encouraging users to bring in more people to boost their mining rate. That kind of structure starts to resemble a multi-level marketing scheme more than a decentralized crypto project. Then there’s the monetization angle. The app is filled with ads, and users are required to complete KYC verification, handing over personal data. So, while you’re not paying money, you’re paying with your attention and information. Given these developments, critics such as Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, and Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, have publicly expressed skepticism regarding Pi Network’s legitimacy . Pi Network might not be a blatant fraud, but the combination of opaque operations, aggressive referral tactics and questionable monetization strategies certainly raises eyebrows. Did you know? Pi Network was officially launched on March 14, 2019 — Pi Day — symbolizing the mathematical constant π (3.14). Can Pi recover, or is it over? Is there a path forward for Pi Network? Possibly, but it’s a steep climb. First, transparency is key. Open-sourcing the code would allow the community to verify what’s under the hood and build trust. Second, Pi needs real utility. Right now, holding Pi doesn’t offer much beyond the hope of future value. Integrating Pi into actual use cases — like payments or decentralized applications — would give the token purpose. Third, broader exchange listings are crucial. Currently, Pi is available on a limited number of exchanges , which hampers liquidity and price discovery. Major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have yet to list Pi, citing concerns over transparency and regulatory compliance. Fourth, decentralization must be more than a buzzword. Currently, the Pi Core Team maintains significant control over the network, which contradicts the principles of decentralization. Implementing decentralized governance would distribute decision-making power and align with the ethos of blockchain technology. But even if all these boxes are checked, time is a factor. Since its mainnet launch in early 2025, Pi’s price has dropped significantly, and user engagement has waned. Rebuilding momentum is challenging. Without significant changes, the Pi Network risks fading into obscurity, remembered more for its unfulfilled promises than its achievements.",Pi Network,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-09 08:10:00
44365555,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158859,1746778254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SEC Commissioner Crenshaw Issues Critical Opposition to Ripple Settlement,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-crenshaw-opposes-ripple/,"In a significant development shaking the ongoing legal saga between the SEC and Ripple , a top official within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has voiced strong opposition to the agency’s proposed settlement with the blockchain company behind XRP . This internal dissent highlights the complex and often contentious nature of Crypto Regulation in the United States. What’s Happening with the SEC and Ripple? The core of the news revolves around SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw ‘s public statement regarding the settlement letter the SEC filed with Ripple in a New York court. This proposed settlement aims to resolve the long-standing lawsuit accusing Ripple of conducting unregistered securities offerings through its sale of XRP . The settlement, as reported by Cointelegraph and confirmed by Crenshaw’s statement, includes terms that would dissolve an injunction issued in August 2024 and return a significant portion of civil penalties held in escrow – specifically, $75 million out of $125 million. While settlements are common mechanisms to conclude legal disputes, this one has drawn sharp criticism from within the regulatory body itself. Here are the key points regarding the proposed settlement terms and Crenshaw’s opposition: Proposed Settlement: Aims to end the lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple . Injunction Dissolution: Seeks to remove an existing injunction against Ripple . Penalty Return: Proposes returning $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow. Commissioner’s Stance: Caroline Crenshaw publicly opposes the terms. Reason for Opposition: Concerns over undermining the court’s role and failing to adequately protect investors and markets. Why Does Caroline Crenshaw Oppose the Settlement? Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw ‘s opposition, detailed in her May 8 statement on the SEC ‘s website, centers on fundamental concerns about the implications of the proposed settlement terms. Her arguments suggest that the settlement, as structured, does not align with the agency’s core mission of protecting investors and maintaining fair markets. Crenshaw specifically argued that approving this settlement would: Undermine the Court’s Role: She believes the settlement terms do not fully respect or uphold the court’s previous rulings and interpretations of securities laws as they apply to XRP and Ripple ‘s activities. This suggests a concern that the settlement might walk back or soften the impact of judicial findings. Fail to Protect Investors and Markets: This is a cornerstone of her argument. Crenshaw likely believes the penalties or the terms do not go far enough to deter future violations or compensate investors who may have been harmed. Her focus on investor protection is a recurring theme in her public statements on Crypto Regulation . Her dissent is noteworthy because it’s a public disagreement from a sitting commissioner regarding a significant enforcement action settlement. While commissioners don’t always agree, publicly opposing a filed settlement is a strong signal of serious concerns about the agency’s approach. Understanding Caroline Crenshaw’s Stance on Crypto Regulation and Investor Protection Commissioner Crenshaw has consistently taken a cautious and often critical stance regarding the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the need for robust Crypto Regulation to safeguard retail investors. She has frequently highlighted what she sees as significant risks within the crypto space, including fraud, manipulation, and a lack of transparency. Her position aligns with a segment within the SEC that views many digital assets and related activities as falling squarely under existing securities laws, necessitating strict enforcement. For Crenshaw, investor protection is paramount, and she appears to believe that the proposed Ripple settlement falls short of achieving this goal effectively. What Are the Implications of This Opposition? While the SEC staff can negotiate and propose settlements, the final approval often rests with the courts, especially in cases involving injunctions. A public opposition from a commissioner, even if not legally binding on the court, adds a layer of complexity and scrutiny to the process. Potential implications include: Judicial Scrutiny: The judge overseeing the case may take Crenshaw’s statement into consideration when reviewing the proposed settlement for fairness and public interest. Internal SEC Dynamics: The opposition reveals internal disagreements within the SEC on how best to regulate the crypto market and resolve high-profile cases like Ripple ‘s. Market Perception: The dissent could be interpreted differently by various market participants – some seeing it as the SEC being overly aggressive, others as a necessary stand for investor protection . Future Enforcement: Crenshaw’s stance might signal a desire within the agency for tougher terms in future crypto settlements, potentially impacting other ongoing or future cases. This development underscores the ongoing debate about the appropriate level and nature of Crypto Regulation needed to balance innovation with the need to protect the public. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community and XRP Holders For those following the SEC vs. Ripple case or holding XRP , Commissioner Crenshaw’s opposition adds a degree of uncertainty to the expected resolution. While a settlement is still possible, her statement highlights potential hurdles or at least increased scrutiny. What should you watch for? Court’s Decision: The ultimate outcome rests with the court’s approval of the settlement terms. Pay close attention to any judicial response to the filing and Crenshaw’s statement. Further SEC Statements: While less likely, any further public comments from other commissioners or SEC leadership on this specific issue could provide more clarity on the agency’s internal consensus (or lack thereof). Ripple’s Response: How Ripple addresses this development, if at all publicly, could also be telling. This event serves as a reminder that the path to regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains complex and subject to differing views even within the regulatory bodies themselves. The focus on investor protection will continue to be a driving force in these debates. Compelling Summary In a surprising twist in the long-running SEC vs. Ripple case, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has publicly opposed the agency’s proposed settlement terms. Citing concerns that the agreement would undermine the court’s authority and fail to adequately protect investors and markets, her dissent shines a spotlight on internal disagreements within the SEC regarding the handling of high-profile Crypto Regulation matters. This opposition adds an element of uncertainty to the settlement’s approval process and underscores the ongoing, complex debate about how best to regulate the rapidly evolving crypto landscape while prioritizing investor protection .

Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa, a 35-year-old from Springfield, Virginia, was handed a sentence of 30 years and four months by a federal judge on May 7. According to the Department of Justice, Chhipa sent more than $185,000 to ISIS operatives over a three-year period, helping fund escape operations and combat efforts in Syria. Prosecutors said he played a key role in moving funds through cryptocurrency to conceal their origins and avoid detection. Chhipa’s sentencing comes after a federal jury convicted him in December 2024 on one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and four counts of providing or attempting to provide such support. The DOJ described him as a key financial facilitator who used social media to raise money and then converted those funds into crypto before sending them to intermediaries in Turkey From there, the money was smuggled across the border into Syria to reach ISIS fighters and female supporters stuck in detention camps. You might also like: US government seizes crypto tied to Hamas terrorist financing The DOJ said Chhipa’s actions helped bolster ISIS’s operational capacity. His primary contact during the scheme was a British-born ISIS member based in Syria known for planning terror attacks and orchestrating breakouts. Prosecutors said Chhipa used various tactics to hide his activity, including misspelled email accounts and aliases when buying travel tickets, and even attempted to flee the U.S. during the investigation. He traveled through multiple countries, including Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, and Germany, before he was stopped in Egypt and returned to the U.S. under an Interpol Blue Notice. According to U.S. Attorney Erik S. Siebert, “Chhipa knowingly and persistently collected and provided a considerable amount of money to fund the violence of an organization bent on forcing their extremist ideology on others.” The May 7 sentencing is the latest in a growing series of U.S. enforcement actions targeting the use of cryptocurrency in terrorist financing. Authorities have ramped up efforts to dismantle digital funding networks linked to groups like ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah , and the Houthis. Last month, the DOJ seized over $200,000 in cryptocurrency tied to Hamas operations, part of a broader scheme that laundered over $1.5 million since October 2024. The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has also been actively targeting wallets associated with sanctioned entities. In April the agency, blacklisted eight crypto addresses used by the Houthis to fund arms purchases and evade sanctions. U.S. enforcement agencies continue to stress that disrupting financial pipelines is key to weakening terror groups’ capabilities.

This follows the Senate’s failure to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a federal framework for stablecoins and other digital assets. Bessent, known for his political ties and influence in conservative financial policy circles, issued a sharp rebuke of lawmakers who blocked the legislation, writing: “For stablecoins and other digital assets to thrive globally, the world needs American leadership. The Senate missed an opportunity to provide that leadership today by failing to advance the GENIUS Act.” ~ Scott Bessent He went on to call the bill a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to extend dollar dominance through innovation. Bessent warned that without the bill, stablecoins would face inconsistent state regulations instead of a unified federal framework that supports growth and competition. He told Senators blocking progress they had a clear choice: either lead or watch digital asset innovation move abroad. For stablecoins and other digital assets to thrive globally, the world needs American leadership. The Senate missed an opportunity to provide that leadership today by failing to advance the GENIUS Act. This bill represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to expand dollar… — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) May 8, 2025 Bessent’s crypto comments spark online uproar over U.S. control and stablecoin motives The backlash was immediate. Critics on X (formerly Twitter) denounced Bessent’s comments as out-of-touch with the core ethos of crypto, decentralization, and independence from centralized powers like the U.S. government. One user said that the GENIUS Bill is not about innovation but the U.S. moving towards a sovereign digital currency via the stablecoin backdoor. A second user directed a question at U.S. Senator Rand Paul on X, asking, “@RandPaul, what’s your excuse for voting against this?” Reddit’s r/CryptoCurrency forum lit up with memes mocking the idea that U.S. dominance could be synonymous with global digital innovation. Many also accused Bessent of using crypto to preserve U.S. financial hegemony under the guise of progress. Still, one user appeared to support Bessent’s stance, urging, “Stop voting for Democrats who openly oppose crypto,” highlighting what they saw as growing hostility from some lawmakers toward the digital asset industry. GENIUS Act draws fire over-centralization, Trump ties, and global crypto concerns The GENIUS Act was pitched as a bipartisan attempt to finally give federal clarity to stablecoins and digital assets, something U.S. crypto advocates have long demanded. Supporters argue it would legitimize dollar-backed digital tokens and help U.S. firms compete globally. But critics say the bill leaned too heavily on federal oversight and would ultimately concentrate control in the hands of a few government-sanctioned entities, possibly undermining crypto’s open-source foundation. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent critic of the GENIUS Act, stated that if the GENIUS Act goes forward without changes, Donald Trump will continue to line his pockets with his crypto scams. In contrast, his policies continue to tank the economy for others. Senator Jeff Merkley also said that people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls. He noted this is a profoundly corrupt scheme. Merkley added that it endangers national security and erodes public trust in government. He urged his fellow lawmakers and community to help end this corruption immediately. Bessent’s framing also drew criticism for its nationalistic tone. Crypto industry veterans from Europe, Latin America, and Asia pointed out that thriving ecosystems already exist in countries with clearer and more adaptive rules — like Switzerland, Singapore, and the UAE. In other developments, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Trump’s crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC. This company launched Trump’s meme coin and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration, and foreign governments.

Speaking at the European Anti-Financial Crime Summit 2025 in Dublin, Eurogroup President and Ireland’s Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe laid out the EU’s plans to ramp up transparency across crypto transactions. Regulators are coming for the black box of crypto. So what exactly is changing and how deep does this go? Let’s break it down. Crypto Transfers Under the Microscope Donohoe revealed that the EU is working on a legislative “reclass of performance transfer mechanisms,” which would extend traditional finance-style oversight to crypto asset service providers (CASPs). “Specifically, to record data on the senders and recipients of funds, [so it] now applies to crypto asset service providers,” Donohoe said during his keynote. The push, he emphasized, is about expanding regulatory scope to “deal with crypto transparency issues.” You know they’re being serious because it’s the latest move in a years-long strategy to tighten the EU’s grip on crypto – and if you’ve been watching closely, you’ll know this has been building for a while. Regulators want to dive headfirst into the blockchain pool, armed with the full weight of the AML agenda. The AML Package: No Room for Anonymity! The EU’s AML Authority (AMLA) is being positioned as the central force to enforce the new rules. Donohoe called it a “landmark development,” stressing that “closer cooperation and coordination is absolutely critical.” And the changes go beyond today’s announcements. Under the AMLR framework – officially passed in 2023 – crypto firms will be barred from interacting with anonymous wallets and privacy-focused coins like Monero ($XMR) and Zcash ($ZEC). These restrictions will take full effect by July 1, 2027 . In fact, regulators plan to block IP addresses of non-compliant decentralized exchanges, marking one of the most aggressive regulatory crackdowns the crypto space has seen yet. DeFi’s Dilemma Critics are not staying quiet about this. Unity Wallet COO James Toledano warned that while these rules mimic traditional banking, they don’t fit well with crypto’s decentralized structure. He added, “They can and will be easily circumvented as self-custodial crypto is truly global.” Still, the EU isn’t backing down. Transparency is becoming law. What Brussels is telling us is: if crypto wants to stay in the game, it has to start playing by traditional rules. Good move or bad?

The platform allegedly facilitated money laundering for major crypto heists including the Bybit and Multisig hacks. According to an official statement issued on May 9, the Frankfurt Prosecutor’s Office announced it had shut down the crypto exchange platform, seizing an array of crypto assets worth 34 million euros or equal to $38.2 million. These assets consisted of a mix of Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Litecoin ( LTC ), and Dash ( DASH ). The prosecutor’s office dubbed it the “third-largest seizure of crypto assets in the history of the BKA.” Authorities accused the team behind the platform of commercial money laundering and operating a criminal trading platform. According to renowned crypto investigator ZachXBT, the platform was used to launder hundreds of millions of funds from some of the largest crypto hacks in history. It was allegedly used to launder funds from the $1.5 billion Bybit hack , the $1.4 billion Multisig hack, the FixedFloat exploit, and the theft of around $243 million from Genesis Creditor, as well as various phishing scams over the past few years.

Director of the Federal Criminal Police Office and Head of the Cybercrime Division, Carsten Meywirth has confirmed that the bureau has secured “a record-breaking sum of millions in incriminating cryptocurrencies” as well as effectively shut down the platform. “We will continue to increase the risk of loss for the underground economy with all the means at our disposal. Our goal remains to hold those responsible accountable,” said Meywirth. How did eXch allegedly launder hacking funds? eXch is known as a crypto exchange service that allowed customers to swap between crypto assets easily. It was made accessible on both the public web as well as the dark web. In fact, it has been specifically marketing itself on sites linked to the criminal underground. It appealed to dark web operators because unlike most crypto exchange platforms, it did not abide to anti-money laundering measures. This meant that users did not have to identify themselves or submit Know-Your-Customer verification. The platform also claimed it does not store user information. Therefore, the platform made it particularly increasingly easy for users to cover their financial tracks. Since it was established in 2014, the platform has facilitated around $1.9 billion worth of crypto transactions. Authorities suspect the platform has been accepting Bitcoin originating from illegal activity. Not only that, the Frankfurt law enforcement have found evidence that the platform may have been used to launder a portion of the $1.5 billion of stolen funds from the Bybit hack. On Feb. 21, crypto exchange Bybit suffered one of the largest exploits in the web3 space. The hackers were able to extract around $1.46 billion from Bybit’s ETH cold wallet. According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, nearly 30% of the funds stolen from Bybit can no longer be tracked. Meanwhile, he believes as much as 84.5% have been converted to Bitcoin via cross-chain liquidity protocol THORchain .

While enjoying some spring baseball in Cleveland, he gave a serious warning: we’re in the middle of a big shift, not a one-day disaster . Powell Is Stuck When asked what advice he’d give Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Gromen joked: “Get a time machine, go back to 2021, and resign when everyone still liked you.” His point? Powell is stuck. No matter what he does now, one group or another—consumers, bondholders, the military, or politicians—will be upset. There’s no easy win. Why Debt Matters Now Some people say we've always had debt, so why panic now? Gromen says this time is different. For example: Interest payments on U.S. debt are now higher than the defense budget —that’s never happened before. Government income (taxes) is no longer enough to pay for Social Security, Medicare, and interest on debt —this is also new. The Federal Reserve is losing money , which hasn’t happened since the Civil War. These are huge warning signs. Gromen says we’re watching the system break slowly, not all at once. Signs of the Breakdown Gromen calls this a ""process."" He explains we are already seeing: Prices for gold, Bitcoin, and stocks rising even when interest rates go up—which normally isn’t supposed to happen. U.S. leaders constantly stepping in to keep bond markets from crashing. More drug overdoses, political anger, and tension with China —all signs of social and economic stress. So, even if there are no zombies in the streets, the system is under pressure. It’s not a big bang. It’s a slow leak. What's Happening With Currencies? He points out something unusual: the Taiwan dollar is getting stronger, as are other Asian currencies. That’s strange, because the U.S. dollar is usually the king. Gromen thinks this may be part of a quiet deal happening behind the scenes—maybe countries are trying to make their currencies reflect trade strength more fairly. If that’s true, it could mean the U.S. dollar will get weaker over time. Gold and Bitcoin as Lifeboats Gromen talks about a new strategy the U.S. Treasury may be using to weaken the dollar—buying foreign money using gold without asking Congress. That’s big, and it could make gold even more important in the future. He also warns that countries might start blocking money from leaving their economies . This is called capital control. He thinks it could start in Europe or Japan, but eventually even the U.S. may do it in hidden ways—like forcing retirement accounts to hold more government bonds. What Should People Do? Gromen says this is a dangerous time. He calls it a period of “wealth destruction” —a time when you can lose money easily, even if you do nothing wrong. His advice: Don’t try to trade or time the market unless you’re a pro. Hold about 20% of your savings in gold and Bitcoin. Keep some cash in case things move quickly. Focus on protecting your money, health, and relationships—not just profits. Final Thoughts This isn’t just an American problem. Gromen says that only Americans think a financial crisis means total collapse. People in other parts of the world see it as a rough patch—they survive and adapt. The U.S. needs to do the same. Key takeaways: Debt is now hurting the system in ways we’ve never seen before. The breakdown is slow but real—rising gold, inflation, and political stress are signs. Gold and Bitcoin can help protect your wealth as the dollar weakens.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-09 09:24:42

In his previous reports, he stated that institutions prefer Solana over Ethereum and that SOL could displace ETH. However, the bank seems to have given up on this idea, as Sygnum Bank stated that it does not expect Solana to overtake Ethereum in the medium term. The giant bank said it has “no convincing signs” that Solana can overtake Ethereum as the blockchain of choice for institutions, as revenue from memecoins remains volatile. “We are not yet seeing compelling signs that Solana will be the preferred choice, as the security, stability and longevity of Ethereum are highly valued.” Sygnum has completely retracted its previous view, claiming that institutions may choose Ethereum over Solana because the market sees Solana’s revenue generation as “less stable” as it is “concentrated in the memecoin sector.” Solana leads Ethereum in market share for layer-1 fee generation, the bank said, but most of the fees are paid to validators and do not increase the value of the Solana token. “In fact, Ethereum still outperforms Solana by 2-2.5x when it comes to revenues,” it added. Ethereum rose 18% in the last 24 hours to $2,250. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Giant Bank Flipped!

Price data shows both wallet expansion and exchange withdrawals have slowed which indicates unfavorable market conditions for the near future. The value of Cardano sits at $0.658 as it tries to overcome resistance following its initial upward movement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is experiencing a strong presale rise through its sale of 450 million tokens that brought in $7.9 million. The project’s current presale phase four offers tokens priced at $0.025. 9,600 active token holders provide a return potential of 140% that is locked into MUTM’s planned $0.06 listing price. Mutuum Finance continues to lead among crypto assets because its presale has gained immense momentum despite XRP and ADA facing market challenges in their quest to reach $4.50 first. XRP’s Stumbling Momentum The XRP price continues to decline as it remains below its critical $2.30 milestone. Technical indicators paint a grim picture: Chaikin Money Flow signals capital outflows, and the MACD reflects bearish pressure. The data relating to blockchain operations shows a continuous decline in new wallet creation starting from December. Investor reluctance has shown through reduced exchange outflow activity. The liquidation heatmaps indicate support might emerge at $2 which serves as a critical psychological barrier. The upcoming XRP trajectory appears challenging despite positive outlooks related to Ripple’s legal battle and massive whale activities. Investors keep a close eye on the token yet its slow progress reduces the likelihood of XRP reaching $4.50 anytime soon. Cardano’s Cautious Climb ADA holders can find the coin at $0.658 as it remains trapped in this limited range. The daily chart displays minor bearish trends as traders demonstrate hesitance through a 45.62 RSI reading. Risks of price correction arise from resistance where $0.748 stands against the market with additional selling pressure emerging from the lower Bollinger Band at $0.599. The 4-hour technical indicators display MACD in negative territory and Balance of Power positioned at -0.42. Cardano demonstrates a scalable blockchain and energy-efficient Ouroboros but maintains weak market momentum. Research indicates ADA will reach $1 by 2025 although its current performance trails behind other actively developing crypto projects. Cardano needs a significant event to break through its current barrier to reach $4.50. Mutuum Finance’s Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to draw widespread investor interest during its stage 4 presale which has achieved 65% completion. With a phase 4 price of $0.025 the token has captured 9,600 holders and generated $7.9 million through its initial stages sales. The future Phase 5 price increase to $0.03 will generate a 20% profit for current holders while boosting the token value. The tokenomics provide investors with a guaranteed return of 140% during the $0.06 market release before expected market value reaches $3.50. A CertiK audit review is finishing at the current time as the team will reveal updates through social media platforms. A new dashboard distributes bonus tokens to the top 50 holders thus creating higher demand for the token. Mutuum Finance demonstrates faster and more orderly growth than XRP and ADA. Racing to $4.50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has proven to advance faster than XRP and Cardano toward the $4.50 price milestone. The presale momentum of MUTM outweighs XRP’s bearish signals and Cardano’s slow recovery period. Mutuum Finance shows unmatched potential through its estimated 5,500% return on investment at $3.50 market value after launch. Investors need to proceed with their investments before phase 4 termination.

As nations worldwide grapple with how to best integrate this burgeoning technology, eyes are often on major economies like South Korea. Recent developments within the country’s political sphere indicate a growing recognition of the potential within the South Korea crypto market , signaling a potential shift towards more proactive engagement. DPK Crypto Policy: A Call to Action A significant move highlighting this shift comes from the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), a major political force in the nation. According to reports from Yonhap Infomax, the DPK recently convened a seminar specifically dedicated to formulating cryptocurrency policies and regulations. This event brought together various experts from the crypto sector, underscoring the party’s commitment to understanding and potentially shaping the future of digital assets in the country. During this crucial seminar, DPK lawmaker Lee Un-ju delivered a compelling message. She stressed the vital importance of South Korea making a decisive entry into the crypto market. Her timing is notable, emphasizing that this step should be taken while the sector is experiencing significant Crypto industry growth and is on a clear upward trajectory. This perspective suggests a desire to capitalize on current momentum rather than waiting on the sidelines. Navigating the South Korea Crypto Market Opportunity Why is now considered a crucial time for South Korea to deepen its involvement in the crypto market? The rapid innovation and increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies globally present vast opportunities. For a technologically advanced nation like South Korea, embracing this trend could: Foster technological innovation and development within the country. Attract global investment and talent in the blockchain and crypto space. Potentially create new economic growth engines. Position South Korea as a leader in the future digital economy. However, entering this market also comes with inherent complexities and risks that require careful consideration. The Urgency for South Korea Crypto Regulation Lawmaker Lee Un-ju didn’t just call for market entry; she also advocated for a specific type of regulatory framework. Her vision is for regulations designed not to stifle, but to actively accelerate growth within the sector. This is a critical distinction often debated in crypto policy circles globally. The challenge lies in creating rules that protect investors and prevent illicit activities while simultaneously allowing innovation and market participation to flourish. Striking this balance is key to fostering healthy Korea crypto adoption . Overly restrictive regulations can drive activity underground or push businesses and talent to more favorable jurisdictions. Conversely, a lack of clear rules can lead to scams, market manipulation, and significant risks for everyday citizens looking to participate. What Does This Mean for Korea Crypto Adoption? The DPK’s focus on developing a comprehensive DPK crypto policy suggests a potential shift towards creating a more predictable and supportive environment for crypto-related activities. This could pave the way for increased adoption among both institutional players and the general public in South Korea. Clearer rules around exchanges, digital asset classification, taxation, and consumer protection are often seen as necessary steps to build trust and encourage broader participation. The seminar and lawmaker Lee Un-ju’s statements serve as a strong indicator that influential political figures in South Korea recognize the potential of the crypto space and are actively exploring pathways for the nation to become a more significant player. The emphasis on growth-oriented regulation is particularly noteworthy, suggesting a forward-thinking approach aimed at harnessing the economic benefits of the crypto revolution. As discussions continue and policies take shape, the coming months will be crucial in determining South Korea’s trajectory in the global crypto landscape. The outcome of these policy debates will significantly impact the future of the South Korea crypto regulation framework and the pace of innovation and adoption within the country.

The four-day visit included military parades, joint statements, red carpets, and a clear message to the United States—Trump’s not in control of this alliance, and they’re not afraid to show it. Xi didn’t come alone either. Nearly 30 other world leaders flew in for the occasion, but it was his presence that gave Putin what he wanted—proof that Russia still had friends while the US tries to box him in. Xi stepped off the plane and got right to business, standing next to Putin in one of the Kremlin’s flashiest halls. The two didn’t just exchange pleasantries—they revived the “no-limits” partnership they had first declared in 2022, just before Russia invaded Ukraine. They both claimed the world needs a new balance of power, one that doesn’t put America on top. Putin called their relationship “equal and mutually beneficial” and said it wasn’t tied to current world affairs. Xi called Putin an “old friend” and described their ties as “confident, stable and resilient.” Putin uses parade to push global support During the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, Putin leaned hard into symbolism. Standing with Xi, he praised the “sacred” victory over Nazi Germany, saying the win still matters today. He made the usual stretch, linking that historical fight to his current war in Ukraine, which he keeps trying to sell as a battle against modern fascists. “Together with our Chinese friends, we firmly stand guard over historical truth,” Putin said, “protect the memory of the events of the war years, and counteract modern manifestations of neo-Nazism and militarism.” That narrative’s been rejected flat-out by Ukraine and much of the West, who say Putin is using fake justifications for an invasion. Still, the Victory Day parade rolled on. Chinese troops made up the biggest foreign unit in the show, marching alongside soldiers from Vietnam, Belarus, Laos, Mongolia, and Egypt. Robert Tollast, a researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said this display shows both countries believe they’ve got “nothing to lose.” He said the way Putin and Xi are handling America signals their patience with diplomacy is over. The alliance is open, and it’s real. China keeps Russia afloat while Trump scrambles Putin needed this visit. With US and EU sanctions hammering his economy since 2022, Russia’s been gasping for support. Xi delivered. While China claims it’s neutral in the Ukraine war, it’s also quietly buying tons of Russian oil and selling parts like microchips that keep Russia’s drones and missiles flying. Xi said the China-Russia friendship is “a natural continuation” of a long-standing bond, and that both nations would protect the interests of developing countries while promoting “multipolar economic globalization.” For Putin, this wasn’t just about foreign optics. It was about telling the people back home he’s still got powerful allies. Stephen Hall, a politics lecturer at the University of Bath, said Xi’s visit and the appearance of other leaders from Latin America, Africa, and Asia help Putin push the idea that Russia isn’t isolated. He still wants to look like a reliable global player, even if the US wants to keep him boxed out. Meanwhile, Trump is trying to fix things with China while watching Xi and Putin cozy up. During an event where he announced a new trade deal with the UK, Trump admitted tariffs on Chinese goods—some as high as 145%—might come down. He said, “You can’t get any higher. It’s at 145, so we know it’s coming down.” A meeting between US and Chinese trade officials is planned this weekend in Switzerland, and Trump tried to spin it positively. “I think it’s a very friendly meeting,” he said. “They look forward to doing it in an elegant way.” Xi first called Putin his “best friend” in 2019 during a state visit to Moscow. He said, “Russia is the country that I have visited the most times, and President Putin is my best friend and colleague.” Putin has responded in kind ever since, calling Xi a “dear friend” during their most recent meeting in Beijing in May 2024.

In a brief yet impactful post , he stated, “Road to 2 Digits. Have a great weekend!” This statement, though concise, has ignited excitement and speculation within the XRP community, commonly referred to as the XRP Army. Road to 2 Digits. Have a great weekend! — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) May 9, 2025 What Does Two Digits Mean for XRP? In the context of Dark Defender’s post, the phrase “two digits” hints at XRP reaching a price point of at least $10. Currently, XRP is trading below this milestone, but the idea of breaking into the double-digit territory has long been a topic of debate and enthusiasm among investors. Such a leap would mark a substantial increase from its current valuation and potentially indicate a major bullish rally. Dark Defender is known for his technical analysis and has frequently provided insights that resonate with XRP enthusiasts. His latest statement, though brief, aligns with the optimistic sentiment held by many within the community who foresee significant gains for XRP, especially as legal uncertainties surrounding Ripple gradually diminish. Community Reaction and Market Sentiment Following Dark Defender’s post, members of the XRP Army took to social media to express their support and excitement. While some celebrated the possibility of a two-digit XRP, others called for caution, reminding fellow investors of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Some community members pointed out that reaching the two-digit mark would require not only a favorable outcome in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) but also broader market support. Others referenced past predictions and speculated about potential catalysts that could drive XRP’s price higher, such as increased adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions or strategic partnerships. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Price Movement: What Analysts Say While Dark Defender’s post sparked enthusiasm, other analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Market experts note that while XRP has demonstrated resilience, its path to the two digits would likely involve breaking through multiple resistance levels and maintaining strong trading volume. The psychological barrier at $10 is particularly significant, as crossing it could trigger substantial buying interest. Moreover, macroeconomic factors, regulatory clarity, and developments within the crypto space will play crucial roles. Analysts emphasize the importance of sustainable growth rather than short-term price spikes, advocating for a balanced perspective among investors. Dark Defender’s confident declaration of XRP’s “Road to 2 Digits” has undoubtedly stirred conversations within the community. While the prospect of XRP reaching $10 or beyond excites many, the journey to such a milestone will require a combination of positive market sentiment, favorable regulatory outcomes, and strategic developments. As the debate continues, XRP holders remain optimistic but cautious, keeping a close watch on the factors that could shape the token’s trajectory in the coming months.

The novel format, idea, and scale of this tournament raise the stature of crypto trading competitions above anything ever seen before. Volodymyr Nosov , Founder and President of WhiteBIT Group, shared his thoughts on what makes the championship unique, its educational purpose, and the prospects for participants. What WhiteBIT group founder says “We set ourselves an ambitious goal — to set a new standard in the world of trading and hold the first-ever live-stream trading championship. Our ICTC is the first international tournament where world-class traders will compete. Along with them, fully-formed squads of 25 participants and individual traders will also take part online. Everyone will have the chance to follow the traders’ decisions in real time, observe their reactions, analyze strategies, and join the conversation via a general chat — asking questions, sharing insights, and engaging in live discussions,” comments Volodymyr Nosov. Volodymyr Nosov. Source: WhiteBIT From the beginning, ICTC has been rooted in education. The championship kicked off with a qualifying stage, allowing participants to compete for a chance to become the eighth trader on the main stage. “Anyone interested had the opportunity to test their skills, gain unique experience, and learn something new even before the main competition stage.” said WhiteBIT Group President Volodymyr Nosov. Nosov also stressed the tournament’s commitment to professionalism, fairness, and transparency: “We’ve ensured continuous financial monitoring to track the traders’ actions in real-time: their screens, open positions, and market activities. After trades are completed, all transactions undergo mandatory validation to ensure compliance with the tournament’s rules and conditions,” Nosov noted. Additional details Traders on the main stage will each be provided with an initial balance of 50,000 USDTB (WhiteBIT’s internal asset for futures trading ). They shall trade in futures, winning all the profits accrued from the participants’ trades if they prove to be the best traders in the tournament. This is Nosov’s opinion: that crypto trading tournaments can turn out to be events of global scale, with the enormity of eSports championships. “Crypto trading has all the necessary components for a spectacular format: strategy, emotions, and strong personalities with extraordinary stories. It has huge potential. These competitions can soon reach a level where traders become public figures, followed by millions who learn from them and support them as true stars,” he added.

44368684,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158942,1746783609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: Japan Firm Makes Bold $21M BTC Purchase,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-bitcoin-purchase-japan/,"In a significant move highlighting the growing trend of corporate treasury allocation towards digital assets, Japanese publicly listed company Metaplanet has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. This development underscores the increasing confidence among forward-thinking firms in Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Understanding Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy Metaplanet, already recognized for its pro-Bitcoin stance, recently shared an important update via the social platform X. The company revealed its resolution to issue 21.25 million in 0% Ordinary Bonds. The explicit purpose of this bond issuance is to finance the purchase of additional Bitcoin. This strategic financial maneuver allows the company to acquire more BTC without incurring interest costs on the debt, effectively leveraging its balance sheet to increase exposure to the cryptocurrency. Prior to this announcement, Metaplanet had already accumulated a significant amount of Bitcoin, holding a total of 5,555 BTC. This established position signals a long-term commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its financial planning, viewing it perhaps as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, or an asset with significant growth potential. Why a Japanese Company is Making a Bitcoin Investment The decision by a Japanese company like Metaplanet to make a substantial Bitcoin investment is particularly noteworthy. While corporate Bitcoin adoption has gained traction globally, led by firms like MicroStrategy in the U.S., it is still a relatively new phenomenon in Japan. Metaplanet’s actions could potentially serve as a case study and encourage other Japanese firms to explore similar strategies. Several factors likely influence such a decision: Macroeconomic Environment: Concerns about currency devaluation and inflation, even in economies historically perceived as stable, can drive companies to seek alternative assets. Store of Value: Bitcoin is increasingly seen by proponents as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset that can preserve value over time, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth, offering the potential for substantial returns on investment. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can diversify assets away from traditional holdings like cash or short-term debt, which may yield low returns in a low-interest-rate environment. How Do Bitcoin Bonds Work for BTC Purchase? Metaplanet’s approach involves issuing 0% Ordinary Bonds. This is a form of debt financing. By issuing bonds, the company raises capital from investors who are willing to lend money in exchange for the promise of repayment at a future date. The ‘0%’ interest rate means the company does not need to pay periodic interest payments to the bondholders; they only need to repay the principal amount upon maturity. The capital raised from the sale of these bonds is then used specifically for the Bitcoin investment. This method is similar in principle to how MicroStrategy has used debt and equity offerings to fund its large-scale BTC acquisitions. It allows the company to increase its exposure to Bitcoin significantly without depleting its existing operational cash reserves. The Significance of Metaplanet’s BTC Holdings With the acquisition funded by the new bond issuance, Metaplanet’s BTC holdings will increase from the already considerable 5,555 BTC. This places Metaplanet among the public companies with the largest Bitcoin treasuries globally, and arguably makes it a leader in Japan for corporate Bitcoin strategy. The exact amount of BTC purchased with the $21.25 million will depend on the prevailing market price of Bitcoin at the time of purchase. The decision to increase holdings demonstrates a doubling down on their conviction in Bitcoin’s future value and its role within the company’s long-term financial health. Challenges and Opportunities in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption While the Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy presents clear opportunities, corporate adoption of Bitcoin is not without its challenges: Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, which can impact the reported value of a company’s treasury holdings and potentially affect earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Japan, which could pose risks. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by region, often requiring companies to mark down the value of their holdings if the market price drops below their cost basis (though recent FASB updates in the US are improving this). Public Perception: Some investors and the public may still view Bitcoin as speculative or risky, which could affect a company’s stock price or brand image. Opportunities: Potential for Significant Returns: Successful Bitcoin investment can lead to substantial appreciation in treasury value. Attracting Forward-Thinking Investors: A pro-Bitcoin stance can appeal to a segment of investors interested in digital assets and innovative corporate finance. Inflation Hedge: Provides a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Leading the Way: Especially in regions where corporate adoption is nascent, being an early mover like Metaplanet can position the company as an innovator. Actionable Insights for the Curious Investor Metaplanet’s move offers several insights: Watch Corporate Adoption: Keep an eye on how other public companies, particularly in Japan and Asia, respond to Metaplanet’s strategy. Increased corporate interest could signal growing mainstream acceptance. Understand Financing Methods: Note the use of bonds for BTC purchase. This is a common financing strategy for large acquisitions and shows creative ways companies can gain exposure without selling equity or using cash reserves. Evaluate Company Conviction: A company issuing debt specifically for Bitcoin signals high conviction in the asset’s long-term value. Research the Company: If you’re interested in this trend, research Metaplanet’s overall business and financial health, not just its Bitcoin holdings. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bold Step in Japan’s Bitcoin Landscape Metaplanet’s decision to issue $21.25 million in bonds to acquire more Bitcoin is a bold statement about its belief in the cryptocurrency’s future. This move not only significantly increases Metaplanet’s BTC holdings but also sets a precedent in the Japanese market for leveraging corporate finance to invest in digital assets. As the company integrates this new acquisition, the financial world will be watching to see how this strategic Bitcoin investment impacts its balance sheet and market position. It reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin evolving from a speculative asset into a legitimate component of corporate treasury management globally.

The sheer magnitude of the move is best seen in the change in ETH’s market cap, which surged by almost exactly $66 billion. Early on May 8, the token’s valuation amounted to $232.84 billion, while at press time in the morning of May 9, it hit $298.88 billion. ETH market cap one-day chart. Source: CoinMarketCap ETH has been among the few major cryptocurrencies that have failed to set a new record during the 2024 bull market and has generally underperformed expectations. The token’s cycle high was recorded on December 7, 2024, when the price exceeded $4,000. Ethereum set its ATH at $4,721 on November 11, 2021, meaning the token would have had to rally 18.03% from its 2024 peak and 92.62% from its press time price to reclaim it. ETH one-week price chart. Source: Finbold What is next for Ethereum after a 26% one-day rally? The latest rally has, however, opened the possibility for the cryptocurrency to at least participate in the coming bull runs. ETH has been noted in recent months for offering only tame reactions to relatively widespread upswings, despite tending to fall together with the market in the downswings. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s short-term performance will be decided by its ability to overcome the other two nearest resistances and remain above the closest support should a strong correction begin. The token has already soared past its closest resistance near $2,336.90 and is, at press time on May 9, eying the levels at approximately $2,476.25 and $2,739.65. In case of a correction, it must remain above $1,934.15 to confidently retain the uptrend. Lastly, examining ETH’s long/short ratio, it is encouraging to see it at 1.633 and above the May 8 lows, indicating the rally is yet to generate significant bearish pressure.

Meanwhile, Michelle Bond, wife of former FTX executive Ryan Salame, is seeking to dismiss her campaign finance charges, and claimed that prosecutors misled her husband into pleading guilty under the false promise she would not be charged. In another crypto case, former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky was granted court approval to travel for his daughter’s wedding, even as he awaits sentencing for fraud tied to the CEL token. ISIS Crypto Financier Jailed A Virginia man was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison after being convicted of financing the Islamic State (ISIS) with cryptocurrency. On May 7, US District Judge David Novak handed down a sentence of 30 years and four months to 35-year-old Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa. Announcement from the Department of Justice The sentence was handed down after his December conviction on one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist organization and four additional counts of providing and attempting to provide such support. According to the Department of Justice, Chhipa funneled more than $185,000 to ISIS between October of 2019 and October of 2022. Prosecutors shared details about how Chhipa raised these funds through online platforms and in-person meetings, even traveling long distances to collect donations. He then converted the funds into cryptocurrency, and sent it to contacts in Turkey who smuggled the money to ISIS members across the border in Syria. Many of the recipients were women affiliated with ISIS who were detained in prison camps, and the funds were used to facilitate their escape and support ongoing militant activities. Attorney General Pam Bondi placed a lot of emphasis on the gravity of the case, and stated that Chhipa “directly financed ISIS in its efforts to commit vile terrorist atrocities against innocent citizens in America and abroad.” She added that the lengthy prison sentence serves as a strong deterrent to anyone considering similar actions. The court also learned that Chhipa tried to evade justice during the FBI’s investigation . After federal agents searched his home in August 2019, Chhipa fled Virginia. He did this initially by paying a stranger at a Taco Bell to drive him to a relative’s house. He then used various aliases and newly created email accounts to buy a sequence of bus and plane tickets, taking him through Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Germany, and ultimately to Egypt. His escape was thwarted when an Interpol Blue Notice led to his return to the United States. FTX Executive’s Wife Says DOJ Misled to Secure Guilty Plea Other crypto criminals are also facing the wrath of the law. However, Michelle Bond, the wife of former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame, is seeking to have her federal campaign finance charges dismissed after alleging that US prosecutors misled her husband in securing his plea deal. In a May 7 court filing in the Southern District of New York, Bond’s legal team argued that the government induced Salame’s guilty plea by promising not to pursue charges against her, but failed to document that agreement. According to the filing, Salame and Bond’s attorneys were told that the assurance not to charge Bond could not be included in the formal plea paperwork, yet it was still presented as a condition to encourage Salame’s cooperation. Bond's lawyers believe this constitutes “stealth and deception,” which raises some serious concerns over the plea’s integrity. Michelle Bond and Ryan Salame Bond is facing multiple charges, including conspiracy to cause unlawful campaign contributions and filing false reports to the Federal Election Commission related to her failed 2022 run for Congress. The indictment was handed down in August of 2024, months after Salame already entered his guilty plea to two felony charges. Salame was sentenced to over seven years in prison, but previously tried to withdraw his plea on similar grounds. He also claimed that it included a non-prosecution agreement for Bond, but he later abandoned the effort and reported to prison in October 2024. The May 7 filing also asked the court to suppress any statements Bond made after the alleged inducement, suggesting they were obtained under false pretenses. Bond, like Salame, implied that her Republican political affiliation played a role in her being targeted by prosecutors. Her case is the latest chapter in the long-unfolding legal aftermath of the FTX collapse. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in 2023 and is now appealing the decision. Caroline Ellison received a two-year sentence under a plea deal, and other executives, including Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, were sentenced to time served. Mashinsky Granted Court OK to Travel Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius, is likely to be granted permission to travel to Tennessee for his daughter’s wedding, regardless of the outcome of his sentencing hearing. According to a filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved a request allowing Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis between May 26 and May 29 to attend the event. Although the approval appeared on the court docket on May 8, it was later removed from public view without explanation. Mashinsky’s sentencing hearing will determine whether he serves prison time after his December 2024 guilty plea. He admitted to commodities fraud and participating in a scheme to manipulate the price of Celsius’ native token, CEL. This was a big shift from his earlier fight against the charges, as he had initially prepared to go to trial before his legal team lost a key motion to dismiss the case. Admission from Mashinsky in court Since his arrest in July of 2023, Mashinsky has been free on a $40 million bond, but his movements were very restricted. Any travel beyond certain designated areas, like the nearly 900-mile trip to Memphis, must receive prior court approval. The uncertainty surrounding whether he will be required to surrender to authorities after sentencing still lingers. Prosecutors are pushing for a very large penalty, and even asked the judge to impose a 20-year prison sentence . Meanwhile, Mashinsky’s defense team requested a much more lenient sentence of one year and one day. His legal team submitted letters of support from family members, including a heartfelt plea from his oldest daughter arguing that Mashinsky never intended to harm anyone and does not deserve a harsh punishment. The case is being closely watched as a possible indicator of how crypto-related criminal prosecutions might evolve under the Trump administration, which appointed the current interim US Attorney overseeing the case. The court presiding over Mashinsky’s case also handled the prosecution of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-09 09:44:16

Investment in projects with good fundamentals is preferred, with Ethereum and Chainlink standing out for stability and Yeti Ouro as options with high-risk potential. All three balance growth with resilience. Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin regained six figures on May 8 after the United States and the United Kingdom signed a trade deal that reduced tensions, instilling confidence in risk assets. This comes after three weeks of $5.5 billion inflow into digital-asset products, where 82 % flowed into BTC products. Traditionally, each round-number break out of Bitcoin compresses the coin’s dominance, loosening liquidity into alt-coins in the following months. With that rotation already underway, these four choices are set to catch the next capital wave. Bitcoin price is currently trading at $103,713.49. Ethereum (ETH): Smart-contract foundation with novel macroeconomics Ethereum’s Pectra hard fork launched on 7 May , merging the Prague and Electra upgrades to reduce costs of transactions, increase blob space for roll-ups, and add soon-activated Verkle trees. More affordable blockspace already is feeding into increased Layer-2 throughput, underpinning the network’s function as DeFi and gaming’s settlement layer. Simultaneously, spot-Ether ETFs, little more than half a year old, continue to draw in net flows even during price corrections, which indicates increased institutional stickiness. If Bitcoin’s new high brings crypto-ETF talk back into mainstream finance, ETH would gain from its regulated entry points and strengthen on-chain economics. Ethereum price is currently trading at $2,381.65. Why it may outperform Deflation mechanics: More ETH have been burnt since EIP-1559 than have been issued in high-usage weeks, so supply grows even more scarce when demand peaks. Yield layer: Staking yields (~4 % currently) form a bond-like floor that more treasuries and family offices are now recognizing. Cross-chain anchoring: Roll-ups and restake protocols use Ethereum as their security foundation, anchoring it as a long-term coordination point. Chainlink (LINK): highways of data for the multichain world Chainlink locked over $20 trillion in total value enabled (TVE) as of Q1 2025. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is deploying to non-EVM chains like Solana and Aptos in this quarter. This makes Chainlink both the oracle standard and an unbiased bridge layer—precisely the “middleware” institutional players need for tokenized securities, RWAs, and CBDCs. Why it may excel Enterprise-wide integrations with SWIFT, DTCC and leading banks are piloted, creating predictable flows of fees. Monetization switch: Staking v0.2 charges explicit fees for data services, turning usage into direct demand for LINK. Macro hedge: With the regulatory environment under which smaller oracles can become classified as data publishers, Chainlink’s decentralized network provides legal insulation. YETIO: Utility-led meme coin with GameFi potential Yeti Ouro pairs a capped token supply of one billion with an Unreal-Engine play-to-earn title, YetiGo, rewarding users in-game and on-chain. Its presale, already at stage 4, is over $4 million at $0.041 an asset (per token), indicating good retail demand even prior to exchange listings. Security is also an advantage: the smart contract survived a SolidProof audit with no critical issues. Because YETIO is built on Ethereum, impending L2 fee drops immediately enhance game economics, and the project’s “learn-and-earn” missions resonate with first-time crypto users—opening up the addressable market beyond speculators. Why it may outperform Narrative value: meme coins tend to outshine in BTC bull markets, and YETIO places real-world P2E utility over viral marketing. Token-gated ecosystem: Holders are rewarded with exclusive quests, staking privileges, and community votes, further enhancing holding incentives. Capital-efficient marketing: Buyers of the game fund perpetual buy-backs and burns, correlating growth in users with token rarity. Closing remarks The three-asset basket consisting of ETH, LINK, and YETIO gives exposure to core infrastructure, cornerstone middleware, and high-beta trends in the business of social gaming. Crypto, though, is still volatile; Ethereum upgrades can propagate hidden bugs, and oracle income is dependent upon enterprise execution timelines. YETIO’s trajectory, conversely, appears well positioned to translate presale hype into enduring gameplays. Position sizing and multi-cycle time horizons are critical. Do thorough independent research and seek out a qualified advisor prior to putting your money to work. For investors who have missed out on BTC and ETH, Yeti Ouro is the next crypto set to explode.

This comes after the SEC officially approved the agreement during a closed-door session on May 8, 2025, more than a month after Ripple and its top executives, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, signed the deal on April 23, 2025. Settlement Slashes Ripple Fine, Lifts XRP Sales Ban The settlement significantly reduces Ripple’s financial penalty from $125 million to $50 million. It also seeks to vacate the permanent injunction previously imposed on Ripple’s future sales of XRP. If the court agrees, Ripple gets back $75 million from escrow.

On-chain investigator ZachXBT pointed to the ongoing investigation by German authorities. The instant exchange eXch had $38M and all technical infrastructure seized by the German authorities. On-chain investigator ZachXBT noted the exchange had its assets seized after the decision to stop operations from May 1. The eXch team previously explicitly refused to freeze ETH funds coming from Bybit, citing previous reputation damage, as well as the blacklisting of funds originating from eXch addresses. The market operator claimed its no-KYC approach was a drive for privacy, and not a deliberate attempt at money-laundering. Remaining eXch addresses still hold minor crypto reserves, though authorities report seizing and controlling over $38M in crypto assets. | Source: Arkham Intelligence The exchange was not closed due to a law enforcement request, but by the decision of its management. After that, there were repots that the exchange still handled swaps through its API. Previously, eXch has hinted at a new management and a potential relaunch, but its Bitcointalk thread has gone silent since May 3. ZachXBT reminded that eXch was used to launder hundreds of millions from the Bybit hack in February. The market operator was also the destination of funds from previous large-scale hacks, including the Multisig Hack, the FixedFloat exploit, as well as up to $234M from the Genesis Creditor theft. The market operator also accepted funds from wallet drainers, and refused to cooperate and block addresses or orders. The asset seizure may help with fund recovery. The market operator was also accused of continuing its services, despite the order to cease all operations from May 1. As more crypto operators strive to be compliant, eXch was one of the few remaining no-KYC markets. German authorities seized eXch servers The eXch market operator had its servers seized by the Frankfurt am Main Public Prosecutor’s office unit for combatting internet crime, and the Federal Criminal Police office. The servers carried the site’s infrastructure, available under the exch.cx domain and other locations. German authorities now control wallets for BTC, ETH, LTC, and DASH, valued at around $38M as of April 30, and even more after the recent crypto market rally. This is the third-largest confiscation of crypto assets in the history of the German BKA office. The Criminal Police actions anticipated attempts by the founders of eXch to abscond with the wallets, leaving depositors with losses. “ Crypto swapping is an essential component of the underground economy, used to conceal incriminated funds from illegal activities such as hacking or trading in stolen payment card data, thus making them available to perpetrators ,” said Dr. Benjamin Krause, Chief Public Prosecutor at the Central Intelligence Agency (ZIT). The main concern for eXch is that it was widely considered a money-laundering platform, used also by dark net sellers. The seized assets are the first significant inflows into the German Government crypto reserves. Previously, the government sold all seized BTC at a price of around $50,000. The current reserves of eXch, however, may be linked to the losses of Bybit users and returned as compensation.

Ethereum soared by over 25% in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin rose to $104,000 for the first time in months. Other top-performing cryptocurrencies were Brett, Uniswap, and Ethena. This article provides a forecast for Pepe Coin, Shiba Inu, and Cardano. Pepe Coin price prediction Pepe Coin was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies on Friday as it jumped to $0.000014, its highest level since February 1. It has jumped by over 153% from its lowest level in March, making ot one of the top-gainers. This recovery happened after the coin formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. It also formed what looks like a double-bottom pattern at $0.0000057. Pepe Coin has jumped above the neckline at $0.0000092 and is nearing th 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.000014385. It also jumped above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a sign that bulls are now back. Pepe price chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, the coin will likely keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance level at $0.00001700, the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point. A break above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the all-time high of $0.000028.

It moved to a high of $0.000015, up from a low of $0.00001042 earlier this month. SHIB price found a strong support at that level, which coincided with the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since July 2023. Most importantly, it has formed the popular harmonic pattern known as the XABCD, which often leads to more gains. The XA section happened between March and August last year, while the AB happened through November. Further, the BC section happened until April, and is now starting the steep climb back yo to the CD section. Therefore, the long-term outlook for the coin is bullish, with the initial target being at $0.000033, the highest swing in November last year. A move above that level will point to more upside to $0.00004588, which is up by 210% above the current level.

A double-bottom is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. Cardano has moved above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), and the upper side of the small bullish flag pattern at $0.74. It also formed an inverse head and shoulders chart pattern. Cardano price chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising in the coming days, with the next point to watch being the psychological point at $1, which is about 30% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.65 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 70.26, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 87.48, both exceeding typical overbought thresholds. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is positive at 0.0175, indicating continued upward momentum. The simple moving averages over 10 and 100 days are $2.18 and $2.15 respectively, showing little difference between short-term and long-term trends. If the price continues to rise, XRP could test the nearest resistance level at $2.45, followed by the second resistance at $2.69. These targets represent potential gains of approximately 6% and 16% from the current price range. Conversely, if a pullback occurs, support levels at $1.98 and $1.75 may come into play, indicating possible decreases of around 5% and 15%. Based on the data, XRP’s recent performance suggests strong growth, but the overbought indicators caution that a correction may be imminent. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has witnessed significant price movements recently. In the past week, its price increased by 3.52%. Over the last month, it surged by 42.96%, showing strong bullish momentum. However, over the past six months, the price has decreased by 23.57%, indicating a recovery phase from earlier declines. Currently, SOL trades between $138.48 and $151.93. It is near its 10-day simple moving average of $150.69 and slightly above the 100-day average of $146.22. The Relative Strength Index is at 71.48, suggesting overbought conditions. The Stochastic oscillator is high at 94.32. These indicators hint at a possible short-term price correction. If the upward trend continues, SOL may reach the nearest resistance level at $159.70. Surpassing this could lead to the second resistance at $173.15, an increase of about 14%. Conversely, if the price drops, it might find support at $132.80 or the second support at $119.35, a potential decrease of approximately 13%. The MACD level of 1.552 indicates positive momentum, but traders should remain cautious due to overbought signals. Conclusion XRP and SOL are solid coins, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports-meme blend, aiming for massive growth and community-driven success in the current bull market.

44369063,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158943,1746784214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Asia FX Feels Pressure: US Dollar Strength Dominates Currency Trends,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-strength/,"For many tracking the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding broader macroeconomic shifts is crucial. Currency movements, particularly in the Forex market, and significant geopolitical events like US-China trade talks, can send ripples across the global financial system, indirectly influencing everything from commodity prices to investor sentiment towards risk assets like crypto. Recently, we’ve seen notable action in the Asian currency space. This article dives into why Asia FX is currently facing headwinds as the US Dollar firms up, and what this means for the wider market. Why is Asia FX Under Pressure? Exploring US Dollar Strength The primary driver behind the recent dip in many Asian currencies is the noticeable strengthening of the US Dollar strength . The dollar, often seen as a safe-haven asset but also a beneficiary of positive economic outlooks and trade developments, has been gaining ground against a basket of major currencies. This strength isn’t happening in a vacuum; it’s linked to shifting global sentiment and specific events. Several factors contribute to this dollar firmness: Improved Trade Sentiment: Hopes for progress in trade negotiations, particularly between major economic blocs, tend to boost confidence in the global economic outlook, often benefiting the dollar as a primary reserve currency. Economic Data: Positive economic indicators from the United States can reinforce expectations of sustained growth, making dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Interest Rate Expectations: While central bank policies vary globally, relative expectations regarding interest rate paths can influence currency valuations. If the market perceives the US Federal Reserve as holding a particular stance compared to Asian central banks, it impacts flows. When the US Dollar strengthens, it makes it more expensive for countries and companies holding other currencies to buy dollar-denominated goods, services, or repay dollar-denominated debt. For investors holding Asian assets, a weaker local currency against the dollar can reduce returns when converted back to USD. Understanding Currency Trends Amidst Global Dynamics Observing currency trends provides valuable insights into global economic health and investor risk appetite. The current trend of Asian currencies weakening against the dollar highlights several underlying dynamics: Firstly, it reflects the significant influence of the US economy and its policies on the rest of the world. The dollar’s role as the dominant reserve currency means its movements have disproportionate impacts. Secondly, it can signal cautious sentiment regarding specific regional economies within Asia, or simply reflect that positive drivers for the dollar are currently outweighing those for Asian currencies. Consider the performance of some key Asian currencies: Table: Select Asia FX Performance (Illustrative Example – Actual values vary daily) Currency vs. USD Change (Recent Period) Key Influences Japanese Yen (JPY) Slightly weaker Monetary policy divergence, global safe-haven flows Chinese Yuan (CNY) Stable to slightly weaker Trade talk sentiment, domestic economic data South Korean Won (KRW) Weaker Global tech demand, trade outlook Australian Dollar (AUD) Weaker Commodity prices, China trade links These movements are complex, influenced by a mix of global factors like dollar strength and specific local conditions and policy decisions. What Do US-China Trade Talks Mean for the Forex Market? Upcoming US-China trade talks are a major focal point for the Forex market news . The relationship between the world’s two largest economies significantly impacts global trade flows, supply chains, and investor confidence. Any sign of progress or breakdown in these discussions can lead to substantial market reactions. Why are these talks so important for currencies? Trade Balances: Outcomes can affect trade volumes and balances between countries, influencing demand for respective currencies. Economic Growth Expectations: Positive trade news can boost expectations for global economic growth, generally favoring risk-on currencies, although the initial reaction might be a stronger dollar on overall sentiment. Negative news can increase demand for safe havens like the dollar or yen. Policy Responses: Trade tensions can trigger policy responses from central banks and governments, further impacting currency valuations. The anticipation surrounding these talks creates volatility. Traders and investors are closely watching for any official statements or leaks that might indicate the direction of negotiations. This uncertainty itself can contribute to dollar strength as market participants seek relative safety. Forex Market News: Staying Ahead of the Curve Keeping track of Forex market news is essential for anyone involved in global finance, including those with interests in cryptocurrencies. Currency fluctuations impact the cost of international transactions, the value of foreign investments, and can signal broader shifts in the global economic landscape. For crypto investors, understanding these macro signals can help inform decisions about portfolio allocation and risk management. Key pieces of Forex news to monitor include: Central bank announcements and interest rate decisions. Major economic data releases (GDP, inflation, employment). Geopolitical developments and trade negotiations. Changes in capital flows and investor sentiment. The current narrative of Asia FX weakness against a firm dollar driven by trade optimism and looming US-China talks is a prime example of how these factors intersect. Challenges and Insights The main challenge for Asian economies facing currency depreciation is the potential for increased import costs and inflationary pressure. It also makes servicing foreign debt more expensive in local currency terms. However, a weaker currency can make exports cheaper and more competitive on the global market, offering a potential benefit. For investors, the insight is that global events are interconnected. While crypto markets have their unique drivers, they are not immune to the effects of major shifts in traditional finance and geopolitics. Monitoring currency movements and trade developments provides valuable context for the overall market environment. Conclusion: Navigating the Currents The recent performance of Asia FX, dipping as the US Dollar gains strength, underscores the significant impact of global trade dynamics and the enduring influence of the US economy. With US-China trade talks on the horizon, the Forex market remains a critical area to watch. These currency trends are not just isolated events; they are indicators of larger shifts in the global financial system that can indirectly affect all asset classes. Staying informed about these macro movements provides a broader perspective crucial for navigating today’s interconnected markets.

The US and China are soon to begin talks on trade. The US stock market is continuing to recover. With this, and so much more good news hitting markets, risk assets have been unleashed. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently above $103,000 and there could be a lot more upside price action to come. US trade war heading towards peace The trade deal that has been reached between the US and the UK is the first agreement among all the global trade disputes, and having been reached in such a short amount of time, it bodes well for many of the other battles on trade. That said, even though the UK managed to achieve certain concessions, the country is probably slightly worse off than before 10% tariffs were imposed by President Trump. Most of the 10% tariffs will in fact remain, but Prime Minister Starmer has talked up the deal, saying that it will “save thousands of jobs in Britain.” As for US/China trade talks, these will begin on 10 May in Geneva. According to the Straits Times, Chinese traders have already started buying up shipping capacity, while four China-based exporters were reported to be preparing to ship goods to the US in the next few weeks. While trade agreements will have undoubtedly been priced in by the market, probably even into next year, such positive news will have possibly led to Bitcoin’s latest big surge, and a growing return to positive sentiment for the market as a whole. $BTC continued upside - or correction to come? Source: TradingView The daily time frame displays the large bull flag that $BTC had been traversing within for more than five months. The explosion out of the previous 8-month bull flag can also be seen. Just like in the case of the previous bull flag, the price may return to confirm the top trend line before starting the main upside price thrust. The Stochastic RSI for the daily time frame is showing that the indicators are approaching the top. This is the case for all of the lower time frame Stochastic RSIs, and so this could signal that a correction could be incoming. Could this take the price all the way back to the top of the bull flag at around $96,000? Quite possibly. There is major support just underneath the price at $102,000. This is the crucial area for the bulls to hold. It will likely be a battle between the bulls, with positive sentiment on their side, and the bears, perhaps being able to take advantage of faltering price momentum. $102,000 is critical support/resistance level for continued bull market Source: TradingView Zooming right the way out into the monthly time frame, one can really appreciate how important the $102,000 resistance is. It can be seen that if the bulls are able to keep the price above this level at the end of May, a new candle body would open above, and the next leg up of the bull market could begin. The Stochastic RSI on this monthly time frame is posturing a bullish cross up, as are the indicators for the Relative Strength Index at the bottom of the chart. Both of these major indicators will need to confirm in this position at the end of May for what could be a truly massive price explosion.

Despite regulatory news and economic uncertainties, several major digital assets, including XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, have recorded impressive gains over the last 24 hours. However, not everyone is celebrating — a growing number of traders are calling foul, hinting that the market remains heavily manipulated. At the center of the storm is XRP. The digital asset soared by over 8%, touching $2.35. While many expected the SEC settlement to bring stability, some market watchers believe this price move was manufactured. Several traders pointed to abnormal volume patterns, identifying what they claim to be a classic bot-driven pump.

GENIUS Act Rejection Ignored Adding to the suspicion, the crypto market moved higher after the rejection of the GENIUS Act, a decision that logically should have weighed on prices. Bitcoin rose 5.87% to $102,880.26, Ethereum jumped 20.39% to $2,170.88, and Hedera (HBAR) gained 10.39%. This unexpected upward move, according to traders, happened as bots pulled liquidity out of XRP pairs and exploited price gaps across different markets, leaving many retail investors chasing shadows. “The Market Is Rigged” The conversation online paints a bleak picture of crypto markets being heavily manipulated, especially on Binance-led pairs. Traders believe this behavior will continue, as large players and automated systems control short-term movements. “There’s so much money behind these games. They’ll run it up when they’re ready,” one post read. “Your only defense is to buy something you understand and hold on for years.” Holding Long-Term: The Only Play Many in the community are pushing for a long-term approach, ignoring short-term volatility and manipulation.

Bonk ( BONK ) has recently broken out of a steep downtrend that had been in place since November last year, marked by a descending trendline on the daily chart. The breakout occurred on April 22, when the memecoin ‘s price decisively closed above this trendline and broke above the local resistance at around $0.000015. The breakout rally then sent BONK price to its peak of $0.000021 on April 28, marking an approximately 75% increase since April 22 pre-breakout opening price of $0.000012. A fullback followed, but the price rebounded with a strong leg up and is now testing the resistance formed by the previous high at the $0.000020 level. If this momentum sustains, BONK is likely targeting the 0.000025 level next, with potential for further upside toward 0.000030 in the medium term as it reclaims prior resistance zones. BONK Price Chart | Source: TradingView Floki ( FLOKI ) broke out of its sustained downtrend with a decisive move above the descending trendline around April 9, followed by a period of bullish consolidation. On April 22, it staged an explosive rally that sent the price to $0.000095 on April at its peak. After a brief pullback, the price resumed its upward move, reaching a new high at $0.00010, where it trades at press time. Since the April 22 opening at $0.000058, the price has now gained about 72%. Given this setup, the next logical target lies around $0.00013, where the price was rejected in early February.

This breakout candle also confirmed the neckline of a double bottom pattern, establishing a key resistance level. That resistance was then tested and broken on April 22, when PEPE made a new higher high. After a brief pullback, a strong rally began on May 6, driving the price up to a new peak of $0.00001310. Since April 22 breakout of the double bottom’s neckline, the price has gained about 69%. The current price action shows strong continuation, with PEPE now testing resistance zone around the $0.000013. If momentum persists, the next, short-term PEPE price prediction is $0.000016, which coincides with previous support-turned-resistance levels from mid- to late January. PEPE Price Chart | Source: TradingView Brett’s ( BRETT ) downtrend began to shift around March 11, when the price entered a tight consolidation range between $0.026 and $0.036. On April 22, it broke out of this range with a strong close around $0.044. The breakout rally extended through April 26, reaching a local high of $0.070. After a brief pullback, BRETT launched a second rally starting May 7, which continues at press time, pushing the price to a new peak of $0.083, marking a new higher high. From the April 22 pre-breakout opening price of $0.035, BRETT has surged approximately 136%, currently trading at $0.080. The next major resistance lies around $0.15 — a level where the price was rejected in early January and which also served as a key horizontal support area back in November prior to the December rally.

With this, the Ethereum price quickly gained momentum and outperformed Bitcoin by attracting nearly 40% gains since the last trading day. With this, the price has broken back into its macro range between $2000 and $3900, which confirms a deviation towards the higher targets if it sustains above the gained threshold. Meanwhile, the history suggests the final retest could be in place which may result in ETH price forming a new ATH. The Ethereum platform underwent one of the most important upgrades, the Pectra, which addressed the transaction speed and count. Soon after the upgrade went live, the whales who had been accumulating ETH since the start of the year intensified their actions. As per some reports, these institutions accumulated millions worth of ETH, which suggests the next pit stop for the Ethereum price rally is not below $3000. Moreover, Trump’s World Liberty also bought $3.5 million worth of ETH, which substantiates bullish prospects. Technically, the ETH price has risen above a mega pattern, hinting a 50% rise is imminent, provided the token secures a crucial range. After the recent breakout, the ETH price has broken above the falling wedge that it was stuck in since it faced rejection from $4000. This breakout after a 5-month consolidation hints towards the beginning of a fresh bullish wave. The On-Balance volume which was maintaining an ascending consolidation, triggered a steep rise that validated the rise in the buying pressure. Meanwhile, the RSI has entered the overbought zone and marked the levels not seen since Q1 2024. This may hint towards a short-term pullback but if the rally holds the crucial support at $2,200, then a rise to $2,800 could be imminent. The Ethereum price has printed a massive daily candle since the spot ETF approval. Besides, the platform has turned more deflationary after the Pectra upgrade by burning nearly 34,000 ETH in the past 24 hours. However, history seems to have repeated itself, as the Ethereum price bull run was ignited with a 20% single-day rise back in 2021 and hence, the current upswing raises the possibility of a similar rally ahead. If the ETH price repeats the pattern, the new ATH could be above $6000 to $6500.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 09:56:53

From an overall analysis, the currency has received up to 6.03% of a boost in the day. If buyers hold the price above $0.0045, we might see further bullish trend in the AMP price toward $0.0052. On the other hand, a drop toward the EMA trend lines might solidify the chances of a correction up to $0.0038 level. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the coming weeks will steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of 2025, potentially pushing AMP above $0.007478. However, conducting your research and seeking professional financial advice is recommended. Why is AMP up? AMP’s price has increased today after Bitcoin led the market by hitting the crucial $100K mark. This surge in price came due to rising buying demand following Fed’s decision to halt interest rate. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.0052, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. What will AMP price target be in 2025? The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.007478. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $352.11 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.028249. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2026 and reach $0.032403 by 2031.

AMP historic price sentiment The AMP token was officially launched on September 11, 2020, with an initial price of $0.009. In its early months, AMP experienced a downward trend, hitting an all-time low of roughly $0.0007 on November 17 of the same year. AMP price history However, the token reversed its fortunes entering 2021. It surpassed its launch price, reaching a notable high of about $0.046 on February 14, 2021. The momentum continued, and by April 18, AMP’s price peaked at $0.064. AMP set new records, reaching a high of $0.077 on May 7, 2021, and then $0.12 on June 16, following its listing on the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. Despite these spikes, the overall trend for the rest of the year was bearish. By September 2021, AMP had fallen below the $0.05 mark as per crypto market data. In January 2022, AMP declined further to $0.02. The bear market proved challenging, and by June of that year, AMP’s price had fallen below its initial launch price. On September 7, it hit a 52-week low of $0.0054. In 2023, AMP attained a maximum price of $0.00642 and a minimum price of about $0.00146. Near the end of the year, AMP was trading at $0.0035. At the start of 2024, AMP gradually started its bullish cycle and reached $0.0056. On March 13, it peaked at $0.0129 before reversing. For May, June, and July, the AMP token continued its slow descent from the $0.0081 level to reach $0.0040, almost losing 40% of its value in three months. At the start of August 2024, AMP continued following the downtrend, reaching $0.0031, but made high spikes, leveling back to $0.00342 on August 25. In September 2024, the AMP token spiked as high as $0.00446 briefly, but in October, the AMP price dipped to the $0.00362 level. In November, AMP touched the $0.00800 mark and spiked higher to $0.0119 on December 8, 2024. AMP then corrected into 2025 below the $0.00649 mark in January and $0.00594 in February. In March, AMP came further down to the $0.0051 level, and in April, it touched the lowest price of $0.00318. At the start of May, AMP is trending near the $0.0041 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|AMP,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|OTHER|RESEARCH|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-09 10:00:00

Bitcoin Trading Volume Ratio Has Declined Under The 1.0 Mark Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the trend in the Trading Volume Ratio for Bitcoin. The “Trading Volume Ratio” is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the amount of the asset becoming involved in trading on spot exchanges and that on derivatives ones. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the spot platforms are witnessing a higher amount of trading volume than the derivatives ones. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the dominance of derivatives trading activity among the investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resistance Limited Beyond $100,000, On-Chain Data Suggests Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Trading Volume Ratio over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Trading Volume Ratio has been sitting under the 1 mark recently, suggesting volume on the derivatives platforms has been outpacing that on the spot ones. This has maintained while the cryptocurrency has gone through its latest leg of the recovery rally, which has taken its price back above the $100,000 level. From the chart, it’s visible that the trend was different during last month’s rally. This previous leg of the run was accompanied by a spike in the Trading Volume Ratio above the 1 level, an indication that spot trades were potentially the main fuel behind it. Historically, sustainable price rallies have generally been of this kind; runs that are borne out of high speculative activity on the derivatives market tend to be unstable. Given that the derivatives market has dominated in this rally so far, it’s possible that it could have trouble lasting. Though, it only remains to be seen how things would develop for Bitcoin. In some other news, Ethereum is extremely undervalued compared to Bitcoin, as the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has revealed in an X post. The indicator shared by the analytics firm is the ratio between the Ethereum and Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratios. The MVRV Ratio is a popular on-chain metric that basically keeps track of the profit-loss situation of the investors as a whole. Related Reading: Only XRP Still In Profit Among Euphoric Buyers—BTC and SOL Deep In Losses As is visible in the chart, the MVRV Ratio of ETH is very low compared to the one for BTC right now. “Historically, this led to Ethereum outperforming,” notes CryptoQuant. “However, supply pressure, weak demand, and flat activity could stall a rebound.” BTC Price Following a surge of nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has managed to break above the $101,000 level.

Let’s dive into some recent market movements that caught our eye. Data from Farside Investors reveals that US spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a combined net outflow of $16.1 million on May 8th. This marks the third consecutive day we’ve seen money moving out of these investment vehicles. While the amount might seem modest compared to some Bitcoin ETF movements, it signals a potentially crucial shift in investor sentiment regarding the ETH ETF landscape. Understanding US Spot Ethereum ETFs Before we dissect the outflows, it’s helpful to understand what we’re talking about. A US spot Ethereum ETF is an exchange-traded fund that aims to track the price of Ethereum directly. Unlike futures ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts, a spot ETF holds the actual underlying asset – in this case, ETH. These products are designed to offer investors exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without needing to directly buy, hold, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through standard brokerage accounts. The anticipation and eventual approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year significantly boosted the crypto market. Many in the industry believe that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could similarly pave the way for greater institutional and retail adoption of Ethereum. Breaking Down the Recent Ethereum ETF Outflows The $16.1 million in net outflows on May 8th is a notable figure, especially coming after two previous days of outflows. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Flow (May 8) FETH Fidelity -$19.3 million (Outflow) ETHE Grayscale +$3.2 million (Inflow) ARKA Ark Invest/21Shares $0 million (No Change) BITW Bitwise $0 million (No Change) DEFT Franklin Templeton $0 million (No Change) EZET VanEck $0 million (No Change) Data Source: Farside Investors As you can see, the bulk of the outflows came from Fidelity’s FETH, which saw $19.3 million leave the fund. Interestingly, Grayscale’s ETHE, which is typically subject to outflows as investors potentially switch to lower-fee options or redeem shares, saw a small inflow of $3.2 million on this particular day. Other approved ETH ETF products saw no change in their holdings. Why Are We Seeing Ethereum ETF Outflows? Market movements, especially outflows from investment products, are rarely caused by a single factor. Several elements could be contributing to these recent Ethereum ETF outflows : Broader Market Sentiment: The overall crypto market can influence ETF flows. If there’s a general risk-off sentiment or price volatility in ETH, some investors might choose to exit positions. Profit Taking: Investors who entered these ETFs earlier may be taking profits after recent price appreciation in Ethereum. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory path for US spot Ethereum ETF approval remains less clear than it was for Bitcoin. The upcoming deadlines for key SEC decisions (like VanEck’s on May 23rd) are fast approaching, and any perceived negative signals or lack of positive momentum could lead to caution. Comparison to Bitcoin ETFs: While Bitcoin ETFs saw massive initial inflows, the pace has slowed, and they’ve also experienced periods of outflows. This might set a precedent or influence expectations for ETH products. Specific Investor Actions: Large individual or institutional investors might rebalance portfolios or make strategic moves that result in significant outflows from specific funds like FETH. The inflow into ETHE could also be attributed to specific institutional strategies or market-making activities. It’s important to remember that daily flows can be volatile and don’t always indicate a long-term trend. However, three consecutive days of outflows warrant attention. Comparing ETH ETF Flows to Bitcoin ETFs When analyzing the crypto market , it’s useful to compare the performance of different asset classes and investment vehicles. Bitcoin spot ETFs, since their launch in January, have accumulated billions in net inflows, although they’ve had days and even weeks of net outflows as well. The scale of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs was significantly larger than what we’ve seen for the currently available ETH ETF products (which are mostly converted trusts like ETHE, with others holding limited assets). The dynamics for ETH ETFs are different, partly due to the smaller market cap of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin and the different investor base and regulatory perception. What Do These Outflows Mean for Ethereum Price? The direct impact of $16.1 million in outflows on the overall Ethereum price is likely minimal in the short term, given the size of the ETH market (hundreds of billions of dollars). However, sustained or increasing outflows could signal weakening demand from a specific segment of investors (those using ETFs), which could contribute to selling pressure. More significantly, these outflows might reflect or contribute to a shift in sentiment ahead of the critical SEC decision deadlines later this month. If market participants become less optimistic about approval, it could negatively impact the Ethereum price . Conversely, a surprise approval could trigger significant inflows and positive price action. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Market For investors navigating the current landscape, these Ethereum ETF outflows offer a few points to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on ETF flow data, but don’t base decisions solely on daily movements. Look for trends over weeks or months. Monitor Regulatory News: The SEC’s decisions regarding spot ETH ETFs are paramount. Follow news related to the May deadlines closely. Assess Market Sentiment: Understand the broader mood in the crypto market . Are investors bullish or cautious? This can influence ETF flows and prices. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a diversified approach within the crypto space, or across different asset classes, based on your risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term flows are interesting, consider your long-term investment goals. The potential for mainstream adoption through ETFs is a long-term narrative. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Crucial Shift The recent Ethereum ETF outflows , particularly from Fidelity’s fund, serve as a reminder that the path to broader institutional adoption through regulated products like ETFs isn’t always a straight line of constant inflows. These movements are influenced by a complex interplay of market sentiment, regulatory expectations, and individual investor strategies. While the $16.1 million outflow on May 8th is not a catastrophic event for the crypto market or the Ethereum price , it highlights a potential crucial shift in short-term dynamics as the market awaits significant regulatory clarity. Keeping a close watch on these flows, alongside regulatory developments and overall market health, will be key for understanding the evolving landscape of crypto investments.

Immediately Following Heavy Criticism from SEC Member!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-settlement-reached-in-ripple-case-immediately-following-heavy-criticism-from-sec-member/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on May 8 that a settlement agreement has been reached in the XRP lawsuit against Ripple Labs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Christian Larsen. According to the agreement, the SEC and Ripple will jointly file a motion with the court to lift the injunction against Ripple and reduce Ripple’s penalty to $50 million as part of the final judgment dated August 7, 2024. According to this redistribution, only $50 million will be paid to the SEC, while the remaining amount will be returned to Ripple. While the settlement of the SEC Ripple case was welcomed by the cryptocurrency industry, SEC member Caroline Crenshaw stated that she opposed the Ripple deal due to investor protection concerns. Cryptocurrency skeptic Crenshaw spoke out against the agency’s decision to offer Ripple a settlement letter in its case. The SEC member argued that if the deal is approved, the settlement would weaken the court's role in interpreting securities laws and would fail to protect investors and markets. Crenshaw said the settlement “razes” both the civil penalty and the injunction, effectively nullifying the effect of the court's decision. “This settlement does a grave disservice to the SEC’s investor protections and weakens the court’s role in interpreting our securities laws. If Judge Torres accepts the settlement, it will eliminate investor protections we have already won and leave a regulatory vacuum until the crypto task force can create a regulatory framework. “As a result, the SEC-Ripple settlement is not in the best interests of the investors and markets our agency is charged with serving and protecting. It raises more questions than answers.” The SEC first filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, accusing it of illegally selling its native token, XRP, as an unregistered security. *This is not investment advice.

After hitting $104,000, BTC/USD is retracing to establish support, but the fate of $100,000 is among the concerns for market participants. Current price action represents an important battleground, as measured from the $75,000 lows this year. ” Headline driven” BTC price gains draw scrutiny Just $6,000 from new all-time highs, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView , BTC price action has stunned the market by jumping 10% in days. The pace of the BTC price gains has come as a surprise for many, but longer-term perspectives show where the most difficult battleground lies. “Since this current impulse was primarily headline driven again this puts markets into a crucial & critical trading day,” trader Skew said about the impetus for the move in an X post on May 8. Skew refers to a common theme uniting BTC price volatility in recent weeks and months. Bitcoin and risk assets have become highly sensitive to headlines and even social media posts involving US President Donald Trump and his trade tariffs. The latest event involves a trade deal between the US and UK, but how long optimism endures remains an open bet. “I’m sure markets are hoping this has a kick on effect to get trade deals on the table for other major trade parties like EU & China,” Skew continued. Another X post said what is needed now are “passive flows,” strong volume to support newly revisited levels and turn them into strong support.

It didn’t launch with a roadmap, utility, or even long-term plans — just a friendly dog and a committed community. But while that approach earned it cultural capital and market value, it also exposed its limits. In 2025, users are asking for more than viral branding — they want usable tools, clear tokenomics, and the ability to engage directly with a network’s growth. Bitcoin Solaris is stepping into that void. Rather than chasing attention with memes, it’s offering direct value through capped supply, mobile-native mining, and real-time network interaction. Its model is based on giving users something they can actually use. Dogecoin’s Appeal — and Its Ceiling There’s no denying Dogecoin’s influence. It made crypto accessible to people who might’ve never looked at Bitcoin or Ethereum. It signaled that community could sometimes matter more than code. But the fundamentals never kept pace with the popularity. DOGE remains inflationary, with no supply limit. Its Proof-of-Work mechanism requires hardware to mine, and beyond simple transfers, the coin has no real use case in the broader market. Even Dogecoin’s development has been slow and uncertain, often reliant on volunteer contributors or third-party wrappers to introduce utility. For most users, it remains something to hold — or trade — not something to use. Bitcoin Solaris: Built for Function, Not Fame Bitcoin Solaris takes a different route. With its 21 million token cap, mobile-first mining model, and smart contract-ready infrastructure, it offers real blockchain utility from day one. Instead of meme-driven speculation, BTC-S is designed to support participation through action—staking, mining, and eventually interacting with DeFi tools on its native dual-layer architecture. Its soon-to-launch Nova App allows users to mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones. That alone creates a use case Dogecoin has never touched. You don’t need GPUs. You don’t need to delegate to validators. You just need a phone with a bit of free storage and CPU. Mining runs in the background, uses minimal power, and doesn’t interfere with daily use. That makes Bitcoin Solaris one of the first networks to put real, on-chain participation into the hands of mobile-first users — without requiring education or investment barriers. A Supply Model That Mirrors Bitcoin Where Dogecoin adds new coins every minute indefinitely, Bitcoin Solaris follows Bitcoin’s scarcity principle. The total supply of BTC-S is hard-capped at 21 million, with no inflation mechanism. This gives the token built-in deflationary pressure and ensures that early adopters benefit from limited issuance over time. Currently, the project is in Phase 2 of its public presale, where BTC-S is available at 2 USDT per token. Only 4.2 million tokens — or 20% of the total supply — have been allocated for presale. After Phase 1 sold out at 1 USDT, Phase 2 represents the final entry point before exchange listings and full-scale utility launches. Presale participants don’t have to wait for usability. Tokens are distributed immediately and will be usable in the Nova App as soon as it launches. That includes mining, staking, and interacting with broader network features. Verified Security and Transparent Architecture Where Dogecoin has always operated with minimal structure or published audits, Bitcoin Solaris has committed to full third-party transparency. The project’s contracts, token mechanics, and consensus logic have been audited by two independent firms: Cyberscope Audit Freshcoins Audit KYC Verification There are no manual validator lists or insider access paths. The protocol enforces rules on-chain, and users can verify every step for themselves. For a breakdown of how Bitcoin Solaris works — and why it’s seen as a functional evolution over Dogecoin — check out this walkthrough by Crypto Legends . Dogecoin will always have a place in crypto history. It proved that communities matter, and it showed how culture could drive demand. But in a maturing market, tools matter too. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to win with a meme. It’s aiming to build something people actually use — every day, from anywhere. With mobile mining, capped supply, transparent mechanics, and accessible earning tools, it offers what Dogecoin never has: function.

44369794,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158946,1746785459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Asia FX Dips: Crucial US Dollar Strength Impacts Global Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-impact/,"Hey crypto enthusiasts! While your focus might be squarely on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the latest altcoin trends, it’s super important to keep an eye on the broader financial landscape. Today, we’re looking at something seemingly distant – the Asia FX market – and how its recent dip, coupled with a strengthening US Dollar , is making waves that could potentially lap at the shores of the crypto world. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters to you. Why is Asia FX Dipping and the US Dollar Firming? Recently, we’ve seen many Asian currencies lose ground against the US Dollar . This isn’t happening in isolation. It’s a reaction to several global factors. One of the primary drivers for the dollar’s strength has been a renewed sense of optimism surrounding international trade, particularly between major economic powers. When confidence in global trade increases, the US Dollar often benefits as it’s seen as a relatively safe and liquid asset in international transactions. Several factors contribute to this dynamic: Trade Optimism: Positive signals regarding potential trade agreements or de-escalation of trade tensions can boost confidence in the global economy, paradoxically strengthening the dollar initially as capital flows towards perceived stability and potential growth hubs. Economic Data: Stronger-than-expected economic data from the United States can also support the dollar, suggesting better growth prospects compared to other regions. Interest Rate Expectations: While not always the primary driver, shifts in expectations around Federal Reserve interest rate policy relative to other central banks can influence currency movements. Capital Flows: Global investors shifting funds based on risk sentiment and economic outlook directly impact currency demand. Understanding the Forex Market and Its Reach The Forex market , or foreign exchange market, is the largest financial market in the world, where currencies are traded. Its sheer size means that movements here have ripple effects everywhere. Think of it as the plumbing of international finance. When major pipes (like the USD or major Asian currencies) experience pressure or flow changes, it affects the entire system, including other asset classes like stocks, commodities, and yes, even cryptocurrencies. Why does the Forex market matter for crypto? Liquidity and Capital: Global capital flows influenced by currency dynamics can either provide liquidity to riskier assets like crypto or pull it away towards safer havens or more attractive returns in traditional markets. Risk Sentiment: Currency movements are often indicators of global risk sentiment. A strong dollar in a risk-off environment (where investors prefer safety) can signal challenging times for risk assets like crypto. Conversely, a weaker dollar might indicate increased risk appetite. Inflation and Purchasing Power: Currency strength or weakness affects the purchasing power of investors in different regions, influencing their ability and willingness to invest in assets like crypto. What Do US-China Trade Talks Looming Mean? A significant factor contributing to the current market mood is the anticipation of upcoming US-China trade talks . These discussions are always closely watched because the economic relationship between the United States and China is massive and complex. Any progress or breakdown in talks can drastically alter global economic forecasts and market sentiment. Potential outcomes of these talks could include: Positive Outcome (Agreement/De-escalation): This could boost global trade prospects, potentially leading to increased investment and economic activity. While initially strengthening the dollar on optimism, it could eventually lead to a more balanced global growth picture. Negative Outcome (Stalemate/Escalation): This would likely increase uncertainty, potentially leading to a flight to safety, further strengthening the dollar in the short term, and potentially weighing on risk assets globally. Partial Agreement: The most likely scenario, where some issues are resolved while others remain contentious, leading to nuanced market reactions. The uncertainty surrounding these US-China trade talks keeps markets on edge and is a key reason why currency movements are particularly sensitive right now. How Do These Shifts Impact Global Markets and Crypto? The interconnectedness of Global markets means that shifts in one area quickly spread. When the US Dollar strengthens significantly, it can have several effects: Emerging Markets Pressure: A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated debt more expensive for countries and companies in emerging markets, including many in Asia. This can strain their economies and currencies. Commodity Prices: Commodities, often priced in dollars, can become more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, potentially dampening demand. Investor Behavior: As mentioned, a strong dollar can coincide with a move away from riskier assets. If investors are worried about global trade or economic stability, they might reduce exposure to assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Funding Costs: A strong dollar can increase the cost of dollar funding for international banks and businesses, potentially tightening liquidity globally. For crypto investors, this means watching these macro indicators is crucial. A period of dollar strength driven by trade tensions or risk aversion could signal headwinds for crypto prices. Conversely, a resolution of trade issues leading to a weaker dollar and increased risk appetite could be bullish for digital assets. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? Staying informed is your best strategy. Here’s what to keep an eye on regarding Global markets , Asia FX , the US Dollar , and US-China trade talks : Trade Talk Headlines: Follow news specifically related to the US-China negotiations. Positive or negative developments will likely trigger market reactions. US Dollar Index (DXY): This index measures the dollar’s value against a basket of major currencies. Watch its trend – a rising DXY generally signals dollar strength. Asian Currency Performance: Monitor how currencies like the Chinese Yuan (CNY), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Korean Won (KRW) are performing against the dollar. Widespread weakness in Asia FX is a key indicator of the trend we’re discussing. Risk Sentiment Indicators: Pay attention to broader market sentiment – are stocks rising or falling? Is volatility increasing? These can signal whether investors are embracing or avoiding risk. Correlation Analysis: Observe how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are correlating with traditional assets and the dollar index. Are they moving in tandem, or are they decoupling? Understanding these macro forces provides context for crypto market movements and can help you anticipate potential shifts rather than just reacting to them. Conclusion: Connecting the Dots While the headlines about Asia FX dipping and the US Dollar firming might seem distant from your crypto portfolio, they are integral parts of the same interconnected global financial system. The optimism around trade, the anticipation of US-China trade talks , and the resulting shifts in the Forex market are powerful forces influencing capital flows and risk appetite across all Global markets . By paying attention to these traditional finance indicators, crypto investors can gain a more holistic view of the market landscape and make more informed decisions. The crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s increasingly influenced by the same macro trends that shape traditional finance.

These initiatives mark a shift in VSC’s operational and leadership structure, aiming to support network scalability and financial oversight. These developments signal VSC’s growing influence at the intersection of blockchain innovation and institutional-grade finance. Breaking the Mold: VSC Introduces Fixed $4 Gas Fee In a space dominated by volatile transaction fees and scalability challenges, VSC’s flat-rate $4 gas fee provides predictable costs, greater accessibility, and enhanced user confidence. “The $4 gas fee isn’t arbitrary—it’s carefully designed to balance network security and accessibility,” said a VSC spokesperson. “We’re removing the guesswork from blockchain.” VSC’s hybrid consensus mechanism ensures high throughput and near-instant transaction finality, making it ideal for enterprise adoption and real-world applications such as asset tokenization. Backed by this innovation, major platforms are already moving. Notably, BESC Exchange recently announced its migration from Solana to VSC. “We believe VSC’s infrastructure and economics offer the highest upside,” said Brian, Executive at BESC LLC. Strategic Leadership: Peter Ritchie Joins VSC To support its rapid growth and sustainability-focused vision, VSC has welcomed Peter Ritchie—former CFO of CitiGroup Finance—to help drive global financial strategy. Ritchie brings decades of institutional finance experience and will play a pivotal role in: Designing blockchain-based sustainable finance frameworks Advancing VSC’s carbon initiatives Guiding enterprise and institutional integration “This isn’t just about blockchain—it’s about building a transparent, resilient financial future,” Ritchie said. “VSC is uniquely positioned to lead that evolution.” Next-Gen Blockchain with Real-World Utility With transparent network operations via VSC Explorer, deflationary tokenomics (including a $1 buy-and-burn per transaction), and a mission to bring blockchain to mainstream finance, VSC continues to build a robust, accessible, and sustainable ecosystem.

However, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong sees great progress in the US crypto legislation this week and expects more to come next. The digital assets market printed huge green indexes in the past 24 hours as the biggest altcoin, Ethereum, led the way with a 22% surge. The cumulative crypto market cap jumped by more than 5% over the last day to stand at $3.25 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 72% to hit $190 billion as market sentiments enter the “Greed” territory. GENIUS Act nears floor vote? Brian Armstrong in an X post highlighted it’s a headway that market structure draft legislation got introduced and is being discussed. He added that bipartisan work is going on to bring stablecoin legislation to the floor and suggested that there might be a vote again early next week. He mentioned that Stand With Crypto day is happening on May 14th, where over 60 crypto founders will assemble in Washington DC to make their voices heard in support of crypto legislation. Coinbase CEO stated that it’s good to see the Senate voting on stablecoin legislation. It was the first round of the negotiation and he believes that the bill still needs some work, like fixing the prohibition on yield and interest. He anticipates that the GENIUS Act will be one step closer to the President’s desk with a strong bipartisan vote. Despite crypto industry heavyweights pouring $119 million into last year’s elections to back pro-crypto candidates and hyping stablecoin rules as a bipartisan no-brainer, the Senate managed to slam the brakes. Senate blocks stablecoin bill after Trump crypto empire boom Only 49 senators voted to move the GENIUS Act forward which is well short of the 60 needed. A shocker came in when GOP Senators Josh Hawley and Rand Paul crossed party lines to block it with the Democrats. Senator Mark Warner, who originally backed the bill, pulled the plug saying the text wasn’t fully finished. After Trump’s World Liberty Financial revealed USD1 would be a big tool used in a $2 billion Abu Dhabi investment into Binance, Senate Democrats hit the panic button. Suddenly, talk of foreign money and anti-money laundering gaps took center stage. Senate Dems accused Republicans of stonewalling tougher safeguards on foreign-backed stablecoins. With that, the bill’s momentum collapsed. Trump backed stablecoin, USD1, is hitting the highway. The market capitalization of Trump’s World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin has grown from $130 million to over $2 billion since the end of April. USD1 is already standing tall in the tally of the stablecoins. Recently, it overtook the First Digital USD (FDUSD) and PayPal USD (PYUSD) to become the 7th biggest stablecoin. On the other side, OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP), his meme coin has surged by over 15% in the last 24 hours and 85% in the past 30 days. TRUMP is trading at an average price of $14.24 at press time.

This uptick follows a consolidation around the $0.18–$0.20 zone, where buyers have steadfastly defended key support levels. With total value locked tripling over the past seven months and daily trading volume surpassing $160 million, investor confidence appears firmly on the ascent. Sei’s plan to scrap Cosmos support and focus only on EVM In early May, Sei Labs announced a proposal to discontinue Cosmos compatibility in favour of a streamlined, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) model-exclusive architecture designed to simplify its codebase. This strategic shift, communicated via an X post on May 7 , aims to “enhance developer experience, simplify infrastructure, and fully leverage Sei’s parallelised EVM performance as the network builds toward Giga.” Since 2024, Sei has uniquely bridged the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems, yet engineers led by Philip Su determined that dual-support imposed an undue infrastructure burden. Dune Analytics data underscores the rationale, revealing that EVM users outnumbered Cosmos participants by 162-to-1 at December’s peak and have maintained above a 2.5-to-1 ratio since then. Source: Dune Analytics While proponents highlight the efficiency gains and heightened developer engagement, detractors voice concerns about migrating existing Cosmos-based assets without reliable bridging tools. One vocal community member lamented the uncertain fate of “OG” collections still housed on Cosmos, calling on Sei Labs to deliver migration solutions before sunset of the Cosmos module. The Wangman @TheWangman_ · Follow Replying to @SeiNetwork Hope they build a bridge for those who have built on the OG side. Our entire collection isn’t on EVM. Would this proposal create a tool for migration? Our collection our staking system. Our permissionless SAAS is all on the COSM side. 10:36 PM · May 7, 2025 13 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies Meanwhile, the network’s total locked value has rocketed from $160 million in October 2024 to $480 million by May 2025, suggesting that investor capital remains undeterred by architectural upheaval. As the debate unfolds, Sei’s decision to focus solely on EVM interoperability positions it squarely within the rapidly growing Ethereum-compatible layer-1 cohort. This move follows a broader industry trend favouring the Ethereum Virtual Machine as the de facto standard for smart contract platforms. SEI price forecast From a technical analysis point of view, SEI is approaching a critical resistance at $0.2400, where a decisive breakout could catalyse another leg higher towards $0.25 and beyond. Supported by ascending 7-day and 50-day moving averages and underpinned by a stable 100-day average, the chart structure suggests that upward momentum remains intact, although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the oversold region. SEI price chart | Source: TradingView The token’s market cap of $1.21 billion and a robust 12.03% volume-to-market-cap ratio reflect growing institutional and retail interest in the project. Moreover, SEI’s market dominance at 0.0364% may seem modest, but it underscores its capacity to attract liquidity even amid fierce competition for on-chain activity. Should trading volume sustain or increase upon breaching the $0.2400 threshold, bulls are likely to target former resistance zones near the all-time high of $1.14, albeit in a multi-phase approach. In the event of a failed breakout, the $0.20 level has historically acted as a magnet for dip buyers, offering a reliable floor that supports further accumulation. Ultimately, SEI’s future price trajectory will hinge on the market’s reception to its EVM-only strategy and the network’s ability to deliver on promised migration and scalability enhancements. For now, traders and investors alike will be watching the $0.2400 mark as the fulcrum that could define SEI’s next major move.

The flagship asset ripped to an intraday high of $103,400 —its first decisive close above $100K since February —propelled by a flood of fresh spot‑ETF inflows ($142 million) and optimism that U.S.–China trade talks are finally thawing. Strategy’s Bitcoin Stashoard Swells Past $57 Billion No public company felt the blast‑off more than Strategy Inc. (the rebranded enterprise analytics firm formerly known as MicroStrategy). A May 4 regulatory filing shows the company now controls 555,450 BTC after snapping up another 1,895 coins for $180 million at an average $95,167. Marked to this morning’s $103K tape, the trove is worth roughly $57.2 billion , handing Strategy an unrealized gain of about $19 billion on its $38 billion cost basis. That stash alone dwarfs the company’s $6 billion equity value, underscoring why Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has leaned harder into Bitcoin than any chief executive on Wall Street. A new $84 billion capital‑raising blueprint , revealed on May 1, doubles the firm’s previous equity‑and‑debt target and could fund the acquisition of nearly half a million additional coins by 2027. If successful, the so‑called “42 & 42 Plan” ($42 billion in stock sales matched by $42 billion in convertible notes) would push Strategy’s holdings toward the mythical one‑million‑BTC mark—roughly 5 % of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. Can Strategy Hit $1 Trillion? At today’s 555 K BTC balance, a $1.8 million Bitcoin price would put Strategy’s Bitcoin pile alone at the trillion‑dollar threshold. Double the stack to one million coins, and that hurdle drops to an even $1 million . Those figures, once dismissed as sci‑fi, are now creeping into mainstream debate: Strike CEO Jack Mallers recently argued that macro‑level adoption could catapult Bitcoin “400-plus times higher,” implying seven‑figure prices within the next decade. Saylor, never one for understatement, believes the company’s fortunes will track the monetary energy of Bitcoin and that a trillion‑dollar valuation is mathematically inevitable once the asset becomes a recognized institutional reserve.

The MicroStrategy co-founder posted a Bitcoin chart on Sunday, fueling speculation that another sizable BTC purchase is imminent. It would mark the fourth straight week of acquisitions by the firm now synonymous with institutional Bitcoin adoption.The company’s latest buy, on April 28, added 15,355 BTC, bringing its total stash to 555,450 BTC—now valued at approximately $52.28 billion. The firm’s average cost... The Brake Pads: Risks and Reality Checks If The Bitcoin Price Doesn’t Hold Yet aggressive leverage cuts both ways. The same mark‑to‑market rule that forced Strategy to record a $4.2 billion paper loss when Bitcoin dipped to $85 K in March will magnify future drawdowns. Rising Treasury yields also mean new debt will cost far more than the zero‑coupon convertibles the firm floated in 2021. Short sellers argue that if Bitcoin retraces to the mid‑$70Ks, Strategy’s net asset value could swing negative overnight, making its equity the ultimate high‑beta proxy for Bitcoin volatility. Bitcoin’s charge past $103K has reignited six‑figure euphoria, and Strategy sits at the molten core of that narrative. If Saylor can secure $84 billion in fresh dry powder—and if Bitcoin’s halving‑driven supply shock lifts prices anywhere near institutional models that flag $500K–$1 M—the “software company turned BTC vault” could indeed morph into the world’s first trillion‑dollar unicorn . For now, every tick up (or down) in Bitcoin will echo through Strategy’s share price—amplified, leveraged, and impossible to ignore.

44373017,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158987,1746790829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Germany Crypto Seizure: Authorities Seize $38M, Deliver Massive Blow to eXch Exchange",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/germany-crypto-seizure-exch/,"In a move that underscores the increasing resolve of authorities to tackle illicit activities in the digital asset space, German law enforcement has made a significant strike. They have successfully executed a Germany crypto seizure , confiscating a substantial 34 million euros, equivalent to approximately $38 million, along with the critical platform infrastructure belonging to the instant crypto exchange known as eXch. This development, confirmed by a press release from Frankfurt prosecutors and highlighted by well-known on-chain investigator ZachXBT via his Telegram channel, sends a clear message to platforms allegedly facilitating financial crime. The focus keyword, Germany crypto seizure , perfectly encapsulates the core action taken by the authorities in this high-profile case. Understanding the eXch Crypto Exchange and Its Alleged Role So, what exactly was the eXch crypto exchange , and why did it become a target for German authorities? While often marketing themselves as fast and convenient platforms for swapping one cryptocurrency for another, or even for fiat conversions, instant exchanges like eXch operate in a complex regulatory landscape. According to the information shared, eXch was allegedly involved in activities far more serious than simple currency swaps. ZachXBT’s commentary on the situation paints a grim picture, suggesting that eXch was instrumental in the movement and concealment of illicit funds. He claimed the exchange played a role in laundering hundreds of millions of euros derived from various hacking incidents. Furthermore, it’s alleged that eXch actively resisted cooperating with authorities, specifically by refusing to block suspicious addresses or comply with official freeze orders. This alleged non-compliance turned the eXch crypto exchange from a mere trading venue into a suspected facilitator of financial crime. The Persistent Challenge of Crypto Money Laundering The seizure of eXch’s assets shines a spotlight on the ongoing battle against crypto money laundering . Criminals are constantly seeking ways to convert ill-gotten gains from cybercrimes like ransomware attacks, phishing scams, and exchange hacks into usable funds, and cryptocurrencies can, unfortunately, be misused for this purpose due to their pseudonymous nature and ease of cross-border transfer. Here’s why crypto money laundering remains a challenge and how exchanges can become unwitting (or, as alleged in eXch’s case, potentially willing) conduits: Pseudonymity: While transactions are recorded on a public ledger, identifying the real-world identities behind wallet addresses requires additional steps. Global Reach: Funds can be moved across borders instantly, complicating international investigations. Layering Techniques: Criminals use various techniques, like mixing services or quickly moving funds across multiple exchanges and wallets, to obscure the origin of funds. Varying Regulatory Standards: Not all jurisdictions have the same strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, creating potential weak points. Exchanges that fail to implement robust AML/KYC procedures, or worse, actively ignore red flags and legal requests, become attractive platforms for those engaged in crypto money laundering , as eXch is alleged to have been. How German Law Enforcement is Adapting to Crypto Crime The successful operation against eXch demonstrates the increasing sophistication and capability of German law enforcement crypto units. Authorities worldwide are investing heavily in tools and expertise to track cryptocurrency transactions, identify suspicious activity, and link digital wallets to real-world individuals or entities. The fact that German police were able not only to identify the alleged illicit activity but also to seize both the funds and the operational infrastructure of the eXch crypto exchange is a testament to these evolving capabilities. This isn’t just about following the money; it’s about dismantling the platforms that allegedly enable the criminal ecosystem. For German law enforcement crypto teams, this seizure represents a significant victory in their efforts to make the digital financial space safer. Key aspects of how law enforcement is fighting back include: On-chain Analysis: Using specialized software to trace the flow of funds on blockchains. International Cooperation: Working with law enforcement agencies in other countries to follow transaction trails across borders. Collaboration with Experts: Leveraging the knowledge of blockchain forensic firms and independent investigators like ZachXBT. Targeting Infrastructure: Moving beyond just seizing funds to disrupting the operational capabilities of illicit platforms. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation in Germany and Beyond? This high-profile seizure by German authorities will undoubtedly have ripple effects on crypto regulation Germany and across the European Union. Germany has generally been proactive in regulating the crypto space, requiring licenses for many crypto-related businesses. This case reinforces the importance of stringent regulatory oversight and the need for exchanges to comply fully with AML/KYC obligations. The allegations against eXch – specifically, the refusal to block suspicious addresses and comply with freeze orders – highlight critical areas that regulators are focused on. Exchanges are increasingly expected to act as gatekeepers, implementing systems to detect and report suspicious transactions and cooperating promptly with legal requests from authorities. The actions taken here signal that non-compliance carries severe consequences, including the seizure of assets and operational shutdown. For platforms operating within or serving users in Germany and the EU, understanding and adhering to crypto regulation Germany (and broader EU directives like MiCA – Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation, once fully implemented) is paramount. This case serves as a stark reminder that ignoring regulatory requirements and law enforcement requests is not an option. Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem The Germany crypto seizure of eXch’s assets sends a powerful message to the entire crypto ecosystem. For legitimate crypto businesses, it reinforces the importance of building robust compliance frameworks and cooperating with authorities to help clean up the space. For users, it underscores the need to use reputable, regulated exchanges that prioritize security and compliance. While some may view increased law enforcement action and regulation negatively, these steps are often necessary to build trust and legitimacy for the broader crypto industry. By tackling alleged instances of crypto money laundering and holding non-compliant platforms accountable, authorities are helping to create a safer environment for legitimate innovation and investment. This action by German law enforcement crypto units is a clear signal that the window for operating non-compliant or allegedly illicit crypto businesses is closing. The focus on the eXch crypto exchange serves as a case study in the potential consequences of failing to adhere to legal and ethical standards in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. In Conclusion: A blow Against Illicit Crypto Activity The Germany crypto seizure of $38 million and the infrastructure of the eXch crypto exchange marks a significant victory for authorities in the fight against financial crime in the digital realm. The allegations of involvement in crypto money laundering and non-cooperation with authorities highlight the critical need for stringent compliance within the industry. This operation by German law enforcement crypto teams serves as a stark warning to platforms that might consider facilitating illicit activities or ignoring regulatory obligations. As crypto regulation Germany and globally continues to evolve, the pressure on exchanges to operate transparently and responsibly will only increase. This case underscores the commitment of authorities to pursue and dismantle operations that allegedly undermine the integrity of the financial system, regardless of the technology used.

Ethereum, the slumbering giant, has suddenly woken up and has skyrocketed back above $2,000 in very quick time. $ETH price - from last rites to new hope In bull markets before this one, Ethereum was the major catalyst that led the rest of the altcoins higher, once Bitcoin had done its thing and was on pause. However, since the $4,865 all-time high in November 2021, the $ETH price plumbed the depths of the following bear market, and even when the new bull market started at the beginning of 2023, the $ETH price generally did not lead. A rally swing high came to a conclusion in March 2024 at just over $4,000, and this was equalled in December 2024, forming a double top. What then followed was a huge sell-off that took the price all the way back down to one of the last ditch supports at $1,400. It was wondered by many if the last rites were going to be said for what is still the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Of course, this couldn’t happen. The tech might be battling to keep up with some of its layer 1 competitors, but this was still a trusted and secure blockchain. A turning point had to come at some time. $ETH explosive move through downtrend line Source: TradingView The explosive price move for $ETH through the descending trendline is a joy to behold. This was a towering 37.5% pair of green candles that went from $1,800 to nearly $2,500 in less than 48 hours. If this hasn’t rejuvenated the altcoins, what else possibly could? Nevertheless, planting one’s feet on solid ground again, the price looks to have been firmly rejected from the major $2,500 horizontal resistance level. The 4, 8, and 12 hour Stochastic RSIs have all topped out, and a period of consolidation could be incoming. The trick will then be for the bulls to keep as much of these gains as they can, and even try to claw above $2,500 in order to consolidate there. Reasonable support is below at $2,150 down to $2,000. $2,500 is major resistance, but huge price momentum coming Source: TradingView Moving right up into the monthly time frame, the $2,500 horizontal resistance can be appreciated. This may not break at what is now the second time of trying. That said, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has the indicators bouncing from the bottom. If they can keep heading up and can cross the 20.00 level, the resulting price momentum can be simply huge. One only has to look back the previous time the indicators crossed up from the bottom. That particular move was to the tune of 242%. If anything like this move were to repeat again, the all-time high would surely not last.

Ko, a legislator at-large in Taiwan’s legislative body, the Legislative Yuan, took to X on Friday to report that he had advocated Bitcoin ( BTC ) investment by the Taiwanese government at the National Conference on May 9. In his remarks, Ko cited Bitcoin’s potential to become a hedge amid global economic risks and urged Taiwan to recognize the cryptocurrency alongside gold and foreign exchange reserves to boost its financial resilience. Source: Ko Ju-Chun Ko’s announcement came shortly after the legislator held talks with Samson Mow, who advocates for Bitcoin adoption by states like El Salvador at his BTC tech firm Jan3. Taiwan is an export-oriented economy Ko highlighted that Taiwan is an export-driven economy that has experienced significant fluctuations in its national currency, the New Taiwan dollar, amid global inflation and intensifying geopolitical risks. “We currently have a gold reserve of 423 metric tons, and our foreign exchange reserves amount to $577 billion, including investments in US Treasury bonds,” the lawmaker stated. In a scenario of more intense currency volatility or potential regional conflicts, Taiwan may “very likely be unable to ensure the security and liquidity,” Ko continued, adding that Bitcoin could be a great addition to Taiwan’s reserves for several reasons. Ko Ju-Chun advocated for the adoption of Bitcoin by the Taiwanese government before the Legislative Yuan. Source: Ko Ju-Chun “Bitcoin has been operating for over 15 years. It has a fixed total supply, is decentralized, and is resistant to censorship. Many countries are focusing on its hedging attributes. At the same time, in intense situations, it may not face the risk of embargo,” he said. Bitcoin is not the only solution Referring to many global initiatives considering Bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset, Ko stressed that he’s not advocating for Bitcoin as the “only solution” to rising economic challenges. Instead, the legislator suggested adding a “small proportion of Bitcoin” into the diversified assets as tools for sovereign asset allocation and risk hedging, and backup capacity of Taiwan’s financial system. Related: Trump tricked into pushing XRP for crypto reserve: Report He previously suggested that Taiwan could allocate a maximum of 5% of its $50 billion reserve to Bitcoin in an X post on May 6. Source: Ko Ju-Chun “When exchange rate risk and regional uncertainty increase, it is time to introduce new tools to construct a more flexible financial strategy framework,” Ko said, adding: “As former Dean Chen Chong said, Bitcoin is the gun of the digital era. It may also be the gold of the digital era, the silver of the digital era. Or it could be gunpowder. A wise nation will not let weapons be in others’ hands.” The news comes as Taiwan is emerging as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction, with the Financial Supervisory Commission pushing institutional trials of crypto custody services in late 2024.

The nine-year-old complaint is back on after a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami ruled Citigroup must face the allegations, overturning a lower court’s decision to dismiss it. “For the second time, we consider this long-running dispute alleging a transnational fraudulent scheme resulting in over $1 billion of losses to thirty plaintiffs. The case has cycled through four complaints, and it has languished at the pleading stage for nine years. The district court dismissed all seven counts in the 541-page third amended complaint for failure to state a claim. We see things differently. Because each of the plaintiffs has sufficiently pleaded the elements of each count alleged in the complaint, we reverse and remand.” The lawsuit alleges that Citigroup’s Banamex unit enabled and concealed rampant fraud at Oceanografía, which was working as a drilling contractor for Mexico’s state oil firm, Pemex. The plaintiffs in the case, about 30 vendors, creditors and bondholders, allege that Citigroup provided $3.3 billion to Oceanografía between 2008 and 2014, despite being aware of an incurred massive debt and forged Pemex signatures on authorization forms to obtain inflated cash advances. According to the ruling, Citibank’s internal investigation found it had issued nearly $430 million in fraudulent cash advances. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined Citigroup $4.75 million for failing to maintain a system of internal controls related to Banamex.

According to Fortune, citing several sources familiar with the matter, Meta is in talks with more than one crypto firm to add stablecoins to manage payouts. Allegedly, the discussions began earlier this year, currently being at a preliminary stage. Moreover, the sources note that the company’s focus is on the benefits that stablecoins provide in comparison to fiat. Namely, they’re interested in low-cost cross-border payouts. Also, there are claims that Instagram , Meta’s subsidiary, could utilize stablecoins for small payouts up to $100 to creators worldwide. The reasoning behind this is that Meta would be spending less money on fees. It seems certain that Meta would not be launching its own coin. Andy Stone, Meta’s Communication Director, highlighted Mark Zuckerberg’s recent statement that the company’s stablecoin project, Diem , is dead. To be clear: as Mark said (and as the story notes), Diem is “dead.” There is no Meta stablecoin. https://t.co/U1DN2VXM9Q — Andy Stone (@andymstone) May 8, 2025 However, a source said the company is in “learn mode” and would likely partner with more than one stablecoin provider. Another claim is that the man leading these discussions is Circle’s Senior Director of Business Development Matt Cavin. Up until March, he served as an executive at Web3 gaming company Immutable . Moreover, Ginger Baker, whom Meta hired as a VP of product in January, is reportedly helping the stablecoin effort. Baker is a crypto native who has served on the board of the Stellar Development Foundation , and previously served as a senior director of product at Ripple . Meta declined to comment. The company shook the financial world when it announced its Libra/Diem project in 2019. Following the establishment of the blockchain division in 2018, and before its formal introduction, the stablecoin was mostly known as ‘Facebook Coin’ or ‘GlobalCoin.’ However, Meta faced massive pushback from the US regulators and policymakers, terminating the project in 2022.

This is primarily due to the institutional interest, boosted by significant technological progress over the years, as well as recent favorable political winds globally in general, and from the US in particular. Total stablecoins market capitalization currently stands at $242.805 billion, according to DeFiLlama. It has been steadily increasing over the past year, hitting one record high after the other. Source: DeFiLlama Standard Chartered Bank recently predicted that the stablecoin market could go up by about 10-fold to $2 trillion within the next three years. Citigroup projected that the market cap could surpass $2 trillion by 2030. Also, as reported last week, Ethereum’s stablecoin market cap has increased to $124.5 billion. Notably, Ethereum’s stablecoin market has become the dominant layer for digital dollar liquidity. At the same time, USDT’s dominance is currently 62%, followed by USDC’s 25%. Source: DeFiLlama Meanwhile, in the US, the lawmakers are discussing stablecoin-related bills, though they seem to have come to an impasse. The Senate failed to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Acton during the Thursday vote. This was the result of a divide over crypto policy and concerns about US President Donald Trump’s ties to cryptocurrencies, including Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial’s launching the USD1 stablecoin. Meanwhile, among many companies making stablecoin strides, payments giant Mastercard enabled 150 million merchants across its network to receive payments in stablecoins in late April. BVNK, a major stablecoin payment infrastructure provider, secured a strategic investment from Visa through the latter’s Visa Ventures arm. The company plans to expand its operations in the US. Also, major payments company Stripe recently introduced the Stablecoin Financial Accounts , which allows companies in 101 countries to hold and transact in stablecoins.

Bitcoin popped more than 5% yesterday on solid volume, putting it firmly back in the six-figure zone above $101,000. Secondary indicators like RSI have also been turning up. By Mike Larson Don’t look now, but... Bitcoin is back! Prior to the last couple of days, “real” gold had been grabbing all the attention, hitting new highs above $3,500 an ounce before pulling back. The precious metal has been a “go-to” asset for protection from the dollar’s decline and market uncertainty driven by tariffs and geopolitical chaos . Meanwhile, “digital” gold spent the time since December 2024 trading sideways, then pulling back, then chopping around for a while. Crypto chatter went quiet. But look at the MoneyShow Chart of the Day - a six-month chart of BTC-USD. You can see that Bitcoin popped more than 5% yesterday on solid volume, putting it firmly back in the six-figure zone above $101,000. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Secondary indicators like RSI have also been turning up. Unlike in the immediate aftermath of President Trump’s election, I’m not picking up on much crypto euphoria, either. Could that be a sentiment-based indicator suggesting Bitcoin has room to run? We’re clearly coming into overhead technical resistance around the old highs. And I’d like to see more convincing evidence Bitcoin has broken the “tech stock tie” to become a true, less-correlated store of value asset. But this is encouraging action - and it bears watching. Digital gold could grab the spotlight back from real gold if it keeps up!

44373362,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158988,1746791431,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Bitcoin Investment Fund Offers Zero Crypto Tax Via Opportunity Zones,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-opportunity-zone-fund/,"Big news is shaking up the world of digital asset investing! A U.S.-based firm, The Pearl Fund, has just launched a significant Bitcoin investment fund . What makes this fund particularly noteworthy isn’t just its substantial size – a hefty $500 million – but the unique strategy it employs to offer potentially massive tax advantages to investors. If you’re an accredited investor looking at Bitcoin investing , this development is definitely worth your attention. What’s Special About This Bitcoin Investment Fund? At its core, The Pearl Fund’s new offering is a substantial pool of capital dedicated to gaining exposure to Bitcoin. However, it’s structured in a way that taps into a specific U.S. economic development program: the Opportunity Zone (OZ) program. This isn’t your average fund; it’s designed with long-term investors in mind, specifically targeting those who can benefit from the unique tax incentives tied to OZs. Key details about the fund include: Fund Size: $500 million target. Asset Focus: Primarily Bitcoin. Key Mechanism: Utilizes the U.S. Opportunity Zone program. Target Investor: Exclusively accredited investor s. Minimum Investment: $250,000. Headline Benefit: Potential for zero capital gains tax on profits held for a minimum of 10 years. Understanding the Opportunity Zone Program So, what exactly is an Opportunity Zone, and how does it connect to a Bitcoin investment fund ? The OZ program was created as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Its goal is to stimulate economic development and job creation in distressed communities across the U.S. by providing tax incentives to investors who invest their realized capital gains into Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs). Here’s a simplified look at how the OZ tax benefits typically work: Invest Capital Gains: An investor realizes a capital gain from selling an asset (like stocks, real estate, or potentially even other cryptocurrencies). Invest in a QOF: The investor then has 180 days to invest those specific capital gains into a certified Qualified Opportunity Fund. Deferral: Taxes on the original capital gain are deferred until the earlier of the date the QOF investment is sold or exchanged, or December 31, 2026. Step-Up in Basis: If the investor holds the QOF investment for at least 5 years, the basis of the original gain is increased by 10%. If held for at least 7 years, the basis is increased by 15%. This reduces the deferred tax liability. Exclusion of New Gains: This is the big one. If the investor holds the investment in the QOF for at least 10 years, any appreciation on the *new* investment within the fund is excluded from capital gains tax entirely when the investment is sold. The Pearl Fund is seemingly structuring its Bitcoin investment fund as a Qualified Opportunity Fund or investing through one, allowing investors to potentially apply these powerful tax deferral and exclusion benefits to their Bitcoin exposure. How Does This Create Zero Crypto Tax on Bitcoin Profits? This is where the innovation lies. By investing *through* a Qualified Opportunity Fund structure, investors can leverage the OZ program’s 10-year hold provision. If The Pearl Fund’s structure qualifies and is maintained for a decade or more, any gains generated from the Bitcoin held within the fund could potentially be sold tax-free at the federal level. This is a significant potential advantage compared to holding Bitcoin directly or through standard taxable investment vehicles. Think about the typical crypto tax implications. Selling Bitcoin held for over a year usually incurs long-term capital gains tax, which can be up to 20% at the federal level, plus state taxes. For short-term gains (assets held a year or less), the tax rate is even higher, matching ordinary income rates. A structure that could potentially eliminate this tax burden entirely after 10 years is groundbreaking for Bitcoin investing , especially for high-net-worth individuals. Who is an Accredited Investor, and Why Does it Matter? The Pearl Fund’s offering is not open to everyone. It’s available exclusively to accredited investor s. This is a term defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and generally includes individuals or entities that meet specific income or net worth requirements, or hold certain professional certifications. Generally, to be considered an individual accredited investor , you must meet one of these criteria: Have earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 with a spouse) in each of the two most recent years and have a reasonable expectation for the same in the current year. Have a net worth over $1 million, either alone or with a spouse (excluding the value of your primary residence). Hold certain professional certifications, designations, or credentials (like a Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82 license). Funds structured like this, often under Regulation D exemptions, are limited to accredited investors because they are considered sophisticated enough to understand the risks involved without the full protections required for public offerings. Why This Fund is Significant for Bitcoin Investing The launch of a $500 million Bitcoin investment fund specifically leveraging the Opportunity Zone program signals a growing trend: the development of sophisticated, tax-efficient investment vehicles for digital assets targeting wealthy investors. It provides a structured way for significant capital to enter the Bitcoin market with a clear potential advantage regarding future tax liabilities. For accredited investor s, this fund represents a new pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin while potentially mitigating one of the biggest costs of long-term appreciation: capital gains tax. It legitimizes Bitcoin further within traditional finance frameworks and demonstrates how innovative structures can bridge the gap between traditional investment strategies and the burgeoning digital asset class. Potential Benefits of Investing in This Fund For an eligible investor, the potential upsides are clear: Significant Tax Savings: The primary draw is the potential for zero federal capital gains tax on profits after a 10-year hold, plus deferral and potential partial reduction of taxes on the original capital gain used for investment. Structured Bitcoin Exposure: Provides a professionally managed way to invest in Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, storage, or private key management. Institutional Approach: Investing through a fund from an established firm like The Pearl Fund may appeal to investors seeking a more traditional investment structure for digital assets. Contribution to OZ Goals: While the direct investment is in Bitcoin, the underlying OZ structure is intended to support investment in designated communities, aligning investment goals with potential social impact (though the direct link might be less apparent when the QOF invests primarily in a financial asset like Bitcoin). Potential Challenges and Risks No investment is without risk, and a fund combining Bitcoin volatility with the complexities of the Opportunity Zone program is no exception. Investors should carefully consider: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings. There’s no guarantee of profits, regardless of tax structure. 10-Year Lock-up: To get the full tax exclusion benefit, capital must be committed for a decade. This represents a significant period of illiquidity. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for both cryptocurrencies and potentially how OZs apply to novel assets like Bitcoin could evolve. Changes could impact the fund’s structure or benefits. Complexity of OZ Rules: Navigating the specifics of the Opportunity Zone program requires expertise. Investors rely heavily on the fund manager’s ability to maintain compliance. Accredited Investor Requirement: This fund is not accessible to the general public, limiting its potential investor base. Fund Management Risk: As with any fund, performance depends on the manager’s execution and ability to navigate the market and regulatory environment. Actionable Insights for Accredited Investors Considering This Path If you are an accredited investor intrigued by the idea of a tax-advantaged Bitcoin investment fund via an Opportunity Zone structure, here are some steps to consider: Educate Yourself: Learn the details of both Bitcoin as an asset class and the specifics of the U.S. Opportunity Zone program and Qualified Opportunity Funds. Consult Professionals: Speak with a qualified financial advisor and a tax professional experienced in both cryptocurrency and Opportunity Zone investments. They can help you understand if this structure aligns with your overall financial goals and tax situation. Perform Due Diligence: Thoroughly research The Pearl Fund, the specific fund documents, its investment strategy, fees, and the experience of the fund managers. Understand exactly how the OZ compliance will be handled. Assess Your Liquidity Needs: Be comfortable with the idea of your capital being locked up for 10 years to achieve the maximum tax benefit. Evaluate Risk Tolerance: Ensure your risk tolerance aligns with the inherent volatility of Bitcoin investing . The Future of Crypto Tax Planning The emergence of funds like The Pearl Fund’s OZ-focused Bitcoin investment fund highlights a growing sophistication in crypto tax planning. As the digital asset space matures, we are likely to see more innovative structures designed to provide tax efficiency for investors, particularly high-net-worth individuals and institutions. This fund sets a precedent for how existing tax incentive programs can potentially be leveraged for digital asset investments, opening up new possibilities for wealth management in the crypto space. Conclusion: A New Era for Tax-Efficient Bitcoin Investing? The Pearl Fund’s launch of a $500 million Bitcoin investment fund utilizing the U.S. Opportunity Zone program marks a significant development. By offering accredited investors the potential for zero capital gains tax on Bitcoin profits held for a decade, it provides a compelling, albeit complex, pathway for long-term Bitcoin investing . While not without risks and requiring a substantial minimum investment and a long-term commitment, this fund demonstrates the evolving landscape of digital asset investment, where sophisticated structures are emerging to address key investor concerns like crypto tax liabilities. It’s a clear sign that institutional-grade, tax-optimized solutions for gaining Bitcoin exposure are becoming a reality.

Veteran macro investor Raoul Pal believes Bitcoin dominance (BTC-D) has peaked, signaling the beginning of what he calls the “Banana Zone” — a parabolic growth phase for altcoins. But not everyone agrees. Bitcoin Hits $103K; BTC Dominance Slides At the start of May, Bitcoin traded around $94,197 . It stayed in the $94K–$97K range until May 7. But in the last 24 hours, BTC surged 3.5% to $103,322 , breaking the critical $100K mark. Overall, Bitcoin has gained 9.66% this month and 6.9% in the past week . Meanwhile, BTC dominance has dropped from 65.36% on May 7 to 63.69% today , a 2.5% decline — the first after two months of consistent growth. Raoul Pal says this downturn could mark the end of Bitcoin’s dominance and the start of the altcoin rally. He notes that BTC-D didn’t reach 2021 or 2017 highs, supporting his call. What Is the “Banana Zone”? Coined by Pal, the “Banana Zone” describes a sharp upward curve in altcoin prices that mimics the shape of a banana. It’s when investors rotate profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, triggering explosive gains across the board. Crypto analyst Mark Harvey disagrees. He believes Bitcoin dominance could grow stronger due to rising ETF inflows and institutional adoption . According to him, the current dip is only temporary. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : $100k Just The Beginning For Bitcoin? , What About the Altcoin Season Index?

Whether this triggers the “Banana Zone” or strengthens BTC dominance further remains to be seen.

While the idea is gaining support from experts and former officials. Could Bitcoin help protect Taiwan’s economy in uncertain times? Let’s find it out! Taiwan Warned of Currency Crisis Taiwan’s economy, which is heavily built on exports, is highly exposed to foreign markets. This has made the value of the New Taiwan Dollar change a lot lately. As an export-driven country, Taiwan is highly affected by global inflation and rising tensions between major countries. Taiwan legislator Ko Ju-Chun called on the government to include Bitcoin in its diversified reserves, alongside gold and foreign exchange reserves. He said Bitcoin has hedging properties and will help improve the resilience and adaptability of Taiwan's financial system.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 9, 2025 Right now, Taiwan holds 423 metric tons of gold and around US$577 billion in foreign exchange reserves. But there’s a catch, over 90% of those reserves are invested in U.S. Treasury bonds. Experts worry that if a major conflict or financial shock happens, these traditional assets might lose value or become hard to use quickly. These changes have raised questions about how secure the country’s financial reserves are. New Proposal: Add Bitcoin to National Reserves To address this issue, in a recent parliamentary session , Taiwan legislator Ko Ju-Chun has suggested that the government should consider adding Bitcoin to Taiwan’s national asset reserves. He believes Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation and global risks. Because Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, is decentralized, and is harder to control or block, Ko says it can offer Taiwan more protection in uncertain times. He’s not asking to replace gold or U.S. dollars, but simply to add a small portion of Bitcoin to the reserves, to give Taiwan more flexibility in the future. Growing Support For Bitcoin’s Initiative Ko’s idea has received support from key figures like Former Premier Chen Cong recently said that Bitcoin may not be used like everyday money, but it is still a powerful asset to guard against inflation. At the same time, Professor Liu Yiru from National Taiwan University pointed out that Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it different from traditional currencies, which can be printed in large amounts during crises. Other Countries Are Taking Action Too Taiwan isn’t alone in this thinking. In the United States, the state of New Hampshire just passed the Bitcoin Reserve Act, officially allowing Bitcoin to be part of its state financial reserves.

Well, there’s a similar notion going on in the cryptocurrency space, as certain assets tend to do the opposite of what the crowd expects from them. This has been the case with Ethereum in the past few weeks (maybe a month) as the asset has gained over a grand since its $1,400 lows registered in early April. The Reverse ETH Trade It was early April, 7 and 9. US President Donald Trump was slapping tariffs left and right, and essentially every country got some. Fear was spreading fast, financial markets were plunging, and hope was nowhere to be found . Sounds like the distant past, right? A lot can change in a month and the cryptocurrency space certainly proved that to be true once again. Ethereum became a laughing stock at one point during this massacre as its price had tumbled by over 60% since the December/January peaks of over $4,000. In fact, ETH not only erased all gains since the start of the bull cycle, but actually traded a lot lower than it did before the US elections. It had tumbled to $1,400, a level not seen since early 2023. The FUD was going crazy, with various entities, whales, and even retail selling off en masse. In general, though, that’s where the most lucrative financial opportunities emerge. This seems to be the case for ETH as its price skyrocketed to almost $2,500 earlier today. Or, to put it in other words – an 80% surge in a month. The past 24 hours have been particularly favorable, as ETH jumped by over 25% at one point. And a big portion of these gains came after the implementation of the latest upgrade – Pectra – which was first seen as a disappointment. According to Santiment, ETH has just “provided a textbook example on how it pays to be a contrarian against the retail crowd.” Ethereum has provided a textbook example on how it pays to be a contrarian against the retail crowd.

This forecast is grounded in Bitcoin’s historical market cycles and key technical indicators, particularly the 21-month Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which EGRAG identifies as a pivotal marker distinguishing bull and bear markets. Understanding the 21-Month EMA and Market Cycles EGRAG emphasizes the significance of the 21-month EMA in assessing Bitcoin’s macro trend. Historically, when BTC’s price remains above this moving average, it indicates a sustained bull market, whereas a drop below suggests a transition into a bear market. This pattern has been consistently observed across previous cycles, providing a reliable framework for predicting market movements. #BTC – Cycle Top (Price & Date) & Bear Market (Price & Date) This post was originally exclusive for subscribers, but I don’t want many of you to miss out on this valuable macro perspective.

This implies a bear market duration of approximately 365 to 396 days, aligning with historical precedents. Price Projections: Peak and Trough EGRAG’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin could ascend to a peak price of around $170,000 by October 2025. Following this apex, a typical bear market correction could see BTC’s price decline by approximately 83%, settling near $30,000.

About two weeks ago, I discussed bitcoin's ( BTC ) bullish breakout above a technical resistance called the Ichimoku cloud and potential for a rally to $100,000 . This week, the cryptocurrency obligingly surged into six figures. Now, top alternative cryptocurrencies such as memecoin DOGE , payments-focused XRP , the Ethereum blockchain's ether ( ETH ) and Solana's SOL have also crossed above the cloud, flashing bullish signals. The analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s, is used to identify support and resistance, momentum and trend change in price actions. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K), and a lagging closing price line. The gap between the first two lines makes the cloud. Crossovers above and below the Ichimoku cloud are taken to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum. The chart shows XRP and DOGE moving above their respective Ichimoku clouds, signaling more gains. In XRP's case, the breakout shifts focus to resistance at around 30 cents, characterized by the trendline falling from February highs. DOGE is trading close to its bear market trendline, which, if topped, would expose resistance at $3.02, the lower high created on March 2. In ETH's case, the breakout has opened the doors to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,700. Meanwhile, SOL may encounter resistance at $218, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the January to April sell-off.",Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|SOL|ETH|DOGE|Technical Analysis|Exclusive|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|ETH|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-09 11:57:30

44373699,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158989,1746792006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Solana Faces Obstacle in Overtaking Ethereum for Institutional Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-ethereum-institutional-adoption/,"The race for blockchain supremacy is one of the most compelling narratives in the ever-evolving crypto market . While retail investors often focus on speed, cost, and trending narratives like memecoins, a different set of criteria drives the decisions of large financial players. When it comes to institutional adoption , a recent perspective from digital asset banking group Sygnum suggests that despite its speed, Solana faces significant hurdles in unseating Ethereum as the preferred network. Why Sygnum Believes Ethereum Holds the Edge for Institutional Adoption Sygnum’s view, highlighted in a recent blog post reported by Cointelegraph, cuts straight to the core of what traditional finance looks for in underlying technology. They argue that the future trajectory of the crypto market will be dictated more by the pragmatic choices of institutions than by the often-fickle sentiment of the retail crowd. From this institutional vantage point, Ethereum currently possesses qualities that Solana has yet to demonstrate convincingly. What exactly are these qualities that give Ethereum its perceived advantage? Security: As a battle-tested network that has undergone the complex transition to Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum is seen as having a robust and proven security model. Institutions prioritize the safety of assets and transactions above almost everything else. Stability: Despite past network congestion issues, Ethereum has a longer track record of continuous operation compared to Solana, which has experienced multiple significant outages. Predictable uptime is crucial for financial operations that run 24/7. Longevity and Track Record: Ethereum has been live since 2015, fostering a massive developer ecosystem and a wide array of established applications (DeFi, NFTs, enterprise solutions). This history provides a level of confidence and reduces perceived risk for institutions. Sygnum suggests that these foundational elements – security, stability, and a proven history – are non-negotiable for institutions considering serious engagement with blockchain technology for services like tokenization, digital asset management, or decentralized finance. Solana’s Challenges: Revenue, Perception, and Value Accrual While Solana boasts impressive transaction speeds and low costs, Sygnum points to specific areas where the network falls short from an institutional perspective. One major concern is the nature of its network activity and revenue generation. Sygnum noted that Solana ‘s revenue is considered unstable, primarily due to the network’s significant focus on memecoin trading. While memecoins drive high transaction volumes and fees, this activity is often speculative and volatile. Institutions typically seek predictable, sustainable economic activity on a network, linked to tangible use cases rather than transient trends. Furthermore, Sygnum highlighted a crucial point about Solana ‘s fee structure and its impact on the value of the native SOL token. While Solana may outperform Ethereum in terms of total layer-1 fee generation volume at times, Sygnum argues this doesn’t translate into equivalent value accrual for the SOL token itself in the same way fees can impact ETH (via burning mechanisms and distribution to stakers). On Solana, most fees are paid to validators, which is different from how value is captured and distributed on Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake network. To underscore this, Sygnum added, “In fact, when it comes to revenues [accruing in a way that supports the network’s economic model], Ethereum still exceeds Solana 2-2.5x.” This suggests that the underlying economic engine of Ethereum, fueled by diverse and often more ‘serious’ applications, generates more significant and perhaps more stable revenue streams relevant to network value compared to Solana’s fee volume driven by speculative trading. Institutional Adoption Drivers: Beyond Speed and Cost It’s easy to get caught up in the technical specs of blockchains – transactions per second, finality time, gas fees. But as Sygnum correctly points out, institutions look at a much broader picture when considering blockchain infrastructure for long-term strategic use. What truly drives institutional adoption? Regulatory Clarity and Compliance: Institutions operate within strict regulatory frameworks. They need blockchains that are perceived as compliant or can easily integrate with compliance tools. Governance and Upgradability: A clear, reliable process for network upgrades and governance is essential for long-term planning and reliance. Ecosystem Maturity: The availability of established tools, infrastructure providers, custodial solutions, and a deep pool of developers and existing dApps makes integration easier and less risky. Interoperability: The ability to connect with other financial systems and blockchains is increasingly important. Liquidity: For trading or managing tokenized assets, deep liquidity on reputable platforms is a must. While Solana is actively working on improving its ecosystem and addressing past issues, Ethereum currently holds a significant lead in many of these non-technical, but institutionally critical, areas. Comparing the Giants: A Quick Look Let’s put some of these points into perspective. While a full technical deep dive is beyond the scope here, we can summarize the institutional perspective highlighted by Sygnum: Feature/Criteria Ethereum (Sygnum’s View) Solana (Sygnum’s Critique) Security & Stability Strong, Battle-tested PoS, Longer Uptime History Past Outages, Newer PoS Implementation Longevity & Track Record ~9 Years, Mature Ecosystem, Large Dev Community ~4 Years, Growing Ecosystem, Less Established Network Revenue Profile Higher Overall Revenue (2-2.5x Solana), Diverse Sources Lower Overall Revenue, Unstable (Heavy Memecoin Reliance) Token Value Accrual from Fees ETH Burn, Staking Rewards (Direct Benefit) Fees Primarily to Validators (Less Direct Benefit to SOL holders from *usage*) Institutional Perception More Established, Less Speculative Association Faster/Cheaper but Associated with Retail Speculation/Memecoins This table simplifies a complex reality, but it reflects the core arguments presented by Sygnum regarding why Ethereum remains the frontrunner for institutional preference based on current characteristics. Can Solana Bridge the Gap? Sygnum’s perspective isn’t necessarily a permanent indictment of Solana , but rather an assessment of the current landscape from an institutional viewpoint. For Solana to potentially bridge this gap and become a preferred institutional blockchain , it would likely need to: Demonstrate prolonged periods of network stability without significant outages. Attract a wider range of enterprise and non-speculative decentralized applications that generate more stable and predictable network activity. Continue to mature its governance and security frameworks. Improve institutional infrastructure support (custody, compliance tools, etc.). Potentially explore mechanisms that better align network revenue with SOL token value accrual, although this is a complex design space. The speed and cost advantages of Solana are undeniable and attractive for certain use cases. However, for institutions considering foundational infrastructure for potentially trillions of dollars in assets, reliability, security, and a proven track record often outweigh raw performance metrics. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Sygnum’s analysis underscores a critical point: the future evolution of the crypto market is increasingly tied to its integration with traditional finance. As institutions become more involved, their requirements will heavily influence which technologies gain traction and for what purposes. This doesn’t mean Solana won’t thrive in other areas – its retail ecosystem, NFT market, and focus on consumer-facing dApps remain strong. But for the specific goal of becoming the primary blockchain rail for large-scale institutional finance, Sygnum believes Ethereum currently holds a significant, perhaps even insurmountable, lead based on its established strengths and the nature of institutional needs. For investors and participants in the crypto market , understanding this institutional perspective is key. While hype and trends drive short-term price action, the long-term infrastructure winners in the institutional space will likely be determined by factors like security, stability, regulatory compliance, and proven longevity – areas where Ethereum presently excels according to Sygnum. Summary: Sygnum’s Take on the Institutional Race In conclusion, digital asset bank Sygnum has offered a clear viewpoint on the competition between Solana and Ethereum for institutional dominance. They argue that the institutional world prioritizes security, stability, and a proven track record – qualities where Ethereum currently shines. Sygnum points to Solana ‘s unstable revenue profile, heavily influenced by memecoins, and its fee structure that primarily benefits validators as key reasons why it is unlikely to surpass Ethereum as the preferred institutional blockchain for now. While Solana’s speed and low cost are advantages, Sygnum believes the future of the crypto market , particularly regarding institutional adoption, will be driven by more conservative, risk-averse choices, favoring the established strengths of Ethereum.

Smarter tools are becoming the real differentiator. Web3 ai ($WAI) is proving exactly why. At only $0.000331 and packed with 12 advanced AI tools, Web3 ai is fast gaining recognition as the best crypto presale 2025 has introduced so far. While the market eyes Web3 ai’s innovative approach, other major players are also showing life. BNB price has surged past $617, testing key technical levels and generating talk of further highs. Meanwhile, Avalanche crypto (AVAX) is also showing encouraging signs after reclaiming important resistance zones. Together, these developments reflect a dynamic market filled with opportunities for forward-looking investors. BNB Price Breaks Past $617 with Rising Volume and Bullish Momentum BNB price is showing solid strength, climbing above $617 after a healthy 2.2% gain in the last 24 hours. Trading volume has also surged, nearly doubling to $1.08 billion. This breakout from a falling channel pattern signals a potential trend reversal. As BNB price tests the 50-day simple moving average near $647, confidence is growing among buyers. Analysts believe that if this momentum holds and resistance breaks, BNB could climb to $750 in the near term. Adding fuel to the optimism is the recent appointment of Paul Atkins, a well-known crypto advocate, as SEC Chairman. This news has lifted overall market sentiment. However, caution remains important. If BNB price drops below $597, it could revisit $536 or even lower levels. Still, the trend looks positive, and many traders are eyeing higher targets with renewed confidence. Avalanche Crypto Breaks Resistance, But the Path Forward Is Still Uncertain Avalanche crypto (AVAX) has also sparked optimism after overcoming a long-standing resistance level that had pressured its price for months. This breakout came after a swing failure pattern, a classic signal often seen ahead of reversals. Following this breakout, AVAX rapidly reclaimed important price zones. Analysts now suggest that the price could target $28.70 if current momentum holds. However, while the move is promising, it does not yet confirm a lasting uptrend. Avalanche crypto still faces challenges ahead. Maintaining levels above the recent breakout zone will be critical. Although this recovery is welcome, it is too soon to label it a full comeback. Investors and traders will be watching closely in the coming weeks.

BNB price continues to climb, testing important resistance near $647 and setting sights on $750. Avalanche crypto, while cautious, is showing positive signs as it pushes past stubborn resistance.

The seizure occurred on April 30, 2025, following an investigation into the platform's failure to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) obligations. The Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office and the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) conducted the operation, confiscating not only the digital assets but also over 8 terabytes of data and the platform's server infrastructure. eXch is suspected of facilitating the laundering of nearly $1.9 billion since its inception, with funds allegedly linked to major cybercrimes including the Bybit theft, Genesis creditor theft, and phishing operations.

The meme coin has now hit a new all-time high in terms of holders, showing that it remains a major player in the space. Shiba Inu Holder Base Crosses 1.5 Million Wallets Shiba Inu marketing Lead, Lucie, took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to celebrate a new milestone for the Shiba Inu community. She showed that the total Shiba Inu holder base has now crossed 1.5 million total holders, marking a new milestone for the meme coin. Related Reading: XRP Is Forms Bullish Reverse Dragon Head Pattern, How High Can Price Go? According to data from Etherscan, the total number of wallets holding Shiba Inu on their balances was 1,507,445 at the time of writing, already up more than 300 wallets after Lucie’s post. Additionally, total transactions that have been carried out on the contract had surpassed the 15 million mark, sitting at almost 15.5 million. What’s Driving Participation From The SHIB Community? A major development for the Shiba Inu community is the upcoming launch of Bury 2.0. This is a staking mechanism from the SHIB team that allows community members and investors to stake the four tokens native to the Shiba Inu platform. Lucie outlined the advantages of Bury 2.0 in another X post, explaining why it is different from other staking mechanisms. The first major reason given for why Bury 2.0 is superior is the fact that it allows stakers to have real voting power in the ecosystem. When users stake SHIB, TREAT, BONE, or LEASH, they get veTokens, eg veSHIB, veTREAT, veBONE, and veLEASH. These veTokens then allow takers to vote on things such as funding, decisions, etc. Additionally, the longer a user has their tokens staked, the more power their vote commands. Another advantage of the Bury 2.0 platform for the Shiba Inu community is allow them to access decentralized finance (DeFi) features such as yield farming, liquidity pools, and more. In this case, the staked tokens are actually being put to work instead of sitting ideal. Related Reading: Analyst Says These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $1,000, But What Does Market Cap Say? The third reason given is that the rewards to stakers in Bury 2.0 continues to evolve. This means that the rewards for staking are not just fixed. So the longer that tokens are staked, chances of rewards such as airdrops, giveaways, and loyalty bonuses are increased. Lastly, staking in Bury 2.0 allows for localized control for the stakers. Lucie explains that each state can launch its own custom veTokens. As such, they can help with decisions and receive rewards for their own state, while being able to create their own rules and priorities. “Bury 2.0 turns passive holders into active Shibizens,” Lucie explained. “It encourages long-term commitment, real participation, and builds a community that’s stronger, smarter, and more involved.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Shiba Inu|SHIB|SHIB news|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu Price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-05-09 12:00:37

She urged those waiting for another round of approvals on crypto-related ETPs or broader regulatory clarity to realize a lot was going on. Commissioner Peirce said the decade-long approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs was “terribly mismanaged” at the time of the approval in January 2024. She issued a statement criticizing the regulator’s “flimsy explanation for its change of heart,” saying that the U.S. SEC had “alienated a generation of product innovators within the space.” After a decade of regulatory back-and-forth with issuers, the SEC approved the first 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10th. The funds accumulated about $60 billion in assets in 24 hours, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) generating $10 billion in AUM—faster than any ETF in history. IBIT currently stands at $59.73 billion in AUM as of May 7, 2025. However, Peirce emphasized that the U.S. SEC’s approval of a product did not imply it was a good investment, and “individuals must make that decision for themselves.” Peirce expresses disappointment in the “mismanagement” of ETF approvals SEC’s Hester Peirce says be patient on crypto ETF filings… “Ongoing litigation we have that we’re trying to work through” & “lots of other considerations we’re thinking about”. Also says spot btc ETF approval process “terribly mismanaged”. via @EricBalchunas @joelwebershow pic.twitter.com/lAs5P3lpiY — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 8, 2025 Peirce said the establishment of spot Bitcoin ETFs proved investors wanted the funds but added there was a “real problem” about how the agency “mismanaged” the initial approval process. She, however, urged patience from those waiting for approvals on crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or broader regulatory clarity, citing ongoing litigation and other considerations that the U.S. SEC was working through, and advised people to be patient with filings. Peirce also stressed that the agency’s “arbitrary and capricious” treatment of applications in this area will continue to harm the Commission’s reputation far beyond crypto, adding that diminished trust from the public would inhibit its ability to regulate the markets effectively. In the days and months leading up to the SEC approvals, crypto investors and analysts closely tracked the communications between the agency and issuers—an unusual scenario for ETF approvals. “We built up so much attention around it, and then you had the [tech glitch] problems around the launch … When we built up that attention, it was just not a healthy way for us to be improving things.” ~ Hester Peirce, Commissioner at the U.S. SEC Peirce pointed out that the Commission had squandered a decade of opportunities to do its job, saying the products could have been approved years ago if the agency had applied the standard it used for other commodity-based ETPs–instead of waiting until a court called its bluff. She added that the U.S. SEC’s approval came only begrudgingly even now, as demonstrated by its continued insistence that these products satisfy a correlation test it did not demand of prior commodity-based ETPs. Peirce says the U.S. SEC’s denial of ETF approvals is legendary According to Hester Peirce, it was time for the Commission to stop denying spot crypto exchange-traded funds/products, claiming that the Commission’s continued resistance to spot crypto ETFs was becoming almost legendary. She added that the reluctance of the U.S. SEC to either approve such an offering or provide greater clarity on how issuers can do so baffles many in the industry. Peirce also claimed that the continued refusal by the U.S. SEC approval of spot crypto ETFs was puzzling to many agency observers. She added that the Bitcoin market had grown, matured, became more liquid, and attracted more sophisticated participants. Peirce, however, reiterated that while she continued to challenge the U.S. SEC’s position on spot crypto ETFs, she remained optimistic that the regulatory agency will change its course. The Commissioner further revealed that watching the U.S. SEC’s refusal to engage productively with crypto ETF users and developers over the years prompted feelings of disbelief at the agency’s puzzling and out-of-character approach to regulation.

Leading the charge are Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and BONK — three of the most recognized meme coins in the space — alongside a fast-rising early-stage contender: MAGACOINFINANCE. These four projects represent very different phases of market maturity, but all are now being flagged as potential breakout assets for 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Dogecoin (DOGE): ETF Hype and Institutional Eyes Dogecoin is the most famous meme coin in crypto history and its relevance is coming back into the picture again. DOGE trading at a price of $0.17 is experiencing fresh momentum from several discussions on the very first Dogecoin ETF which is under course. If allowed, it could bring significant institutional inflows. The price of DOGE is expected to move between $0.141 and $0.205 soon according to the predictions. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Burn-Fueled Optimism and Technical Breakouts SHIB has climbed approximately 7% over the past month, boosted by the burn of over 284 million tokens in a single day. Technical analysts are watching for a bullish breakout pattern, with some projecting a move toward $0.00008. New ecosystem integrations — including MetaMask support and Shibarium expansion — are increasing both adoption and visibility. BONK: Solana’s Meme Engine Gains Momentum Currently in consolidation following an uptick in April is BONK, Solana’s biggest Meme coin. Traders think a break above $0.00001950 will send it toward $0.00002400. BONK is viewed as high-volatility speculation with upside potential, as the Solana ecosystem is back in focus. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Undiscovered Contender with 50x Potential LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE, currently in presale and trading under $0.001, is gaining traction among investors seeking exposure to early-stage growth with strong narrative alignment. With Stage 7 live and a projected listing target of $0.007, analysts are watching closely. The token’s political theme, scarcity-based mechanics, and viral structure have prompted comparisons to early DOGE and SHIB runs. Projects launched from similar structures have delivered 18,500%+ gains in previous cycles — and MAGACOINFINANCE appears to be following that blueprint.

Wellgistics Health, a Nasdaq-listed pharmaceutical distribution and healthcare infrastructure company, announced in a press release that it will launch a new initiative to adopt XRP as a reserve asset and additionally utilize Ripple’s real-time payments infrastructure. In order to support its XRP payments initiative, Wellgistics plans to launch a $50 million equity line of credit (ELOC) program. The company stated that it will integrate ATM and related technologies into its payment network with the aim of facilitating transactions between pharmacies, medical equipment suppliers, and prescription drug manufacturers using XRP. The company also said that the healthcare industry has long been criticized for its slow payments, high fees, and legacy systems, but with XRP, that will change. At this point, the company aims to speed up merchant payments, automate pharmacy reimbursements, and improve financial access across the supply chain by integrating XRP with Ripple’s blockchain network. Instead of waiting days for payments to be processed, Wellgistics Health will use XRP to send money in just 3 seconds. This means less delays, fewer errors, and a much smoother process. At this point, the company added that it prefers XRP because it is faster, has lower fees, is more flexible and transparent. Wellgistics Health said that if the initiative is successful, it will become the first public company to hold XRP as reserves. *This is not investment advice.

As a result, his tribute meme coin LLJEFFY has fallen by 40%. According to a report by local news outlet The San Francisco Standard, Jeffy Yu was confirmed to be alive and living in his parents’ home, five days after the 23-year-old crypto mogul seemingly took his own life on a livestream. On-chain traders have speculated that Yu faked his own death as a way to depart from the crypto space. Especially after Yu’s obituary on the memorial platform, Legacy was removed a few days after it was published. Not only that, on-chain activity shows that there have been multiple transactions linked to Yu’s wallet after his alleged death. On May 9, a reporter from the San Francisco Standard confirmed that Yu was not dead. Instead, he had been living in a two-story home with his parents. Yu declined to provide any commentary about the false reports of his death and how he benefited from it. However, the Zerebro ( ZEREBRO ) founder said that he would be moving his parents out of the home within a week due to fearing that other people would be able to track down his whereabouts. “I’ve been doxxed. I’ve been harassed. If you can find me, other people can find me,” said Yu. Price chart for LLJEFFY, Zerebro co-founder Jeffy Yu’s legacy meme coin, May 9, 2025 | Source: DEX Screener According to DEX Screener , the Solana ( SOL )-based meme coin LLJEFFY, created to honour Yu’s legacy, has fallen more than 40% following the news of Yu being alive. A far cry from its previous high when the token skyrocketed as high as 2,115% after news of Yu’s livestreamed suicide began to circulate. At the moment, the token has accumulated a market cap of $2.1 million. “If you’re reading this, it’s because my 72-hour deadman’s switch triggered, so I’m not here, at least physically,” said the Zerebro co-founder in a scheduled blog post linked to the meme coin. “This is a legacoin, my final art piece. $LLJEFFY,” he wrote. On the other hand, Yu’s original staple token, ZEREBRO, has been on the rise. In the past 24 hours of trading, the token has gone up by 22.3%. It is currently valued at $0.048. In the past few days the token has also suffered a similar downfall to its “legacoin” counterpart, dropping by nearly 10% in the past week and declining by 34.8% in the past two weeks.

44374116,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159004,1746792612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Market Shift: CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Outdated Cycle Theories Amidst Institutional Influx,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-cryptoquant-prediction-shift/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where predictions often dominate headlines, a significant admission from a key industry figure is turning heads. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to openly state that his previous BTC prediction was incorrect. This level of transparency is rare and prompts a deeper look into why established market theories might be losing their predictive power. Bitcoin’s Unpredictable Path: A CryptoQuant CEO’s Revelation Just a couple of months prior, Ki Young Ju had suggested that the bull market for Bitcoin had concluded. This forecast, coming from the head of a respected on-chain analytics firm like CryptoQuant , naturally carried weight within the community. However, market movements since then haven’t strictly followed that script, leading Ju to publicly revise his stance. His candor highlights the inherent difficulty in forecasting market tops or bottoms, even with sophisticated data tools. While he has adjusted his immediate outlook, Ju still characterizes the current market environment as ‘sluggish’. It’s a phase caught between traditional bullish momentum and potential bearish pressures, gradually absorbing new capital. This observation sets the stage for his broader argument about the evolving nature of the Crypto Market . Why Old BTC Prediction Models Are Failing According to Ki Young Ju, the traditional models used for BTC prediction , particularly those based on historical cycles driven by specific market participants, are becoming less reliable. He specifically pointed out that the market composition has dramatically diversified. Where once ‘whales’ (large individual holders), miners, and retail investors were the primary forces, the landscape now includes a wider array of players: ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) Strategy funds Institutions (traditional financial firms) Government agencies (though their role is more complex, often related to seized assets) This diversification means that the old ‘profit cycles’ – where whale sell-offs at perceived peaks would signal a market top – are no longer the dominant narrative. The influx of new, large-scale participants with different investment horizons and strategies fundamentally alters market dynamics. The New Crypto Market Landscape: Beyond Whales and Retail The structure of the Crypto Market is undergoing a profound transformation. It’s no longer a playground solely influenced by the trading patterns of early adopters and individual enthusiasts. The entry of regulated financial products like spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets, particularly the U.S., has opened the floodgates for capital from traditional finance that previously had limited avenues to invest directly in crypto assets. This shift introduces new complexities but also new levels of liquidity and demand. Institutional players operate differently than retail or even large individual whales. Their investment decisions are often based on long-term strategies, portfolio allocation, and regulatory considerations, rather than short-term speculative trading or mining costs. Institutional Crypto and the Power of New Liquidity A key insight from the CryptoQuant CEO is the impact of Institutional Crypto adoption on market structure. Ju emphasized that the significant liquidity brought in by institutions and ETFs has the power to counterbalance traditional selling pressure, even from large whale movements. In the past, a major whale offloading a substantial amount of Bitcoin could significantly impact the price. However, with large institutions consistently accumulating Bitcoin through mechanisms like ETFs, this new demand can absorb supply that would have previously overwhelmed the market. This doesn’t mean price corrections won’t happen, but the triggers and the market’s reaction mechanisms are changing. The market is becoming deeper and potentially more resilient to the actions of any single type of participant. Key Takeaways on New Liquidity: Offsetting Supply: New institutional demand can absorb supply from traditional sellers (whales, miners). Deeper Market: Increased participation leads to a more liquid and potentially less volatile market over time. Changing Price Discovery: Price signals are now influenced by institutional flows, not just on-chain movements of older entities. Navigating the Sluggish Market: What’s Next? Despite the long-term implications of institutional adoption, the market isn’t always a straight line up. Ju’s description of the market as ‘sluggish’ reflects periods of consolidation, sideways movement, and uncertainty as these new dynamics play out. This phase is crucial as the market ‘gradually absorbs new liquidity’. It’s a period where demand meets available supply, and a new equilibrium is sought. For investors and analysts, this means adapting their frameworks. Relying solely on historical cycles or metrics that only tracked older market participants might provide an incomplete picture. Understanding the flow of capital into regulated products and the strategies of institutional players is becoming increasingly vital. Actionable Insights for the Evolving Market: Diversify Analysis: Look beyond traditional on-chain metrics to include data on ETF flows and institutional activity. Understand New Players: Learn about the motivations and operational methods of institutional investors. Expect Volatility: While new liquidity adds depth, the transition period can still involve significant price swings. Long-Term View: The structural changes suggest a maturing market, potentially favoring longer-term investment strategies. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Era for Bitcoin CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s candid admission about his past BTC prediction error serves as a valuable reminder that the Crypto Market is not static. It is a dynamic ecosystem constantly evolving, particularly with the significant entry of Institutional Crypto and new investment vehicles like ETFs. The old playbooks, heavily reliant on historical cycles driven by early participants, are becoming outdated. The current market phase, described as sluggish but absorbing new liquidity, is a testament to this transition. While challenging for short-term predictions, this evolution points towards a more mature and diverse market structure for Bitcoin . Understanding these fundamental shifts, rather than clinging to old theories, will be crucial for navigating the crypto landscape moving forward.

Bonk ($BONK) rose 8.19% in the last 24 hours, hitting $0.00001855, while SLERF ($SLERF) posted a 7.16% gain to $0.07149. These movements hint at a brewing momentum shift across the meme coin market. It’s no surprise that meme coin lovers are again digging into the charts for their next 100x play. Over the past few years, tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE have gone from punchlines to portfolios. But 2025 is shaping up differently. The next meme coin run isn’t just about community—it’s about mechanics, momentum, and early entries. One project clawing its way to the top of that conversation? Troller Cat . With a presale live, 69% staking APY, and a roadmap designed to burn supply while rewarding holders, $TCAT isn’t just chasing lasers. It’s building something. This makes it a serious contender for the best 100x crypto play this month. Troller Cat ($TCAT): This Cat Isn’t Playing—It’s Planning Troller Cat kicked off its presale on May 2, 2025, and it’s already turning heads. The project is in Stage 3, priced at $0.0000072 per token. The planned launch price? A spicy $0.0005309. If you strike while it’s hot, that’s a 7,000% ROI potential. The structure’s as tight as its branding. There are 26 presale stages, each one increasing the token price and tightening early supply. If you’re eyeing a $30,000 play at this stage, you’re potentially looking at a $2.2M upside at launch—numbers that put it firmly in the best 100x crypto bracket. But this isn’t a flash-in-the-pan meme coin. Staking during the presale gives holders 69% APY, with rewards locked for two months post-launch to keep things steady. And there’s no staking fluff here—it’s built to benefit long-term community holders. Add in the TrollerCat Game Center—a Play-to-Earn ecosystem that burns tokens through ad revenue buybacks—and the tokenomics go from clever to deflationary genius. As players game, ad dollars are funneled back into $TCAT buybacks, then burned. Fewer tokens. More scarcity. Higher value. Let’s not forget the referral program. Drop $25 or more into the presale and unlock a unique code. Share it and earn 10% of your referrals’ buy-ins, while they get 10% extra tokens. And yes, you can track it all in your dashboard. Audited, KYC-approved, and over $75K raised—this cat’s not just meowing. It’s roaring. With just 1 day left before the next price hike, now’s the time to act. The earlier the entry, the greater the gain. This isn’t just a meme—it’s mechanics built for long-haul wins. 69% APY Staking: Rewards With Real Claws Troller Cat isn’t just offering utility—it’s rewarding loyalty. Early supporters can stake their $TCAT tokens during the presale for a jaw-dropping 69% APY. This rate isn’t some unsustainable yield farm gimmick; it’s backed by a structured lock-in period that balances the system. Once you stake, rewards are accumulated and locked for two months post-launch. This ensures early whales don’t dump and helps keep the token’s price action smoother when $TCAT hits exchanges. It’s a setup that rewards patient holders while discouraging short-term speculation. The staking process is simple. You can stake anytime during the presale and earn passively while the project grows. There’s no complicated math or convoluted token wrapping—just pure, high-yield rewards for those who believe in the long game. Bonk ($BONK): Holding the Line With Solid Social Momentum Bonk ($BONK) has been on a roll, jumping 8.19% in the past day and now trading at $0.00001855. It’s bounced off support at the $0.000016 level and is now targeting $0.00001970 as short-term resistance. Momentum is rising, and so is trading volume. What’s giving Bonk its second wind? Community strength and visibility. It’s one of the few Solana-based meme coins with staying power. After surviving a market-wide dip in early Q2, it’s finding new legs through influencer push and fresh DEX integrations. While Bonk lacks staking or token burn mechanics, its loyal fanbase keeps the fire going. Technically, Bonk is forming a bullish continuation flag. If volume sustains, we could see a breakout toward $0.000022 in the near term. But for it to be a best 100x crypto, it’ll need more than tweets and trading pairs. Right now, it’s still more sizzle than steak. Investors looking to ride momentum should watch for confirmation on the next leg up. It’s a trending play, not a foundational one—yet. SLERF ($SLERF): Quiet Surge, Big Energy SLERF isn’t new to hype—it launched with chaotic energy earlier this year, and it’s still holding onto that meme madness. Up 7.16% today and trading at $0.07149, it’s gaining traction again with fresh speculative interest. Unlike some memes that fade into oblivion after the first spike, SLERF is still trading on decent volume. It’s consolidating above the $0.065 range, and if it breaks through the $0.075 ceiling, we could see it chase $0.085 fast. The SLERF team hasn’t revealed much about long-term utility, but that hasn’t stopped buyers. Its appeal is raw meme power, a touch of community chaos, and the kind of chart action traders chase during slow macro weeks. Still, without staking, supply burn, or a utility model, SLERF’s long-term 100x potential is questionable. It’s fun. It’s speculative. But it’s not yet foundational. If you’re looking for moon shots based on technical swing setups, SLERF’s got legs. But if you’re asking what the best 100x crypto is with mechanics and staying power? SLERF is more thrill than thesis. Conclusion: Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat has the strongest case for being the best 100x crypto to watch right now. It’s not just about momentum—it’s about mechanics: 7,000% ROI from presale to launch, 69% staking APY, deflationary burn loops via its Game Center, and a referral system that rewards early movers. Bonk and SLERF are both trending up, and they deserve to be on your radar, but neither has the strategic structure Troller Cat is flexing. With only a few hours left before the next presale price hike, TrollerCat.com is clawing ahead fast. If you want in at the lowest price point, now’s the time to act. This isn’t a meme season—it’s a momentum moment.

The tokens were transferred off the exchange into private wallets, suggesting strategic accumulation amid growing market interest in Pi Network. This isn’t an isolated event.

Yet, exchange wallet balances haven’t changed—fueling speculation. According to Pi Barter Mall , this sudden rise may stem from a 5 billion Pi liquidity pool release, possibly in preparation for a major exchange listing . While official confirmation is pending, such activity hints at broader plans to introduce Pi Coin into deeper liquidity environments. Pi Coin Price Prediction Pi Coin is showing notable strength on the technical charts . Following a sharp price rise and surge in trading volume, Pi Coin is now consolidating within $0.58 and $0.59. Several indicators are aligning to suggest a bullish breakout for Pi Coin. The RSI is forming a golden cross on both the 4-hour and daily charts, signaling a possible continuation of the upward trend. At the same time, the stochastic RSI appears to be bottoming out, another indicator pointing to a potential reversal to the upside. Pi Coin is forming the “C” leg of the butterfly pattern, expected around the $0.5603 level. However, since the price is currently showing strength at the golden pocket of $0.5833, it is likely to move higher from here.

Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate , was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence. “Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation,“ Scott said. The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering. Related: Trump tricked into pushing XRP for crypto reserve: Report Scott criticizes last-minute opposition Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said that “the GENIUS Act was a bipartisan achievement at the Banking Committee.” By working on it, he claimed those involved “made the decision to make America's economy safer and cheaper for the American people.” Still, in his view, Democrats changed their minds when the “light and cameras were watching.” Scott alleged that the shift was driven not by changes in the bill, but by efforts to deny President Donald Trump a legislative win: “It was a vote against President Trump and President Trump’s legislative agenda. It was a vote to stop President Trump from having a victory in the digital asset space.“ Related: Democrat lawmakers object to hearing, citing ‘Trump’s crypto corruption’ Democrats cite corruption concerns Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading voice on crypto regulation, raised concerns that the Trump family-linked stablecoin, USD1, surged in market value due to a “shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates.” “The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption,“ she said. On May 1, Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX used the Trump-linked stablecoin USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance . According to CoinMarketCap data , the stablecoin’s market cap shot up from under $137 million on May 1 to nearly $2.13 billion on May 2. USD1’s Market Capitalization. Source: CoinMarketCap Democrats voiced concerns around Trump’s crypto-related activities and sponsored multiple bills to address those concerns. Four of the five pro-crypto Democrats who passed the GENIUS Act in the Senate Banking Committee signed their names to a statement on May 3, saying that they do not feel comfortable with the direction stablecoin legislation is taking. While the letter did not mention Trump directly, Representative Maxine Waters was more explicit in her opposition. “If there is no effort to block the President of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers,” Waters said. Democrats propose stricter crypto laws Democrats also recently sponsored the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, to prevent federal officials from profiting from memecoins . US Senator Jeff Merkley and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also introduced the End Crypto Corruption Act earlier this week. The End Crypto Corruption Act would ban the president, vice president, senior executive branch officials, members of Congress, and their immediate families from financially benefiting from issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets, such as memecoins and stablecoins. In a statement published on Merkley’s website, he said that “people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls.” “This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let’s end this corruption immediately,” Merkley added. In a statement to CBS News, Warren echoed that sentiment, saying that both Democrats in favor and opposed to the GENIUS Act “agree that green-lighting Donald Trump’s corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong.” “The GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump’s crypto corruption,” Warren claimed.

The current ETH rally led to over $430M in liquidations for the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) showed its ability to rally, adding over 20% in a single day. ETH recovered to $2,445.37, gaining to 0.023 BTC. The strong daily price move, however, directly attacked short positions. ETH recovered as BTC traded at $103,419.00, boosting all other coins and tokens with increased optimism. As a result, ETH was the leader in short liquidations, with over $430M in the past 24 hours. Short liquidations affected both the centralized market and high-risk single-trader positions on the Hyperliquid perpetual DEX. At the same time, whales continued their buying, including from a wallet probably belonging to World Liberty Fi.

Almost no loans can be found at above $1,500, following previous rapid corrections for ETH. The low price reflects fears that ETH may dip even lower, despite the current breakout. On the positive side, ETH is expected to return to the $3,000 range and potentially continue its rally as high as $10,000. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The arrival of Cambrian represents a turning point where networks expand beyond traditional blockchain operations, and off-chain computational power meets on-chain security guarantees. These “network extensions”—Actively Validated Services (AVS) and Node Consensus Networks (NCN)—enable everything from AI processing to privacy-preserving transactions. Traditionally, building these systems required expertise equivalent to constructing your own mini-blockchain. Enter Cambrian : the infrastructure revolution that turns months of custom engineering into minutes of configuration. Much like how AWS transformed web development, Cambrian provides the toolkit that lets developers focus on innovation rather than infrastructure. The Problem: Building from Scratch Building an AVS/NCN is like hand-assembling a high-performance engine from individual nuts and bolts—each consensus protocol, on-chain integration, and security checkpoint must be configured manually. Teams wrestle with custom node operations, orchestrate communication across distributed services, implement cryptographic safeguards, and maintain real-time monitoring, all while preserving decentralization. Such complexity creates a substantial barrier, sidelining many innovative projects simply because the infrastructure demands are too high. The Cambrian Solution Cambrian provides something akin to a LEGO set for Solana infrastructure. Developers can now combine pre-built, battle-tested modules to create sophisticated AVS and NCN systems. The toolkit combines a modular SDK, intuitive CLI, and ready-to-deploy components working seamlessly together. Cambrian’s mission is practical: slash development time and eliminate infrastructure overhead. By simplifying the creation of these network extensions, Cambrian democratizes access to restaking infrastructure, opening the ecosystem to teams of all sizes. Cambrian’s main capabilities and benefits include: 90% Faster Development. With scaffold projects, local testing environments, and one-command deployment, Cambrian compresses months of work into days. Smaller Teams, Lower Costs. Production-ready building blocks replace the need for specialized consensus engineers and infrastructure experts, allowing small teams to accomplish what previously required entire departments. Deep Solana Integration. Cambrian’s Solana-native architecture includes built-in hooks for Jito restaking, creating a seamless extension of Solana’s capabilities. Turnkey Components. Choose from plug-and-play consensus algorithms, governance models, and slashing/reward modules—selecting options from a menu rather than building each from scratch. Deployment Wizard. The intuitive CLI transforms the complex journey from local development to mainnet into a guided process. Active Developer Community. Cambrian boasts a collaborative ecosystem with comprehensive documentation and support channels. How It Works Cambrian’s architecture streamlines complex AVS development through five core components: Cambrian SDK & CLI. The SDK automatically generates code and configuration files based on your specifications, eliminating hundreds of hours of boilerplate coding. Consensus Building Blocks. Cambrian provides modular consensus components—offering HotStuff, RAFT, or PoA with integrated threshold signatures by default. Node Operation Tools. Docker-based operators with automatic node discovery and performance metrics make distributed system management straightforward. Local Testing Environment. A complete simulation environment lets you test validators, stake flows, and off-chain tasks before deployment. One-Command Deploy. Cambrian’s deployment wizard handles the complex orchestration required to launch your AVS on devnet or mainnet with a single command. Real-World Use Cases Cambrian enables practical applications across the Solana ecosystem: Oracles & Data Pipelines. These systems provide reliable external data to the blockchain. Developers can create decentralized price feeds or cross-chain bridges connecting different networks. AI Inference & ZK-Coprocessors. Cambrian supports off-chain computational tasks while maintaining verifiable connections to on-chain operations—like complex calculations that would be too expensive to perform directly on-chain. DeFi Circuit Breakers. These protective mechanisms monitor market conditions and implement automated safeguards for restaked assets, helping manage risk during volatility. Private RPCs & Compute Networks. Specialized service networks that maintain security while offering enhanced privacy or dedicated processing power for demanding applications. Specialized Processing Networks. The platform supports technical utilities like audio/video transcoding, software-defined networking, and data availability layers—critical infrastructure components secured by restaked assets. Pros & Cons Cambrian shines with three main advantages that make it a game-changer for Solana developers. Think of it as having a time machine for your project timeline—development acceleration slashes your journey from concept to deployment, giving teams the agility to iterate and test concepts while competitors are still setting up their infrastructure. The building block approach provides a rich library of pre-tested components. And Cambrian’s seamless Solana ecosystem integration, particularly with Jito restaking protocols, creates smooth user experiences without the technical seams that often plague blockchain projects. Like any pioneering technology, Cambrian does come with a couple of issues to consider. As an emerging platform, some specialized modules are still evolving. Additionally, teams unfamiliar with distributed consensus models will face an initial learning investment, though Cambrian’s comprehensive documentation helps flatten this curve. These limitations seem like only teething issues, shrinking with each platform update. In Summary Cambrian represents the evolution of blockchain infrastructure—from custom coding to industrial efficiency. By providing AWS-like simplicity for Solana restaking, it democratizes access to capabilities once reserved for specialized teams. Explore their documentation, join the Discord community, or spin up your first AVS project in minutes. As restaking powers the next generation of Web3 services, Cambrian presents an express lane for turning visions into reality.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|SOL|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 12:17:22

44374479,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159008,1746793215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive OKX USDT Transfer Sparks Mystery,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/okx-usdt-transfer-mystery/,"Large movements of cryptocurrency on the blockchain often capture the attention of the market, and for good reason. These significant transactions, often dubbed ‘whale’ movements, can sometimes signal shifts in market sentiment, potential large-scale trading activity, or strategic positioning by major players. Recently, a notable event involving a substantial USDT transfer from a major exchange has done just that, sparking considerable discussion and speculation within the crypto community. What Happened: A Massive OKX USDT Transfer The crypto world was alerted to a significant transaction when the popular blockchain tracker, Whale Alert crypto , reported a movement of 200,000,000 USDT. The stablecoin, Tether (USDT), valued at approximately $200 million, was transferred from the crypto exchange OKX exchange to an address identified only as an ‘unknown wallet’. Whale Alert is a widely followed service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Its reports provide transparency into the flow of significant amounts of digital assets, offering insights into potential market dynamics. In this instance, the report highlighted the origin – a known entity, OKX – and the destination – an address with no public association or identification, hence labeled ‘unknown’. This particular large crypto transfer stands out not just for its size, but for its origin and destination. Transfers from exchanges like OKX often represent users withdrawing funds, exchanges moving assets between hot and cold wallets, or potentially institutional activity. The ‘unknown wallet’ destination adds a layer of intrigue, leading many to question the purpose behind such a substantial move. Why Does This Large Crypto Transfer Matter? A large crypto transfer of this magnitude is significant for several reasons: Market Speculation: Large movements of stablecoins like USDT, especially from exchanges, can sometimes precede significant trading activity. Traders often move stablecoins to exchanges when preparing to buy volatile assets or move them off exchanges when planning to hold or move into fiat. Whale Activity Insight: This is a clear example of crypto whale activity . ‘Whales’ are individuals or entities holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Tracking their movements can provide clues, though interpreting these clues requires caution and context. Exchange Dynamics: While the funds moved from OKX, it doesn’t necessarily mean they were sold. It could be OKX moving funds internally, or a large user/institution withdrawing assets. Transparency vs. Privacy: The blockchain is transparent in showing the transaction occurred, but the identity behind the ‘unknown wallet’ remains private, highlighting the dual nature of crypto. Understanding the potential motivations behind such a USDT transfer is key to interpreting its possible impact. Was it a move to cold storage for security? Was it funding an over-the-counter (OTC) trade? Was it an institutional investor rebalancing a portfolio? Each possibility carries different implications for the market. Unpacking the Mystery: Who Owns the Unknown Wallet? The term ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the address has not been publicly attributed to a specific exchange, company, or well-known individual. This leaves the door open to numerous possibilities: Potential Owners of an ‘Unknown Wallet’: Let’s consider who might be behind such a significant address: Cold Storage: An exchange or large institution might move funds from hot wallets (used for daily operations on the OKX exchange ) to cold storage (offline wallets) for enhanced security. OTC Desk: Over-the-counter trading desks handle large trades directly between parties, often moving funds to or from private wallets to facilitate these deals without impacting public exchange order books. Another Exchange: The wallet could belong to a different, perhaps less transparent, exchange moving assets. Institutional Investor: A hedge fund, asset manager, or corporation holding crypto might use private wallets to manage their positions. Individual Whale: A very wealthy individual with significant crypto holdings could be consolidating assets or moving them for personal reasons. Without further on-chain analysis or external information, definitively identifying the owner of the wallet is challenging. Blockchain explorers allow anyone to view the transaction details and track subsequent movements from the ‘unknown wallet’, but linking the address to a real-world identity is often difficult, if not impossible, due to privacy features inherent in cryptocurrencies. What Can We Learn from Whale Alert Crypto Reports? Services like Whale Alert crypto are invaluable tools for anyone trying to understand the flow of value within the crypto ecosystem. They provide real-time notifications of large transactions, helping observers track significant movements that might otherwise go unnoticed. By monitoring these alerts, along with other market data, participants can gain a broader perspective on market sentiment and potential large-scale strategies. However, it’s crucial to remember that these alerts are just data points. A USDT transfer from an exchange doesn’t automatically mean a market crash or pump is imminent. It requires careful analysis and consideration of other factors, such as overall market trends, news events, and the context of the specific cryptocurrencies being moved. For instance, a large Bitcoin transfer might be interpreted differently than a large stablecoin transfer. Similarly, a transfer to an exchange might suggest intent to sell or trade, while a transfer from an exchange (like this one from the OKX exchange ) might suggest intent to hold, move off-exchange, or engage in private transactions. Navigating Crypto Whale Activity: Actionable Insights For regular crypto participants, monitoring crypto whale activity can be insightful, but it shouldn’t be the sole basis for investment decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources like Whale Alert for notifications on significant transfers. Use Blockchain Explorers: Learn how to use tools like Etherscan (for ERC-20 tokens like USDT) to track the origin and destination of funds reported by Whale Alert. See where the funds go next. Look for Patterns: Is this a one-off transfer, or is the ‘unknown wallet’ consistently receiving or sending large amounts? Consistent activity might suggest a specific entity or strategy. Context is Key: Consider the broader market conditions. Is the market bullish or bearish? Are there major news events? Avoid Panic or FOMO: Don’t blindly follow whale movements. A whale’s strategy is likely very different from yours, based on much larger capital and different goals. Focus on Fundamentals: Ultimately, the long-term success of crypto assets depends on their underlying technology, adoption, and development, not just short-term whale movements. This specific large crypto transfer serves as a reminder that while the blockchain offers transparency of transactions, the identity of participants can remain private, adding an element of mystery to significant fund movements. The Bottom Line on This USDT Transfer The 200 million USDT transfer from the OKX exchange to an unknown wallet, highlighted by Whale Alert crypto , is a prime example of the significant crypto whale activity that occurs daily on blockchains. While the exact purpose of this particular large crypto transfer remains speculative, it underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data for potential insights into market dynamics and the strategies of major players. It’s a reminder that the crypto market is influenced by large holders, and keeping an eye on their movements, while applying critical thinking and considering broader market context, can be a valuable part of a comprehensive crypto strategy. The mystery of the ‘unknown wallet’ continues, but the transaction itself provides a clear data point for analysts and enthusiasts to ponder.

Analyst Sets Target Price,https://timestabloid.com/stellar-xlm-is-breaking-out-analyst-sets-target-price/,"Stellar (XLM) is gaining significant attention due to its potential breakout from a key technical pattern, which could signal a notable price movement. On-chain analyst Ali recently took to X to highlight this development, declaring, “Stellar $XLM is breaking out!” His insight has sparked a wave of enthusiasm among traders and investors alike. #Stellar $XLM is breaking out! https://t.co/tMETE50eBn pic.twitter.com/uUkGvK31sX — Ali (@ali_charts) May 9, 2025 Technical Analysis Points to a Breakout Ali’s analysis is rooted in a chart he shared on May 6, where he pointed out that XLM seemed to be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern—a classic bullish indicator. According to Ali, if the $0.24 support level holds, XLM could complete the formation of the right shoulder, setting the stage for a potential breakout towards $0.39. This prediction aligns with traditional chart patterns, as an inverse head and shoulders setup often signals a reversal from bearish to bullish momentum. Market Sentiment and XLM’s Price Action The crypto community reacted swiftly to Ali’s statement, with market sentiment turning increasingly bullish. At the time of writing, XLM’s price hovers around the critical $0.24 level, indicating that traders are closely monitoring whether this support can withstand selling pressure. Should the level remain intact, it could confirm the pattern and ignite buying interest, potentially pushing the price toward the anticipated target of $0.39. Analysts are monitoring trading volume and RSI indicators to assess the likelihood and strength of a breakout. Historically, increased volume during a breakout can validate the move, while RSI readings can help determine whether the asset is overbought or oversold. As of now, volume indicators have shown a modest uptick, suggesting that traders are cautiously positioning themselves. XLM’s Broader Market Context As a prominent blockchain, Stellar aims to facilitate seamless international transactions and increase access to financial services. XLM, its native token, has long been regarded as a competitor to Ripple’s XRP, especially in international transactions. Recent market conditions have seen increased volatility in the altcoin space, with XLM at a pivotal point in its technical trajectory. Beyond technical patterns, Stellar’s ongoing partnerships and ecosystem developments may also influence its price action. The network has continued to focus on integrating blockchain solutions with traditional finance, and positive news on this front could further fuel bullish momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Lies Ahead for Stellar XLM If XLM holds the $0.24 support and completes the inverse head and shoulders pattern, it would validate Ali’s analysis and reinforce bullish sentiment among market participants. However, traders should remain vigilant as the pattern has yet to fully play out, and unexpected market shifts could still affect the outcome. Investors looking to capitalize on this potential breakout should consider monitoring broader market trends and Bitcoin’s price movements, as altcoins often mirror BTC’s direction. Additionally, keeping an eye on volume surges and on-chain metrics could provide further insights into the strength and sustainability of XLM’s breakout. While Ali’s forecast is grounded in classic technical analysis, traders need to incorporate risk management strategies, given the inherent volatility in the crypto market. Nevertheless, should XLM break through the targeted $0.39 mark, it could signify a significant shift in the token’s market structure, offering new opportunities for both short-term traders and long-term holders.

The International Crypto Trading Championship 2025 debuts as a novel crypto event, blending competition, education, and transparency. WhiteBIT is organizing a live trading event, the newly introduced International Crypto Trading Cup. The event mixes a competition between high-profile traders, in addition to building educational content and showcasing the trading tools on WhiteBIT. A selected group of traders will showcase their trading abilities, including full transparency of the WhiteBIT trading screens and on-chain transfers. The ICTC aims to boost exposure for top traders, turning them into global public figures. “ We set ourselves an ambitious goal — to set a new standard in the world of trading and hold the first-ever live-stream trading championship. Our ICTC is the first international tournament where world-class traders will compete. Along with them, fully-formed squads of 25 participants and individual traders will also take part online ,” said the WhiteBIT Group President Volodymyr Nosov. The event is open to anyone to track the traders’ decisions in real-time, observe their reactions and strategies, as well as join the conversation via chat, added Nosov. Volodymyr Nosov: Anyone can test their skills on WhiteBIT The focus of ICTC is on crypto trading education. The pre-tournament qualification selected from a wide circle of traders, who competed for a chance to become the eighth trader on the main live event. “Anyone interested had the opportunity to test their skills, gain unique experience, and learn something new even before the main competition stage,” added Nosov. In the second stage, the competition will focus on professionalism and fairness. All participants will be monitored for financial soundness. The traders’ actions will be open for tracking in real time, including screen-sharing. Anyone will be able to preview their open positions and trades.

In a court filing submitted on May 7 to the Southern District of New York, Bond’s attorneys argued that her indictment was the result of “stealth and deception” by federal prosecutors who, according to the filing, privately promised not to pursue charges against her. The document claims that this verbal assurance played a critical role in securing Salame’s guilty plea. However, prosecutors refused to include any protection for Bond in the formal agreement. “Mr. Salame and Ms. Bond’s attorneys were advised that the agreement to cease investigating Ms. Bond could not be placed within the four corners of the Salame plea,” the filing reads. Bond’s legal team is now requesting that the court suppress any statements she made after this supposed inducement, and is calling for a hearing to establish the scope and legitimacy of the government’s promises. Bond, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2022, is facing four criminal counts, including conspiracy and violations of campaign finance laws related to excessive and unlawful contributions. Her legal team has implied that political motivations may have played a role, pointing to her Republican affiliation as a possible factor behind the charges. Prosecutors Accused of Playing Fast and Loose Salame, who was sentenced to over seven years in prison in 2024 after pleading guilty to two felony charges, had initially attempted to void his plea on similar grounds. He ultimately dropped the challenge and began serving his sentence in October. The couple’s legal strategies suggest a coordinated effort to expose what they claim is misconduct by federal prosecutors handling the broader FTX collapse. Bond’s defense hinges on the argument that her prosecution was effectively off the table—until it wasn’t. Her team contends that the government’s reversal undermines not only the fairness of her case but the broader integrity of plea negotiations. FTX Legal Web Still Unraveling The downfall of FTX has pulled nearly every top executive into the legal spotlight. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He has filed an appeal , reportedly eyeing a potential pardon from President Trump. Caroline Ellison received a two-year sentence, while Nishad Singh and Gary Wang were handed lighter penalties. Now, Michelle Bond’s fate may hinge not just on campaign finance law—but on whether the court believes she was collateral in a larger prosecutorial strategy.

Instead, under the new agreement, Ripple Labs would pay the Commission $50 million and have the remaining escrow funds to be released. The deal marks a stark departure from the last appeal filed by the SEC before the former Chair Gensler resigned, in which the watchdog argued that the court’s previous decision was erroneous and continued insisting that, despite XRP itself not being a security, the contracts by which the token is sold are.

Solana’s overreliance on meme coin activity and validator-centric tokenomics raise concerns about long-term viability. Meanwhile, Ethereum gained fresh momentum after the Pectra upgrade triggered a 20% price surge, liquidated over $300 million in shorts, and reignited bullish sentiment. Vitalik Buterin also boosted Ethereum’s outlook by proposing a major protocol simplification to enhance scalability, efficiency, and decentralization. Investors Still Prefer Ethereum Over Solana Sygnum, a well known crypto bank group, is very skeptical about Solana’s ability to overtake Ethereum as the preferred blockchain for institutional adoption. In a blog post dated May 8, Sygnum pointed out that despite Solana’s recent surge in transaction volumes and fee generation, it lacks the critical indicators necessary to position itself as a dominant institutional platform. Solana vs Ethereum volumes (Source: Dune Analytics ) The firm argued that Ethereum’s long standing strengths—like security, stability, and established track record—are still highly valued by traditional financial institutions, and that these qualities are likely to drive decision-making more than short-term market sentiment. Sygnum explained that while Ethereum’s current market sentiment is relatively poor, institutions are likely to lean towards platforms that offer dependable infrastructure for long-term products, which Ethereum continues to provide. The report raised concerns about Solana’s revenue model, and stated that its income is “highly concentrated in the meme coin sector,” which introduces a lot of volatility and undermines revenue stability. This, according to Sygnum, limits Solana’s potential to outperform Ethereum despite its current fee dominance, because the quality and sustainability of revenue matter more than quantity. Another area of critique was Solana’s tokenomics. While Solana has become the leading layer-1 blockchain in fee generation, Sygnum pointed out that most of these fees go to validators and do not actually contribute meaningfully to the value of the SOL token. (Source: Sygnum ) In contrast, Ethereum’s revenue, although facing scaling-related challenges, still surpasses Solana’s by a factor of 2 to 2.5. The bank also noticed that Solana’s community recently rejected a proposal to reduce the token’s inflation rate. This indicates a reluctance to prioritize tokenholder value. Despite the criticisms, Sygnum still acknowledged that Solana could make up ground if it began generating more stable revenue streams through use cases like tokenization and stablecoins. It did show some success in growing total value locked in its decentralized finance protocols. Still, Ethereum’s dominance in areas like DeFi, stablecoins, and asset tokenization positions it perfectly for more institutional adoption and growth. The Ethereum Foundation’s recent shift to prioritize its layer-1 roadmap and revamp its market strategy may also help renew confidence in the network. Ethereum Upgrade Triggers Price Breakout Ethereum’s price surged by close to 20% in the past 24 hours after the successful launch of the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade. Now, some traders are convinced this could be a pivotal moment for the asset. ETH’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) After a year of lackluster performance and uncertain sentiment, Ethereum is now trading at $2,345, up from $1,472 in early April. The recent rally saw Ether's open interest spike by 21%, and ignited fresh optimism among traders, with some describing the price movement as “insane.” The surge also triggered approximately $328 million in liquidated short positions . This suggests that there were a lot of traders who were caught off guard by the altcoin’s price jump. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7, and introduced key enhancements to Ethereum. Some of these changes include improved wallet functionality, higher staking limits, and better scalability. While some, like trader Alex Kruger , credited the pump to a wave of new long positions, others pointed to a broader confluence of bullish factors. These include US President Donald Trump’s trade deal with the United Kingdom, which reduced tariffs on British imports, and Coinbase’s $2.9 billion acquisition of derivatives exchange Deribit. Nick Forster , founder of the on-chain protocol Derive, believes that these macro developments also played a role in lifting market sentiment. Despite the strong rally, Ethreum’s momentum still has to translate into gains for spot Ether ETFs, which recorded $16.1 million in outflows on May 8. This was their third consecutive day of net losses . Historically, Ethereum posted an average return of 62.2% in the second quarter since 2013, which could put it on track for a price near $2,950 by the end of June if the trend holds. The broader crypto market also experienced a boost, with the total cap rising by almost 5% in the past 24 hours of trading. Bitcoin was also able to reclaim the $100,000 mark for the first time in over three months. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) The renewed bullish sentiment pushed the Crypto Fear & Greed Index deeper into “Greed” territory, now sitting at a score of 73. Vitalik Buterin Pushes for a Simpler Ethereum Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently proposed a major simplification of Ethereum’s base protocol to enhance the network’s efficiency, security, and accessibility. In a blog post titled “Simplifying the L1,” Buterin argued that Ethereum’s long-term scalability and resilience depend on reducing its technical complexity. Part of Buterin’s blog post By drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s minimalist approach , he laid out a roadmap to make Ethereum’s architecture a lot more streamlined across its consensus, execution, and shared protocol components. He acknowledged that Ethereum’s recent technical achievements, like the transition to proof-of-stake and zk-SNARK integrations, have made the network more powerful, but also more bloated and prone to risks and inefficiencies. A major part of Buterin’s vision is the adoption of a “3-slot finality” model to replace Ethereum’s current consensus mechanisms. This change will eliminate complex elements like epochs, sync committees, and validator shuffling, and pave the way for simpler implementations of fork choice rules. He also advocated using STARK-based aggregation protocols to simplify network coordination while also increasing decentralization. On the execution layer, Buterin proposed replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with a simpler, zero-knowledge-friendly virtual machine based on RISC-V architecture. This change could bring huge performance gains—potentially up to 100x for zero-knowledge proofs—while easing protocol implementation. To make sure there is a smooth transition, Buterin suggested running existing EVM contracts via a RISC-V interpreter during a transitional phase, allowing both systems to operate concurrently. In addition to technical changes, Buterin called for standardized protocol-wide design choices. He recommended adopting a single erasure coding method, a unified serialization format (preferably SSZ), and a common tree structure to reduce redundancy and complexity across Ethereum’s tooling and infrastructure. He compared simplicity to decentralization and floated the idea of enforcing a maximum line-of-code count for consensus-critical logic to keep the core protocol lean, auditable, and robust. This call for simplification happened at a time when Ethereum is losing ground to competing layer-1 blockchains. While Ethereum was once seen as the inevitable leader in the crypto space, newer platforms with more efficient architectures are challenging that assumption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-09 13:25:28

Speaking at a national finance conference on May 9, Ko suggested allocating a small portion of the country’s reserve assets to Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a hedge against rising global economic uncertainty and regional geopolitical risks. Ko pointed to Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, fixed supply, and growing role as a hedge in various countries as reasons to integrate it into Taiwan’s sovereign asset strategy. He highlighted Taiwan’s reliance on exports and the associated volatility in the New Taiwan dollar as further justification for broadening the reserve mix. You might also like: CryptoQuant CEO admits he was wrong about Bitcoin bull cycle Bitcoin as a crisis reserve The lawmaker also referenced the country’s vulnerability in a potential crisis scenario, suggesting that Bitcoin could serve as an uncorrelated asset that maintains liquidity and avoids seizure risk during geopolitical tensions. He previously indicated on X that Taiwan could allocate up to 5% of its reserves—about $50 billion—to Bitcoin, though he framed this as part of a diversified approach rather than a full pivot. While Ko acknowledged Bitcoin is not a singular solution to Taiwan’s financial challenges, he emphasized the need to expand the nation’s toolkit for economic resilience. The proposal arrives as Taiwan moves toward more crypto-friendly regulation . The Financial Supervisory Commission is expected to roll out institutional crypto custody trials later this year. In contrast, mainland China continues to enforce a blanket ban on most crypto-related activities. Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission released a draft of the “Virtual Asset Service Act” on March 25 to regulate crypto businesses and protect investors. The draft included licensing requirements for VASPs, standards for stablecoin issuance by banks, and enforcement measures. A 60-day public consultation period was launched, with the law expected to be submitted to the Executive Yuan by June 30. Ko’s call positions Taiwan among a small but growing group of jurisdictions exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Though no formal policy has been introduced, his advocacy signals rising interest in digital assets within Taiwan’s financial planning discussions.

At this point, Taiwanese lawmakers called for Bitcoin to be added to national reserves. Taiwanese lawmaker Ko Ju-Chun has called on the government to add Bitcoin as a reserve alongside gold and foreign currencies as part of a diversified reserve strategy. According to Wu Blockchain’s X, BTC’s hedging capabilities could help increase the resilience and flexibility of Taiwan’s financial system. In his speech at the National Conference, Ko touched on Bitcoin's potential as a hedge against global economic risks, stating that Taiwan should recognize Bitcoin alongside its gold and foreign exchange reserves to increase its financial resilience. Ko noted that Taiwan has an export-oriented economy and that there have been significant fluctuations in their national currency, the New Taiwan dollar, due to global inflation and increasing geopolitical risks. “We currently have 423 tons of gold reserves and our foreign exchange reserves, including investments in US Treasury bonds, amount to $577 billion. I think Bitcoin should also be added to Taiwan's reserves, as it is very likely that Taiwan will not be able to provide security and liquidity in a scenario of more intense currency volatility or potential regional conflict. “In addition, Bitcoin has been around for over 15 years. It has a fixed total supply, is decentralized, and is censorship-resistant. For these reasons, I believe Bitcoin is a great fit for Taiwan.” *This is not investment advice.

44377376,https://invezz.com/?p=2712359,1746797208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"XRP steady at $2, but investors flock to MUTM for its yield-backed ecosystem",https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/09/xrp-steady-at-2-but-investors-flock-to-mutm-for-its-yield-backed-ecosystem/,"XRP has found stability near the $2 level following its recent decline, indicating a short-term slowdown in selling activity. While the token has held its support level for now, investors are showing signs of shifting capital into newer projects offering clearer utility and stronger upside potential. One project that’s capturing that inflow is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a rising DeFi protocol that’s still in presale but quickly building traction among those looking to generate yield without sacrificing long-term exposure. In a market that’s becoming increasingly selective, capital is no longer just chasing names with history — it’s flowing into cryptocurrency ecosystems with built-in functionality and tangible reward systems. MUTM fits that narrative and is gaining attention for all the right reasons. Ripple (XRP) XRP’s recent price stability around the $2 level reflects a temporary balance between buyers and sellers. Large wallet addresses have stopped aggressive selling, and on-chain activity has leveled out. However, analysts remain cautious. While support has held for now, upside momentum remains limited, and most of the current volume is driven by short-term traders, not long-term accumulation. This hesitancy is pushing many investors to reevaluate where they allocate capital next. With interest in passive yield and structured returns on the rise, a growing number of portfolios are looking outside the top-10 coins — toward projects like Mutuum Finance that offer functionality from day one. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t relying on speculation or price cycles to gain attention. Its appeal lies in its yield-backed ecosystem, which connects platform usage with real returns. Rather than inflating its token supply or issuing rewards out of reserves, the protocol uses fees generated from lending activity to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to users who participate in the protocol by holding mtTokens — a tokenized representation of their deposits. This feedback-driven system directly connects the protocol’s growth with the rewards received by tokenholders. It rewards real engagement, rather than passive holding, and that’s proving to be a major draw for long-term investors who are tired of short-term pumps that fade just as quickly. At its current price of $0.025, MUTM is being recognized as one of the best crypto investment opportunities of 2025. The token is set to launch at $0.06, and with the fourth presale phase nearing completion, the next price bump to $0.03 is approaching fast. For those getting in now, the value proposition is clear: lock in over 140% in potential gains before the token even hits public exchanges. Mutuum has already raised more than $7.7 million and attracted a base of over 9,500 holders, all before launching. That kind of early momentum — especially in a market where attention is hard to earn — says a lot about the credibility the project is building. While XRP continues to consolidate, many investors are already shifting their focus to where the next wave of value will be created. Mutuum Finance stands out in this rotation — not just because of its pricing or presale performance, but because of the system it’s building. With its buy-and-redistribute model, planned beta rollout, and increasing visibility, MUTM is gaining momentum at a stage where early involvement still offers significant upside. It’s not just a token — it’s a functional DeFi platform that’s tying its success to user participation, making it a compelling choice for those asking what crypto to invest in next. As investors increasingly prioritize real utility over sheer market cap, MUTM is meeting key criteria — and early capital is already starting to flow in.

Instead, real-world use cases like student loans backed by DeFi may be crypto’s most convincing value proposition to date. DeFi student loans On April 30th, Pencil Finance, a project supported by Animoca Brands and its education arm Open Campus, announced a $10 million student loan financing initiative aimed at providing cheaper, blockchain-backed loans. Siu believes this type of infrastructure investment goes further than symbolic funding. “What our industry needs a lot more is these kinds of positive-sum use cases that everyone else understands,” Siu said in the interview. “If students can receive better, cheaper and more effective opportunities and interest rates through crypto student loans, what happens? They’re going to be more pro-crypto.” Related: The Giving Block starts disaster fund for California wildfire victims Unlike a one-time donation, the Pencil Finance model integrates crypto directly into the financing mechanism—leveraging blockchain rails to make lending more transparent, efficient, and accessible. “While money has influence, it doesn’t necessarily change the system for the better per se. The technology… actually provides a way we can onboard people into that.” Crypto in the classroom Siu said the crypto industry still suffers from a perception problem, especially among those unfamiliar with financial tools or blockchain-native culture. That’s why educational use cases need to move beyond highbrow NFT art or meme coins and offer something universally relatable. “When you’re sitting at the table and someone’s saying, ‘What is crypto really good for?’—what do we say?” he asked. “Memecoins? Or do we say student loans? That’s something everyone understands.” Siu also emphasized the long-term impact of onboarding students early—both for growing crypto literacy and building a foundation for adoption. “You want to onboard them at the earliest levels and let them understand what’s going on,” he said. “That’s what Apple did with education discounts. It wasn’t about profit at first—it was about future influence.” Ripple’s donation may be a step forward for awareness and much-needed funding support in the education sector, but Animoca’s approach aims to make crypto indispensable, not just visible, in education systems around the world. “We have to show what [crypto] is good for. We’ve got to start from the grassroots.” Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page , Apple Podcasts or Spotify .

Following its exit from the Diem project in early 2022, Meta is reportedly holding early-stage talks with crypto infrastructure firms to explore stablecoin applications across its platforms. Rekindling Its Digital Currency Ambitions Originally launched as Libra in 2019 and later rebranded as Diem, Meta’s first major crypto initiative aimed to create a global stablecoin. However, it was shelved in January 2022 amid intense regulatory scrutiny. Now, under new leadership, Meta appears ready to re-enter the space. Ginger Baker, a fintech veteran and former Plaid executive, has been appointed as Vice President of Product. Baker also sits on the board of the Stellar Development Foundation, giving her strong credentials to lead Meta’s new stablecoin push. A Focus on Cross-Border Efficiency Sources indicate that Meta’s renewed interest is centered on enabling cross-border payments using stablecoins as a faster, cheaper alternative to wire transfers. The company sees stablecoins as a viable tool to reduce transaction fees, particularly for small payments across international borders. An executive from a crypto infrastructure provider said Instagram could be one of the early adopters, using stablecoins to compensate creators in different regions. This would allow Meta to cut down on fees for transactions as low as $100. Booming Stablecoin Market Provides Tailwind The timing of Meta’s move coincides with significant growth in the stablecoin sector. According to DeFiLlama data, the total stablecoin market cap has doubled to $245 billion over the past year. Tether (USDT) remains the dominant player with a market cap of approximately $150 billion. Meanwhile, USD Coin (USDC) has also expanded, growing from $33 billion to around $60 billion, according to CoinGecko. This market expansion suggests an increasing appetite for blockchain-based payment solutions, adding momentum to Meta’s plans. Regulatory Winds Still Blowing Despite favorable market conditions, the regulatory environment remains fluid. The GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at creating a legal framework for stablecoins, failed to pass in the Senate earlier today. However, Senator John Thune has announced plans to file a motion next week to reconsider the bill. This continued legislative activity highlights the growing importance of stablecoin regulation and may influence how quickly Meta can bring its vision to market. While Meta’s efforts are still in the exploratory phase, the company appears poised to reassert itself in the digital finance space—this time, with a sharper focus and potentially broader support.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-09 13:34:21

BTC shattered the $100,000 barrier after President Trump announced a comprehensive trade deal between the US and the UK. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, trading around $102,708 after reaching an intraday high of $103,756. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) surged past $2,000, registering a staggering jump of nearly 17% and moving to its current level of $2,217. Ripple (XRP) also broke out of its trading range, registering an increase of over 5% to $2.29. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) surged past $155 and $160, rising over 8% in the past 25 hours and settling at $162. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) also registered significant price increases. Crypto Market Rallies The crypto market cap surged as Bitcoin (BTC) shattered the $100,000 resistance and moved to its current level of $102,993. BTC breached this level after spending weeks in a narrow trading range between $90,000 and $96,000. The crypto market’s rally comes amid significant developments, as President Donald Trump announced a major trade deal with the UK. The deal signaled a potential de-escalation of global trade tensions, improving market sentiment and investor risk appetite. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s trip to Switzerland to meet with officials from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce has sparked further optimism. Bessent stated during an interaction with press officials, “The current tariffs and trade barriers are unsustainable, but we don't want to decouple.” BTC’s rally led to significant losses for bearish traders, who paid heavily for their bets against Bitcoin. According to Coinglass data, over $118 million in short positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours. US Senate Votes Against GENIUS Act The United States Senate voted against advancing the GENIUS Act after last-minute pushback from Senate Democrats derailed momentum. The bill's rejection is viewed as a substantial setback for the crypto industry’s push for regulatory clarity. The setback comes after months of bipartisan negotiations and a win in the Senate Banking Committee. Lawmakers raised concerns about insufficient safeguards against illicit finance and foreign stablecoin issuers. Senate Democrats also highlighted President Trump’s crypto dealings, including his meme coins and fundraising dinners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized the vote, stating, “For stablecoins and other digital assets to thrive globally, the world needs American leadership. The Senate missed an opportunity to provide that leadership today by failing to advance the GENIUS Act. This bill represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to expand dollar dominance and US influence in financial innovation. Without it, stablecoins will be subject to a patchwork of state regulations instead of a streamlined federal framework that is more conducive to growth and competitiveness.” The procedural vote ended 48-49, falling short of the 60 votes needed to begin a formal debate. Bitwise Announces Partnership with Icapital Crypto asset manager Bitwise Asset Management has announced a new partnership with fintech investment platform Icapital to expand access to institutional-grade crypto investment opportunities. The collaboration adds Bitwise’s suite of actively managed crypto strategies to the Icapital Marketplace. Speaking about the partnership, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horseley stated, “Crypto is rapidly emerging as a new alternative asset class, with unique drivers that can make it a compelling diversifier in portfolios for investment professionals.” The integration of Bitwise’s crypto strategies allows Icapital users to access crypto strategies to harness opportunities for alpha in digital asset markets. iCapital noted in a briefing, “Users of Icapital Marketplace are now able to access Bitwise’s active crypto strategies that seek to capitalize on the alpha opportunities in the crypto space.” Bitwise’s offerings include a multi-strategy framework encompassing non-directional, tactically directional, long bias, and special situation approaches. Each offering delivers optimized, risk-adjusted returns with a low correlation to conventional assets. The strategies are managed by a team with expertise in portfolio management, derivatives, and crypto market risk analysis. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) shattered the $100,000 barrier after a stunning Thursday rally, which saw the price surge to an intraday high of $103,963. The flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $100,000 for the first time since February. BTC lost momentum in February after President Trump introduced trade tariffs. The latest rally sets the stage for BTC to retest its all-time high and potentially move beyond it. The primary reason behind the rally was the announcement of a comprehensive trade deal between the US and the UK. The breakthrough deal is the first since Trump triggered a draining trade war, imposing tariffs on long-time trade partners, including Mexico, Canada, and China. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset trading platform Nexo, stated, “The retaking of $100,000 must go down as one of Bitcoin’s more formidable feats and is a reminder that buying peak fear – just last month bitcoin was languishing around $74,000 – can be exceptionally lucrative. The speed of the rebound to $100,000 amid a resumption of risk appetite sends a signal that $109,000 and above are in its sights, as buying from long-term holders — those holding for at least 155 days — more than offsets selling by short-term holders.” Institutional investors are bullish about BTC’s prospects, with Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick stating he believes the flagship cryptocurrency could reach $120,00 by the end of the second quarter. Standard Chartered’s long-term outlook suggests BTC could reach $500,000 by 2028. Meanwhile, VanEck predicts BTC could peak at $180,000 in 2025 and anticipates a surge past $400,000 in the next bull cycle. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, stated, “Bitcoin's surge to $100K is primarily macro-driven, fueled by expectations of Fed rate cuts and Trump's vocal push for lower interest rates, which bolsters risk assets. However, the Fed's focus on unemployment and inflation creates uncertainty around actual rate cuts, with Trump's influence adding political but not definitive weight. Strong institutional inflows, ETF demand, and whale accumulation provide solid support for a sustained move higher.” Let’s look at BTC’s price action. BTC dropped to an intraday low of $92,948 on Wednesday (April 30) before settling at $94,155. However, it recovered on Thursday, rising 2.45% to surge past $96,000 and settle at $96,458. The price surged to an intraday high of $98,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $96,939, ultimately registering an increase of 0.50%. BTC lost momentum over the weekend as selling pressure returned. As a result, BTC fell 0.98% on Saturday and 1.66% on Sunday, slipping below $95,000 and settling at $94,390. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in positive territory, rising 0.41% to $94,773. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as markets rallied, driving the price up over 2% to $96,845. BTC registered a marginal increase Wednesday to claim $97,000 and settle at $97,013. BTC and the crypto markets rallied Thursday after President Trump announced a comprehensive trade deal with the UK. The flagship cryptocurrency surged over 6%, shattering the $100,000 mark, and settled at $103,096, but not before reaching an intraday high of $103,963. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers look to force a move past $105,000. However, BTC faces selling pressure and profit-taking, leading to waning momentum. If buyers can regain momentum, a push toward $109,000 could occur. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has registered a stunning rally over the past two sessions, buoyed by the Pectra upgrade and the US-UK trade deal. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency surged past the $1,860 resistance on Thursday after trading in a narrow range since April 24. ETH’s Thursday rally allowed it to shatter the $2,000 level, continue its trajectory, and cross $2,000. The Pectra upgrade has also rekindled institutional interest in ETH. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation has allocated over $32 million in grants to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem. ETH’s 22% jump is the biggest single-day increase since May 2021. Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto Research, stated, “The recent Pectra upgrade has regained confidence in Ethereum. ETH/BTC is down by almost 40% this year, so it’s not a wonder that buyers are coming in at these levels.” The Pectra upgrade went live on Thursday, improving staking efficiency, validator operations, and scalability for Layer2 solutions. ETH’s recent surge is also driven by general market optimism thanks to US-China trade talks and the US-UK trade deal, which has boosted market sentiment. “Investors are altering their perception on crypto as altcoins are gaining buying momentum.” As seen in the price chart, ETH had been struggling to build momentum, having been pinned below $1,860. The price registered a notable increase on Thursday (May 1), rising 2.42% to $1,838. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH could only register a marginal rise on Friday before selling pressure overwhelmed buyers over the weekend. As a result, ETH dropped 0.40% on Saturday and 1.34% on Sunday to settle at $1,810. Source: TradingView ETH started the current week positively, rising 0.58% to $1,820. Despite the positive start, ETH lost momentum on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $1,816. Price action remained bearish on Wednesday as ETH dropped 0.26% to $1,812. However, price action turned bullish as markets rallied thanks to the US-UK trade deal. As a result, ETG soared almost 22%, surging past $2,000 and settling at $2,206. ETH extended its gains during the ongoing session, surging to an intraday high of $2,490. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level thanks to buyer exhaustion, and the price fell to its current level of $2,345. Analysts believe if ETH can stay above $2,200, it could build momentum and push toward $2,500. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) surged past the resistance at $155 on Thursday as the crypto market came to life following the announcement of a trade deal between the US and the UK. The altcoin surged over 11% on Thursday, crossing $160 and settling at $164, and has extended gains during the ongoing session as buyers eye a push toward $200. However, it is experiencing volatility during the ongoing session thanks to selling pressure and profit-taking. SOL’s price action was relatively muted as it struggled to surpass $155. It registered a notable increase on Thursday (May 1) to settle at $150. However, it lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.88%, slipping below $150 and settling at $148. Price action remained bearish over the weekend, and SOL dropped 0.83% on Saturday to settle at $146. The price declined on Sunday, falling nearly 2% to $144. Source: TradingView SOL recovered on Monday thanks to lower-level support. As a result, it rebounded almost 2% to $146. The price fell to an intraday low of $141 as selling pressure intensified. However, SOL rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase. Price action remained positive on Wednesday as SOL rose 0.35% to $147. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as markets rallied, with SOL surging nearly 12% to cross $160 and settle at $164. The current session sees SOL up over 2% and trading at $168 as buyers look to push the price higher. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA) registered a substantial decline on Wednesday (April 30) as sellers attempted to drive the price below the 20-day SMA. However, it rebounded from this level on Thursday, rising over 3% to cross $0.70 and settling at $0.704. The price pushed higher on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $0.726. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell 0.85%, ultimately settling at $0.698. The price raced to an intraday high of $0.730 on Saturday but lost momentum again, ultimately settling at $0.70 after a marginal increase. Price action turned bearish on Sunday as ADA dropped over 3% to end the weekend at $0.677. Source: TradingView ADA continued to decline on Monday, falling over 2%, slipping below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $0.663. The price plummeted to an intraday low of $0.678 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, ADA rebounded from this level to cross the moving averages and settle at $0.678, ultimately registering an increase of 2.26%. Price action turned bearish on Wednesday as ADA fell almost 1%, slipping below the 20-day SMA to $0.672. ADA surged on Thursday as markets rallied, soaring over 14% to $0.769.

44377377,https://invezz.com/?p=2712318,1746797703,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,This undervalued DeFi crypto is gaining traction as the best cheap crypto to buy now,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/09/this-undervalued-defi-crypto-is-gaining-traction-as-the-best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-now/,"In a market where thousands of tokens compete for attention, only a few quietly make their way onto serious investor watchlists before the broader crowd catches on. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to follow that exact path. With a presale price still sitting at $0.025, this DeFi token is becoming a standout among those searching for the best cheap crypto to buy now — not because it’s trending, but because it’s structured to grow with real utility behind it. It hasn’t yet saturated social feeds or news headlines, but that’s often how strong entries start. Long before momentum takes over, the early signs come in the form of rising holder numbers, capital inflows, and deeper conversations within strategy-driven circles. That’s exactly what’s happening with MUTM right now — and the window to act at the current price is starting to narrow. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s presale has already attracted more than 9,500 participants and brought in upwards of $7.7 million in initial capital. That kind of traction doesn’t happen by accident — it signals confidence from participants who are watching beyond surface-level marketing and looking at how the project is built. The token is currently in its fourth presale phase, with this pricing stage now approaching its final stretch. Once this round wraps, the price jumps to $0.03, marking a clear line between those who moved early and those who waited. That in itself is creating a quiet but increasing sense of urgency among potential investors. For anyone evaluating what crypto to invest in, timing matters — especially when the next price increase is confirmed and fast approaching. Buying before a 20% jump gives early supporters a head start that simply won’t be available once the phase ends. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as more than just another token launch, focusing instead on building a utility-driven ecosystem from the start. The team has been deliberate in designing a system that aligns long-term participation with actual financial mechanics. The protocol’s core offering allows users to access capital without needing to sell off their existing digital assets — a lending mechanism that serves everyone from cautious holders to active traders. This model is drawing the kind of attention that lasts. It creates a use case tied to real needs in the crypto space, especially for those looking to make their assets work harder without overexposing themselves. That blend of practicality and flexibility is part of why MUTM is being added to watchlists by investors thinking beyond the next market cycle. A major reason this token is turning heads is simple: upside. At the current $0.025 price, the entry is affordable — but it’s not just the low number that stands out. It’s what comes next. The launch price is already confirmed at $0.06, but even more conservative projections suggest that if Mutuum delivers as expected and listings follow, the growth curve could extend much further. Take a $1,900 entry at today’s presale price of $0.025 — when MUTM reaches $1 down the line, that same amount could potentially return over 30 times the original investment. It’s this kind of risk-reward profile, grounded in real use rather than hype, that’s drawing in early buyers ahead of the next price jump. Unlike tokens that spike overnight and fade just as quickly, MUTM is quietly gaining ground through fundamentals. It’s combining sustainable economics, early-stage pricing, and an active presale structure that rewards participation before listings. These are signals that often precede breakouts — and they’re why experienced buyers are already positioning themselves. In a space full of distractions, Mutuum Finance is carving a path built on simplicity and value. And for now, it’s still early enough to act before the crowd. If you’ve been holding off and waiting for a strong entry point into a promising crypto investment, MUTM’s presale is offering exactly that — but not for long.

Over the past 24 hours, SHIB has jumped by more than 15%, catching the attention of traders across the market. While Bitcoin and other altcoins are also on the rise, SHIB’s strong move is pushing it 60% price rally. SHIB Forms Bullish Cup & Handle Currently, Shiba Inu price is trading around $0.0000152 , reflecting a jump of more than 15% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, a Psydunuemus Crypto analyst sees SHIB forming a Cup & Handle Pattern seen in the weekly chart, a bullish chart setup often seen before major breakouts. So far, SHIB has successfully bounced from its key support zone around $0.00001148, which has acted as a strong foundation for this bullish structure. Now, the price is approaching the top of the “cup” near $0.00001500, a key area to watch for a breakout. The analyst pointed out that SHIB could reach $0.00002215 soon, and if that happens, it would mean a 60% jump from where it is now. Meanwhile, if the rally picks up speed, it might climb to $0.00002724 within a month. And if the bullish trend continues over time, it could even go as high as $0.00003298 in the long run. Short Sellers Take a Hit While SHIB moves up, traders betting against it are feeling the pressure. In just one day, nearly $2.2 million worth of shib were liquidated, while the largest losses came from short sellers who faced $1.8 million in liquidation. That means many traders who thought SHIB would fall have been forced to close their positions at a loss. Interestingly, Open interest, or the number of active contracts in SHIB, has also jumped over 25%, showing growing interest and confidence among bullish traders. But if SHIB buyers stay strong, the meme coin could smash through this barrier.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 13:43:50

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.842884. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.37 with an average trading price of $1.32. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Dogecoin Token DOGE Price $ 0.207 Market Cap $30.73B Trading Volume $2.84B Circulating Supply 149.19B DOGE All-time High $0.7376 May 07, 2021 All-time Low $0.00008547 May 07, 2015 24-hour High $0.2126 24-hour Low $0.183 Dogecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 6.26% 50-Day SMA 0.173389 14-Day RSI 67.13 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA 0.222533 Dogecoin price analysis: DOGE price jumped toward $0.2145 amid rising buying demand TL;DR Breakdown : Dogecoin price analysis confirmed a strong surge toward $0.2145 before retracing slightly. Cryptocurrency gains 13.19% of its value. DOGE coin prices seek support around $0.199. On May 9, 2025, Dogecoin price analysis revealed a strong bullish pattern for the meme coin. The meme coin value has spiked up to $0.2145 high in the past 24 hours. Overall, the currency has received a major 13.19% boost in the day. The bulls have been securing the lead since yesterday, which has resulted in a considerable ascent. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin confirmed an upward trend in the market. DOGE/USD value has stepped up to a $0.2145 high over the last 24 hours. However, it retraced slightly following minor selloff from short-term holders . The long green candles on the price chart suggest rising bullish domination around each Fib level. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening, leading to a rising volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the immediate support, has shifted to $0.199. Whereby its lower limit, serving as additional support, has moved to $0.155. DOGE/USD shows increasing volatility The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has entered the overbought area. The indicator’s value has launched up to index 71.08 in the day. This overbought condition might pave the way for a correction below $0.2 to cool down the current sentiment. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price analysis of Dogecoin referred to an increasing volatility. The meme coin price is struggling to surge above $0.2145, suggesting that bears are active there. However, buyers are aiming for the continuation of the bullish rally by inducing more volatility. A rise in volatility might also strengthen the comeback for bears. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart The Bollinger bands are widening, opening room for both buyers and sellers to intensify their domination. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.205, defining the immediate support. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.1548, marking yet another support. The RSI indicator is hovering within the overbought area. The indicator’s value has hiked up to index 79.60 in the last four hours. This might trigger a price reversal around the EMA20 trend line. Dogecoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 0.17126 BUY SMA 5 0.176684 BUY SMA 10 0.17696 BUY SMA 21 0.175173 BUY SMA 50 0.173389 BUY SMA 100 0.202233 BUY SMA 200 0.222533 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 0.16995 BUY EMA 5 0.166678 BUY EMA 10 0.165674 BUY EMA 21 0.169849 BUY EMA 50 0.192595 BUY EMA 100 0.224176 SELL EMA 200 0.230596 SELL What can you expect from the DOGE price analysis next? Dogecoin price analysis gives out a strong bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The meme coin value has increased up to $0.2145 in the past 24 hours. If buyers hold the current momentum, we might see further surge in the DOGE price chart toward $0.24. On the other hand, a rejection around immediate resistance line might give sellers an advantage. In such a case, the price of Dogecoin might decline toward the support below $0.2. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.491 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.207 over the last 24 hours. DOGE has managed to overcome the strong resistance at the $0.1995 mark. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.263401 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2029. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,849.48 DOGE in May; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.414 on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.37 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin Nasdaq has applied for U.S. SEC approval for listing the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. 21Shares has previously formed a partnership with the House of Doge to launch Dogecoin ETP in Europe, which has yielded a 17.74% YTD return and $1.6 million in assets under management.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142.

With its unique format, concept, and scale, this tournament elevates crypto trading competitions to a whole new level. The founder and president of WhiteBIT Group, Volodymyr Nosov, shared his thoughts on what makes the championship stand out, its educational mission, and the opportunities for participants. ""We set ourselves an ambitious goal — to set a new standard in the world of trading and hold the first-ever live-stream trading championship. Our ICTC is the first international tournament where world-class traders will compete. Along with them, fully-formed squads of 25 participants and individual traders will also take part online. Everyone will have the chance to follow the traders' decisions in real time, observe their reactions, analyze strategies, and join the conversation via a general chat — asking questions, sharing insights, and engaging in live discussions,” comments Volodymyr Nosov. From the beginning, ICTC has been rooted in education. The championship kicked off with a qualifying stage, allowing participants to compete for a chance to become the eighth trader on the main stage. ""Anyone interested had the opportunity to test their skills, gain unique experience, and learn something new even before the main competition stage,"" added WhiteBIT Group President, Volodymyr Nosov. He also emphasized the tournament’s focus on professionalism, fairness, and transparency. ""We’ve ensured continuous financial monitoring to track the traders' actions in real-time: their screens, open positions, and market activities. After trades are completed, all transactions undergo mandatory validation to ensure compliance with the tournament’s rules and conditions,"" Nosov noted. According to the rules, traders on the main stage will each start with a balance of 50,000 USDTB — an internal asset for futures trading on WhiteBIT. They will compete in the futures market, and the winner who demonstrates the most effective strategy during the tournament will receive all accumulated profits from the trades of the participants. Nosov is confident that crypto trading tournaments can evolve into global-scale events, comparable to eSports championships. ""Crypto trading has all the necessary components for a spectacular format: strategy, emotions, and strong personalities with extraordinary stories. It has huge potential. These competitions can soon reach a level where traders become public figures, followed by millions who learn from them and support them as true stars,"" he added.

He said that a continuation of this trend was the most likely outcome: “The trend of institutional buying was likely to continue on May 8-9, unless there were sharp macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks.” Related: Bitcoin options could pave the path for new BTC price highs — Here is how Grayscale Bitcoin Trust plays by different rules Obchakevich explained that “the absence of significant outflows in key ETFs other than Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) supports the hypothesis that the whales and funds remain bullish.” GBTC outflows, he said, are justified by different factors. Obchakevich said GBTC outflows “are of particular importance because it is the largest Bitcoin ETF, and its high fees ~1.5% are driving investors to switch to cheaper alternatives, which affects the price of Bitcoin and market dynamics.” According to the analyst, GBTC outflows are caused by “a combination of factors starting with tariffs, the political crisis, and the conflict between Pakistan and India.” He added: “The GBTC outflow is related to these factors as investors are not confident in the stability of GBTC.“ Magazine: Adam Back says Bitcoin price cycle ’10x bigger’ but will still decisively break above $100K",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-09 13:46:23

Despite an increase in overall crypto market activity, Ethereum's value has dropped by 42% since the start of the year, leaving many investors concerned about its future trajectory. This month, Ethereum launched its highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, hoping to reignite growth by improving speed, scalability, and user-friendliness. Yet, questions linger about whether it will be enough to restore Ethereum’s former glory, especially considering the rising competition from other blockchain platforms like Coldware (COLD) . Coldware: A New Challenger on the Horizon While Ethereum faces an uphill battle, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a significant player in the blockchain space, particularly in the growing sectors of decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Unlike Ethereum, which has yet to fully resolve scalability and transaction cost issues, Coldware (COLD) has built its infrastructure with a focus on speed and stability, making it an attractive option for both institutional investors and the retail market. Coldware’s mobile reveal, scheduled for the near future, is expected to expand its appeal significantly. The project’s mobile platform will allow users to engage in RWA tokenization seamlessly, opening doors for traditional financial institutions to enter the decentralized space without the barriers currently presented by Ethereum's more complex setup. Additionally, Coldware's approach to decentralization and its increasing momentum on Tier 1 exchanges have generated significant interest, positioning it for considerable growth in 2025. Ethereum's Struggles Amidst Market Pressure Despite Ethereum's recent technological strides, including the Merge in 2022, its market performance has not lived up to expectations. The Pectra upgrade, which launched earlier this month, brings substantial changes aimed at enhancing the blockchain’s performance. Specifically, Ethereum's upgrade includes raising the staking cap for validators from 32 to 2,048 ETH , which could greatly benefit institutional investors. Additionally, transaction fees are set to decrease, and payments can now be made using stablecoins like USDT. However, even with these technical advancements, Ethereum's price struggles persist. The blockchain continues to face stiff competition, particularly from faster, cheaper alternatives such as Solana and Coldware (COLD) . Ethereum’s current problems lie in its inability to keep up with newer blockchains, both in terms of speed and cost efficiency. As Ethereum works to address these issues, it remains unclear whether Pectra will have the desired effect in restoring investor confidence. Security Concerns Around Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade While the technical improvements provided by Pectra are designed to streamline Ethereum’s operations, they also introduce new security concerns. As the staking mechanism evolves, there are concerns regarding vulnerabilities that could be exploited. The SEC’s regulatory stance on staking, for instance, could also affect Ethereum’s market growth, as the agency considers allowing or rejecting specialized staking ETFs. Coldware, on the other hand, is working on ensuring that its decentralized finance platform can offer robust security while catering to institutional needs. By integrating features that bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-based asset management, Coldware has earned a reputation as a more secure and scalable option for investors seeking stability in a volatile market. The Future of Ethereum and Coldware In the face of Ethereum's current struggles, Coldware (COLD) has emerged as a strong contender for the attention of institutional investors and those seeking exposure to both DeFi and RWA tokenization. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade could indeed improve its network, but whether it can recover to its former heights remains uncertain. The market will be watching closely to see if Ethereum’s technical changes can outpace the innovations brought forward by projects like Coldware. As Ethereum works to solve its scalability and transaction fee issues, Coldware is advancing rapidly, with its unique approach to tokenizing real-world assets and improving decentralized finance transactions. Coldware’s upcoming mobile platform reveal could further accelerate its position in the market, making it one of the top players to watch in 2025.

With negative funding rates and plunging open interest—down from $7.87 billion to $3.06 billion since January—traders are losing confidence in its short-term potential. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance (RXS) , an ERC-20 token priced at $0.20, is drawing attention from major investors. Over $48 million has been raised in its presale, with 92% of allocated tokens sold. One whale transaction shows $150,000 (750,000 RXS) moved to a private wallet, signaling institutional interest. While XRP battles bearish signals, RXS is positioning itself as a gateway to tokenized real-world assets—a market projected to hit $16 trillion by 2030. XRP’s Uncertain Path Forward XRP’s inability to hold above $2.20 has exposed its vulnerability. Perpetual futures contracts show negative funding rates, a sign traders are betting against its recovery. Open interest—the total value of active trades—has collapsed by 61% since January, reflecting dwindling market participation. Technical indicators paint a grim picture: XRP trades below key moving averages, and a drop below $1.86 could trigger a slide toward $1.07. Even its 21.5% surge on April 9 faltered at the $2.20 ceiling, reinforcing skepticism. Without a surge in buyer momentum, XRP risks stagnation while newer projects like Rexas Finance seize the spotlight. Rexas Finance Bridging Real-World Assets and Blockchain Rexas Finance is transforming how global investors interact with tangible assets like real estate, gold, and commodities. By converting these assets into blockchain tokens, RXS removes geographic and financial barriers. A farmer in Nigeria can now own a fraction of a Tokyo apartment, earning passive rental income through RXS tokens. This shift democratizes access to markets previously reserved for the wealthy, unlocking trillions in untapped value. Rexas Finance’s platform lets users mint tokens tied to real-world assets in minutes. Whether fractionalizing a commercial property or tokenizing rare art, the process is streamlined through tools like the Quickmint Bot and AI Shield. The Launchpad feature enables projects to raise capital directly from the community, bypassing traditional gatekeepers. Already, $41 million has been secured across 11 sold-out presale stages, with the final stage priced at $0.20—a 6.6x jump from its initial $0.03 offering. Every RXS smart contract has passed a CertiK audit, ensuring robust security against exploits. This validation, combined with listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, amplifies credibility. Rexas Finance prioritizes accessibility: its interface allows anyone to tokenize assets or invest using minimal crypto experience. With plans to launch on three top-tier exchanges post-presale, RXS is poised for broader adoption. Presale Momentum Fueling Market Optimism The RXS presale has attracted over $48 million, with 92% of the 500 million allocated tokens claimed. Early buyers have watched the price climb from $0.03 to $0.20, with a confirmed listing price of $0.25 in 2025—a 25% jump from current levels. Analysts project a 50x surge post-launch, driven by real-world utility and a $1 million giveaway campaign offering 20 winners $50,000 each. Unlike XRP, which relies on speculative trading, RXS ties its value to tangible asset growth, offering stability in a volatile crypto market. While XRP grapples with fading trader interest, Rexas Finance is building infrastructure for lasting impact. Its presale success, CertiK-backed security, and real-world applications create a compelling case for exponential growth. With the final presale stage open and exchange listings imminent, RXS represents a rare opportunity to invest in blockchain’s next evolution—before it reaches mainstream adoption. Act Now or Miss the Ground Floor Rexas Finance’s presale closes once the remaining 8% of tokens sell out. For those seeking assets with real-world utility and 50x potential, RXS offers a strategic entry point. The project’s focus on democratizing wealth through tokenization—not fleeting hype—positions it to dominate the 2025 market. As XRP investors wait for a breakout that may never come, RXS is already breaking ground.

Samson Mow Issues Bull Run Warning as Price Breaks $103K,https://coinpedia.org/news/too-late-to-buy-bitcoin-samson-mow-issues-bull-run-warning-as-price-breaks-103k/,"The post Too Late to Buy Bitcoin? Samson Mow Issues Bull Run Warning as Price Breaks $103K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has crossed $103,000, and JAN3 CEO Samson Mow is making noise. Known for his no-nonsense stance on Bitcoin, Mow is issuing a direct warning: the trillion-dollar Bitcoin era is approaching fast, and those waiting on the sidelines may miss out entirely. As institutional interest explodes, government support grows, and Bitcoin’s limited supply becomes more obvious than ever, 2025 is shaping up to be a historic year for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. “Act Fast or Miss Out”: Mow’s Urgent Rally Call Mow’s recent tweet sent a strong message: Bitcoin under $100,000 won’t be around for long. With the post-halving supply crunch setting in, he stressed that the price could climb sharply. “You won’t buy Bitcoin under $0.1M for long,” he tweeted, urging investors to act before the market skyrockets. Mow is pointing to the real possibility of a supply shock, triggered by rising demand and decreasing availability. Governments Are Getting In – and That Changes Everything Mow believes Bitcoin’s momentum isn’t just coming from investors and institutions. This time, governments are stepping in. In the US, the federal government has launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, using 200,000 BTC seized over the past five years. Arizona and New Hampshire have already passed laws to create their own state reserves. Beyond the US, Mow says three more countries are preparing to roll out Bitcoin strategies in 2025. One of them, he hints, is in Asia. In South Korea, the leading presidential candidate has pledged support for spot crypto ETFs. These developments are building a foundation for long-term Bitcoin adoption on a national level. SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci recently added that growing government involvement could fuel Bitcoin’s next major rally. Time May Be Running Out Bitcoin’s total supply is limited to 21 million coins. That’s not new information, but Mow is reminding everyone that the gap between BTC and global liquidity is now impossible to ignore. As the price moves above $103,000, the market is beginning to reflect that scarcity. Institutional buyers are not trading – they’re holding. That’s reducing available supply for retail investors faster than most expected. ETF Inflows Are Driving the Next Phase of the Rally BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is leading the charge in the spot ETF space. The fund has seen 18 consecutive days of inflows, including $69 million on Thursday alone. IBIT now holds over 572,000 BTC – worth about $69 billion – and demand isn’t slowing down. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone as far as calling Bitcoin a serious contender for a global reserve asset. Institutions are treating Bitcoin like a long-term strategic position. For Mow, this supports his prediction of a $1 trillion Bitcoin market cap in the near future. Corporations are starting to follow the same strategy. GameStop recently announced that it would hold Bitcoin as part of its treasury – a move that mirrors MicroStrategy’s now-famous approach. Samson Mow’s warning is about recognizing that Bitcoin’s place in the world is changing fast. And if his prediction holds, the idea of $1 million per Bitcoin might not be so far-fetched after all.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-09 13:56:19

In a press release, the healthcare infrastructure company said it has secured a $50 million equity line of credit that will be spent on implementing the plan. According to the company, proceeds of these funds, secured through LDA Capital, will go towards developing the on-demand financial infrastructure that will allow the national healthcare network to transition to using blockchain for payments. The company CEO, Brian Norton, stated that the platform will connect manufacturers with pharmacies and patients, doing away with the bureaucratic red tape in the healthcare sector. Norton said: “Our blockchain-enabled payment system and ledger is just the next logical step in healthcare evolution, allowing us to hardwire speed, liquidity, and transparency into a system that’s long been starved of all three.” Meanwhile, the company stated in its press release that it chose to integrate XRP and its infrastructure because of its benefits, which include speed, transparency, global scope, and low cost. It added that there is also flexibility with XRP-backed lines of credit to boost liquidity for independent pharmacies. Although the company provided no information on when the XRP services would start, it stated the potential use cases for XRP and Ripple technology. These include real-time settlements, rebates, credit lines, and global vendor payouts. Wellgistics Health is a publicly listed company with a network of over 6,000 independent pharmacies in the US, trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker WGRX. Wellgistics Health to make XRP a treasury reserve asset Interestingly, Wellgistics Health stated in its announcement that it will also make XRP its treasury reserve asset. While it did not explain how it intends to achieve this, the move is quite surprising. It marks the first time a publicly listed company will consider adopting XRP as a treasury asset. However, it only continues the trend of low-cap companies looking to cryptocurrencies as reserve assets, with Bitcoin being the preferred option. Wellgistics had reasons to choose XRP for both payments and treasury. It pointed at the launch of the XRP futures contract by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, Mastercard highlighting the token as a bridge currency in cross-border transactions, and other developments as proof of XRP’s future potential. However, adopting XRP has not impacted the company’s stock performance. WGRX was down 30.56% at the close of the market on May 8 and traded at $3. It has already seen a further drop to $2.872 in premarket trading, forcing its market cap to drop to $155.83 million. XRP gains almost 10% in a massive day for altcoins Meanwhile, XRP is up more than 8% in the last 24 hours as the token returned to a positive year-to-date performance after recent struggles. The token’s latest gains come amidst the general market pump that has seen Ether gain more than 20% in value, its biggest daily gain since 2021. While several factors are responsible for the broad gains, XRP gains are also attributed to the recent announcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it has settled its lawsuit with Ripple. Under the settlement agreement, Ripple will pay $50 million to the SEC, less than the original $125 million that the court had ordered it to pay, and will get back the remaining $75 million; the SEC approval marks the end of the long-running legal battle over the status of XRP. The settlement is still subject to the approval of the presiding judge, Analisa Torres, but criticism has already been attracted from SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. Crenshaw criticized the deal in a statement, noting that it will affect the SEC’s ability to regulate crypto firms. Despite the criticisms, many expect the settlement to be finalized in the coming weeks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This Price Level Is Now Crucial,https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/can-dogecoin-reach-0-60/,"In his latest YouTube briefing to 292,000 subscribers, the analyst known as “More Crypto Online” (MCO) argued that Dogecoin’s recovery from early-May support keeps the memecoin’s larger Elliott-wave roadmap intact and, crucially, leaves open the long-discussed advance toward the $0.60 region. Dogecoin’s Path To $0.60 Speaking less than forty-eight hours after Dogecoin’s local low on 6 May at roughly $0.163, MCO underlined that price action has so far respected the fourth-wave Fibonacci retracement he mapped out in previous sessions. “The price held this support area between 15.5 cents and 16.8 cents as standard Fibonacci support in a wave four,” he noted, adding that the bounce has already satisfied the “bare minimum” requirement for a fifth-wave launch. The analyst’s near-term pivot (1-hour chart) remains the $0.18 line—exactly the 50 percent retracement of the late-April impulse. “As long as we’re holding above $0.18, there’s absolutely no sign of a top,” MCO said, stressing that a decisive break below that threshold would force a reassessment of the intraday pattern and shift focus back to the 6 May swing low. He described $0.18 as the level that “allows for continuation, direct upside continuation, in an upside impulse.” Related Reading: 72% Of Binance Traders Go Long On Dogecoin, What Does This Mean For Price? So far, Dogecoin’s latest push has only retested the 30 April high near $0.193, leaving the fifth wave “not healthy enough to really be considered a fifth wave that’s already completed.” The analyst therefore expects at least “one or two Fibonacci levels above where the third wave topped,” singling out the 123.6 percent, 138.2 percent and 161.8 percent extensions as conventional zones that would validate a properly extended fifth wave. The ideal target area thus begins fractionally above $0.193 and could stretch into the low-20-cent range if momentum remains intact. MCO also mapped out the contingency in which the market loses the $0.18 floor. Provided the resulting retracement stays corrective and, critically, holds above the 6 May low at $0.163, he would view the setback as the “B-wave pullback” within a broader “wider ABC structure” that ultimately propels Dogecoin to fresh cycle highs. “That would allow for a wider ABC structure… and the B-wave pullback could just be corrective but must hold above this 6 May low,” he explained. Related Reading: Dogecoin ‘Looks Incredible Here,’ Says Crypto Analyst — Here’s Why While the current segment concentrated on the micro-structure—whether the fifth wave finishes in a single thrust or morphs into a more complex ABC variant—the analyst reiterated that none of the outlined scenarios negate the larger bullish thesis so long as the $0.155 to $0.168 macro support band survives. That framework still culminates in a wave count that projects Dogecoin toward the psychologically important $0.60-cent region once the full higher-degree impulse cycle unfolds. For now, the analyst’s dashboard remains straightforward: above $0.18, the burden of proof lies with bears; below it, the market will probe whether the corrective downswing is merely the prelude to the next—and potentially decisive—rally leg. As MCO concluded, “A direct move up remains the expectation but a break below will then, you know, force that discussion.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.205.

Leading the charge are Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and BONK — three of the most recognized meme coins in the space — alongside a fast-rising early-stage contender: MAGACOINFINANCE. These four projects represent very different phases of market maturity, but all are now being flagged as potential breakout assets for 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Dogecoin (DOGE): ETF Hype and Institutional Eyes Dogecoin is the most famous meme coin in crypto history and its relevance is coming back into the picture again. DOGE trading at a price of $0.17 is experiencing fresh momentum from several discussions on the very first Dogecoin ETF which is under course. If allowed, it could bring significant institutional inflows. The price of DOGE is expected to move between $0.141 and $0.205 soon according to the predictions. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Burn-Fueled Optimism and Technical Breakouts SHIB has climbed approximately 7% over the past month, boosted by the burn of over 284 million tokens in a single day. Technical analysts are watching for a bullish breakout pattern, with some projecting a move toward $0.00008. New ecosystem integrations — including MetaMask support and Shibarium expansion — are increasing both adoption and visibility. BONK: Solana’s Meme Engine Gains Momentum Currently in consolidation following an uptick in April is BONK, Solana’s biggest Meme coin. Traders think a break above $0.00001950 will send it toward $0.00002400. BONK is viewed as high-volatility speculation with upside potential, as the Solana ecosystem is back in focus. MAGACOINFINANCE: The Undiscovered Contender with 50x Potential LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE, currently in presale and trading under $0.001, is gaining traction among investors seeking exposure to early-stage growth with strong narrative alignment. With Stage 7 live and a projected listing target of $0.007, analysts are watching closely. The token’s political theme, scarcity-based mechanics, and viral structure have prompted comparisons to early DOGE and SHIB runs. Projects launched from similar structures have delivered 18,500%+ gains in previous cycles — and MAGACOINFINANCE appears to be following that blueprint.

44378082,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66734,1746799478,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,New Letter: This SEC Commissioner Disagrees With Ripple and XRP Case Settlement,https://timestabloid.com/new-letter-this-sec-commissioner-disagrees-with-ripple-and-xrp-case-settlement/,"In a recent tweet, prominent crypto commentator Crypto Eri weighed in on a recent statement issued by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw. The commissioner publicly opposed the agency’s settlement with Ripple Labs, Inc., ending a multi-year legal dispute that began in December 2020. Crypto Eri shared the statement with a short caption: “Crenshaw puts out her strong dissent statement.” This signals attention to the unusual internal disagreement within the SEC over a high-profile case that has shaped much of the legal discourse around digital assets in the United States. ""This is not a settlement ( @Ripple v @SECGov ) I can support."" Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw puts out her strong dissent statement. She wants to ""gut its own enforcement program from the inside out."" https://t.co/0jyljz4nRN pic.twitter.com/A8enuWXgx5 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) May 9, 2025 Crenshaw Outlines Legal and Procedural Objections The statement, which was officially published by the SEC, outlines Commissioner Crenshaw’s reasoning for her dissent and is sharply critical of the settlement terms. Crenshaw reiterated that the original lawsuit against Ripple alleged the company and its executives sold XRP as unregistered securities, raising capital without proper disclosures. The district court partially agreed in its 2023 summary judgment, ruling that Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP constituted unregistered securities offerings. However, it did not apply that ruling to programmatic or secondary market sales. Despite this, Crenshaw noted with concern that the May 2025 settlement vacates the court-imposed injunction against Ripple and returns over $75 million held in escrow back to the company. According to her, this development eliminates key investor protections that were established through extensive litigation. She warned that if Ripple were to resume institutional sales of XRP without registration, the SEC, under the new approach, would take no enforcement action, nullifying the original court ruling. Criticism of the SEC’s Strategic Shift in Crypto Regulation Crenshaw argued in her statement that this resolution is inconsistent with the rule of law or the agency’s duty to protect investors. She expressed concern that the SEC is moving away from consistent enforcement of existing securities laws in the crypto space and towards a policy direction based on a still-undefined future regulatory framework. Commissioner Crenshaw emphasized that the new course of action appears to be motivated by a desire to appear more favorable to innovation, rather than a principled application of securities laws. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 She warned that this creates a legal and regulatory vacuum, offering no immediate clarity while simultaneously discarding the outcomes of prior legal proceedings. She also stated that such a reversal undermines the credibility of SEC attorneys who have spent years litigating these issues and damages the reliability of government processes. Crypto Eri Highlights Division Within SEC Leadership Crypto Eri’s decision to amplify this dissenting statement aligns with her history of following developments related to the XRP ecosystem. While her tweet did not include commentary beyond the headline, her post aimed to draw public attention to a significant moment within the SEC’s ongoing internal debate over crypto regulation. The dissent represents a clear split in the Commission’s stance on enforcement in the digital asset sector following a broader trend of recent case dismissals and settlements involving other crypto companies. Commissioner Crenshaw’s objections suggest that the SEC’s evolving approach may weaken previously established legal precedent and investor protections. Whether this reflects a temporary transition or a lasting change in regulatory policy remains to be seen. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to a press release issued Thursday , the Florida-based company aims to leverage XRP’s blockchain infrastructure to improve transaction speeds and lower settlement costs for pharmacies, suppliers, and manufacturers. Currently, standard wire transfers can take up to three days to settle and may incur fees ranging from $10 to $30, often with limited cross-border capabilities and transparency. XRP Offers Faster, Cheaper Alternative for Cross-Border Payments By contrast, XRP transactions settle in 3 to 5 seconds and typically cost less than one cent, offering a faster and more affordable alternative for cross-border remittances. “Wellgistics is challenging the notion that healthcare must rely on outdated systems and slow financial processes,” said CEO Brian Norton. “We believe the future belongs to platforms that prioritize speed, data clarity, and operational efficiency.” To support its transition, Wellgistics has secured a $50 million equity line of credit (ELOC), which will fund its XRP integration and long-term treasury strategy.

Norton said that adaptability, not legacy infrastructure, will define the future of healthcare innovation. “I believe that the future winners in healthcare won’t be the companies with the biggest buildings…they’ll be those with the fastest rails, cleanest data, and most efficient platforms.” SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple Labs Concludes After Four Years The legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has concluded after more than four years , marking a significant development in cryptocurrency regulation.​ In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens, raising over $1.3 billion. Ripple contested the claim, arguing that XRP is a digital currency, not a security.​ In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a mixed ruling: she determined that XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, while sales on public exchanges did not. Consequently, Ripple was ordered to pay a $125 million civil penalty. ​ In March 2025, Ripple and the SEC reached a settlement. Under the agreement, Ripple would pay $50 million of the previously imposed fine, with the remaining $75 million returned to the company. Both parties agreed to drop their respective appeals, effectively ending the litigation. Last month, a potential security crisis was narrowly avoided after a hacker exploited a developer’s access token to inject malicious code into a key toolkit used by applications on the XRP Ledger. According to Aikido Security, the attacker gained access to a developer’s Node Package Manager (NPM) token, allowing them to publish compromised versions of xrpl.js, the official JavaScript library for interacting with the XRP Ledger. With over 140,000 weekly downloads, the package is widely integrated into hundreds of thousands of apps and websites, raising concerns over the potential scale of the breach. Could the XRP Price Push Past $5 Next? At the time of writing, the XRP price is hovering near $2.40 . A move to $5—roughly a 100 % rally—would require a cluster of tail‑winds that, for once, are lining up at the same time: Regulatory clarity at last. March’s SEC settlement wiped out the litigation overhang and confirmed that secondary‑market XRP sales aren’t securities. Analysts argue this removes the single biggest hurdle to U.S. institutional participation . Corporate adoption sparks network demand. If Wellgistics proves that running payables, receivables, and idle cash on the XRP Ledger slashes costs, other mid‑cap corporates—especially in high‑velocity sectors like e‑commerce and logistics—could pile in, driving real‑world volume and fee burn . Bullish on‑chain signals. Daily transactions on XRPL hit an all‑time high in April, while active addresses are trending up, a mix that historically precedes outsized price moves. Technical analysts see an ascending‑triangle breakout above $3.00 opening the door to $3.80, then psychological resistance at $5.00. ETF and liquidity catalysts. Rumors of a U.S. spot‑XRP ETF —revived after the SEC’s softer stance—have already powered moves toward $3. If even a mid‑sized issuer files in 2025, the passive‑fund bid could accelerate flows similar to what Bitcoin ETFs unleashed earlier this year. Supply dynamics. Ripple’s programmed escrow releases return unutilized XRP to lock‑up each month, capping net issuance. Should corporate demand and ETF inflows ramp faster than tokens exit escrow, the resulting supply squeeze could amplify any breakout. Put simply, with legal uncertainty fading, on‑chain usage rising, and the first public‑company adoption story grabbing headlines, the case for a $5 XRP no longer rests on hope alone—it’s a plausible upside scenario if these catalysts converge before the next macro risk‑off wave hits. As always, investors should weigh that potential against the token’s well‑known volatility and the broader crypto market’s sensitivity to macro shocks.

Scott Bessent harshly criticized the Senate's decision to halt the advancement of the GENIUS Act. He described the GENIUS bill as a generational opportunity to expand dollar dominance and increase U.S. influence in financial innovation, while arguing that stablecoins and cryptocurrencies need U.S. leadership. “The world needs American leadership to enable stablecoins and other digital assets to thrive globally. The Senate missed an opportunity to provide that leadership by not advancing the GENIUS Act today.

Experts believe that Bitcoin couldn’t work as a day-to-day mode of payment due to the additional stress on its network, which would challenge the blockchain’s speed, cost, and scalability. However, this is not the first time, and certainly not the last, that we’re seeing cryptocurrency integration on the retail channel. In this article, we’ll briefly explore just how bullish corporations are on ‘digital gold.’ Read until the end because we’ll also suggest the best new crypto to buy today to benefit from large institutions’ vote of confidence in crypto. Cryptocurrency in Retail Steak ‘n Shake put out an X post on March 8, asking whether it should accept Bitcoin or not. Interestingly, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted ‘Yes’ in reply to this. In 2022, Chipotle started accepting more than 90 cryptocurrencies at 100+ locations in the US. Previously, Starbucks also allowed its customers to recharge their digital wallets using $BTC. Subway also experimented with Bitcoin payment as early as 2013. Finally, El Salvador’s Pizza Hut was the first retail outlet to officially accept $BTC as payment. Although most of these initiatives were short-lived and never scaled, the tide seems to be changing now (for the better, that is). With $BTC gaining strong ground as a new hedge asset among corporations and governments, many companies are trying to either buy and HODL it or adopt it into their ecosystem. The bottom line, therefore, is that Steak ‘n Shake’s current initiative is just the beginning of the domino effect. More retail businesses are expected to follow suit sooner rather than later (and the reasons for that are pretty clear – adoption). As Bitcoin adoption unblocks new milestones and it becomes a part of our daily lives, there can be hardly any doubt that the asset could be the backbone of modern economies. If you want to make the most of crypto’s increasing popularity, here are the best cryptos you should consider buying right now. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Best New Crypto to Buy Right Now A secure and user-friendly crypto wallet is essential as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, enabling users to pay for everyday items such as burgers and gas using the top altcoins . Enter Best Wallet . As outlined in our Best Wallet review , we’re impressed by the wallet’s mobile-first design and support for multiple cryptocurrencies. These are crucial if you want to benefit from the growing support for crypto payments in offline stores. The app is also laced with class-leading security features. First and foremost, Best Wallet is non-custodial, meaning none other than you will have access to your crypto assets. Secondly, it employs Fireblock’s advanced cryptographic technology and multi-factor authentication (including biometrics) to keep bad actors at bay. It’s worth noting that Best Wallet’s native cryptocurrency, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , gives you a unique opportunity to invest in the wallet’s growth. Best Wallet, after all, is on a mission to capture over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026. In addition to potentially offering you a 280% gain on your investment in less than five years (the token is predicted to jump to $0.07 by 2030 ), owning $BEST also comes with many on-platform benefits. For instance, $BEST token holders will have to pay lower fees when they buy, sell, or swap cryptos on Best Wallet. Furthermore, they’ll also get early-bird access to all the new meme coins on presale listed on Best Wallet. If you like what you see, buy $BEST today for just $0.024995 each. The project, which has turned out to be one of the best crypto presales , has raised over $12M so far. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Altcoin Offering Free $BTC via Airdrops Both $BTC’s adoption and price are on a hot streak right now, so we believe it could be the perfect time to invest in a Bitcoin-themed altcoin that could rise alongside the king cryptocurrency. We’re talking about BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It’s unique because it’s the only crypto out there offering Bitcoin airdrops to its token holders. In other words, if you buy into the BTC Bull Token presale, you’ll be rewarded with a sizable portion of a $100K crypto asset for absolutely zero costs on your end. According to BTC Bull Token’s whitepaper , the $BTC airdrops will take place every time the underlying crypto, i.e., Bitcoin, smashes through a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, or $250K. Important: You must hold your purchased $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet to be eligible for free $BTC. Apart from its one-of-a-kind Bitcoin giveaway mechanism, BTC Bull Token’s chunky 40% marketing budget is also why we’ve predicted it to jump over 380% and reach $0.0096 by 2026. Combined with a deflationary model, wherein a portion of the total $BTCBULL token supply will be burnt off every time $BTC’s price rises by $25K, the project’s focus on PR could be a huge reason why its rally could stretch over multiple months. Join the group of Bitcoin maximalists and buy $BTCBULL now . The project has raised nearly $5.5M, and you can get one token for just $0.002505 if you act now. 3. Moo Deng ($MOODENG) – Viral Meme Coin Trending Right Now Moo Deng first made the headlines soon after its launch in September 2024. At the time, it took less than two months to skyrocket to its all-time high of $0.62 – a gain of over 2,000% from the levels of $0.031. After a sluggish 3-4 months, the token is back among the top trending cryptos . It’s up over 150% in just the last 24 hours, which brings its total monthly gain to over 450%. Currently trading at $0.1292 , this cheap crypto is an out-and-out meme coin, meaning it’s driven by community engagement and virality. It’s based on a baby pygmy hippo, also known as Moo Deng. As is the case with meme coins , $MOODENG, too, rose to popularity when the baby hippo meme went viral on social media. Investors soon flocked to Solana to shower their love on this cute token. Beware – New Crypto May Result in FOMO Before you pour a disproportionate amount of money into new cryptos, expecting them to rocket to the moon, kindly remember that the crypto market, especially meme coins, is a high-risk investment. We suggest only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, this article isn’t financial advice of any sort, and you must do your own research and due diligence before investing.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-05-09 14:09:56

A sudden burst of green across major tokens has set off alarms, celebrations, and speculation all at once. Ethereum led the charge with a dramatic 20% surge, dragging the rest of the market into an upward frenzy. Surprising a huge chunk of retail investors, over $750 million in short positions were liquidated in a single day—an eruption not seen since 2023. With bears reeling, the question hanging over everyone now is simple: is this the start of a multi-month bull phase? Short Squeeze Ignites Hope for a Real Trend Reversal It’s not every day that the market records a $750 million blowtorch taken to short sellers. But when it happens, it forces the market to pay attention. This wasn’t just another random bounce—this was a full-scale liquidation event, hinting that the tide might finally be turning after months of stagnation. The short squeeze, led by ETH’s clean break above $2,000, was the most aggressive since Bitcoin's climb to $93K in March, and it did more than just ruin overleveraged bears. It reignited sentiment. 84% of the total liquidations came from shorts, according to CoinGlass data , suggesting the market had become overly skewed toward bearish bets. That imbalance has now been violently corrected. Ethereum’s $310M+ worth of short liquidations alone tells the story of a market misread—one where bearish overconfidence met bullish momentum. Bitcoin’s break above $100K only added fuel to the fire, while altcoins like DOGE and ADA soared more than 10%, and even large caps like BNB, XRP, and Solana logged decent gains. The number of traders who got liquidated through shorts have only gone up since. Almost $1B(!) in short liquidations in the last 24 hours. Nature is healing pic.twitter.com/dmO59rFiqZ — Tom Dunleavy (@dunleavy89) May 9, 2025 What’s especially striking is that this happened in lockstep with news of a U.S.-UK trade deal—an external macro catalyst that likely spurred a rush of speculative buying and de-risking across the board. Meanwhile, the bulk of liquidations—over $500 million—came from Binance and OKX alone, confirming this wasn’t just spot buying. This was an all-out detonation in the futures market. Historically, mass liquidations of this scale are often precursors to new bullish stretches. Not because liquidations themselves cause rallies, but because they reset the board. They purge excess pessimism, expose mispriced positions, and make way for organic upward momentum. This latest wipeout suggests the crypto market may be ready to flip the script. Best Crypto to Buy Now With Crypto Looking Bullish Solaxy If the short squeeze signaled a return of risk appetite, Solaxy is the kind of infrastructure play that benefits directly from revived user activity. It’s not another generic Layer 2. Solaxy is engineered specifically to streamline transaction flow across Ethereum and Solana, two of the busiest and most congested chains in crypto. As interest returns to DeFi, NFTs, and gaming protocols, this dual-chain alignment puts Solaxy in a strategic sweet spot: scalability meets interoperability. But where Solaxy quietly pulls ahead is its incentive structure. Users aren’t just transacting—they’re rewarded for supporting network security through staking. And not with trivial returns either. The staking APY has remained competitive, even in quieter markets, making it appealing to those looking to hedge volatility with passive income. Unlike many Layer 2s still figuring out their tokenomics, Solaxy’s ecosystem feels more deliberate. It doesn’t rely on hype cycles or endless airdrops. Instead, it’s laying down long-term foundations by attracting developers and users with performance and sustainability. HyperSpeed Achieved!🔥🚀33 Million Raised! 🛸🪐 pic.twitter.com/HgswKcnnVM — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 3, 2025 Reaction to this unique concept was also quite positive, since the presale—having raised upwards of $33 million in presale records, one of the biggest this year when it comes to memecoin presales. With short sellers sidelined and Layer 2 usage expected to rise during bull cycles, Solaxy fits into the thesis of capital rotation toward efficiency-first infrastructure. It’s a technical play wrapped in a tokenized rewards system—and for those seeking value beyond speculation, that’s hard to ignore. BTC Bull BTC Bull might look like another meme-adjacent token hitching a ride on Bitcoin’s name. But scratch the surface, and you’ll find one of the smarter utility designs in the space right now—especially for investors tracking Bitcoin’s price arc. The project ties its token mechanics directly to Bitcoin’s own performance. For every major milestone BTC hits—$120K, $150K, $200K—BTC Bull triggers a dual-event mechanism: a percentage of its total supply is burned, and fresh airdrops are unlocked for holders. This means scarcity increases in lockstep with optimism, while rewards are distributed when confidence is peaking. It's a cleverly gamified financial layer that aligns incentives with Bitcoin's momentum. What makes this setup powerful is how it flips passive holding into something dynamic. Rather than waiting for a pump to take profits, BTC Bull lets investors play the long game, with built-in mechanisms that mirror market euphoria. When the market moves, the project responds in kind. It encourages holding by rewarding patience and discourages dumps by embedding deflationary moments into its core logic. The token is also fully audited and backed by a strong community that understands Bitcoin’s cultural weight. And right now, with BTC crossing $100K again and bullish narratives regaining ground, BTC Bull looks primed to enter its next active phase. For traders seeking a meme-style token with tangible logic—and a price action rhythm synced to the world’s most valuable crypto—BTC Bull isn’t just noise. It’s a strategic echo of Bitcoin’s next moves. SUBBD The post-liquidation market might be dominated by infrastructure and narrative tokens—but there’s room for real-world use cases too, and SUBBD fits squarely in that category. Designed as a creator-first economy, SUBBD aims to upend the way influencers, artists, and educators interact with their audiences. Instead of relying on ad revenue or platform algorithms, creators can monetize directly through blockchain-native tools, powered by the $SUBBD token. The token itself isn’t just a tip jar. It functions as a gateway to premium content, community interactions, and even equity-style participation in a creator’s growth. Early adopters can stake tokens to access content or receive benefits as a creator’s popularity increases. This model transforms viewers into stakeholders, shifting fan loyalty into something with financial and emotional weight. Endorsed by top creator channels like 99Bitcoins , SUBBD’s potential seems to have been recognized by many already. The rise of tokenized fan economies is no longer speculative—it’s operational, and SUBBD is building infrastructure to support that shift. Smart contracts handle membership perks. On-chain analytics track engagement. And creators retain full ownership of their earnings. Even beyond content, SUBBD is building partnerships across e-learning and community platforms, signaling long-term plans to scale into a broader tokenized labor market. In a bullish market, utility-backed tokens often gain renewed traction, especially when they bridge online behavior with real-world income. Conclusion The recent liquidation wave may have marked more than just a turning point for short sellers—it might have flipped the broader sentiment entirely. With volatility back on the table, investor focus is shifting toward tokens with clear mechanics, real utility, and strong positioning. Whether tied to infrastructure, market milestones, or user-driven ecosystems, the projects outlined above all align with where momentum appears to be heading. As bullish energy continues to build, assets that combine purpose with timing could see a meaningful stretch of growth ahead.

Crypto influencer JackTheRippler shared the official settlement agreement document filed by the SEC with the U.S. district court to end the contentious case that has gripped the crypto community for years. Settlement Details Shed Light on Resolution The official document, titled “Settlement Agreement,” was filed with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case, designated as 20 Civ. 10832 (AT) (SN) involved the SEC as the plaintiff and Ripple Labs, along with its executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen, as the defendants. BREAKING: This is the official SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT from the SEC to end the @Ripple case! #XRP pic.twitter.com/Hhp1kkTys6 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 9, 2025 The agreement outlines that this resolution addresses both the initial litigation in the District Court and the subsequent appellate litigation in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The case numbers for these appeals are 24-2648(L) and 24-2705(XAP), marking the final steps in a legal journey that began in December 2020. Background and Context of the Litigation The SEC initiated legal action against Ripple Labs and its key executives on December 22, 2020, accusing the company of conducting an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens. Ripple contested these claims, arguing that XRP should be classified as a digital asset rather than a security. Throughout the proceedings, Ripple garnered significant support from the crypto community, with many arguing that the SEC’s stance was inconsistent with the evolving nature of blockchain technology. The litigation, marked by heated court debates and extensive legal filings, became a pivotal case for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Key Aspects of the Settlement Agreement The settlement agreement serves as the formal conclusion of the legal battle. It reflects a mutual understanding between the SEC and Ripple to resolve the case without proceeding to further litigation. The document specifies the parties involved and the scope of the settlement, including Ripple’s response to the initial complaint and the SEC’s subsequent appeals. A crucial element of the settlement is that it not only resolves the District Court litigation but also addresses the appellate proceedings. This comprehensive resolution indicates a willingness on both sides to put the matter to rest, avoiding prolonged court battles that could have continued to impact Ripple’s business operations and XRP’s market stability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Reaction and Market Impact Ripple Labs has consistently maintained its stance that XRP is not a security. With the settlement now finalized, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Christian A. Larsen are expected to focus on restoring Ripple’s market position and reinforcing the utility of XRP within the company’s payment ecosystem. Market analysts have noted that the official resolution could have a positive impact on XRP’s price, as legal uncertainty has long been a shadow over its performance. The formal end of the case might restore investor confidence, potentially leading to renewed adoption and use of XRP in cross-border transactions. Industry Implications and Future Outlook This landmark settlement serves as a critical point in the ongoing discourse around cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. The outcome could influence how other blockchain projects approach compliance, especially those navigating similar regulatory challenges. As the crypto industry digests the implications of the settlement, stakeholders are keen to see how Ripple positions itself moving forward. With legal battles behind it, the focus now shifts to product innovation, ecosystem expansion, and global partnerships, particularly in jurisdictions more favorable to digital assets. JackTheRippler’s timely post on X has brought the document to the community’s attention, underscoring the widespread interest and relief surrounding the case’s conclusion. As Ripple moves past its legal challenges, the industry will be watching closely to see how XRP’s trajectory unfolds in a post-litigation landscape.

The famed investor and billionaire-by-debt explained that the situation indicates that ‘the poor and middle class’ have finally heeded the advice of his ‘Rich Dad’. They realized ‘what’s hot at Costco’ and that ‘savers are losers.’ Thus, according to the writer, they have forsaken the ‘fake money’—a nickname Kiyosaki has given to the American dollar—and are replacing it with the precious metal, gold . In his X post, the finance guru also rhetorically asked whether people have heard his calls to flee to the safety of his favored assets, gold, silver , and Bitcoin ( BTC ), using the much-discussed global Central Bank commodity buying spree as evidence that he is right. WHATS HOT AT COSTCO? Costco is know for great prices. Costco is generally where the poor and middlclass shop. So what is blowing off the shelves at Costco? ….Discount toilette paper or baked beans? No. GOLD. Costco cannot keep enough gold bars and coins in stock. WHAT… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 9, 2025 The return on Robert Kiyosaki’s investment advice Although Robert Kiyosaki appears unable to decide whether gold is better than Bitcoin or the other way around, and even though silver is far from making the moves necessary for his $70, 2025 price target to be hit, there is little doubt that his recommendations have been sound in recent months. Gold stands out particularly for its consistent strength. It rallied 44.41% in the last 12 months and 27.01% year-to-date (YTD) and is, at press time on May 9, changing hands at $3,334. Gold price YTD chart. Source: TradingView As Finbold reported on April 29, such performance ensures that the 2% in Costco gold bars compared to spot prices would not have made buying them unprofitable. A 1-ounce bar from the retail chain gained 39.21% in value between late April 2024 and late April 2025. Though it was generally struggling in 2025, Bitcoin has also reversed in the last 48 hours and is now, at price, 10.49% up this year. BTC price YTD chart.

A landmark case of crypto fraud reached its conclusion. On Thursday, May 8, Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in the firm’s bankruptcy, which cost its users billions. According to the prosecution, Mashinsky victimized thousands of people, many of whom lost their life savings. At the same time, the disgraced founder stole more than $48 million from Celsius. Mashinsky pleaded guilty to securities and commodities fraud. Mashinsky pleads for sympathy The sentence fell short of the 20-year term requested by the Department of Justice, which called it a just punishment. Mashinsky disagreed, and his lawyers, in a May 5 filing, described the DOJ’s request as a ‘death-in-prison’ sentence . They argued that Mashinsky never intended to harm customers or steal their money. His legal team attempted to elicit sympathy by highlighting the persecution his Jewish family faced in Soviet Russia and his military service in the Israeli Defense Forces. However, the judge did not take those factors into consideration during sentencing.

On some deposits, they gave out 17% in interest , much higher than the market rate. At its height, the firm claimed it had 1.7 million users, managed $11.7 billion worth of assets, and gave out $8 billion in loans. But in 2022, as the crypto market faced extreme volatility, Celsius’s operations began to unravel. Instead of secure loans, the firm had engaged in highly leveraged trading strategies. When markets turned, those positions collapsed, leaving Celsius insolvent and its depositors with billions in losses.

In terms of revenue, Hyperliquid generated $2.3 million in the past 24 hours, ranking it as the second-highest-earning application, trailing only Solana and surpassing Ethereum by nearly $1 million. This demonstrates the presence of real consumer activity on the chain. The $HYPE token directly benefits from this, as Hyperliquid allocates 97% of daily revenue, around $1.3 million on average, toward price support and supply reduction mechanisms.

This robust model has led many investors to compare $HYPE’s potential to that of Binance’s $BNB token, which grew from $40 in 2021 to over $620 per token. Technical Breakout Points to More Upside for $HYPE Technically, $HYPE spent much of March and early April consolidating between $12 and $14, forming a reliable support base. It has since embarked on a steady upward trend, marked by consistently higher highs and higher lows. $HYPE price analysis/ Source: TradingView The token recently broke through a major resistance zone at $25, supported by strong trading volume and a large bullish candlestick, indicating continued momentum.

If a retracement occurs, the $25 level is expected to act as new support, with a stronger demand zone lying between $14.50 and $16.00, which served as the base for this rally.

This week, Tidal Financial Group filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two aggressive long-short ETFs. One will back Bitcoin while betting against gold, and the other will do the opposite. The firm is pushing these under its Battleshares brand, turning the never-ending pissing contest between crypto and metal into a market product. According to Bloomberg , the funds would give investors a loud, one-click way to pick a side in one of finance’s most ideological fights. For years, Bitcoin fans have pitched the coin as digital gold, a hard cap alternative to money printing. Meanwhile, gold defenders see the shiny rock as the only real hedge when things fall apart. Now, those opposing views are being baked into ETFs that use swaps, options, and short sales to go all-in on whichever asset traders think wins in a shit-hits-the-fan scenario. Tidal monetizes the Bitcoin vs gold culture war The Bitcoin-long/gold-short product is for those who think the crypto crowd finally has the edge. The gold-long/Bitcoin-short version is for the boomers who believe the digital coin is still a tech bro fantasy. Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist at Counterpoint, said this feels like a personal win. He sees both Bitcoin and gold as part of the same asset class—things governments can’t easily seize or kill. “Bitcoin will gradually grab market share from gold,” Joshi said. “So long BTC/short gold should trend higher over time, while short BTC/long gold will trend lower.” He’s made the argument for years, and now it’s being packaged in a product regular investors can use. But not everyone’s cheering. Brent Donnelly, president of Spectra FX Solutions, thinks the whole thing is unnecessary noise. “It feels gimmicky and unnecessary,” Donnelly said. “Most people bullish on Bitcoin are also bullish on gold.” He pointed out that anyone could already build the same trade using BlackRock’s IBIT for Bitcoin and State Street’s GLD for gold. “These ETFs just add friction.” That said, both assets are moving on very different timelines. Gold has hit new highs in 2025 thanks to fear over US asset stability during the trade war. At the same time, Bitcoin crashed alongside other risky stocks in early April. But once the White House, now led by Donald Trump, leaned deeper into crypto and signaled upcoming trade deals, Bitcoin came back strong. “Bitcoin continues to trade as a risky asset, tracking Nasdaq very closely with a few exceptions,” Donnelly said. He added that “gold is more of a ‘Sell America’ proxy these days.” Retail traders are eating this up. Their appetite for risk hasn’t dropped. Even after markets went nuts in April, they came storming back. And just this week, Bitcoin hit $100,000 on Thursday, while gold dipped following the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady. This back-and-forth is exactly why investors are divided. Some are hedging inflation. Others are betting on chaos. And FOMO is dragging billions into both sides. So far in 2025, over $14 billion has flowed into the top four gold ETFs, while the leading Bitcoin ETFs have collected $8 billion. Charlie Morris, CIO at Bytetree Asset Management, isn’t picking a winner. His fund, BOLD, splits the difference by allocating to both Bitcoin and gold. “I believe Bitcoin and gold both benefit from this era of macroeconomic uncertainty, but at different times,” Morris said. “Gold tends to do better when there is geopolitical uncertainty, and Bitcoin when things are going well.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-09 15:15:06

(Price Prediction),https://cryptonews.com/news/fartcoin-pumps-20-is-100-really-possible-price-prediction-solx/,"Fartcoin has jumped by 20% today, surging to $1.32 as the cryptocurrency market rises by 4% in the past 24 hours. These gains have followed a trade deal between the UK and the US , which has invited expectations that tariffs between the US and much of the rest of the world may soon be coming to an end. FARTCOIN is now up by 10% in a week and by a more impressive 144% in a month in this context, although the meme coin remains down by 47% since reaching an ATH of $2.48 on January 19. Yet its recent gains and momentum suggest that the token could enjoy more rallies in the coming weeks, with its long-term price prediction looking very strong. Fartcoin Pumps 20% – Is $100 Really Possible? (Price Prediction) Looking at Fartcoin’s chart, its momentum has exploded in the past few hours, yet it still has some more space to rise further, before correcting. For instance, its relative strength index (purple) has just touched 70, yet it won’t be until it spends a few days in this region before we can say that buying has heated up too much. Source: TradingView Having said that, this point will likely come sooner rather than later, given that the token’s 30-period average (orange) has been above the 200-period average (blue) for over a month now. This signals that a correction is in order, although it’s interesting to note that the 30-period has begun rising again in the past few hours, so any decline may not happen for a day or two. We still don’t see any sign of whales sending FARTCOIN to exchanges in order to sell, with the latest big transfers involving purchases. A smart trader who made $4.9M on $Fartcoin spent 563K $USDT to buy 488K $Fartcoin again in the past hour and now holds 2.12M $Fartcoin ($2.48M). This trader first aped into $Fartcoin when its market cap was $32M, making $4.9M by buying low and selling high.… pic.twitter.com/pTuUvewFnL — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 28, 2025 It may therefore be a few days before the coin suffers a significant slide, yet its medium- and long-term trajectory remains positive. Most analysts expect the US to complete trade deals with other major economies in the coming weeks, boosting market positivity further. This will help lift Fartcoin’s price, while the token will also gain strength from its own status as a relatively decentralized meme coin, given that it has no team members to rug traders. As such, it’s likely to remain the meme coin of choice for many whales and retail traders for some time to come, pushing its price higher. It could reach $1.50 in a matter of weeks and $10 by Q4. And if momentum snowballs alongside broader meme coin mania, even the $100 mark may not be out of reach. Alternative Altcoins with Strong Fundamentals For anyone worried that Fartcoin’s lack of fundamentals makes it too risky, there are other, newer alts that come with more utility and arguably a better chance of having a longer shelf life. Of course, identifying such tokens early is tricky, but one way to do this is to look for the biggest presales, which can often end with big listing rallies. One token with a good chance of rallying once it lists is layer-two network Solaxy (SOLX) , which has now raised an incredible $34 million in its sale. Dive into the world of Solaxy. Speed. Scalability. Security. $SOLX has it all. https://t.co/mdaTX9aVVx pic.twitter.com/HbMgVnSoIs — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 8, 2025 Launching soon, Solaxy is Solana’s first ever layer-two network, providing low transaction fees and high speeds. Solaxy will provide instant bridging itself and Solana, while also enabling users to avoid the delays and congestion that can still impact Solana from time to time, even with recent upgrades. Its native token SOLX will pay for transaction fees, meaning that it could attract lots of demand if Solaxy gains significant adoption. Holders will also be able to stake it, meaning they can earn a regular income from the token. Solaxy is aiming to tap into Solana’s massive meme token market, and to provide an outlet to high-frequency traders looking to trade with a minimum of friction. It could therefore grow very big, with investors able to join its sale at the Solaxy website . SOLX is currently available at $0.001718, although this price will increase later today, so you should act quickly. The post Fartcoin Pumps 20% – Is $100 Really Possible?

On May 8, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs reached a settlement agreement, concluding a legal battle that began in December 2020. @Ripple settles with the @SECGov , agreeing to pay a $50M penalty and dropping its cross-appeal, marking the near conclusion of a long-standing lawsuit. #SEC #Crypto #Ripple https://t.co/txqDDCnn0G — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 25, 2025 Under the terms, Ripple will pay a $50 million penalty , which is significantly reduced from the original $125 million fine imposed by Judge Analisa Torres in August 2024. The remaining $75 million, currently held in escrow, is to be returned to Ripple, pending court approval. This settlement follows a court ruling that found Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP violated securities laws, while sales on public exchanges did not. Both parties have agreed to drop their respective appeals if the court lifts the injunction against Ripple, effectively ending one of the most closely watched cases in the crypto industry. Commissioner Crenshaw’s Critique Highlights Internal SEC Tensions SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has publicly criticized the settlement, expressing concerns that it undermines investor protections and the agency’s authority. In a statement , Crenshaw warned that the agreement “does a tremendous disservice to the investing public and undermines the court’s role in interpreting our securities laws.” She further argued that the settlement could create a “regulatory vacuum,” leaving investors vulnerable until a comprehensive regulatory framework is established. Crenshaw’s dissent shows internal divisions within the SEC regarding the agency’s evolving approach to crypto enforcement. The settlement also depicts a shift of the SEC retreating from aggressive crypto enforcement actions , as seen in the dropping of lawsuits against other crypto firms like Coinbase and Kraken . The SEC is rolling back a barrage of Gensler-era enforcement actions. What does that mean for crypto? #SEC #Regulation #Crypto https://t.co/D3VZuNrl29 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Notably, the settlement has had immediate market implications, with XRP’s price experiencing a quick surge.

Even with the SEC and Ripple reaching an agreement on paper, the resolution of this high-profile lawsuit remains in flux.

Filan (@FilanLaw) May 8, 2025 According to ex-federal prosecutor James Filan, the first hurdle is Judge Analisa Torres’s indicative ruling. The judge must formally agree to dissolve last August’s injunction and approve the return of $75 million from escrow. Only then can the real procedural machinery kick in. Should Judge Torres signal her consent, both the SEC and Ripple plan to petition the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for a limited remand, sending the matter back to her courtroom to enter the agreed settlement order. That step would trigger the official motion to vacate the injunction and redistribute the funds. Once the injunction is lifted and the settlement funds are disbursed, the final act will be for both parties to jointly ask the Court of Appeals to dismiss the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal. At that point, after more than four years of litigation that began with the SEC’s December 2020 lawsuit alleging XRP’s unregistered securities offerings, the case would finally draw to a close.

In a note to clients on Friday, H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese provided a detailed breakdown of Coinbase’s acquisition, earnings performance, and updated his outlook on the stock’s valuation. Coinbase to acquire Deribit in $2.9b deal In the largest crypto M&A deal to date, Coinbase announced plans to acquire Deribit for $2.9 billion, consisting of $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase stock. Deribit is the world’s largest crypto options exchange with a 75% market share and over $30 billion in open interest. Analyst Mike Colonnese sees the deal as a strong strategic fit, immediately making Coinbase the leading global crypto derivatives platform, while accelerating its international expansion and boosting cross-sell potential with spot and futures trading. Deribit is expected to be accretive to profitability, given its consistent positive EBITDA track record. Q1 2025 earnings recap Coinbase reported Q1 revenue of $2.03 billion, slightly below expectations, with trading volumes falling 10% quarter-over-quarter to $393 billion. Retail volumes dropped 17%, while institutional volumes declined 9%. Transaction revenue came in at $1.26 billion, down 19% sequentially and short of consensus. Despite weaker transaction revenue, subscription and services revenue hit a record $698.1 million, up 9% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong growth in USDC holdings and Coinbase One subscriptions. Adjusted EBITDA was $929.9 million (47.4% margin), below Q4’s $1.29 billion, while adjusted EPS was $1.94, in line with consensus. You might also like: Coinbase calls on remaining US states to drop confusing staking lawsuits Price target revised lower despite clear catalysts for growth Despite what the analyst describes as a “monumental” Deribit acquisition, Colonnese revised his 2025 and 2026 revenue estimates downward to $7.4 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, citing weaker-than-expected transaction volumes. He also lowered his adjusted EPS forecasts to $5.92 and $12.11, with a price target lowered to $305 from $350. Still, the analyst remains optimistic about Coinbase’s long-term outlook, particularly as the regulatory environment evolves. “We believe greater regulatory clarity for crypto in the U.S., specifically as it relates to formal stablecoin and market structure legislation, which we could see this year, will prove to be a major tailwind for Coinbase, and will drive an acceleration of institutional participation into the space,” Colonnese wrote. In addition, more than 200 firms including BlackRock and PayPal already rely on Coinbase’s infrastructure and more tarditional finance institutions will find it beneficial “to seek out” Coinbase’s products and services rather than build their own. As such, “the stars are aligning for an extended bull market for crypto over the next 12 to 18 months,” the analyst wrote.

Synthetix price analysis gives out a highly bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The SNX/USD value has spiked up to $0.796 in the past 24 hours. If we observe from an overall view, the cryptocurrency has gained 17.59% of recovery. However, the four-hour price analysis presents a relatively bearish market scenario. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $4.96 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is under bullish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price increased to $0.796 gaining 17.59% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.31 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2030. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $5.69, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $5.69 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. At the start of May, SNX is trading in a range of $0.663 to $0.753.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SNX|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-09 15:30:00

Whale movement has shifted BTC’s stance from simple trading to a more diverse investor group. Ju emphasizes new liquidity from ETFs and institutions, making BTC market less predictable. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, has confessed that he was mistaken about Bitcoin’s market direction. Just two months back, Ju asserted that the bull cycle for Bitcoin was likely over. However, recent developments, especially the impact of exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, have significantly changed the landscape, prompting Ju to revise his outlook. Earlier, Bitcoin’s market was dominated by whales, miners, and retail investors. These participants traded Bitcoin back and forth, and the market coincided with liquidity drying up. Further, if whales exited, the prices fell, triggering what Ju described as a game of “musical chairs,” where late participants were left holding losses.

Strategy understands and appreciates how valuable bitcoin can be as a permanent store of value. Speaking for myself, I see it as a 21st-century digital collectible. MSTR buys and holds bitcoin through what it calls “intelligent leverage.” I see that as roughly akin to the leverage that Warren Buffett used to become an investment legend. MSTR has dramatically outperformed bitcoin, the S&P 500, and several big-name stocks. Its ability to do that justifies MSTR trading at a premium to its bitcoin holdings. I’m bullish on MSTR based on intelligent leverage. I also like a convertible bond ETF and two preferred issues that relate to MSTR, but with different reward-risk profiles. “Me know that, not real money.” That, according to comedian Nikki Glaser, is how former professional football star Rob Gronkowski (Gronk) rebuked former teammate Tom Brady for the latter’s crypto misfortunes. She did that as part of her routine during a 5/5/24 Netflix comedy special “roasting” Brady. For those not in the know, Tom Brady played quarterback mostly for the National Football League’s New England Patriots. Many say he was the GOAT (Greatest of All Time). And a big part of that came from his intellectual approach to the game. Gronk was Brady’s highly cherished teammate. He cultivated a crude party animal image. So Glaser’s quip stung not just Brady, but crypto in general. The full quote is: Tom lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? Even Gronk was like, ‘Me know that not real money.’ … Gronk actually does bitcoin, which is where he just chews on a handful of nickels. Many people in real life feel that way about Bitcoin. So, I thought hard before I clicked “submit” a Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) article that was ultimately published on 12/20/24 . This company’s main endeavor is and since 2020 has been to buy, keep buying, and keep holding bitcoin. I agree with Gronk about that not being real money. But I saw something unique and interesting here. (See below.) So, I crossed my fingers and rated the stock “Hold.” At the time, MSTR (then known as “Micro Strategy” — it became just plain “Strategy” on 2/5/25 ) was not popular on Seeking Alpha . Of the previous 20 write-ups, 12 carried “Sell” or “Strong Sell” ratings. Four other analysts had “Hold” ratings. That means only four out of 20 reports carried bullish ratings. Since my prior report was published, MSTR turned in a decent performance. It’s up almost 14%. The S&P 500 is down about 4.5%. And more Seeking Alpha reports since 12/20/24 have come out with favorable ratings. Today, I join the bulls. I’ll be raising my rating to “Buy.” I’ll also issue “Buy” ratings for several securities related to MSTR. (These are NMAX, STRF, and STRK… see below.) Does this mean I think bitcoin is about to rally? Not necessarily. I’m really intrigued by MSTR’s use of “intelligent leverage.” But before getting to that, let’s first take a look at… Bitcoin’s Place in the World First, and to give Gronk his due, bitcoin truly is not money, or currency. An “Everyday Economics” booklet published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas says: Money is anything that is widely accepted as a form of payment for goods and services or repayment of debts. In the limited economies of POW camps, cigarettes became money as soon as they became the accepted form of payment for rations that prisoners were exchanging. (Emphasis Supplied.) Bitcoin and cigarettes both qualified as “anything.” Cigarettes became “widely accepted” within the context of a particular society. Bitcoin, however, is not “widely accepted” for use in commerce. Many resent the role of central bankers in creating money and managing its supply. But that is not enough to turn privately created bitcoin into money. Maybe bitcoin will someday gain wide acceptance in commerce. But that’s not the case now. Consider, on the other hand, collectibles. Investopedia defines one as… An item worth far more than it was initially sold for because of its rarity and/or popularity. Stereotypically, these include “fine art, antiques, toys, coins, comic books, and stamps.” But the world evolves. Today, in the 21 st century, we also have digital collectibles . These… Represent a revolutionary way to think about ownership and value in a world increasingly dominated by digital experience…. At its core, a digital collectible refers to a unique digital asset that is verifiable in the blockchain. These collectibles are often tokenized, meaning they are represented as a token on a blockchain that certifies their authenticity and ownership. Back in 2017, New York University Stern School of Business Professor and Seeking Alpha contributor Aswath Damodaran published an interesting blog suggesting bitcoin, which can’t be valued but only priced, may be a digital collectible. Speaking for myself, I say bitcoin is, indeed, a collectible. It’s not aesthetic like a work of art, or even a digital art piece (an NFT, or non-fungible token ). Nor is it functional like a toy. It doesn’t have to be. (Owners of gold bars don’t typically display or caress them. They lock them in secure vaults. Even many artworks are stored away.) To me, collectibility is all about the desire to own a scarce thing simply because it feels good to do so. Collecting is rooted in our innate desire to organize, categorize, and possess objects of significance. Psychologists suggest that collecting satisfies fundamental human needs, such as the quest for knowledge, the pursuit of mastery, and the expression of identity. I believe the inherent scarcity of bitcoin (there can’t be more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation) and acceptance on the part of many humans concerning the desirability of ownership qualify it as a collectible. That creates a base level of demand for bitcoin. That’s being enhanced by increasing willingness of more corporations to hold it (possibly as a hedge against inflation and currency risk) and the Trump administration's support. The latter is reflected in an Executive Order mandating the creation of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile.” Let’s say this is a 21st-century version of gold bars stored at Fort Knox . The prospect of bitcoin prices rising over the long term is one aspect of the investment case for MSTR. But there’s much more… Rather Than Being a Mere Play on Bitcoin, Strategy is Financial Engineering Done Right and Done Well Financial engineering is a more sophisticated version of finance. Besides financial theory, it draws on applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, and economic theory. Like many things, it can cause problems if misused. Case in point: Overly exotic derivatives that caused problems during the 2008 financial crisis. But used properly and prudently, it can help enterprises achieve better results than they otherwise could, and often with the same or even lesser risk. For a positive example, we need look no further than Warren Buffett’s investment activities at Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ). These aren’t funded by his own money, or even by BRK.B’s treasury. It’s funded by the “float” earned by Berkshire’s huge insurance businesses. In other words, Buffett invested on margin. But it’s not as dangerous for him (i.e., for BRK.B) as it might be for you or me. By using funds from insurance companies he controlled, there was no risk of margin calls during down markets. Getting the benefits of margin without any of the downside has been a significant contributor to the returns that have made him legendary. MSTR invests in bitcoin using its own version of a leveraged strategy… It uses the phrase “intelligent leverage.” It mainly issues new equity and/or convertible debt to fund bitcoin purchases. It does so with a dose of inspiration from Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy . According to that work, the number 42 is the answer to “the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything….” MSTR IR MSTR IR So MSTR initially launched a 21/21 Capital Raising Plan… $21 billion in new equity plus $21 billion in new convertible debt. (The total equals $42 billion!) Now, however, the company is amping it up… it’s now pursuing a 42/42 plan to raise $84 billion. New debt and new equity are coming on board gradually, as market conditions for debt, equity, and bitcoin suggest. Here’s the current progress of the 42/42 plan. MSTR IR Did MSTR really need to discuss Adams and 42? Of course not. (Management could have just as easily introduced a 25/25 plan and then raised it to 50/50.) The 42 thing is just a bit of entertaining whimsy. But I appreciate that. It sets the tone for something extremely important… Financial engineering can get quite complex. And this is definitely so for MSTR. MSTR works hard to heavily over-collateralize its new securities based on bitcoin. (This isn’t a formal mortgage-like encumbrance. But it’s substantively functionally equivalent to bitcoin being collateral.) And MSTR is careful to control dilution. Moreover, MSTR contrasts sharply, by 180 degrees, with the folks who designed the obscure and ultimately troublesome mid-2000s mortgage-backed securities. This company works hard to be highly transparent. It does so through its detailed and extensive 10K discussion. (See pages 7-10). Its quarterly earnings presentations, such as the most recent one , are very detailed. And management is very clear and comprehensive in its earnings calls, such as the latest one from 5/1/25 ). MSTR really and truly wants investors to understand what it’s doing. It also works to provide alternative (to MSTR common) vehicles investors can use to implement varying reward-risk parameters (see below). Space here doesn’t permit a comprehensive discussion of the details of MSTR’s capital structure activities. But if you click to download that latest earnings presentation , and/or if you’d like to peruse historical presentations , you’ll find MSTR to be very generous – and clear -- with information. In evaluating the performance of its intelligent leverage strategy, MSTR developed a metric it calls BTC Yield. This compares the change in bitcoin holdings to the change in the number of diluted shares. (Again, MSTR doesn’t just churn out equity, even equity attached to convertible debt, willy nilly. It’s very sensitive to dilution). Here, from the Appendix portion of MSTR’s latest presentation , are details of the number of coins owned and diluted shares. MSTR IR The current BTC Yield is in the lower-right corner. It’s presently 13.7%. Here is how MSTR calculates it. MSTR IR The 13.7% figure was achieved in the context of a 15% target. On the 5/1/25 earnings call , CEO Phong Le announced that MSTR is raising the 2025 BTC Yield target to 15%-25%. The Performance of MSTR’s Intelligent Leverage Program The magnitude of the BTC Yield tells us management is achieving its goals. But let’s also evaluate things in terms that are more familiar to those of us in the investment world… comparative performance. MSTR helps us do this… MSTR IR MSTR IR MSTR IR That’s impressive stuff! But is it a bubble? We’ve seen those before. Who doesn’t know of the infamous 17 th- century Tulip Bulb bubble ! More recently, we’ve experienced the turn of the century dot-com stock bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble. Relatively strong performance for MSTR would not be appealing if the price progress was driven by empty air or hopium . Since the company is in the business of buying and holding bitcoin, it seems reasonable to expect some sort of understandable relationship between the monetary value of MSTR’s bitcoin holdings and its (fully diluted) market capitalization. So I calculated that. Here’s what I have as of 4/27/25. Analyst compilation based on data from MSTR earnings deck and Yahoo! Finance (There’s no magic to any of this. I got everything from MSTR’s BTC-Yield slide reproduced above – the one that details coin ownership and convertibles-based dilution – and market prices from Yahoo! Finance.) We see here that MSTR trades at a hefty premium to the value of its bitcoin holdings. In a perfectly static world, I’d take this as a signal to “Sell,” or possibly even short the stock. But the world is not static. As with high P/Es on some of today’s more popular stocks, like Palantir ( PLTR ) or Tesla ( TSLA ), it’s legitimate to associate premium valuation with future growth prospects. MSTR’s premium-to-bitcoin reflects investors’ willingness to pay up to participate in the company’s intelligent leverage protocol. As shown by the relative performance slides above, investors who have thus far done this have been well rewarded. We also see that in the percentage changes of items in the above market cap to bitcoin table. Analyst compilation based on data from MSTR earnings deck and Yahoo! Finance Here, also, are management’s views on the premium MSTR stock commands. MSTR IR I agree with these points. And note especially the remarks on BMAX, STRK (conversationally nicknamed “strike”), and STRF (strife). I alluded to those above when I referred to other related securities with different reward-risk characteristics. Let’s now look at those… Other Securities in the MSTR Ecosystem – BMAX, STRK, and STRF BMAX - Convertible Bonds This is the REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF (NASDAQ: BMX) . It’s not issued by MSTR. It’s a REX Shares product. As its name suggests, it emphasizes convertible bonds. Most are issued by MSTR. But some are issued by other companies that pursue bitcoin strategies similar to those used by MSTR. This is not an income vehicle. Some bonds have zero coupons. Others have minimal coupons. The key feature is convertibility into common stock. I’ve long liked convertible bonds. But trading characteristics are not amenable to the needs of individual investors. Unless you trade into the millions, you could face hostile bid-ask spreads. Hence, the merits for individuals of convertible bond ETFs. (They are not the most popular things around, but this vehicle is made to order for MSTR-type convertibles. It’s a great way for individuals to participate.) Conversion prices are fixed by contract. They’re set at a level high enough that the bondholder won’t choose to convert on day one. But if the stock rises, it will eventually rise to a level where it becomes worthwhile to convert. Because the conversion feature has no value on day one, the upside here is not as strong as it would be with stock ownership. On the other hand, there’s a lot of downside protection. Most of these bonds earn minimal interest. Ultimately, though, if bitcoin and the stocks disappoint and fall, the bondholder can look forward to getting 100 cents on the dollar at maturity. (As noted above, there’s a lot of collateral-like backing behind these securities.) These are short- and intermediate-term bonds. Here, from page 11 of the latest 10-Q, are details of the MSTR debt outstanding as of 3/31/25. page 11 of MSTR's latest 10-Q Notice that the longest-dated maturity is only about nine years out. BMAX doesn’t own it right now. The longest dated maturity in its current portfolio is 6/1/31. That’s for a convertible issued by Mara Holdings ( MARA ). But BMAX may eventually own the MSTR ’34 issues. Essentially, BMAX is like MSTR, but a bit lower on the reward-risk scale. STRK and STRF – Preferred Shares These are preferred shares. Like bonds, they rank higher than equity in the capital structure. (That only comes into play in times of severe financial distress.) The main characteristic is that these are for income-oriented investors. But unlike bonds, they don’t mature. (That said, individual preferred issues may come with provisions that let issuers “call” them — force redemption — under certain conditions.) Both STRK and STRF are lower on the reward-risk scale than MSTR and BMAX. MicroStrategy Incorporated SER A PFD STK (NASDAQ: STRF) is a preferred issue that, in terms of capital structure hierarchy, ranks below the bonds issued by MSTR. But it’s higher than STRK and MSTR equity. Its dividend is fixed at 10% of the $100 face value. In other words, each share pays a $10 annual dividend (divided into four quarterly payments). Based on the current market price of STRF, the indicated yield is about 10.6%. (Because the issue is so new, Seeking Alpha data presentations don’t yet show the dividend or the yield.) Bear in mind, here, that MSTR has the right to pay the dividend in cash or MSTR common shares. It’s OKI if a STRF holder does not want to own MSTR common. The latter is liquid. So any shares received as a dividend can immediately be monetized by selling. That wouldn’t be the smoothest thing in the world. But for a 10.6% yield, I’d say that situation is quite acceptable. MicroStrategy Incorporated 8.00% SERIES A PERPETUAL STRIKE PFD (NASDAQ: STRK) is very similar to STRF. There are two differences. First, the dividend here is 8% of the $100 face value. In other words, it’s $8 per share. At STRK’s current price, that works out to an indicated yield of 8.7%. Here, too, the dividend can be paid in cash or MSTR stock. In the capital structure hierarchy, STRK ranks below STRF and above MSTR. So, why might anyone buy STRK instead of the higher-yielding STRF? The answer is convertibility. Unlike STRF, STRK gives the holder a little bit of upside exposure to bitcoin and MSTR. It’s not a lot… Each STRF share is convertible into only 1/10 of a share of MSTR. The conversion feature is not valuable today. Assuming a $92 price for STRF, you’d need $920 worth of face value (10 shares) to get a single MSTR share. The latter trades at around $415. But conversion could become worthwhile in the future if these securities rise. It’ll take a long time. But with an 8.7% yield, it pays to be patient. Risk The risk here is that bitcoin suffers a major, catastrophic, and sustained collapse. MSTR’s intelligent leverage program is such that the company can readily withstand periodic corrections, or even downturns that amount to more than corrections. (Anyone can define “correction” in their own way.) But if bitcoin suffers a tulip-like prolonged crash, that would be troublesome for MSTR and all related instruments. Bitcoin/crypto cynics will undoubtedly trumpet this. And I can’t condemn anyone who does so. But the reason I devoted so much attention to the relationship between bitcoin and the collectible world is to put the worst-case scenario into a more familiar context. Art prices could enter a serious and prolonged crash. So, too, could antique. So, too, could vintage baseball cards. Ditto even gold. According to Statista , only 7.16% of 2024 gold production was used in industry. Imagine how the price could crash if the other 92.84% of demand were to become compromised. Even if we add back the 44% used in jewelry, that would still leave 48.84% of demand that is completely non-utilitarian. That could still suggest widespread nightmares. Think of the devastating bitcoin crash risk in this context. Suddenly, it has much in common with many other things that have long been readily accepted. I believe that makes it much less scary. What to do About MSTR, BMAX, STRK, and STRF Securities Here’s the MSTR price chart. StockCharts.com Conventionally speaking, this looks fine. I like how the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) recently moved up and through the now up-trending 50-day EMA. Consider, too, Chaikin Money Flow ( CMF ) and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO). Both measure which party to trades is more motivated. CMF does it for institutional investors. CO does it for the market in general. Both indicators are nicely bullish, Buyers being more motivated than sellers exert upward pressure on stock prices. And CMF tells us it’s not just individuals chasing memes. That indicator measures the group labeled by Marc Chaikin (its creator) as “ smart money .” Here’s a much shorter-term look at MSTR and the rest of its ecosystem (BMAX, STRF, and STRK)… just a few weeks. (BMAX, STRF, and STRK are really NEW !) Seeking Alpha The picture shows exactly what the above verbiage suggests. MSTR is the main event. BMAX is a slightly more conservative alternative. STRF and STRK are much more stable as income vehicles. But between them, STRK’s tiny conversion feature gives it a little bit of volatility relative to STRF. So, as minuscule as this sample is, we already see the securities properly aligned according to reward-risk theory. When it comes to rating stocks, I think in terms of probable future stock performance relative to the market, rather than literally buying, holding, or selling. And since I’m not rating based on a quant model, I’ll eschew “Strong …” extremes. Absent an exceptional degree of conviction, I think “Buy,” Hold,” or “Sell” are enough. I see all as attractive relative to their respective security types. I translate that to the Seeking Alpha rating taxonomy by assigning “Buy” ratings to all four — MSTR, BMAX, STRF, and STRK. The difference between them should be based entirely on one's own reward-risk preferences.",MSTR|BMAX|STRF|STRK,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-09 15:33:42

Raoul Pal argued that an altcoin rally could be very close, stating that Bitcoin dominance, which is the biggest obstacle for altcoins, has reached its peak. Macro analyst Pal, in his post from the X account, stated that Bitcoin dominance has probably reached its peak, with DeMark indicators indicating peaks for BTC dominance on daily, weekly and monthly charts. Noting that the current BTC.D level is lower than the 2021 and 2017 peaks, Pal stated that this is in line with past historical patterns. He argued that this could signal the next phase of the so-called “Banana Zone,” which refers to a parabolic increase in altcoin prices, creating a banana-shaped curve on the chart. However, not everyone agrees with Raoul Pal, as crypto analyst Mark Harvey believes that Bitcoin dominance could strengthen further due to increased ETF inflows and institutional adoption. According to him, the current decline in BTC dominance is only temporary. As Bitcoin dominance declines, the CMC Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 41. While the Altcoin Season Index is at its highest level since February, it is still well below the altcoin season threshold of 75. This means we are not yet in full altcoin season. *This is not investment advice.

Pi Coin ( PI ) token surged to an intraday high of $0.78 on Friday, its highest point since April 12, and 41% above its lowest level this month. The 24-hour volume soared by 170% to $353 million. Two broader factors drove this rally. First, it surged as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins soared, pushing the total crypto market cap to over $3.25 trillion. This surge was because of the ongoing Bitcoin accumulation and the rising hopes of trade deals between the US and other countries. Second, the Pi Network community is anticipating a major ecosystem announcement next week. The timing aligns with the Consensus event in Toronto, where Pi Network’s founder Nikkolas Kokkalis is scheduled to speak. A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14. Tune in to find out what's coming next! pic.twitter.com/5jn7m5mlmD — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) May 7, 2025 This announcement could be a partnership with a large company, an ecosystem fund to incentivize developers, an exchange listing, or a token burn. Rumors of a token burn gained traction after on-chain data revealed a transfer of 84 million PI tokens to an unspecified address. Some analysts suggest these tokens may have been moved to provide liquidity for a potential exchange listing. You might also like: Is Binance listing Pi Network soon?

For example, the Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) price jumped by double digits on Friday after it was listed on Upbit, a top South Korean exchange. A token burn would also lead to a parabolic move because it would offset the ongoing token unlocks. Data shows that over 1.45 billion Pi coins will be unlocked in the next twelve months, diluting existing holders. These unlocks have led to higher supplies and contributed to the recent crash. Pi Network price analysis Pi price chart | Source: crypto.news The ongoing Pi Coin price surge is in line with what we predicted here and here . In those articles, we pointed to the narrowing spread of the three Bollinger Bands lines, and that it was in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. On the 8-hour chart, Pi Coin bottomed at $0.5577 on April 29 before rallying to $0.7810 on Friday. This pattern has formed a cup-and-handle structure, a widely followed bullish continuation pattern. The depth of the cup is approximately 30%. A measured move from the breakout point suggests a potential upside target of $1.10, a 41% rally from current levels.

The firm shows strong revenue growth and profitability but has high valuation expectations and significant concentration risks. Despite positive industry growth dynamics, Antalpha's exposure to Bitcoin volatility and regulatory unpredictability warrants a cautious 'neutral Hold' rating. Investors bullish on Bitcoin may find the ANTA IPO appealing, but I'll be watching for a lower entry point post-IPO. A Quick Take On Antalpha Platform's IPO Antalpha Platform Holding Company ( ANTA ) has filed to raise $46.2 million in an IPO of its ordinary shares, according to SEC F-1/A registration information . ANTA provides supply chain financing in the Bitcoin mining machine industry. The firm has produced strong recent topline revenue growth and has turned a profit, but valuation expectations are very high and the firm has numerous and widespread concentration and other risks. I’m a neutral Hold on the ANTA IPO as I watch for a lower entry point post-IPO, although ""risk on"" investors who are positive on the wider Bitcoin complex may have a more bullish outlook. What Does Antalpha Do? Singapore-based Antalpha Platform Holding Company was founded to enable companies to expand their Bitcoin mining scale and operations to purchase Bitcoin mining machines from partner Bitmain and other equipment suppliers. Management is led by founder, Chairman and CEO Mr. Moore Xin Jin, who has been with the firm since its inception in 2021 and was previously general manager of Diansuan Information Technology, a software provider for online shopping and mining machine distribution and management services. The firm was previously a sister company of financing firm Northstar and with which it has a continuing relationship, which it recognizes revenue it calls ""technology platform fees,"" which are essentially loan servicing fees, that currently account for about 18.5% of its total revenue. Antalpha has booked fair market value investment of $48.6 million as of December 31, 2024 from investors, including Antalpha Technologies Holding Company, AMT Integrated Fund and Will Chang-Wei Chiu. Sales and Marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue have fallen materially as revenues have increased quickly, as the figures below indicate: Sales and Marketing Expenses vs. Revenue Period Percentage Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024 9.0% Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 23.5% (Source - SEC.) The Sales and Marketing efficiency multiple, defined as how many dollars of additional new revenue are generated by each dollar of Sales and Marketing expense, was a robust 8.5x in the most recent reporting period. (Source - SEC.) What Is Antalpha’s Market? According to a 2025 market research report by Verified Market Research, the global market for ASIC Bitcoin mining machines was an estimated $9.2 billion in 2024 and is expected to exceed $26.7 billion by 2031. This represents a forecast CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of strong CAGR of 22.3% from 2025 to 2031. The primary factors driving this expected growth are the increasing usage and price of Bitcoin worldwide, driving up potential mining block rewards despite the reward halving approximately every four years. Also, the chart below illustrates the expected trajectory of the Bitcoin mining hardware market through 2031: Verified Market Research Major competitive vendors or industry players include the following firms: DigMig Innosilicon HashFast Technologies BTCGarden Biostar Group Spondoolies-Tech Ltd. Grdichip BitDragofly Antminer Ebang BitFury Group Black Arrow CoinTerra Butterfly Labs Others. The company sources supply chain financing customers via its relationship with Bitcoin mining company Bitmain. It also provides technology and loan servicing services to Northstar for non-U.S. loans by Northstar. I’ve prepared a thumbnail SWOT analysis for Antalpha: Strengths Bitcoin mining ecosystem expertise, strategic relationships with large industry players, asset light business model. Weaknesses Exposure to volatile Bitcoin industry, close ties to two entities - Bitmain and Northstar, concentrated portfolio and funding sources. Opportunities Growing digital mining market, expansion into AI GPU markets and new geographies. Threats Unpredictable regulatory environment in various jurisdictions, Bitcoin mining economic return variability, cybersecurity risks. Antalpha’s Recent Financial Results The firm’s recent financial performance is summarized as shown below: Sharply growing topline revenue Increasing gross profit and gross margin A swing to operating profit Reduced cash used in operations. Below are major financial results from the firm’s current registration statement: Total Revenue Period Total Revenue % Variance vs. Prior Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024 $ 47,454,993 321.0% Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 $ 11,272,995 Gross Profit (Loss) Period Gross Profit (Loss) % Variance vs. Prior Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024 $ 22,837,628 359.4% Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 $ 4,970,744 Gross Margin Period Gross Margin % Variance vs. Prior Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024 48.12% 9.1% Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 44.09% Operating Profit (Loss) Period Operating Profit (Loss) Operating Margin Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024 $ 3,181,081 6.7% Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 $ (7,622,347) -67.6% Net Income (Loss) Period Net Income (Loss) Net Margin Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024 $ 4,393,471 9.3% Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 $ 6,585,440 58.4% Cash Flow From Operations Period Cash Flow From Operations Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024 $ (11,694,058) Year Ended Dec. 31, 2023 $ (12,239,995) (Glossary Of Terms.) (Source - SEC.) As of December 31, 2024, Antalpha had $6.9 million in cash and $1.2 billion in total liabilities. The company has generated free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, of negative ($11.9 million). Antalpha’s IPO Plan ANTA intends to sell 3.85 million shares of ordinary shares at a proposed midpoint price of $12.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $46.2 million, not including the sale of customary underwriter options. Tether International, the operator of the largest USD stablecoin network ( USDT-USD ), has indicated a non-binding interest in purchasing shares of up to $25 million from the IPO and on the same terms. Dilution in net tangible book value per share for investors in the IPO is expected to be $8.32, which is within the typical range for a company at IPO. The company’s enterprise value at IPO (excluding underwriter options) will approximate $638 million. The float-to-outstanding-shares ratio (excluding underwriter options) will be approximately 16.7%. Per the firm’s most recent regulatory filing, it plans to use the net proceeds as follows: We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for: general corporate purposes, which may include investment in product development, sales and marketing activities, technology infrastructure, capital expenditure, global expansion, and other general and administrative matters; loan operation and customer funding advance needs, to accelerate our fund flow and improve customer experience; investment in technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisition or investment; and investment in Bitcoin and gold (in digital form) as part of our treasury management. (Source - SEC.) Management’s presentation of the company roadshow is not available. Pertaining to potential legal exposure, leadership says the firm is presently not a party to any legal actions that it considers 'material.' Listed underwriters of the IPO are Roth Capital Partners and Compass Point. Below is a table of relevant capitalization and valuation figures for the company: Measure [TTM] Amount Market Capitalization at IPO $277,200,000 Enterprise Value $638,160,362 Price / Sales 5.84 EV / Revenue 13.45 EV / EBITDA 110.21 Earnings Per Share $0.19 Operating Margin 6.70% Net Margin 9.26% Float To Outstanding Shares Ratio 16.67% SBC as Percentage of Free Cash Flow -1% Dilution to New Shareholders $8.32 Revenue Growth Rate 320.96% (Glossary Of Terms.) (Source - SEC.) Antalpha Is Growing Quickly And Profitably ANTA wants to access U.S. capital markets to fund its growth and expansion plans, and to purchase Bitcoin or tokenized gold digital assets for its treasury strategy. The firm’s financials have generated quickly growing topline revenue, growing gross profit and gross margin, a swing to operating profit and lower cash used in operations. However, free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, was negative ($11.9 million). Sales and Marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue have fallen quickly as revenue has grown and its Sales and Marketing efficiency multiple was a strong 8.5x in the most recent reporting period. The firm currently plans to pay no dividends and will likely retain any future earnings for its growth and working capital needs. ANTA’s recent capital spending history indicates it has spent lightly on capital expenditures despite generating negative operating cash flow. The firm’s growth strategy features a desire to diversify its funding sources, expand its client base beyond traditional Bitcoin miners to corporates and family offices, and explore offering financing for AI compute GPU purchases. The market opportunity for the Bitcoin mining ecosystem is large and expected to grow at a very strong rate of growth through 2031, so the company has positive industry growth dynamics in its favor. Risks to the company’s outlook as a public company include its ""foreign private issuer"" and ""emerging growth company"" status, which allows management to produce less information for shareholders. Many of these types of stocks have performed poorly post-IPO. ANTA has several concentration risks, including customer and loan concentration, geographic concentration in the U.S. and Asia, funding source concentration with Northstar, product concentration with only providing financing for Bitmain brand mining machines and collateral concentration. In its history, Antalpha was a wholly-owned subsidiary before it was carved out of Northstar. In late 2024, Northstar agreed to provide ANTA with a credit facility of up to $1.0 billion, with an accordion feature to increase to up to $1.15 billion per year. Northstar is a Hong Kong-based entity that is not a regulated or registered financial institution, but is an irrevocable trust with the beneficiary of Mr. Ketuan Zhan, co-founder of Bitmain, and is essentially a private capital provider that facilitates Bitmain’s financing options. Management is seeking an Enterprise Value/Revenue multiple of approximately 110x and an EX/Sales multiple of 13.5x on very high revenue growth but extremely uneven net margin, which was 58.4% in 2023 and 9.3% in 2024. The company is exposed to a volatile industry and prospective investors should think of Antalpha as essentially within the greater ""Bitcoin complex"" and subject to Bitcoin’s frequent, though lessening over time, volatility. Also, it is subject to a variety of unpredictable regulatory changes, including the Hong Kong domicile of its primary source of funds, Northstar. Antalpha’s outstanding loan balance at the end of 2024 was $428.9 million out of a $1 billion credit facility. It also generates revenue from servicing Northstar loans to non-US customers. If Northstar were to be prohibited or hindered from providing financing to Antalpha, it could severely disrupt Antalpha’s ability to generate revenue. So, while ANTA is growing quickly and profitably, there are material risks to investors from a variety of vectors described above. For investors who are bullish on the Bitcoin space in general and are willing to stomach the risks of a Bitcoin-adjacent company like Antalpha, the IPO may be worth a close look. However, I'm a bit more cautious due to its ultra-high EV/EBITDA valuation expectations given its fluctuating margin and its various concentration risks, as I outlined above. As a result, I'm a neutral Hold on the ANTA IPO on valuation and risk concerns, although I’ll be watching it closely in post-IPO trading for a potentially lower entry point.

Traders should prepare for possible price swings and increased market activity. Approximately $3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options contracts are expiring before the start of the weekend. This significant event could lead to heightened volatility, as options expirations often result in increased trading activity and rapid price movements. With Bitcoin trading around $102,871 and Ethereum at $2,309, investors are closely watching for possible market shifts. Key technical points, Options Expiry Volume: Approximately $3 billion in BTC and ETH options are expiring today, potentially leading to increased market volatility. Market Sentiment Indicators: The put-to-call ratios for Bitcoin and Ethereum suggest mixed market sentiments, with Ethereum showing a slightly more bullish outlook. Potential Price Movements: Traders anticipate possible price swings and increased market activity as a result of the options expiry. Options contracts allow traders to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price before a specific date. The expiration of these contracts frequently sparks repositioning, leading to increased activity and short-term volatility. The sheer size of Friday’s expiry could influence near-term price dynamics. Bitcoin Open Interest by Strike, Source: Deribit The put-to-call ratio is a common metric used to gauge market sentiment. A ratio above 1 indicates a bearish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 suggests bullishness. Current data shows Bitcoin’s put-to-call ratio at 0.93, indicating a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment, whereas Ethereum’s ratio stands at 1.22, reflecting a more bearish outlook. Ethereum Open Interest by Strike, Source: Deribit Analysts have mixed views on the impact of today’s options expiry. Some believe it could lead to short-term volatility and influence market sentiment, potentially driving prices higher if the prevailing sentiment is bullish. Others view it as a routine event with limited long-term impact, suggesting that while price swings may occur, broader factors such as regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions will continue to play a significant role in market trends. What to expect in the market post-expiry Following the expiration of these options contracts, traders should be prepared for potential short-term volatility as the market adjusts. If bullish sentiment prevails, we could see upward price movements, particularly if key resistance levels are breached. Conversely, if bearish sentiment dominates, prices may face downward pressure. It’s essential for traders to monitor market indicators and news closely, as external factors like regulatory changes and macroeconomic developments could also influence market direction in the coming days.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Trading,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-09 15:49:30

The size and timing of this withdrawal suggests a shift toward long-term custody and reduced intention to sell. Such moves are often interpreted as bullish signals, as they decrease immediate market supply and reflect confidence in further price appreciation. Abraxas Capital’s large-scale transfer is drawing attention amid a broader wave of accumulation. While the firm withdrew 61,401 ETH over two days, the total figure across multiple transactions reached 138,511 ETH, according to onchain data.

At the same time, over $265 million in short positions were liquidated, accelerating the price move. Though ETH has gained 54% in the last month, it remains down 26% for the year. However, analysts at CryptoQuant point out that Ethereum is now at its most undervalued level relative to Bitcoin since 2019, based on the ETH/BTC MVRV ratio. Abraxas Capital’s operations highlight the increasing involvement of institutions in the Ethereum markets. Established by Fabio Frontini in 2002 with the aim of creating a top-tier asset management firm, Abraxas Capital Management has focused on digital assets since 2017, quickly rising to become a global leader in the field.

The SEC recently filed a Settlement Agreement Letter, marking significant progress in the prolonged legal battle. While the XRP community has greeted this development with enthusiasm, legal analysts caution that the journey is not entirely over. Attorney James K. Filan, a key observer throughout the case, noted that despite both parties agreeing to the terms of the settlement, the final say rests with Judge Analisa Torres. Before the settlement becomes official, the judge must evaluate whether it aligns with the public interest, which remains a critical hurdle before the case can be definitively closed. The Remaining Steps Toward Final Resolution While the filing of the settlement marks a significant achievement, there are still crucial steps ahead before Ripple can claim a complete victory. Legal experts outline four primary stages that must unfold: First, Judge Torres will thoroughly examine the settlement and make a preliminary determination on whether to lift the current injunction. This step includes addressing the release of escrowed funds, with $50 million designated for the SEC and the remainder returned to Ripple. If the judge concurs with the proposed terms, both Ripple and the SEC will file a joint request with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking a limited remand. This procedural step aims to return the case to Judge Torres to implement the agreed-upon actions. Once the remand is secured, the parties will submit a combined motion requesting the formal execution of the agreed measures, specifically, dissolving the injunction and allocating the escrowed funds. The final phase involves requesting the Court of Appeals to dismiss both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal , thereby officially bringing the legal conflict to an end. The settlement process that has happened in SEC v Ripple over the last several weeks and will continue over the next few months is apparent from the details of the rule 62.1 motion filed today asking for an indicative ruling from Judge Torres. 1. Settlement agreement signed by… — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 8, 2025 XRP Community’s United Front The XRP community has remained resolute throughout the litigation, demonstrating steadfast support for Ripple. Attorney Bill Morgan recently emphasized that a significant portion of those affected by the outcome are XRP holders. Notably, over 80,000 XRP holders joined attorney John Deaton in presenting their collective interests during the case, underscoring widespread opposition to the SEC’s stance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Morgan believes that this overwhelming public backing could significantly influence the judge’s decision. He argues that approving the settlement, which includes lifting the injunction and imposing a $50 million penalty, aligns with the public interest given the community’s vocal support for Ripple’s position. Legal Uncertainty Lingers Despite the optimism from Ripple supporters, not everyone is convinced the outcome is secure. Marc Fagel, a former SEC attorney, pointed out that Judge Torres’ prior decision regarding Ripple’s institutional XRP sales is likely to be upheld by appellate courts. Should the judge reject the settlement, it remains uncertain whether the SEC would continue to defend its position on appeal. Nonetheless, some community members believe the evolving regulatory environment in the United States, combined with Ripple’s strengthened stance at the appellate level, increases the likelihood of a favorable resolution. The general sentiment leans toward Judge Torres approving the settlement, especially given the substantial community support and the shifting landscape of crypto regulation. A Landmark Moment with Uncertain Outcomes While the settlement agreement represents a landmark moment in the Ripple vs. SEC saga, its full resolution hinges on judicial approval. As the community awaits Judge Torres’ decision, the crypto world remains attentive, weighing the potential impact of either outcome on Ripple, XRP, and the broader industry. Should the settlement gain approval, it could mark the end of a contentious chapter, offering Ripple a chance to fully refocus on its core business operations.

Analysts Say It’s the Best Crypto to Invest Today,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-this-0-025-altcoin-really-hit-8-analysts-say-its-the-best-crypto-to-invest-today/,"In a space filled with short-lived trends and heavily promoted tokens, only a handful of altcoins are gaining real attention for their long-term potential. But Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is slowly turning heads — not because of a flashy marketing campaign, but due to the structure of its ecosystem, rising adoption in presale, and a clear pathway toward real utility. It’s currently priced at just $0.025, yet some analysts are suggesting that this token could eventually reach $8 — and that it may be one of the best crypto investments available today. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance isn’t built to follow the crowd. Instead of relying on traditional hype cycles, the project is focused on building a decentralized protocol that unlocks capital without requiring users to part with their crypto assets. Through smart contract-powered lending and borrowing, users can deposit assets like BTC, ETH, or stablecoins as collateral — gaining access to liquidity while maintaining full exposure to the market. This is more than just convenience. It’s a framework designed for long-term participation, where users can borrow to fund new opportunities, cover short-term needs, or build strategies — all without liquidating positions. For experienced cryptocurrency holders, this structure is exactly what they look for in a next-generation protocol. MUTM is now in the fourth stage of its presale, with the token available at a price of $0.025. Over $7.75 million has already been raised, with more than 65% of this phase completed. The next pricing level is set at $0.03, and once public trading begins, the launch price will be $0.06. For early participants, that makes right now a rare opportunity. The current price offers more than double the value compared to launch — and far more when looking at the long-term projections. Those who understand the mechanics behind successful crypto investment plays know that entry timing matters, and Mutuum is reaching a point where more investors are moving quickly to secure a position before visibility increases and price follows. This growing interest is pushing urgency. Once the next presale phase begins, latecomers won’t be able to buy in at $0.025. And when exchange listings go live, early entries will have locked in a significantly more favorable cost basis. Skeptics might raise an eyebrow at the $8 projection. But it’s important to consider the mechanics that back the token. Revenue generated by Mutuum’s platform — through interest from lending — is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to participants, creating an ongoing cycle of demand tied directly to platform activity. This model doesn’t depend on token emissions or hype — it ties token value to actual usage. As more users borrow, more MUTM gets purchased and distributed, reducing supply and increasing demand. Combined with growing interest in decentralized borrowing, Mutuum has positioned itself as more than just a presale asset. It’s a utility-driven cryptocurrency with real staying power. Analysts believe this setup, along with the stablecoin being developed inside the protocol and the utility of mtTokens (which represent deposits and accrue value), lays a realistic path toward much higher valuations. Not in weeks, but as adoption builds and platform use scales — $8 is not just a target; it’s becoming an expectation. Alongside the presale, Mutuum is also running a $100K giveaway — open to anyone who participates. Full details are available on the project’s official website, where users can learn how to qualify and boost their chances through simple actions like sharing the campaign or referring others. MUTM isn’t chasing virality. It’s offering real infrastructure for those who want yield, capital access, and long-term returns — not just temporary momentum. For anyone exploring the best cryptocurrency to invest today, it’s becoming harder to ignore this $0.025 altcoin. The numbers line up. The model holds up. And the price? For now, it’s still low enough to make early entries count. With $8 in view and a growing number of holders getting in before the rest of the market catches on, Mutuum Finance might be one of the few altcoins today that’s actually worth the headline.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Neobanks improved convenience, but true financial freedom requires transparency, control, and autonomy, deobanks like WeFi are making it a reality. Table of Contents What financial freedom really means The limits of Neobanks What makes a Deobank different How WeFi delivers real financial freedom Rethinking what financial freedom really takes At some point, most of us have excitedly downloaded the latest fintech app, lured in by its promises of seamless transactions, effortless budgeting, and a slicker financial experience. Clean and modern interfaces make onboarding a breeze, while the debit card arrives in cool, photogenic packaging that makes users feel special. But, what has actually changed? Once the initial excitement fades, we realize it’s the same engine, the same infrastructure, just a pretty new face to interact with. That means the same limitations, opaque rules, and lack of control are still in place. Of course, things are faster and the upgrade is more convenient and usable, but access and financial freedom are not the same thing. A nicer interface doesn’t mean more autonomy. Until now. The concept of a deobank is one where users can have their cake and eat it. People get beautiful interfaces and revolutionary features, as well as full control of their finances and complete transparency over their funds. That requires more than just a sleek and minimalist new card arriving in the mail, users need to leverage decentralized technologies, transparent-by-design tooling, and user-centric platforms built on the values of blockchain technology. What financial freedom really means Let’s reflect on what “financial freedom” actually means (hint: it’s more than just having a certain amount of money in the bank). It’s really about: Having full control over funds: Only users can decide how their money is used, with no limits, no freezes, and no need to ask permission or justify a withdrawal. They’re the user’s assets, always accessible. Having confidence and transparency: Users should be able to see how their bank manages its assets (user funds), understand every fee being charged, and know that every transaction is recorded immutably on a public ledger. With transparency comes confidence, not blind trust. Having full flexibility: Financial freedom is having the tools to save, send, spend, or grow money without restrictions. Users can invest in emerging DeFi protocols, earn a competitive yield, or get a loan, whenever they like, with no barriers. Traditional banks and neobanks don’t offer this level of control, and likely wouldn’t, even if they knew how to. Instead, they improve their apps and make nicer looking cards. Truthfully speaking, a fresh coat of paint and sleek aesthetics does absolutely nothing for financial autonomy. To do that, we need to overcome certain limitations. The limits of Neobanks It’s hard to argue that neobanks haven’t disrupted banking with their user-friendly UI and reduced fees, but when we look closer, they’re hardly different from their traditional banking predecessors. It’s now a critical task for new and innovative fintech platforms to help take the industry into a new era. Consider these key limitations: Legacy banking rails: Most neobanks are dependent on traditional banking rails for payment processing, regulatory compliance, and infrastructure. They’re subject to the same inefficiencies, delays, and restrictions. Subject to centralization: Neobanks may have improved the user experience, but they’re still controlled centrally, meaning they can freeze accounts, place arbitrary limits, charge whatever fees they deem fit, and make decisions about the users’ funds. If they can do that, users don’t truly own their “banked” assets. Centralization also exposes users to hacking risks, regulatory intervention, and fund mismanagement. Users are essentially renting their financial freedom, not owning it. Is a smoother app worth the trade-off, or are people willing to explore new fintech developments to get a much better experience and autonomy? You might also like: Stablecoins can hold central banks fiscally accountable | Opinion What makes a Deobank different Deobanks are the next step forward for banking, and how we think about banking. They are blockchain-native, decentralized platforms designed to empower users with real financial freedom via a transparent, secure, and accessible financial system. Here’s what defines a deobank: Non-custodial or hybrid accounts: In a non-custodial model, users hold the private keys to their digital assets, with nobody else having any power or control over them. Alternatively, hybrid models offer more balance, providing custodial options to those who want them, but with self-custody prioritized. On-chain transparency: Everything that happens within a deobank is recorded immutably, on a public blockchain, for anyone to verify and track. No more black box activity, banking mysteries, or “misappropriated funds”. Stablecoins: Deobanks understand that cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets, like the US dollar, enable seamless, global financial access. These stablecoins, like USDC and USDT, eliminate the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies and make for cheaper, faster, and borderless transactions. DeFi integrations: Decentralized finance offers thousands of new tools with incredible opportunities, such as lending protocols, yield farming platforms, and other financial products typically hard to access with traditional banks. Right now, only deobanks like WeFi are pursuing this kind of freedom, flexibility, and control for their users, who they see as participants, not customers. Maksym Sakharov, WeFi’s Group CEO and Co-founder discusses what problems deobanks must solve that neobanks and traditional banks still struggle with, especially when it comes to user autonomy and transparency. He explains that deobanks address the fundamental issue of centralized control inherent in traditional banking systems. With WeFi, users get unparalleled autonomy over their assets, eliminating the risk of arbitrary account freezes or restrictions. How WeFi delivers real financial freedom WeFi is leading a revolution in banking, embodying the deobank model to redesign the system in favor of the users. They plan to achieve this by leveraging decentralized technologies and ideals to deliver full transparency and user empowerment. Key features designed to achieve the deobank dream: Smart contract-based accounts: WeFi accounts are built on smart contracts. This requires users to connect with their own blockchain wallets, but allows them full control over their funds and eliminates intermediaries. Full transparency: Every transaction and operation on WeFi is recorded on the blockchain for full auditability, so that users no longer have to ask “what is happening to my funds”. The system’s integrity is verified at all times. Real-time access: WeFi provides users with immediate access to a range of tools, like high-yield savings accounts, near-instant payment solutions, and lending or borrowing opportunities. Users are empowered and encouraged to manage their finances more actively. Optional custody: Some users may want full control, while others may opt for WeFi’s support with security and account protection. WeFi knows that they have to go further than just convenience, but what does the platform believe makes the deobank approach unique in empowering users with true financial control? Head of Growth, Agne Linge, shared that WeFi’s unique approach lies in its seamless integration of DeFi principles, tools, and opportunities into a sleek UI, offering non-custodial options and transparent on-chain operations, and empowering users to retain complete control over their assets. Rethinking what financial freedom really takes A cool debit card and funky UI are not financial freedom, they are just convenience. They don’t shift the power dynamic, improve ownership, access, or transparency. Only deobanks like WeFi are working on pushing for that change. Now, it’s time to consider a new type of system that works for all users, for financial freedom, for autonomy, and for a new era of financial empowerment. New possibilities, opportunities, and options await.

Key Reasons Revealed,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/why-is-xrp-up-today-key-reasons-revealed/,"In a single New-York trading day, XRP surged almost 10%, mirroring a ferocious bid across the entire digital-asset complex and closing Thursday, 8 May at its highest mark in roughly two weeks. Analysts trace the rally to a cocktail of macro relief, order-book mechanics and renewed alt-season positioning—factors that coincided in a narrow window and magnified one another. Why Is XRP Up Today? The initial spark came from macro headlines. News of a fresh trade accord between Washington and London tempered fears of escalating tariffs, while word of forthcoming minister-level talks between US and Chinese officials signalled a potential thaw in the world’s most consequential bilateral trade standoff. The calmer outlook flipped global-macro desks into a risk-on stance just as New York opened, and Bitcoin responded first, catapulting through the psychologically loaded $100,000 handle on a strong spot demand. The vertical move forced short sellers to buy back exposure; that “short squeeze,” by definition self-reinforcing, spilled rapidly into major altcoins and lifted XRP alongside the broader tape. Related Reading: VWAPs Don’t Lie—XRP Faces Judgment Day At Monthly Support On-chain flow data added a powerful regional twist. Crypto-market analyst Dom (@traderview2) noted that the South-Korean exchange Upbit—historically an XRP bellwether—flipped from net seller to aggressive accumulator in less than forty-eight hours. “Finally Upbit market changed their tune and are the strongest buyers over the last 24 hours,” he posted to X, specifying that Binance followed closely with a net 9 million XRP absorbed. “We are seeing the strongest taste of aggressive market buying that we have seen in over a week. Key is to see it continue.” The volte-face was striking because only 6 May the same commentator had tallied 220 million XRP in cumulative net sales on the KRW pair since 11 April—roughly $500 million of distribution. The reversal underscores how swiftly sentiment can shift when liquidity concentrates in a handful of regional venues. Technicians, meanwhile, drew attention to inter-market breadth. Bitcoin dominance, a gauge that measures the flagship token’s share of total crypto market capitalization, slipped from 65.38% to 64.43%—its sharpest single-day contraction in weeks and a classic tell that capital is rotating into altcoins. Related Reading: XRP Price Repeating History? 2017-Like Rally To Send Price To $10 Dom mapped the shift onto higher-time-frame structure, writing that “TOTAL, the total market cap of crypto, has just hit its uptrend it has held over the last 18 months This also coincides with the POC of the volume profile since late 2023.” Point of Control (POC) levels are where the largest amount of volume has historically traded; rebounds from such nodes often act as springboards. In a follow-up post he added, $TOTAL has regained its 2021 highs—yes, all you needed to do was bid the apex of support and the multi-year uptrend.” The same pivot is visible on XRP’s own chart. Dom highlighted that bulls “just breached the quarterly VWAP for the first time in 50 days… If it can hold as support, I am looking at the ATH VWAP as the next stop (US $2.47).” While that target lies some distance above Thursday’s closing price, the break of a multi-week volume-weighted average price is, in technician parlance, a changing-of-the-guard signal that often forces trend-following algorithms to flip long. At press time, XRP traded at $2.31.

B3 will launch these new futures on June 16. The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) has approved the launching of ETH and SOL futures contracts. They are meant to make it easier for institutions to get into the crypto market without having to worry about how to store their assets. This is a problem that small businesses often have. B3 said that the launch of these goods had been planned since February and that the futures contracts should be available by the end of the year. SOL and ETH futures to be traded in US dollar Unlike Bitcoin futures, these contracts will be traded in US dollars at prices of 0.25 ETH and 5 SOL, respectively. They will also be referenced to the Nasdaq Ether Reference Price and Nasdaq Solana Reference Price indices. Marcos Skistymas, product director at B3, said these products were important for the stock market because they give customers “regulated and secure” crypto instruments. He said, “B3 makes new cryptocurrency derivatives instruments available to meet the growing demand for products linked to crypto assets, bringing more innovation and sophistication to our products, in addition to offering more alternatives to investors familiar with blockchain technology.” Also, the stock exchange announced a drop in Bitcoin futures contract prices, which the CVM had previously approved. Prices for these contracts, which are now at 0.1 BTC, will be decreased to 0.01 BTC. This will make them more accessible to investors, boost market liquidity, and lower trading costs. This comes after the recent rise in Bitcoin’s price which is back to the 100k level. Now, with the launch of Ethereum and Solana futures, as well as involvement in DREX trials and market transparency powered by blockchain, Brazil is getting ready for a more structured and institutionalized crypto ecosystem. This means better trade tools for investors, more control over their crypto assets, and a future where digital finance and traditional markets work together without any problems. B3 hosts several crypto ETFs. B3 has become the place to go for launching new crypto-based investment goods. It is becoming a stronger player in Brazil’s digital finance industry. As of late last month, B3 launched the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fundo de Índice (XRPH11), which is the first spot XRP ETF in the world. The ETF keeps an eye on the spot price of XRP, which is Ripple’s cryptocurrency and invests at least 95% of its net assets in XRP and other connected assets. B3 offers a number of other crypto-related ETFs handled by Hashdex in addition to the XRP ETF. These include ETFs linked to Bitcoin (BITH11), Ethereum (ETHE11), and Solana (SOLH11). Hashdex launched nine crypto ETFs on B3. This means that institutional and advanced investors in Brazil can now choose from a wider range of controlled digital asset investment products. Meanwhile, the crypto market is moving strongly upward. According to on-chain data, Bitcoin has gone up 4% in the last 24 hours to about $103,000. Ether has gone up an amazing 20% to $2,300, and Solana has gone up 11% to $172.

The market decline of XRP and Cardano (ADA) has led traders to review their crypto portfolio investments. MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining market traction despite facing technical and macroeconomic obstacles as several established coins face similar challenges. The price of XRP has dropped by 7% during its recent five-day trading period while hovering at around $2.12. A 77% estimated likelihood exists for XRP spot ETF approval by 2025 which can boost institutional investment. The cryptocurrency platform Cardano (ADA) trades near $0.65 after experiencing a market decline amounting to 8% across the previous week. The charts display negative indicators because ADA trades beneath crucial exponential moving averages and maintains an RSI value at 35. The Cardano ecosystem demonstrates substantial growth through increasing wallet total by 4% and substantial Plutus V3 smart contract deployment reaching more than 500% growth this year. CLICK HERE – 25x GROWTH STILL ON THE TABLE Among recent market trends MAGACOINFINANCE establishes itself in the forefront as a prominent participant. Traders seeking crypto market alternatives seem drawn to MAGACOINFINANCE despite the need to exercise caution when starting new projects. XRP and Cardano: Navigating Market Challenges XRP’s Current Landscape The XRP price has dropped to approximately $2.12 because of multiple reasons. Technical indicators show downward trends for the future price movement. Fewer network transactions point to reduced user participation. Macroeconomic uncertainties affecting investor confidence. The market absorbed profits during a significant market recovery during late 2024. Ripple’s shift toward its RLUSD stablecoin may pull attention from XRP’s original use case. XRP price may recover because of two positive developments: the approval process for spot XRP ETFs and increased XRP fee burning activities which lower the circulating supply. Cardano’s Technical and Fundamental Outlook Current Cardano price stagnation at $0.65 shows that the project cannot overcome resistance between $0.68–$0.72. Technical analysis reveals: The asset stays beneath all major exponential moving averages on the 4-hour trading period. Market trends since early May show a bearish movement through lower highs coupled with lower lows. The RSI indicator demonstrates sustained selling activity by positioning at 35. Cardano’s ecosystem shows promise: During the initial months of 2025 Wallet numbers climbed by 4% above to surpass 5.3 million. User adoption of cryptocurrency continues to rise based on the 2,200 daily new wallets creation data. Smart contract deployment has witnessed an astounding rise since Plutus V3 contracts experienced a growth of more than 500% throughout 2025.

The upwards move has been snubbed at the $0.80 resistance—a barrier that has capped gains since mid-April. With a total of $18 million PI tokens scheduled to unlock over the weekend, typically a slow period for crypto, inflationary pressure could weigh on price action. Pi token unlock schedule.

The Pi Network price currently stands 40% below the pattern’s $1 target. If PI cannot build the momentum to clear this level, or loses the $70 resistance, it could remain range-bound between $0.55 and $0.80 until a substantial catalyst emerges.

44382636,https://nulltx.com/?p=149244,1746807170,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Cold Wallet Vs Dogecoin & Solana in Privacy,https://nulltx.com/cold-wallet-vs-dogecoin-solana-in-privacy/,"The crypto market evolves rapidly, making careful selection of digital assets more critical than ever. Due to recent price movements and renewed trading interest, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) have regained attention. Both coins reflect short-term sentiment and market cycles. In contrast, Cold Wallet ($CWT) introduces a distinct value proposition. It prioritises user control and data protection with the potential of 4900% gains. Through its governance model, Cold Wallet enables its holders to influence key decisions, shaping the platform’s direction and advancing the long-term vision of a privacy-centric Web3 infrastructure. Dogecoin Eyes $1.385, But Volatility Remains a Risk Dogecoin has regained momentum, trading near $0.42 with a market cap close to $60 billion. This surge followed the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency, supported by Elon Musk. Technical analysis shows a cup and handle pattern, indicating further gains. Analysts expect a short-term rise to $0.571 by April 2025, and possibly $1.385 if the market cap reaches $203 billion. While trends appear favorable, DOGE remains sensitive to sentiment and market swings. Its outlook hinges on sustained interest and volume, making ongoing price action crucial to track in the coming months. Solana Builds Momentum Despite Bearish Wedge, Eyes Q3 Highs Solana bounced from $115 in early 2025, forming a double bottom pattern similar to its 2022 trend. This setup often signals a potential reversal, with analysts expecting a move toward the $160 to $180 range by May. Although the current rising wedge pattern is typically seen as bearish, strong trading volume and upward momentum may support continued gains. If SOL moves past the $180 level, it could retest its all time high in the third quarter of 2025. At present, SOL is near $144.99, with recent highs of $146.16 and lows around $134.20. Cold Wallet: Control and Privacy for the Web3 Era Cold Wallet’s Web3 approach centers on privacy and user control. Those holding $CWT can vote on platform decisions, including new features, blockchain integrations, and partnerships. This governance structure gives the community direct influence over the platform’s future direction. Rather than following trends, Cold Wallet builds a secure foundation for long-term use in a changing digital world. Currently in Stage 3 of its crypto presale , $CWT is priced at $0.00728. The projected listing price is around $0.351, marking a notable difference that reflects confidence in the project’s utility and market readiness. This early phase offers access to a platform designed to meet the growing demand for digital privacy. What sets Cold Wallet apart is its zero-knowledge architecture. It avoids IP tracking, skips behavior logging, and does not collect user data. Instead, it ensures access without surveillance. It functions like a regular wallet but is built for security, offering protection often missing in other platforms. With data exposure becoming a critical issue across Web3, Cold Wallet provides a clear solution. It addresses risks at the infrastructure level rather than treating privacy as an add-on. This proactive stance makes it a valuable option for those seeking real protection in decentralized environments. As digital threats grow, Cold Wallet is positioned to lead in privacy-first innovation. Final Thoughts While many crypto assets focus on short-term gains, Cold Wallet addresses long-term priorities like privacy and user control. Dogecoin and Solana show momentum, but Cold Wallet builds the foundation for a privacy-focused Web3. Holding $CWT offers real governance power, allowing community input on platform growth. Unlike projects driven by speculation, it targets practical needs with a clear structure. Privacy continues to grow in importance, and Cold Wallet’s decentralized model positions it strongly in today’s landscape. By combining privacy, function, and user choice, it stands out as a serious project built to meet the future demands of digital ecosystems.

According to Nansen data, while Bitcoin and Ethereum rose, whales bought the most from altcoins named WBTC, Chainlink (LINK), Ondo Finance (ONDO), LDO and PEPE.

While the altcoin called WBTC ranked first in the list of most purchased cryptocurrencies, LINK, one of the most popular altcoins of whales, ranked second.

New Player Changes The Narrative,https://nulltx.com/are-ethereum-meme-coins-dead-amid-solanas-pump-fun-dominance-new-player-changes-the-narrative/,"Are Ethereum Meme Coins Dead Amid Solana’s Pump.Fun Dominance? New Player Changes The Narrative As the meme coin battle escalates between Ethereum (ETH) meme coins and Solana’s (SOL) Pump.fun’s explosive activity, a surprising player has entered the arena, engineering trends. While analysts focus on Solana’s (SOL) Pump.fun’s supremacy, one new platform is quietly rewriting the meme economy’s next chapter. Solana’s (SOL) Pump.Fun’s Meteoric Ascent Reshapes Ethereum’s (ETH) Meme Coin Dynamics The rise of Pump.fun on the Solana (SOL) blockchain has been nothing short of seismic. As of 2025, Pump.fun has made over $296 million in transaction fees, surpassing Ethereum’s (ETH) $249 million for the same period. Solana’s (SOL) technical advantages are low fees, near-instant transactions, and no-code token launches. These advantages have fueled its momentum, allowing over 10 million tokens to emerge via Pump.fun, with daily launches crossing 30,000. But not everyone is cheering. Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum (ETH) co-founder, criticized the chaotic influx of low-effort projects, citing spam, fraud, and the erosion of trust. Although appealing, Pump.fun’s fair-launch model strips away safeguards that Ethereum-based meme coin investors have come to expect. This opens a dangerous gap between hype and utility. Ethereum (ETH) Meme Coins Remain Strong Despite Pump.Fun’s Surge, But Momentum Is Shifting Elsewhere Despite the frenzy surrounding Pump.fun, Ethereum (ETH) remains a meme coin stronghold. Shiba Inu (SHIB) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , and Pepe (PEPE) still command immense trading volumes. Ethereum’s (ETH) infrastructure is mature, its tooling robust, and its developer ecosystem unmatched. But the truth is that the narrative is shifting. Solana’s (SOL) Pump.fun has captured a new generation of traders, meme coin enthusiasts, and fast-profit seekers. However, Ethereum-based coins are also evolving. FloppyPepe (FPPE) enters this changing space, a meme coin engineered for virality and value. While Solana (SOL) rides waves of speculation, this meme coin is crafting a different identity: one backed by AI, community incentives, and an artistically iconic heritage from Matt Furie’s universe. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) Standard: Meme Utility + Matt Furie’s Legacy FloppyPepe (FPPE) blends meme utility with cultural firepower. Using Matt Furie’s creative legacy, the meme coin arrives with pre-loaded relevance. This meme coin is strategically positioned at the intersection of humor, history, and high-tech futures, not as an anonymous launchpad token. Already, FloppyX , the AI-powered Video Bot, and Meme-o-Matic , the instant meme generator, are live in beta on Telegram. The meme coin sector is moving fast, but the FloppyPepe (FPPE) platform is faster. With a staking protocol that rewards loyalty and redistributes value through its 3% Floppynomics fee, every transaction fuels deflation, community growth, and charitable causes. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) Memevannah And AI Movement At just $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is converting observers into early adopters. In a presale that shocked even the most seasoned crypto analysts, this platform raised $907,200 in 24 hours. Its SolidProof audit has already bolstered investor confidence, while its meme-forward branding and AI roots are attracting traders who know how to spot the next breakout before it hits centralized exchanges. Referral rewards are fueling this momentum. Every new user who joins the Memevannah rally earns the inviter FloppyPepe (FPPE) tokens. As AI cryptocurrencies surge toward a projected $66 billion market cap by 2025, this platform is emerging as the people’s AI token. With a projected AI market size of $747.91 billion by 2030, this meme coin is building for the next phase of AI-driven crypto. Now Is The Time To Use The Bonus Code FLOPPY80 As Ethereum (ETH) meme coin dominance teeters and Solana (SOL) continues its Pump.fun parade, a new narrative is cementing its place. Airdrops and community campaigns actively reward early engagement. To ignite this fire, FloppyPepe (FPPE) now offers new buyers an 80% bonus using the exclusive code FLOPPY80. While Solana’s (SOL) Pump.fun ecosystem roars forward, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is proving that Ethereum (ETH) meme coins aren’t dead; this platform is writing the next chapter of the meme coin era.

This remarkable transformation has stirred interest in the crypto world. As the market buzzes, there’s speculation about the next big token with immense growth potential. A new player, Codename:Pepe crypto, claims it’s designed for massive profits and is attracting attention. Based on the success of similar coins, Codename:Pepe crypto aims to capitalize on the hype. It’s not just another meme coin; it’s promising revolutionary gains using advanced intelligence. With its AI-driven approach, this project could be the key to unlocking significant profits. Enthusiasts are eyeing its potential to replicate PEPE’s impressive trajectory. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to hunt down the juiciest meme coins, predict market trends, and deliver exclusive AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO kicks in. Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains. Every great agent needs an elite organization backing them. That’s where $AGNT comes in. Holding $AGNT unlocks membership in a top-secret DAO, where operatives (investors) gain access to classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on high-stakes missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in a top-secret DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO fund will be allocated to those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring the spoils of the trade go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited.

Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount Pepe (PEPE) Eyes Potential Breakout Amidst Support and Resistance Levels Pepe (PEPE) is currently trading between $0.0000076437 and $0.0000088577. This range indicates a period of consolidation where buyers and sellers are finding equilibrium. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000096353, and the closest support is at $0.0000072073. If the price moves above the resistance at $0.0000096353, it could signal the beginning of an upward trend. A breakout here might attract more interest, pushing the price higher. Conversely, a drop below the support at $0.0000072073 could indicate a potential downward movement. The proximity to the resistance level suggests there’s potential for growth. Traders may see this as an opportunity if the price starts to climb toward that point. Without specific data on price changes over the past weeks or months, it’s challenging to predict the exact movement, but the current levels are critical points to watch. Monitoring these support and resistance levels can provide insights into PEPE’s next direction. A significant move in either direction could set the tone for its short-term performance. Conclusion In conclusion, while tokens like PEPE have shown remarkable growth, their short-term potential may be waning amid market saturation. Investors are now looking toward new projects that offer more than just meme appeal, seeking innovative features and stronger profit potential. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a promising contender by leveraging true intelligence for maximum profits. By utilizing advanced artificial intelligence to analyze market trends and automate trading, it aims to help investors navigate the chaotic meme coin landscape effectively. Its community-driven model and capped token supply position it as a potential candidate for significant gains in the current bullish market.

As investors search for the next game-changing presale in Web3, the emergence of AI-native platforms like Nexchain offers a compelling proposition: scalable infrastructure, lightning-fast transaction speeds, and intelligent automation on-chain. With just days left before the current round ends, Nexchain’s momentum is unmistakable. The Web3 community is starting to pay close attention, especially as the platform prepares for its next major listing phase. But what exactly is Nexchain, and why is this presale gaining so much traction? Nexchain: Powering AI in Web3 with Next-Gen Blockchain At its core, Nexchain.ai is an innovative Layer-1 blockchain infrastructure project that merges artificial intelligence with decentralized processing to create faster, smarter, and more scalable dApps. Built to solve critical issues in blockchain architecture, namely transaction speed, AI data interoperability, and network congestion, Nexchain leverages a proprietary proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Unlike other crypto presales and traditional blockchains that suffer under the weight of high-frequency data (especially from AI workloads), Nexchain enables real-time AI model execution directly on-chain. This not only enhances decision making when it comes to development of Web3 applications, but also places Nexchain in front when it comes to AI led blockchain platforms. The use cases are vast, ranging from autonomous DeFi bots and AI-powered gaming to decentralized prediction markets and high-frequency trading tools. In a rapidly evolving AI economy, Nexchain stands out by fusing decentralized trust with intelligent automation. How to Buy Nexchain Tokens (NEX) Getting involved in the Nexchain crypto presale is refreshingly easy with only 3 easy steps. Visit the Official Site: Head to Nexchain.ai to access the live presale dashboard. Create an Account: Sign up with your wallet and email address. Complete KYC verification, as Nexchain prioritizes trust and compliance, so identity verification is a must. Buy NEX Tokens: Choose from accepted payment options such as ETH, USDT, or credit card, and purchase your NEX tokens directly. Your tokens are delivered instantly, ensuring ownership from the moment of purchase. It’s a frictionless process designed to welcome both retail and institutional investors into the Nexchain ecosystem. Breaking Down the Nexchain Presale 2025 The Nexchain crypto presale has already secured over $1.3 million in contributions, signaling strong investor confidence as the next big crypto ICO of 2025. With a multi-phase model and bonus incentives for early participants, the presale offers a strategic entry point before exchange listings drive wider exposure. Current Price: $0.038 per NEX (Stage 10) Upon listing: $0.30 per NEX Total ROI: 789% Total Supply: 2 billion tokens Presale Allocation: 20% to the public Accepted Currencies: ETH, USDT, Fiat (via credit/debit) With AI integration becoming the norm in DeFi, GameFi, and data services, the potential for value appreciation is substantial. The presale’s transparency and security protocols have further boosted investor trust. Smart contracts have been audited by leading firms, and Nexchain’s KYC requirement reduces the risk of bad actors participating in the early rounds. According to its roadmap, listings on tier-1 centralized exchanges (CEXs) and DEXs are scheduled for Q3 2025, coinciding with the rollout of its native AI protocol for developers. The CEO, Logan Reynolds, has also boasted about the CertiK smart contract audit that has given a CertiK Skynet score of 75, which is commendable. Unlocking Nexchain’s Core Features and Real Utility Nexchain is enabling possibilities in blockchain technology that seem impossible, having a capacity to do an amazing 400,000 transactions per second. This performance is driven by intelligent optimization systems that allow multiple transactions to happen at once, without any delays or bottlenecks. One of the key strengths of Nexchain is its ability to connect with other blockchain networks. Thanks to advanced bridging tools, it allows developers and decentralized applications to interact easily across different platforms, making cross-network communication smooth and efficient. In terms of cost and sustainability, Nexchain is ahead of the curve. It offers extremely low transaction fees, just $0.001, and uses modern technology to keep energy consumption low. As part of its ongoing crypto presale, Nexchain is showcasing these groundbreaking utilities to early investors, highlighting its readiness to serve real-world applications with unmatched efficiency. Beyond the tech, through decentralized governance, every holder of the Nexchain token gets a say in how the platform develops. Plus, earnings from the network are shared fairly among participants, creating a sense of shared ownership and reward. Conclusion: Is Nexchain the Best Crypto Presale of May 2025? As we approach mid-2025, Nexchain has already distinguished itself as a top-tier crypto presale of May, combining real AI functionality, high-speed blockchain infrastructure, and a transparent growth roadmap. With $1.3 million raised and ambitious targets ahead, the project is aligned with the future of both decentralized finance and artificial intelligence. Whether you’re looking to invest early in a transformative blockchain or seeking a platform capable of running AI-native dApps, Nexchain offers a rare opportunity. The fusion of next-gen tech with community-first values places this presale among the most promising of the year. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

The company's break-even Bitcoin price soared to an unrealistic $277k per coin, highlighting severe operational inefficiencies and unsustainable cost structures. Despite a 2.7x price to forward sales multiple at $100k BTC, ongoing dilution and poor capital management make TeraWulf a poor investment choice. Downgrading WULF to 'sell' due to persistent losses, fresh ATM, and better alternatives in both HPC services and Bitcoin mining sectors. Five months ago, in my prior coverage of the stock, I called TeraWulf ( WULF ) a 'hold' and spent time on the company's pivot to HPC/AI revenue. Though I generally viewed the HPC/AI segment as a necessary revenue diversification strategy, I noted what I viewed to be a large overvaluation of the equity. Data by YCharts Fast-forward to May, and we observe an equity that is trailing the biggest company in the sector, as well as the industry as a whole. At least some of this under-performance is likely due to the HPC/AI narrative potentially breaking down . That's a potential long-term problem for TeraWulf but not the focus of today's article. In this update, we'll look at what I view to be an abysmal start to 2025 for TeraWulf based on the company's Q1 report. Top and Bottom Lines For the quarter ended March 2025, TeraWulf reported $34.4 million in revenue from mining Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) - a year-over-year reduction of 19%. To be sure, the April 2024 halving is partly to blame for this decline. However, the price of BTC spent all of Q1 2025 at a substantially higher level than Q1 2024. BTC Daily Chart (TrendSpider) Investors learned from the report that the company mined just 372 BTC in the quarter. As has been industry standard for years, TeraWulf had been providing monthly production updates during most of 2023 and 2024. That is apparently no longer going to happen this year as TeraWulf stopped sharing those releases starting with the January 2025 data: $ in millions Q1 2025 Q1 2024 YoY Revenue $34,405 $42,433 -18.9% Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) $24,553 $14,408 70.4% Opex $2,892 $1,673 72.9% SG&A $50,144 $14,909 236.3% Depreciation $15,574 $15,088 3.2% Loss/gain on fair value of digital currency, net $870 -$1,329 -165.5% Total costs and expenses $94,033 $44,749 110.1% Operating loss -$59,628 -$2,316 2474.6% Source: TeraWulf After assessing the cost of revenue, opex, and depreciation, TeraWulf's operating loss in the quarter was over $59.6 million. And this is not a result of a revaluation loss on digital assets held. Rather, simply by operating the business and paying themselves handsomely, TeraWulf managed to increase the quarterly operating loss to the company by almost 2,500% year over year. The SG&A is the glaring problem here. SG&A as a percentage of revenue comes in just shy of 150% during the quarter. This moonshot in SG&A year over year comes with $38.7 million in stock-based compensation. Which was a 458% increase year over year and more than double the $16.7 million in stock-based comp from Q4 2024. The sad thing is, even if you eliminate stock-based comp entirely, TeraWulf still lost $21 million in the quarter. And keep in mind, this company has never produced a single quarter of positive earnings per share. Break-even and Valuation To further illustrate what, I think, is an absurdly high level of stock-based comp in Q1, consider what the company's break-even Bitcoin price is over the last five quarters. Again, this is a very simple metric that aims to include all expenses and costs of revenue against the BTC mined in a quarter to determine what would be the Gold-miner equivalent of an 'all-in sustaining cost.' What's not surprising is seeing this break-even figure moving higher quarter after quarter. What is more surprising is seeing just how outrageously high TeraWulf's break-even price was in Q1: Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Cost of Revenues $14,400,000 $13,900,000 $14,700,000 $19,600,000 $34,405,000 Total Opex $26,500,000 $27,100,000 $28,700,000 $49,900,000 $68,610,000 BTC Mined 1,056 711 555 423 372 Breakeven Price $38,731 $57,665 $78,198 $164,303 $276,922 Source: Author's calculations In this table, total opex includes depreciation and SG&A. Given the putrid year-over-year decline in BTC mined in Q1 coupled with the enormous stock-based comp, Bitcoin's price would have had to be $277k per coin to produce a quarter of positive operations. Yet, it's still worth wondering if the worst has now been priced in already. At a $100k BTC price, WULF is only trading at a 2.7x price to forward sales multiple using Q1's BTC production figure: Stock WULF Market Capitalization $1,189,258,207 3-Month Avg Production 372 FWD P/S At $85k BTC 3.13 FWD P/S At $100k BTC 2.66 FWD P/S At $150k BTC 1.78 FWD P/S At $200k BTC 1.33 Source: Author's calculations That's admittedly not expensive relative to the sector median. But keep in mind, the company just announced yet another $200 million ATM and has already diluted the outstanding common stock by 32% year over year. To be sure, TeraWulf has authorization for another $200 million in common stock repurchases - but given the management of this same capital tool last year, I'm not terribly optimistic going forward. Closing Summary Shareholders can likely make any excuse they'd like for why the stock has under-performed, but the reality is very simple; TeraWulf issued convertible notes to overpay for its own stock last year and has paid out over $55 million in stock-based compensation in just six months while the company continues to lose millions of dollars quarter after quarter. While I'll freely admit that the worst could be priced in at $3 per share, ultimately this comes down to opportunity cost for me. And unfortunately, this is not a company that, I think, is worth even a speculative flier at this point. If you want to invest in an HPC services company, there are likely better options. If you want to invest in a Bitcoin mining company, there are likely better options. And if you want to invest in a company that is a hybrid of the two, there are likely better options. And all of these ideas may still under-perform BTC when it is all said and done. Traders might be able to play some sort of dead cat bounce in WULF with BTC back above $100k, but I'm downgrading WULF to a 'sell' longer term.",BTC-USD|WULF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-09 17:28:44

Now, with market sentiment recovering, experts believe another explosive breakout could be on the horizon and XRP, Cardano (ADA), and the rising newcomer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are topping prediction charts. XRP is gaining strength with growing institutional backing, while ADA is positioning for major DeFi growth amid network upgrades. But it’s Mutuum Finance, that’s drawing bold Solana comparisons thanks to its disruptive dual lending model. Mutuum Finance is currently in Presale Phase 4 which is over 60% sold out, already raking in over $7.9 million with over 9,600 investors participating. With over half the phase sold and public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 4 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 140% by the time the token hits exchanges. One of these could be 2025’s Solana and smart investors are already placing bets. XRP and ADA Gear Up for Breakouts as Market Eyes 2025 Altcoin Leaders XRP and Cardano (ADA) are both entering a critical phase with analysts watching closely to see which will echo Solana’s historic 2021 run. XRP currently trading around $2.20 is fueled by renewed institutional interest and increasing optimism following positive developments in its legal battle with the SEC. Meanwhile ADA priced near $0.67 is drawing attention for its growing DeFi ecosystem and upcoming scalability upgrades which could reignite its momentum. Though their approaches differ, XRP focusing on cross-border payments and ADA on decentralized infrastructure, both are poised for significant upside. Still, some experts suggest a lesser-known coin like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could outpace them both. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today’s $0.025, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A Phase 5 20% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.03. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there’s plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-cap DeFi plays. Spurring Early Adoption with Community Rewards Mutuum Finance encourages community involvement by launching a $100,000 giveaway, where ten users will win $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. A referral bonus scheme incentivizes users to bring new members on board, promoting organic growth. The project’s top 50 holders also stand to gain bonus token rewards if they can maintain their ranks. Experts are predicting massive breakouts for XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and many believe MUTM could mirror Solana’s legendary 2021 rally. Currently in Phase 4 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already raised over $7.9 million from 9,600 investors, with 60% of the phase already sold out. The price is still $0.025, but Phase 5 will see a 20% price increase to $0.03, setting early investors up for potential gains of 140% before the token even hits exchanges. This could be the next Solana don’t miss your chance to get in at the ground floor while the price is still low.

While XRP price forecasts hit $1,000 and Dogecoin (DOGE) eyes $0.20 with renewed momentum, Unstaked is where the real shift is happening. In just 24 hours, over $1 million poured into Unstaked, pushing its presale total past $3 million. At $0.007535, $UNSD isn’t just a low entry, it’s a launchpad for utility. Post-listing, $UNSD will activate autonomous AI agents that grow communities, run engagement, and earn based on a verified “Proof of Intelligence” model. With a confirmed $0.1819 listing price, buyers across every presale batch are locking in up to 700% gains before trading even starts. This isn’t a meme play, it’s the top crypto to buy if you want to earn, not just hold. Unstaked: Tokens That Work for You Most tokens just sit in your wallet. $UNSD does the opposite, and right now, it’s breaking out in real time. Unstaked just raised over $1 million in 24 hours, pushing its total presale haul to more than $3 million and igniting serious momentum. The project is currently in stage 6, with the token priced at just $0.007535, offering early buyers a shot at 700% gains before listing, and analysts are eyeing long-term targets of $4+. Unstaked isn’t just selling a token, it’s building an AI-powered task force that users will deploy after launch. These agents will run community growth, marketing, and engagement on autopilot across platforms like Telegram and X. Every move they make will be logged on-chain using Proof of Intelligence, so performance is fully auditable and rewards are earned, not guessed. The kicker? These agents will cost just $10–$25/month, offering up to 100x cost savings over human help. Scaling is instant, ownership is on-chain, and your $UNSD becomes the engine of a decentralized AI workforce. With 60% of the 6 billion token supply open to public buyers and no private round dilution, this is the kind of setup that early-stage legends are made of. Unstaked isn’t just another crypto presale . It’s your front-row ticket to the AI utility wave before it floods the market. XRP Price Outlook Backed by Utility, Not Just Hype The XRP price outlook is heating up with fresh speculation that the token could reach triple or even four-digit valuations. While $1,000 may sound extreme, XRP isn’t just betting on hype, it’s targeting real-world use in cross-border payments. If it captures even 10% of SWIFT’s $5 trillion daily volume, analysts say XRP could hit $27–$50 based purely on transactional demand. Add in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity system replacing a slice of the $27 trillion in dormant Nostro/Vostro accounts, and price targets of $80–$100 start to make sense. What’s really pushing the XRP price outlook higher are potential partnerships with over 40 central banks, and talk of Ripple eventually becoming a licensed financial institution. Some analysts are even modeling XRP into global derivatives settlements. If just 0.1% of that market flows through XRP, the long-theorized $1,000 price point wouldn’t be just a fantasy, it would be math. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast Targets $0.20 Breakout The Dogecoin (DOGE) price forecast just got a serious boost as DOGE surged past $0.17 on renewed optimism around U.S.–China trade talks and fresh funding news. Technical signals look strong, the coin is breaking out of a falling wedge pattern, with bullish MACD crossovers and rising open interest pointing to a push toward $0.20. If it hits key resistance at $0.1761, nearly $13 million in short liquidations could trigger even more upside. On the fundamentals side, DOGE is riding a sentiment shift fueled by a $6.9 million funding round for DogeOS from Polychain. Derivatives data shows rising open interest, and the memecoin’s 24/7 community support keeps volume steady. The Dogecoin (DOGE) price forecast is aiming even higher, with Fibonacci levels marking $0.2299 and $0.2673 as next targets. If macro conditions and FOMC clarity hold, DOGE could rally fast, especially with whales and traders already positioning ahead of time. Final Thoughts The XRP price outlook is now pointing to targets as high as $1,000, fueled by real-world adoption and central bank partnerships. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin (DOGE) price forecast is aiming for $0.20 this week, with technical breakouts and funding news driving bullish sentiment. But if you’re only focused on price, you’re missing what’s next. Unstaked is bringing something different. The $UNSD presale isn’t just another token launch, it’s a shift in what tokens can do. Under development now, Unstaked’s AI agents will go live after $UNSD hits exchanges, giving every holder the power to deploy digital agents that engage, grow, and work online. All actions will be tracked on-chain through Proof of Intelligence, making every result yours. This is more than hype, it’s one of the top cryptos to buy if you want a token that actually works for you. But that only happens if you get in before the listing.

The recent drop in fees on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has boosted investor confidence and increased network usage. According to CoinMarketCap data, BNB is trading at $634, up 3% in 24 hours. With a bullish pattern forming and positive momentum across the crypto market, BNB could soon break past $700 and possibly hit new all-time highs (ATH). CZ’s Proposal Cuts BSC Fees by 90% A few days ago, Binance founder Changpeng (CZ) Zhao proposed a sharp drop in gas fees on the BNB Chain. That proposal has now passed, cutting fees from 1 gwei to just 0.1 gwei. The lowered fees have made the network more attractive. More users are now turning to the BSC, and this increased activity is helping push BNB’s price higher. This 90% reduction is a big deal, especially compared to Ethereum (ETH), where fees remain around 4 gwei. On the other hand, the Ethereum blockchain recorded a major upgrade that could make its network faster, cheaper, and more efficient. Developers have recently proposed raising the gas limit by 66%, from 36 million to 60 million units. BSC Network Usage Hits One-Year High The BNB Chain has reached a key milestone following the reduction in gas fees. Activity on the network is now at its highest level in a year. According to DeFiLlama, the Total Value Locked (TVL) has climbed above $8 billion, the highest level since January 2024. At the same time, decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes on the BSC reached a whopping $2.12 billion in one day, a six-week high. All these developments point to growing trust in the BNB ecosystem. Binance Coin Bullish Patterns Hint at More Gains Technical indicators also support BNB’s price action. A double-bottom pattern has formed on the daily chart. If BNB can break the $644 resistance line called the neckline, the pattern will confirm a bullish trend. Notably, the target price for this breakout is $732. If BNB hits that level, it could go even higher, aiming for $1,000. Most recently, analysts at Standard Chartered forecasted that BNB could rise from its current price of around $600 to $2,775 by the end of 2028. Another sign supporting these bullish predictions is that BNB has broken out of a symmetrical triangle, a pattern often seen before strong upward moves. Key indicators also support the bullish outlook. The MACD and Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms suggest that bears are losing control, and momentum is shifting in favor of the bulls. This aligns with the broader upward trend in the crypto market, where Bitcoin (BTC) has now hit over $100,000. As the flagship cryptocurrency leads, altcoins like BNB are attracting strong gains.

These containers carry goods from companies like Amazon, Home Depot, Ikea, Ralph Lauren, and Tractor Supply. According to Marine Traffic , seven of the ships left China after the announcement of the 145%-plus tariffs and are now at the country’s two busiest ports for container traffic from Asia. The goods inside the containers are a wide range of consumer goods. Now, consumers are about to feel the weight of tariffs. Five more freight ships are expected to arrive in the next few days. The consumer products in the shipping containers Trump said on Friday, before important trade talks, that he was ready to lower taxes on China to 80%. Trump wrote on Truth Social , “80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B.” He was referring to the meeting this weekend in Switzerland that was set up between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and someone from China. However, 80% is still a rate that many businesses would probably consider to be very high, but it is better than 145% tariffs 145% tariffs will still hit many consumer products. Amazon brought in a lot of different goods for sellers, like freezers, deep fryers, mouse pads, bookshelves, living room sofas, housewares, clothing, and furniture. Tractor Supply ships portable drum fans, yard tools, and men’s work boots. In addition, Home Depot has been able to get lamps and ceiling fans through customs. There is also furniture from Ikea, swim caps and goggles from Speedo, tissue boxes from Procter & Gamble, printed circuit boards from Samsung, microwaves, and parts for refrigerators. In response, Amazon said in an email that it is working with its “broad, varied range of valued selling partners in their store to support them in adapting to the evolving environment. It maintains a broad selection and low prices for customers. On the other hand, Home Depot is taking it easy before releasing its quarterly results. A Home Depot spokesperson said, “We, together with our vendors, are monitoring developments and will work closely to manage with the goal of being our customers’ advocate for value.” The number of freight ships and shipping containers coming from China to the US has dropped Since the tariffs were announced in early April, the number of freight ships and shipping containers coming from China to the US has dropped by a huge amount. For the months of April and May, Sea Intelligence found that there were 90 empty sailings on the trade paths between Asia and North America on both the East Coast and West Coast. Forty-eight of those scrapped trips were run by the Ocean Alliance, a group of freight ships that includes Chinese-owned and -operated COSCO and OOCL, Taiwanese-owned Evergreen, and French-owned CMA. Logistics companies and ocean carriers say bookings are down anywhere from 30% to 50%. Ocean carriers are using smaller ships to move trade because companies have stopped ordering goods to be manufactured, and there are fewer containers to fill. Two freight companies that use smaller ships between Asia and the West Coast of North America are MSC, the world’s biggest ocean carrier, and the Gemini Alliance. Also, Intelligence data that looks at the effects of delayed sailings and vessel changes shows that MSC’s container capacity has dropped by 28% year-over-year. Ocean Alliance’s container capacity has also dropped by 26% year-over-year.

Despite the skepticism surrounding ambitious forecasts, the analyst suggests that XRP could eventually rise to $1,000, referencing its exceptional performance during the 2017–2018 bull cycle. XRP Price Behaviour and Analyst Optimism Over the past quarter, XRP has maintained a largely sideways trading pattern, fluctuating between localized highs of around $3 and lows near $1.60. This extended consolidation has fueled both doubt and hope within the community. While some market observers view this stagnation as a signal of limited growth, others, including analysts such as BarriC , remain optimistic about XRP’s long-term trajectory. People will always say something can’t be done…. Until it happens It happened with $XRP in 2017-2018 when it went from $0.006 to $3.80 And it will happen with #XRP going from $2 to $1,000 — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 7, 2025 Matthew Brienen , Chief Operating Officer of CryptoGuard, is among those who believe XRP could eventually reach between $100 and $1,000 over the next decade. His outlook aligns with other bullish commentators who keep referencing XRP’s historical precedent to support long-term growth scenarios. Reviewing XRP 2017–2018 Bull Run BarriC’s perspective is rooted in XRP’s dramatic performance in the previous market cycle. In early 2017, XRP was trading at approximately $0.0055. Over the following nine months, it experienced substantial gains, culminating in an all-time high of $3.80 in January 2018. This climb represented a staggering increase of nearly 69,000%. Notably, the asset did not follow a straight trajectory to its peak. Initial momentum carried the price up to nearly $0.40 by May 2017, followed by a period of consolidation that lasted until late in the year. The next leg of the rally began in November and drove XRP to its record high in January 2018. BarriC uses this past surge to argue that sharp, unexpected price increases are not without precedent for the token. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Skepticism and Market Cap Considerations Despite the optimistic outlook, many experts remain unconvinced that XRP can replicate this level of growth, particularly to the extent of reaching $1,000. Critics highlight the issue of market capitalization. At that price, XRP’s fully diluted valuation would approach $100 trillion, several times higher than the total market capitalization of gold, which is widely regarded as one of the most valuable global assets. Financial commentator Rajat Soni has strongly dismissed such projections, stating that even targeting $100 is fundamentally unrealistic. He has gone so far as to question the rationality of those who believe such valuations are feasible. While projections of XRP reaching $1,000 are widely resisted by financial analysts, proponents like BarriC remain confident that history could repeat itself. Drawing parallels to the asset’s 2017–2018 rally, they maintain that what once seemed improbable ultimately became reality. Whether XRP can achieve similar results again remains a subject of intense debate within the crypto community.

The partnership involves Horizon, an institutional-grade decentralized finance products platform launched by Aave Labs earlier this year. Aave ( AAVE ) founder Stani Kulechov said in an announcement on May 9 that the new market will target qualified users, allowing them to borrow stablecoins with their tokenized real world assets as collateral. “I‘m pleased to announce Horizon’s strategic collaboration with Ant Digital Technologies, one of the largest blockchain technology services providers in the world,” Kuchelov posted on X. “We will work with them on a custom RWA market on Ethereum.” Aave Labs introduced Horizon in March, eyeing it as a custom RWA platform designed to bridge decentralized finance and institutional adoption. The Ethereum-based protocol’s first product is tokenized money market funds. Institutional investors can use the MMFs as collateral when looking to tap into stablecoin liquidity.

The investigation kicked off after wallets known to belong to Yi continued selling tokens despite the published obituary. The founder of Zerebro and meme token creator Jeffy Yu is alive and well. He was doxed and discovered in his parents’ home, following an investigation by the San Francisco Chronicle. Search for Yu commenced after doubts were raised about his death, and his wallets kept swapping tokens in the past day. ‘ I’ve been doxxed. I’ve been harassed. If you can find me, other people can find me ,” Yu said to The Chronicle. ‘ Now I have to move my parents out of here this week. ’ Yu confused meme token degens, after seemingly taking his own life on a Pump.fun livestream, another shock-value attempt at fame and pumpkin a token. Yu had just launched a new token, LLJEFFY, which then entered a period of volatility. After the livestream, on-chain investigators connected the current LLJEFFY creator wallets to previously owned addresses, that used the confusion to dump ZEREBRO. The gruesome stunt repeats a previous incident where a trader really died during livestream, prompting Pump.fun to remove the feature for months. This time, Yu’s stunt and token selling angered the meme community even more, while actively dumping on the market. Estimates see Yu liquidating up to $1.4M of his assets. On May 6, LLJEFFY started out at $0.001, rising as high as $0.31 before crashing. Following the scandal and the doxing, LLJEFFY fell back to $0.01. LLJEFFY spiked and crashed back to $0.01, and was taken over by the community to keep the history of Yu’s actions. | Source: DexScreener ZEREBRO traded at $0.04, close to its lower range. Following the faked death scandal, the @zerebro0x account was suspended. ZEREBRO was a former star among AI tokens , inviting inflows at the end of 2024 and in early 2025. Jeffy Yu crosses the boundary of crypto influencing While volatile, the projects of Jeffy Yu fit into the overall ethos of hot meme and AI agent markets. The crypto community considered Yu one of the top influencers and content producers. https://x.com/moneypolyx/status/1920794345931719150 AI agent and meme token stunts are not unknown in crypto space, ranging from harmless fun to fake charity or outright rug pulls. By industry standards, Yu’s rug pull is relatively small, though it happened at a time where meme tokens lost some of their irrational hype. LLJEFFY rallied up to a valuation of $30M at its peak, relatively low compared to the first wave of the meme market. As a paradox, LLJEFFY did not go to zero, but turned into a community token. Unlike rug pulls, the online fame of Yu means the community may not forget the rug pull attempt and the lies so quickly. The new community sent out a message the asset would continue, as a legacy to Yu’s fake story. https://x.com/JeffyYuOG/status/1920864564423655897 Despite the market cap losses, Yu mostly earned from ZEREBRO sales, and posted losses on LLJEFFY. On-chain data showed Yu actually bought some of the token’s supply and sent it to a burn address.

A data-driven look at the contenders,https://crypto.news/which-crypto-could-boom-in-2025/,"As the market recalibrates post-halving and post-tariff, which crypto could boom in 2025 as volatility, liquidity, and adoption collide? Table of Contents Which crypto could boom in 2025? The core pillars — Bitcoin and Ethereum High-potential altcoins — Solana and Sui Emerging trends — AI and memecoins Strategies for investing in 2025’s crypto boom Which crypto could boom in 2025? The year 2025 is beginning to reflect a shift away from short-lived excitement and toward deeper changes that are steadily influencing how crypto finds its place within the broader financial system. After the sharp rise in 2024, which saw the market cap cross $3 trillion, attention is now turning to whether that momentum is sustainable and what deeper forces are quietly steering the direction. One of the most consequential developments is the policy recalibration underway in the U.S. With Donald Trump back in office, there is renewed political interest in dismantling regulatory barriers that previously limited the scope of digital assets. The rollback of SEC guidelines such as SAB 121 is one such example, signaling that regulated financial institutions may soon be allowed to expand into crypto custody, settlement, and related infrastructure. That shift carries weight because institutional participation is no longer hypothetical. As of May 9, Bitcoin ( BTC ) spot ETFs have attracted more than $41 billion in inflows, confirming that large allocators are no longer treating Bitcoin as a fringe allocation. Still, the market does not operate in isolation. The reintroduction of U.S. tariffs in early 2025 triggered brief pullbacks across risk assets, including crypto. However, the subsequent rebound in the last few days has revived bullish sentiment, particularly among institutional investors who continue to add exposure in anticipation of regulatory clarity. Against this backdrop of evolving regulation, let’s try to identify which crypto could boom in 2025, and why. The core pillars — Bitcoin and Ethereum Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ) continue to serve as foundational assets in the crypto market, not simply because of their history but because their roles have evolved alongside institutional behavior, technical advancements, and broader economic realignments. Bitcoin’s recent performance has reinforced its positioning as a strategic reserve asset. After crossing $109,000 in January 2025, its momentum slowed, and the price fell by nearly 30% through early April. As of now, BTC has regained ground and is trading near $103,000. A major factor behind this recovery is the scale and composition of inflows channeled through spot ETFs. Price projections vary significantly. Speculative posts on X regularly point to targets of $500,000 or even $1 million, although more grounded models place Bitcoin within the $80,000 to $200,000 range. Reports from Galaxy Digital have echoed this sentiment, forecasting levels around $185,000 due to institutional demand, declining issuance, and heightened interest in non-sovereign reserve assets. Ethereum, on the other hand, operates as a critical infrastructure layer within the broader crypto economy. ETH is currently trading around $2,330, having gained nearly 28% in the past 7 days. The network’s transition to proof-of-stake in 2022 led to a reduction in energy consumption by over 99%, and the latest Pectra upgrade introduces enhancements aimed at usability and scalability. Key improvements include doubling blob capacity on layer 2 networks to ease congestion and lower fees, enabling Account Abstraction to allow gas payments in tokens such as Dai ( DAI ) or USD Coin ( USDC ), and raising the maximum validator stake from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which simplifies operations for large institutional validators. These updates are designed to improve accessibility, reduce the cost of network participation, and accommodate rising throughput demand across layer 2 applications. Ethereum’s price forecasts are also widely debated, though generally more tempered than those for Bitcoin. VanEck projects levels above $6,000. Institutional sentiment has become more cautiously optimistic since the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024, although capital flows into ETH products remain below those seen in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin and Ethereum are not positioned as high-upside bets like smaller altcoins, but their importance to both infrastructure and the broader crypto narrative continues to anchor their relevance across cycles. High-potential altcoins — Solana and Sui Solana ( SOL ) continues to establish itself as one of the most functionally active blockchains in 2025, supported by strong developer participation and consistent traction, particularly within the memecoin ecosystem. In the first quarter of 2025, Solana captured nearly 40% of on-chain spot decentralized exchange trading. Its advantage in execution speed and affordability has made it a preferred environment for high-frequency, retail-driven activity. Much of the volume has stemmed from speculative applications. Pump.fun, a platform that facilitates rapid token creation and trading, generated $400 million in revenue in 2024, even after token launch activity dropped following the LIBRA incident . Alongside memecoins , NFT and gaming projects continue to favor Solana due to its low transaction costs and sub-second finality. Builders often cite these characteristics as core reasons for selecting Solana over Ethereum or other base layers. Institutional interest has grown in parallel, with strategic partnerships and ecosystem funding reinforcing the chain’s credibility. Price forecasts for SOL remain wide-ranging. Analysts have suggested targets between $220 and $520, while community-driven estimates often cluster near the $300 mark. Meanwhile, Sui ( SUI ), a newer Layer 1 developed by former Meta engineers at Mysten Labs, has also emerged as a contender for investor attention. Built using the Move programming language and centered around an object-based execution model, Sui supports parallel transaction processing. Under test conditions, it has achieved throughput nearing 297,000 transactions per second with sub-second finality. In 2025, Sui’s price action reflected both momentum and volatility. After hitting an all-time high of $5.35 in January, it has corrected to $4.02 as of May 9. With a market cap exceeding $13 billion, it now ranks among the top fifteen crypto assets by value. CoinCodex forecasts place Sui’s year-end price between $6.86 and $8.53, contingent on market conditions and sentiment-driven flows. However, investors are watching closely as a $320 million token unlock scheduled for May could inject short-term supply pressure into the market. For those exploring layer 1 chains beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, both Solana and Sui offer data-backed narratives supported by technical traction and ecosystem growth. Still, as with all emerging assets, shifts in sentiment can lead to sharp corrections, citing the need for active risk management. Emerging trends — AI and memecoins The current cycle is being shaped not only by individual blockchain projects but also by broader themes that are influencing how capital, attention, and development efforts are distributed across the crypto market. Among these themes, artificial intelligence and memecoins continue to command disproportionate interest, though for entirely different reasons. Projects such as Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ) and Render ( RENDR ) are using decentralized infrastructure to support AI-driven applications, including autonomous agent networks, supply chain analytics, and GPU resource sharing. Both projects could benefit from rising global demand for compute capacity as centralized cloud providers encounter scaling limitations. In parallel, memecoins remain one of the more divisive areas of the crypto space. Despite frequent criticism over their speculative design and limited utility, they continue to attract substantial liquidity — especially on high-speed blockchains such as Solana. Tokens like Bonk ( BONK ), Pepecoin ( PEPE ), and Brett ( BRETT ) have triggered sharp spikes in decentralized exchange activity, fueled by community hype and viral narratives. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), while still culturally relevant, has seen relatively flat performance in recent months and has not matched the momentum of newer entries. Memecoins tend to behave more like leveraged speculative instruments than structured investments. Although they occasionally generate rapid price surges, they remain highly volatile and often respond more to influencer activity and social media traction than to any fundamental driver. Strategies for investing in 2025’s crypto boom Investing in crypto during a cycle marked by renewed momentum and expanding narratives requires more than optimism. A structured approach is essential to navigate both opportunity and risk. Start with allocation. Anchoring a portfolio with Bitcoin can provide relative stability, particularly as institutional inflows continue to influence price behavior. While BTC may not offer the upside of emerging tokens, its liquidity, market depth, and growing regulatory clarity position it as a core holding during periods of uncertainty. Adding exposure to high-potential altcoins can complement that base, as long as position sizes account for heightened volatility. These assets often move sharply in both directions and should be treated with caution. Dollar-cost averaging remains one of the more effective entry strategies, especially in markets where sentiment can shift without warning. Spreading entries across multiple weeks or months can reduce exposure to short-term price swings and offer a more measured path into the market. Clear entry and exit strategies help reduce emotional decision-making. Having predefined targets makes it easier to avoid chasing rallies or holding assets beyond their value proposition. Research remains one of the most underused advantages. Studying whitepapers, monitoring GitHub contributions, and following community involvement can reveal whether a project is building sustained momentum or simply benefiting from hype cycles. Risk management should extend beyond asset selection. Using cold wallets for long-term storage, limiting reliance on centralized exchanges, and regularly reassessing portfolio concentration are critical steps that protect capital. The year 2025 is not only about potential returns but also about execution. The pace of change is fast. Projects will surge and fade. Narratives will shift overnight. Volumes will accelerate and vanish just as quickly. Staying focused, maintaining discipline, and knowing your limits will matter more than ever.

The letter, spearheaded by Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, was delivered to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi. It was also signed by Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal. The senators’ call comes on the heels of Senate Democrats blocking a long-awaited stablecoin bill, following revelations that a Trump family-controlled company’s USD1 digital token was used to finance a $2 billion investment in Binance by Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX in March. The same company reportedly also contributed to a $100 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure fund that Trump announced a day after his inauguration. Thus, indirect ties between the Trump family and Binance, which was found guilty of violating US laws, came to the fore. Binance's former CEO Changpeng Zhao also pleaded guilty, resigned from his position and spent four months in prison in the US. Related News: A Historic Turning Point for Cryptocurrencies: Coinbase Makes the Anticipated Announcement “Our concerns about Binance’s compliance obligations have been heightened by recent reports that the company has partnered with foreign investment firms using the Trump family’s stablecoin,” the senators wrote in the letter. According to Bloomberg, an organization with ties to the Trump family, World Liberty Financial, is also reportedly considering partnership opportunities with Binance. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family is in talks to acquire a stake in Binance’s U.S. subsidiary, Binance.US. The same report also claimed that Zhao has requested a presidential pardon from the Trump administration. “The possibility that this administration would allow Binance, which has repeatedly violated federal laws and regulations, to continue operating in the United States is deeply troubling,” the senators wrote in the letter. The letter asked the Treasury and Justice Departments to report on Binance’s compliance with the plea agreement. It also asked for clarity on the company’s plans to exit the US, the timeline for that process, and whether a possible pardon for Zhao had been discussed with any officials. It also asked whether Binance had made any contact regarding World Liberty or its plans to list a new stablecoin. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached a high of $103,600 on May 8 after reclaiming $100,000 for the first time since January. Its market dominance also surged above 60%, reflecting more bullish BTC sentiment. This marked the third time BTC has broken through six figures since it reached the milestone on Dec. 5, 2024, and again on Jan. 20, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The BTC rise coincided with Trump announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, which may include removing a 10% blanket tariff on all imports. In the wider crypto space, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade implemented much-needed improvements for the crypto ecosystem.

The surge was attributed to onboarding major mining pools SpiderPool and Foundry. The influx of mining support boosted Rootstock's hash power above 740 exahashes per second. This surpassed Bitcoin's total network hashrate recorded in October 2024, marking a more mature phase for the platform's merged mining growth. The surge in merged mining participation came as Rootstock's ecosystem faced headwinds. In Q1 2025, Rootstock’s total value locked (TVL) declined.

In under 48 hours, ETH surged more than 35%, reaching as high as $2,490 and sending a strong signal that a new phase may have just begun. The breakout, which comes after months of sluggish price action and uncertainty, has reignited bullish sentiment across the market. Related Reading: Cardano Approaches Critical Resistance – Break Above Could Trigger Move To $0.80 Top analyst Jelle described the move in dramatic terms, noting that Ethereum aggressively broke straight through a massive resistance level, “like it wasn’t even there.” More importantly, ETH has now made a higher high, flipping the market structure and confirming the strength of this rally. This is the kind of breakout that often marks a shift in trend, not just a temporary spike. With Bitcoin flirting with $100K and altcoins waking up across the board, Ethereum’s explosive move may be the start of something much bigger. The $2,000 level had been a significant psychological and technical barrier for months, and now that it’s gone, bulls are in control. All eyes are on whether ETH can hold these gains and continue leading the charge in the next leg of the crypto bull cycle. Ethereum Forms Bullish Structure As Momentum Shifts After months of relentless selling pressure and persistent bearish sentiment, Ethereum is finally showing signs of structural recovery. The market environment, long dominated by doubt and underperformance, is now shifting as ETH begins to establish a new, more bullish formation. This shift isn’t just about price—it’s being reinforced by meaningful developments on the fundamental side. One of the most important catalysts is the upcoming Pectra update, a major improvement designed to make Ethereum more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective. The update focuses on enhancing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and optimizing smart contract performance, key changes that could significantly improve network usability and reduce transaction costs. This technical progress renews investor interest and builds a fresh narrative around Ethereum’s long-term potential. The price action confirms the change in sentiment. Jelle highlights that Ethereum easily broke past the $2,000 resistance, as ETH surged more than 21% only yesterday, blasting through $2,200 and hitting a high near $2,490. More importantly, ETH has made a higher high, signaling a trend reversal. According to Jelle, holding the $2,200 level is now key—if this support holds, “ETH could actually be back.” Analysts are beginning to call for continued upside, pointing to the combination of washed-out bearish sentiment, fresh technical structure, and growing network optimism driven by the Pectra upgrade. With ETH now breaking out and flipping resistance into support, the conditions are aligning for a potentially massive recovery phase. If momentum holds and the $2,200 level is respected, Ethereum could be entering the early stages of a powerful and sustained rally. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Extremely Undervalued Against BTC’ – Supply Pressure May Delay Recovery ETH Price Analysis: Bulls Take Over Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,334 after a stunning rally that saw it surge more than 35% in less than 48 hours. The daily chart shows a massive breakout above the long-standing $2,000 resistance level, with price reaching as high as $2,490 before pulling back slightly. This breakout decisively ends months of downtrend structure and signals the formation of a new bullish leg. This move came with substantial volume, validating the breakout and showing clear market conviction. ETH also printed a higher high for the first time in months, confirming a shift in trend. However, the price is now approaching the 200-day EMA at $2,428 and remains below the 200-day SMA at $2,701—two levels that could serve as medium-term resistance. If ETH can hold the $2,200–$2,250 zone as support, this breakout could turn into a full trend reversal. The recent volume spike suggests that both retail and institutional players are stepping back in, possibly driven by growing optimism around Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and improving macro sentiment.

The upgrade marks the first major shift in Ethereum's positioning in two years, enabling new use cases and facilitating adoption to better compete in the crypto space. Despite a modest initial market reaction with ETH price rising only 0.96% and a slight decline in daily active addresses, Ethereum experienced a 20% price surge shortly after, representing its largest gain in four years. The Superchain, Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem, activated the Pectra upgrade within 48 hours of its mainnet launch, becoming the first L2 ecosystem to implement it. The Superchain currently handles 12.9 million daily transactions, collects 83% of Layer 2 fees, and contributes to over half of Ethereum’s blob fee burn.

Traders are monitoring XRP’s setup for possible movement, and Aave’s buyback has drawn fresh interest. Yet beyond these updates, some are looking at long-term use cases. Projects like Web3 ai offer more than price moves. They focus on tools and features that can shape how people interact with the crypto space. Unlike tokens that depend only on market cycles, Web3 ai’s system uses real-time data, automated strategies, and AI-supported tools. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in now, this approach highlights how function could lead the next wave. XRP Chart Outlook: A Period of Calm Before the Next Move? XRP is holding around $2.10, forming a tight range between $2.05 and $2.23. Current signs, such as a flat MACD and price tracking near the 50-period EMA, point to low activity that may come before a shift in trend. Views differ. Some analysts expect a breakout during July, following past seasonal trends. Others, including Peter Brandt, warn of a possible decline, even suggesting XRP’s market cap could fall sharply if bearish trends continue through 2025. The XRP forecast depends on near-term levels. A move above $2.23 could open targets at $2.35 and $2.48. But if XRP slips below $2.05, it might drop toward $1.93 and $1.84. Aave’s Next Phase: DAO-Led Buyback Shows Confidence Aave has launched a $50 million buyback program, approved with strong support from the community. This move signals confidence from its DAO and reflects a focus on token strength and stability. The goal is to improve both liquidity and long-term utility for the AAVE token. Recent data supports this momentum. Wallet activity has increased, showing growing interest from both retail and larger holders. The staged buyback also helps manage market effects, reducing sharp swings in price. The Aave update points to a larger trend of active governance. With this plan, Aave is reinforcing its treasury strategy and building long-term value through careful management.

Utility Could Be the Real Driver in Crypto’s Next Phase Speculation often drives short-term attention, but long-term results may come from what users can do with their tokens. XRP’s movement depends on price action, and Aave’s buyback shows belief in its future value. But both are still tied to broader market conditions. Web3 ai presents another direction. By offering tools that help users decide, manage risk, and act in real time, it moves away from watching prices and toward using data. This kind of real-world function may be what defines the next standout.

This was part of an ongoing investigation into the alleged use of eXch for laundering funds stolen during Bybit’s record-breaking $1.4 billion hack in February 2025. Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and Frankfurt’s main prosecutor’s office announced the seizure, which marks the third-largest crypto confiscation in the BKA’s history. The seized crypto includes a mix of assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Dash (DASH). The authorities also seized over eight terabytes of data stored on eXch’s German server infrastructure, effectively shutting down the platform. The BKA stated that a large portion of the Bybit exploit’s proceeds was funneled through eXch, making the platform an important player in the network of illicit crypto transactions. eXch’s Role in Crypto Laundering and its Unlawful Operations Launched in 2014, eXch marketed itself as a privacy-centric “swapping” service, offering users the ability to exchange crypto assets across various blockchains without requiring identity verification or adhering to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. This noncompliance made it a magnet for criminals looking to “wash” stolen funds and conceal their origins through obfuscation tactics such as token hopping, cross-chain bridges, and multiple wallets. According to the BKA’s findings, eXch was used in laundering over €1.75 billion ($1.9 billion) worth of crypto, a large portion of which is suspected to originate from criminal activities. Crypto security analyst ZachXBT, who has previously exposed some of the industry’s largest hacks and laundering operations, confirmed that eXch also played a major role in processing funds from other high-profile incidents. Source: ZachXBT This includes the multisig wallet exploits, FixedFloat exchange-related laundering, the $243 million Genesis creditor heist, and numerous phishing drainers and rug pulls over the past few years. ZachXBT further revealed that eXch ignored repeated warnings, refused to block malicious wallet addresses, and did not comply with freeze orders issued by regulators or intelligence-led investigators. Additionally, according to ZachXBT’s February 22 Telegram post, even the North Korean Lazarus Group allegedly used eXch to launder over 5,000 ETH stolen from the Bybit hack. This detail links eXch to state-sponsored cybercrime, which elevates the geopolitical importance of the investigation. Platform Denial, Sudden Shutdown, and Official Response In April, eXch denied helping launder stolen funds for the Lazarus Group. It said only a small portion of the Bybit hack funds passed through its system. eXch has denied allegations of laundering money for North Korea’s #Lazarus Group following the $1.4 billion hack on @Bybit_Official on February 21. #eXch #Bybit https://t.co/FWTnP5hiJS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 24, 2025 Soon after, the platform announced it would shut down by May 1, blaming increasing pressure and signals intelligence targeting its servers. Privacy-focused crypto exchange eXch will shut down on May 1 following scrutiny over alleged ties to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. #bybithack #eXch https://t.co/ZXQCBVbotz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 18, 2025 However, eXch’s shutdown didn’t last. On April 27, the suspension notice disappeared, and the site resumed operations. Despite shutdown claims, crypto mixer eXch still launders illicit funds via active API, linked to Bybit hack and CSAM funding, warns @trmlabs . #CryptoCrime #CryptoMixer https://t.co/DQBOEYPnR3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 5, 2025 A report from TRM Labs revealed that eXch never really shut down. While its websites went offline, its backend API stayed active. This allowed users to continue moving funds using eXch’s signature laundering method, which involves mixing funds in pools that hide where the money comes from. TRM found that eXch was still being used by criminal groups, including the Lazarus Group and those linked to child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Over $300,000 connected to CSAM has passed through eXch, with more expected. The system also made it hard to tell which funds were clean or criminal.

In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Wood says ARK continues to predict Bitcoin will increase at least 580% of its current value by 2030. “We have always had a 2030 target, the base case in the $700,000 to $750,000 range, the bull case in the $1.5 million range.” Wood says there are three driving factors behind the massive Bitcoin price prediction. “David Puell, our analyst and our on-chain analyst, put that piece out recently, and you can see the building blocks, how much share we expect Bitcoin to either take from gold or grow that store-of-value market, institutions moving in – and they’ve barely moved in, we have a million more coins, roughly, to be minted ever, and institutions have are just testing the waters right now – and then there’s the emerging market use cases as well. So we think we have miles to go.” Wood also says that the US has been in a recession, but that it will soon come to an end after there’s more clarity around President Trump’s tariff negotiations, opening up the door for massive economic growth, in part driven by advances in artificial intelligence (AI). “I just put out a letter talking about the rolling recession we’ve been in for the last three years, since the Fed jacked up rates. We got a negative quarter in the first quarter, and potentially in the second quarter as well. And I think more and more people are getting concerned about an extended recession, and amid all the uncertainty, we actually think we’re at the end of this rolling recession, and that we are moving into a period, after all of this uncertainty, of much greater productivity. And interestingly, if you look at the government sector, we’re seeing unbelievable productivity moves taking place. There’s a video out there between the new head of the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration), and the new head of CDER (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research), and they’re talking about generative AI in reviewing studies, medical trials, that cut work from days to minutes. So there’s a lot of productivity I think evolving in the ecosystem… I think we’re going to see a lot more productivity driven growth, which means inflation is going to be much lower than expected, which is going to be very capital friendly.” Bitcoin is trading for $102,811 at time of writing, up 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

Following this move, it appears strongly bullish and looks set for a bigger rally. Last week, Bitcoin halted its recovery after facing a slight rejection under $98k. It pulled back briefly and later remained calm during the weekend. That triggered some panic in the market as altcoins bled. Luckily, the $93.5k level stood well and the price slowly climbs back this week. The last 24 hours saw several altcoins through major gains as the price recovers well following a major break above the fundamental but psychological $100k level. Following the breakup, Bitcoin’s recovery has reached a new milestone of $104,145 once again after three months of swing, and as we can see, it looks highly bullish on the daily chart. The upsurge was mainly fueled by increasing demand. However, it has faced a slight rejection, but still looks poised for a bigger recovery. Looking at the daily price actions, Bitcoin’s trading landscape has changed as market sentiment turns positive. A full recovery to the top could set the market up for a huge rally to a new all-time high. As of now, the bulls appear back in control. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Anticipating a surge above the current daily high, the next resistance ahead is $106,457. If Bitcoin surpasses it, the recent all-time high of $109,588 would be the next resistance level to watch. A break-up there should rocket the price to a new high. The broken $97,895 level may provide support in case of a drop. Losing grip above this level could slide us back to $93,500. Other supports are located at $88,765 and $85,800. Key Resistance Levels: $104,145, $106,457, $109,588 Key Support Levels: $97,895, $93,500, $88,765 Spot Price: $102,947 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to $104,000 for the first time in months, while the Dow Jones Index peaked at $41,360, its highest point since April 3. There are signs that the stock and crypto markets are entering a bull market as trade risks fall and the odds of interest rate cuts rise. Dow Jones vs Bitcoin: Why BTC wins Bitcoin and the Dow Jones are significantly different assets. Established in 1896, the Dow is the oldest index in the United States, tracking 30 blue-chip companies across most sectors. Its top names include companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Walmart, and IBM. The index started trading at $40.94 and has surged by 92,800% since then. On paper, the Dow Jones seems like a better investment since it holds some of the most well-known companies in the US. It is also considered a less volatile asset compared to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You might also like: Dow drops 180 points as caution prevails ahead of U.S.-China talks However, in reality, Bitcoin has been a better investment than the Dow Jones and other top blue-chip indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. BTC has risen by over 10% this year, while the Dow is down 2.78%. The same trend holds since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, as it has surged by 11.4 billion percent. It has climbed nearly 1,000% in the last five years, while the Dow Jones has gained just 73% in the same period. Bitcoin vs Dow Jones | Source: crypto.news Why Bitcoin wins against stocks Bitcoin outperforms the Dow Jones for several reasons. First, it has evolved into a store of value , which explains why many large holders don’t sell it. This characteristic comes from its fixed supply of 21 million coins and its halving cycles. That makes it a better option than the US dollar, which has an unlimited supply. Second, Bitcoin experienced strong demand from retail investors for years, even as institutions remained on the sidelines. Now, institutions are leading the charge, with a company like Strategy controlling over 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Firms like Coinbase, Tesla, Block, and Semler Scientific have all invested in Bitcoin, and some countries are considering adding it into their reserves. As a result, spot Bitcoin ETFs have had over $40 billion in inflows since January last year. Further, unlike the Dow Jones, Bitcoin is becoming more scarce. Over 19.82 million coins have already been mined, and the supply on exchanges has dropped to a five-year low. As such, a combination of declining supply and rising demand is likely to push the price higher over the long term.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond.

The RSI is around 61, suggesting momentum is on the bullish side but not yet overbought. Bollinger Bands are widening, hinting at increased volatility. If the price can maintain above $0.52 support, Sonic may push towards $0.60 resistance. However, watch for potential consolidation if buying pressure fades near current highs. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart Sonic/USD 4-hour Chart The 4-hour chart for Sonic (S/USDT) reveals recent upward momentum, with price action nearing the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a bullish trend that may be overextended short term. The MACD shows positive crossover and rising histogram bars, confirming continued buying interest. However, the Balance of Power indicator reflects a slight dip into negative territory, suggesting potential short-term weakness or consolidation. Support is seen around $0.54, while resistance remains near $0.61. If the bullish volume persists, a breakout could materialize, but caution is advised for possible pullbacks as the price has moved rapidly. Consolidation is likely before further trend confirmation.

The combined 4-hour and 1-day charts for Sonic (S/USDT) show a cautiously optimistic outlook. On the daily chart, the price is testing upper Bollinger Band limits with the RSI near 61, indicating moderate overbought conditions, yet leaving room for growth. The 4-hour chart confirms bullish momentum, with MACD maintaining positive crossover and continued upward pressure. However, Balance of Power reflects moments of weakness, hinting at possible near-term consolidation. Support rests around $0.54 and resistance is near $0.61. If volume sustains, Sonic could extend gains, though minor pullbacks or sideways moves are probable before confirming a decisive trend continuation or reversal. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.1939 price by 2025 and $1.41 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and an assessment of personal risk tolerance are essential steps for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $1.18 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $1.49. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $1.99 Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $5.89 and $6.99, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications.

According to him, the pressure from sellers of the first cryptocurrency is decreasing, and significant funds are coming into the market through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Previously, bitcoin's dynamics were driven by three groups: miners, whales, and retail investors. When liquidity from new participants dried up and large holders started to fix their profits, a chain reaction of sell-offs started; Now, the market structure has become more complex, with ETFs, companies like Strategy, institutional investors and even government entities entering the market in addition to the traditional players, Ju said. ”The old model of cycles no longer works. Now it is important not to track whale sell-offs, but to assess the volume of new capital from institutional and ETFs. This inflow can even compensate for the mass exit of large holders,” said CryptoQuant CEO. Despite the growth of bitcoin price, the analyst calls the current market ”sluggish”. Most indicators are balancing on the edge, not giving clear signals, he explained; That said, Ju emphasized: an error in prediction doesn't mean that onchain metrics have lost value. ”Data remains data. Different analysts can interpret them in their own way,” the expert added. He promised to improve the quality of expertise and take into account new factors, including the integration of the first cryptocurrency with traditional finance. After $100,000, Is $180,000 the Next Target? That’s the Level Technical Analysts Are Eyeing On the weekly chart of bitcoin after the upward breakout of the ”bull flag” pattern, a further rise to $182,000 is possible - to the growth range before the downward consolidation. Such a scenario presented in Cointelegraph. The CoinDesk suggested parallels to two patterns of digital gold rallying at the end of 2024, when the rate soared from $70,000 to $109,000. The first involves the MACD indicator. The metric turned bullish in mid-October, confirming the upward trend by December. Currently, the indicator has only approached the neutral level. Its overcoming upward will mark the formation of 'bear trap' in March-April. The second indicator consists of a combination of the 50 DMA and 200 DMA. About four weeks ago, the moving averages formed a ”death cross” which was not confirmed. Recently, the ”fast” DMA began to grow and may now cross the ”slow” DMA from bottom to top, forming a ”golden cross” in the coming weeks. A similar signal occurred last August with the subsequent ATH update. From scenarios to levels An analyst under the nickname AlphaBTC listed a rally to $106,000 as the immediate target. Analyst and founder of MN Trading Michael van de Poppe has a similar opinion. The expert singled out the zone between $103,800-107,000 as a stop before a pullback followed by ATH renewal this quarter. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao predicted bitcoin's growth to $1 million The digital gold exchange rate could reach $500,000 and even $1 million already in the current market cycle, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) shared his prediction in an interview with Farokh Radio. According to the businessman, the total capitalization of the crypto market will exceed $5 trillion in 2025. CZ did not specify a specific timeframe for achieving these values. This is not Zhao's first prediction: in 2020, he predicted bitcoin would rise to $100,000, which was realized in December 2024. In February this year, he hinted at $1 million, ironizing the ”collapse” from $1,001,000 to $985,000. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $102,252 and the crypto market is capitalized at ~$3 trillion. In an interview, CZ called meme-coins ”speculative noise,” predicting the collapse of 99.99% of them. He sees the integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence and DeSci as promising directions. The Binance founder noted the dramatic reversal of US regulatory policy under Donald Trump's administration: ”The situation has changed 180 degrees in 100 days.” He also predicted the dominance of decentralized exchanges over centralized exchanges, calling them ”different doors to the same world.” Zhao ruled out a return to Binance and said he would focus on mentorship. According to him, after four months in prison, health and family have become priorities. In April, CZ became a consultant to the Kyrgyz government on cryptocurrency and blockchain issues.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-09 18:10:08

While that marked its biggest buying volatile period since the recovery started, it currently appears bullish. Following last month’s bounce, which came as a surprise after tanking to the lowest level in a year, Ethereum recovered nicely and reclaimed the $1,800 level. Unfortunately, the buying pressure dropped, and the crypto remained calm with little-to-no movement throughout the month. Crossing over into this month on a weak note, it attempted a break above the mentioned level, but failed and continued to consolidate on a daily scale. As several top altcoins recovered from their recent lows due to a major surge in Bitcoin’s price, it joined the momentum and rallied hard into the $2,200 range with a bullish engulfing close yesterday. That has triggered a slight break above the descending trendline, acting as diagonal resistance since last December. Reiterating positive actions today, it seems ready to claim more highs on the daily timeframe. Looking at the daily chart, ETH will likely face tougher obstacles on the way up. If it manages to climb above the $4,000 level, we can expect a major rally in the long term. Losing control to the bulls, the bears are currently in disbelief at the latest surge. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that volatility is back in the market, the $2,320 level is considered a close obstacle for the bulls. If they flip through along with the March’s $2,550 resistance, their next target buying level would be $2,745. A drop from the current trading level may bring a retest at the falling resistance line, marked at the $2,104 level. Failure to rebound may bring us back to $1,873.

Momentum now points toward a potential explosive move to $1.04. After being trapped in an accumulation phase since February, Popcat ( POPCAT ) has finally broken out with strong bullish momentum. The move comes as price action confirms acceptance above the critical $0.33 level, marking a shift in market structure from neutral to decisively bullish. This breakout sets the stage for a potential rally toward the next major resistance near $1.04, with favorable volume and technical confluence supporting the move. Key technical points Key Breakout Level: Price has reclaimed $0.33, flipping it into support after months of consolidation. Bullish Structure Formed: Multiple higher lows and a confirmed trend shift signal strong upward momentum. Target Resistance at $1.04: Aligned with key Fibonacci levels and limited overhead resistance. PopCatUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Technical breakdown The structure of Popcat has shifted significantly in recent weeks. After forming a base through an extended accumulation phase, price has now reclaimed the $0.33 level, a major technical pivot. This level previously acted as resistance but now confirms strong support, allowing bulls to take control of the market. The bullish structure is reinforced by consecutive higher lows, pointing to growing demand and sustained buying pressure. One of the most notable technical alignments is the confluence between the $1.04 resistance level and a significant Fibonacci retracement zone. This strengthens the case for an upward continuation, especially given the low resistance zones between current price levels and $1.04. If volume continues to rise, as currently observed, the move could accelerate swiftly due to limited supply in this range. You might also like: Which crypto could boom in 2025? A data-driven look at the contenders From a broader perspective, the market has transitioned from a bearish to a bullish structure. This is evidenced by the breakdown of the previous downtrend, the formation of accumulation, and now the breakout supported by volume and structure. The price now has a clear higher high and higher low, confirming a classic uptrend. What to expect in the coming price action With bullish confirmation above $0.33 and increasing volume, Popcat appears poised for a continuation toward $1.04. Traders should watch for healthy consolidation or a minor pullback that forms a new higher low, which would further solidify the uptrend.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries. On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last? Liquidity is Bitcoin's silent price driver Raoul Pal, the founder of Global Macro Investor, recently gave a speech on the strong correlation between Bitcoin and global M2 liquidity. In a recap posted by Paul Guerra, Pal’s message refers to: despite looming concerns—recession risks, geopolitical tensions, and other global stressors—rising liquidity as the dominant force behind asset price action. According to Pal, expanding liquidity backs up to 90% of Bitcoin’s price action and as much as 97% of the Nasdaq’s performance. Indeed, a chart comparing global M2 (with a 12-week lead) and Bitcoin’s price shows an almost uncanny alignment. Global M2 and BTC/USD. Source: Real Vision Pal also frames the issue in personal finance terms. He says there's an 11% ""hidden tax"" on all of us, composed of 8% currency debasement and 3% global inflation. He notes, “If you’re not earning more than 11%/yr, you’re getting poorer by definition.” Bitcoin has returned an average of 130% annually since 2012, despite dramatic drawdowns. That makes it one of the most asymmetric bets of the past decade—and it’s outperformed the Nasdaq by over 99%. What drives global liquidity? At its core, global liquidity is fueled by expanding the money supply. As independent investor Lyn Alden puts it , “Fiat currency systems are primarily based on ever-growing debt levels. The money supply continuously grows in every country for this reason.” This offers a high-level view of global liquidity and suggests its long-term expansion is structural. However, this growth isn't linear. Over shorter time frames, it fluctuates based on specific drivers. Michael Howell, author of “Capital Wars,” identifies three main drivers currently impacting global liquidity: the US Federal Reserve, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), and banks lending through collateral markets. Global liquidity drivers. Source: Michael Howell Howell also points to indirect influences that act with a lag of 6 to 15 months. These include the world business cycle, oil prices, dollar strength, and bond market volatility. A weak global economy and a softening dollar typically boost liquidity. But rising bond volatility tightens collateral supply and chokes lending, undermining liquidity. Related: New bull cycle? Bitcoin's return to $100K hints at ‘significant price move’ How long will global liquidity rise? Michael Howell believes that global liquidity moves in roughly five-year cycles, and is now on the way to its local peak. He projects the current cycle to mature by mid-2026, reaching an index level of around 70 (below the post-COVID index of 90). That would mark a turning point, with a subsequent downturn being a likely outcome. Global liquidity cycle. Source: Michael Howell The recent growth in global liquidity stems from the rapidly weakening world economy, which is likely to prompt further easing by central banks. The People’s Bank of China has already begun injecting liquidity into the system. The Fed now faces a tough choice: continue fighting inflation or pivot to support an increasingly fragile financial system. At its May 7 meeting, rates were held steady, but the pressure on Chair Jerome Powell is mounting, especially from US President Donald Trump. At the same time, economic uncertainty is driving up US Treasury yields and fueling bond market volatility, both indicators of collateral scarcity and tightening credit conditions. Over time, these pressures are likely to become headwinds for liquidity expansion. Meanwhile, a looming recession is expected to weaken investor risk appetite, further draining liquidity from the system. Even if a downturn lies ahead in 2026, global liquidity still has room to run, at least through 2025. And that matters for Bitcoin. Howell notes, “The likely inevitable policy response of ‘more liquidity’ is a great future omen. It establishes the upward path of persistent monetary inflation that ultimately underpins hedges such as gold, quality equities, prime residential real estate, and Bitcoin.” Interestingly, Howell’s liquidity cycle roughly aligns with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle. The former points to a potential peak in late 2025, and the latter in early 2026. If history rhymes again, that convergence could set the stage for a major price move.

This zone, which has previously acted as a launchpad for bullish momentum, is once again drawing attention as bulls defend it with determination. The current price action suggests that the market is taking a breather, potentially setting the stage for a fresh leg higher. With bullish sentiment gradually building and support holding steady, speculations are whether LINK can capitalize on this consolidation and ignite its next rally toward higher resistance zones. Why Chainlink Bulls Are Still In Control The current price action reveals that Chainlink has resumed its upward movement following a brief and healthy pullback. After testing the immediate support zone and holding firm above the $15.29 level, the bulls have stepped back in with renewed confidence. LINK’s rebound suggests that the temporary pause in momentum was likely a consolidation phase rather than a full-fledged reversal, allowing the market to reset before continuing its ascent. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Targets Rebound To $19 — But Only If This Key Support Holds One of the standout bullish signals is LINK’s recent break above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This moving average often acts as a dynamic resistance in downtrends, and a successful close above it suggests a potential trend reversal or continuation of bullish momentum. Such a move typically garners the attention of technical traders, increasing the likelihood of follow-through buying pressure. Further confirmation comes from the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator, which has now made a bullish crossover and climbed above the zero line. This momentum shift reflects a strengthening buying trend and hints that LINK could be gearing up for a broader breakout. If the current setup holds, LINK may soon challenge higher resistance zones, opening the door for a sustained rally. What Could Derail The Uptrend? While Chainlink shows promising signs of continuing its uptrend, the bullish momentum is still at risk. A failure to hold above the immediate support at $15.29 could invite increased selling pressure and signal a potential shift in sentiment. If bears push the price below this level, a deeper retracement toward the next major support zones is probable. Related Reading: Chainlink Shake-Up: Investors Pull $120 Million From Exchanges Additionally, overbought signals from momentum indicators such as the RSI might suggest exhaustion among buyers if they begin to flash warning signs. A bearish crossover or weakening in the MACD could further confirm waning strength. Traders should also be cautious of broader market volatility or negative macroeconomic developments, which can weigh heavily on sentiment even for technically strong assets like LINK. Keeping an eye on volume and price reaction at key levels will be critical to assess whether the uptrend remains intact or is at risk of faltering.

Are you feeling the shift in the air? The Bitcoin market has been buzzing lately, and a significant indicator is flashing green, suggesting that positive momentum might just be getting started. If you’ve been watching the charts or following the news, you’ve likely heard whispers of changing tides. Now, a prominent on-chain analytics firm, CryptoQuant , has highlighted a notable shift in the Crypto market sentiment , specifically for Bitcoin, that’s got everyone talking about the potential direction of the Bitcoin price . What is the CryptoQuant Bull Score and Why Does 80 Matter? Let’s dive into what this ‘Bull Score’ actually is. CryptoQuant developed this metric to gauge the overall sentiment and potential directional bias of the Bitcoin market. It aggregates various on-chain and market indicators – things like exchange reserves, stablecoin inflows, miner behavior, and derivatives market data – into a single, easy-to-understand score. This score typically ranges from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a more bullish outlook and lower numbers suggesting caution or bearishness. Think of it like a market thermometer for optimism. A score around 20, where it was previously, suggests a neutral to slightly cautious or even bearish environment. But a jump all the way to 80? That’s a dramatic shift! A score of 80 falls firmly into the ‘high bullish’ territory. Historically, when the Bull Score reaches these elevated levels, it often precedes or coincides with periods of strong upward price movement for Bitcoin. It suggests that underlying conditions, as measured by CryptoQuant’s diverse data points, are aligning in a way that supports price appreciation. Decoding the Bullish Sentiment Signal: Spot Demand and More CryptoQuant specifically pointed out rising spot demand as a key driver behind this surge in the Bull Score. Why is spot demand important for understanding Bullish Bitcoin trends? Genuine Buying Pressure: Spot demand refers to buying Bitcoin on exchanges for immediate delivery, as opposed to trading derivatives like futures or options. Increased spot buying indicates that people are acquiring actual BTC, often with the intention of holding it. Reduced Selling Pressure: High spot demand can absorb available supply, reducing selling pressure on exchanges. Foundation for Rallies: Strong spot accumulation provides a solid foundation for price rallies, as it represents real capital entering the market rather than leveraged positions that can be quickly unwound. The Bull Score hitting 80 isn’t just about spot demand, though that’s a significant component. It means that multiple factors across the market are likely converging to paint a positive picture. This requires careful BTC analysis , looking beyond just one metric. What This Means for Bitcoin Price Potential So, what are the implications for the Bitcoin price when the Bull Score reaches such a level? While no indicator is a crystal ball, a score of 80 is a powerful signal that market participants are becoming increasingly optimistic and that the technical and on-chain conditions are favorable for upward movement. It suggests: Increased Confidence: High scores reflect growing confidence among investors and traders. Potential for Momentum: Bullish sentiment can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, attracting more buyers and creating upward price momentum. Historical Correlation: Past instances of the Bull Score reaching 80 or higher have often correlated with periods of significant price rallies. It’s a signal that the market might be entering a growth phase. It’s crucial to remember that market conditions can change rapidly, and past performance is not indicative of future results. However, this shift from 20 to 80 is a strong indication that the probability of positive price action has increased significantly according to CryptoQuant’s model. Navigating the Crypto Market Sentiment : Risks and Opportunities While a Bull Score of 80 is exciting news for those hoping for higher prices, it’s vital to approach the market with a balanced perspective. Understanding Crypto market sentiment is key, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Here are some points to consider: Opportunity: A confirmed shift to bullish sentiment, supported by metrics like the Bull Score and rising spot demand, presents potential opportunities for investors looking to participate in a potential uptrend. It validates a positive outlook based on underlying data. Risk: Markets are inherently volatile. Sentiment can shift quickly due to external news events, regulatory changes, or unexpected sell-offs. A high Bull Score doesn’t guarantee a straight line up. It could even signal a potential peak if euphoria becomes excessive (though 80 isn’t necessarily ‘euphoria’ level yet, typically that’s closer to 90-100). Challenges: Relying solely on one indicator is risky. It’s important to perform comprehensive BTC analysis , looking at technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, and other on-chain metrics. The interpretation of any score also requires nuance; understanding *why* the score moved is as important as the score itself. Actionable Insight: Use the Bull Score as a confirmation signal alongside your own research. If your BTC analysis aligns with the bullish sentiment suggested by CryptoQuant, it can add conviction. However, always practice risk management – don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, consider setting stop losses, and diversify your portfolio. Avoid making decisions based purely on FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) triggered by exciting headlines. Here’s a simplified look at what different score ranges might generally suggest: Bull Score Range General Sentiment Indication 0-20 Bearish to Very Bearish 20-40 Cautious to Neutral 40-60 Neutral to Slightly Bullish 60-80 Bullish to Strong Bullish 80-100 Very Bullish to Euphoric The move from 20 to 80 is clearly a leap across several categories, highlighting a fundamental shift in the market’s internal dynamics as measured by CryptoQuant. Conclusion: A Powerful Signal for Bullish Bitcoin ? The jump in the CryptoQuant Bull Score from 20 to 80 is undoubtedly a significant development in the Crypto market sentiment . It reflects increasing underlying strength in the market, driven in part by rising spot demand, and aligns with a historically bullish signal for the Bitcoin price . While this analysis from CryptoQuant provides a compelling case for a potentially Bullish Bitcoin phase, it’s essential for every investor to conduct their own thorough BTC analysis and consider the broader market context before making any investment decisions. This score is a powerful indicator, but it’s best used as part of a comprehensive strategy.

This launch also includes a new AI-powered storytelling platform and a social game. This initiative marks a big step for the Doodles project, which aims to expand its ecosystem beyond digital collectibles. Major Exchange Supports DOOD Token Launch The newly launched Doodles’ DOOD token is available for trading on well-known exchanges, including Bybit, Binance Alpha, Gate.io, KuCoin, and MEXC. Reportedly, even more trading platforms are expected to list the token soon. Notably, eligible users can now claim their DOOD airdrop directly from the official Doodles website. The new token has a total supply of 10 billion, divided across several key groups. The Doodles community holds the largest portion at 30%, while 25% is set aside for the ecosystem fund to support future growth and development. The core team receives 17%, reflecting their role in building and maintaining the project. A group labeled “New Blood” is allocated 13%, possibly indicating new contributors or strategic partners. To support trading and market stability, 10% of the tokens are reserved for liquidity. Lastly, 5% is allocated to the company itself. While the token is now live on Solana, Doodles plans to bring DOOD to Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain , soon. DreamNet Turns AI and Imagination into Rewards DreamNet, the new platform launched with DOOD, allows users to build their characters and story worlds using artificial intelligence (AI). These creations can then be used in games, videos, or animations. If other people use these creations in games or shows, the original creators can earn DOOD tokens. The platform is designed to help artists and fans collaborate and earn rewards. DreamNet is a new way for people to participate in digital storytelling and earn money from their creativity. Doodles also released a game called Lord of the Files to make things even more exciting. The game occurs in a virtual office setting where players try to outsmart each other. The winner will receive a prize of 500,000 DOOD tokens. Doodles Grows Beyond NFTs Doodles started in October 2021 with 10,000 cartoon-style NFTs. In 2022, the art collection raised $54 million in its first funding round , bringing its value to over $704 million. Since then, it has become one of the most recognized digital art collections. Currently, the floor price of a Doodle costs around 3.37 Ethereum, valued at $8,000. Since May 9, the project has made over $4 million in trading volume. The team wants Doodles to become more than just digital art. The project intends to use technology to bring together art, fun, and ownership. With the launch of DOOD, Doodles is entering a new phase.

Weeks after the collapse of the Mantra (OM) token, users are still seeking answers about what happened. On Friday, May 9, OM was down 2.09%, despite a broader market rally, trading at $0.3667 and erasing its earlier gains. Earlier in the day, the token had climbed to a daily high of $0.3923, suggesting the potential for a breakout. However, it is now trading below both its 10-day and 20-day simple moving averages, which stand at $0.40614 and $0.4666, respectively. If Mantra can reclaim and sustain those levels, it would signal a possible shift in momentum. For now, though, technical indicators and investor sentiment are weighing on the token, suggesting that a reversal is unlikely in the near term. Instead of a breakout, OM quickly retraced, continuing the steady decline that has persisted for weeks. Investors still demand answers over Mantra’s 95% drop The token’s slide has continued since the sharp collapse on April 13, when Mantra, a real-world asset token, suddenly lost 95% of its value. While the team initially blamed exchanges for liquidity mismanagement, online investigators have shared a different narrative. Read more: Mantra price plummets: What happened to the real-world asset token? Several on-chain sleuths, including Choze and Onchain Lens, highlighted large movements from Mantra’s wallets to exchanges. While not definitive proof of insider selling, many in the community believe that’s exactly what occurred. Fueling further concern are allegations that the Mantra team controls up to 90% of the token’s supply. According to Onchain Lens, this level of control allowed the team to artificially pump OM’s price for months. In response to the crash and growing scrutiny, CEO John Mullin pledged to burn 150 million staked OM tokens, a portion of the team’s holdings. With a circulating supply of 1.66 billion, the burn would account for just under 10% of the token’s total supply.

That’s precisely what happened recently when a significant USDT transfer involving a substantial amount of funds was detected, moving from the HTX exchange to the Aave decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. This kind of large movement often signals strategic positioning by major players, commonly referred to as crypto whale s, and understanding these movements can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. What Did Whale Alert Report? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert , known for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions, flagged a notable transfer. The report indicated that a staggering 200,000,000 USDT, equivalent to approximately $200 million, was moved. The origin of this massive stablecoin transfer was identified as the HTX cryptocurrency exchange, and the destination was the Aave protocol. Such a significant sum changing hands between these specific platforms is more than just a routine deposit or withdrawal; it suggests a deliberate strategic action. Here’s a breakdown of the key details reported: Amount: 200,000,000 USDT Value: Approximately $200,000,000 USD Origin: HTX Exchange Destination: Aave Protocol Reported By: Whale Alert Understanding the Players: HTX , Aave , and USDT Transfer s To fully grasp the significance of this transaction, let’s quickly look at the entities involved: HTX: Formerly known as Huobi, HTX is a major centralized cryptocurrency exchange. Exchanges like HTX serve as gateways for users to buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies. Large amounts of assets are held in custody by exchanges, making outflows of this size particularly noteworthy. Aave: Aave is one of the largest decentralized lending and borrowing protocols operating primarily on the Ethereum blockchain (though it has expanded to other chains). Users can deposit crypto assets to earn yield or borrow assets against their collateral. Aave is a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. USDT (Tether): USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged to the value of the US dollar. Stablecoins are crucial in the crypto market for providing stability and acting as a medium of exchange, especially when moving funds between exchanges or protocols without converting back to fiat. A large USDT transfer from a centralized exchange like HTX to a DeFi protocol like Aave indicates a shift in strategy from holding assets on an exchange (often for trading) to deploying them within the DeFi ecosystem (often for yield generation, borrowing, or providing liquidity). Why Would a Crypto Whale Move $200M to Aave ? This is the million-dollar question (or rather, the $200-million question). While we can’t know the exact motivation behind this specific USDT transfer , several common reasons drive crypto whale s to move large sums to DeFi protocols like Aave : 1. Yield Farming and Lending: Aave allows users to deposit assets like USDT and earn interest. With $200 million, even a modest Annual Percentage Yield (APY) can generate significant returns compared to traditional finance options. This is perhaps the most common reason for moving stablecoins into Aave. 2. Borrowing Against Assets: The whale might intend to deposit the USDT as collateral to borrow other assets (like ETH or BTC) without selling their USDT holdings. This can be used for leverage, shorting, or funding other ventures while maintaining their long-term stablecoin position. 3. Providing Liquidity: While Aave is primarily lending/borrowing, the funds could potentially be used in related DeFi activities facilitated by Aave’s ecosystem or moved further into other protocols for liquidity provision in pools. 4. Arbitrage Opportunities: Large players constantly look for price differences across exchanges and protocols. Moving funds to Aave could be part of a complex strategy to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities involving lending rates or asset prices. 5. Security and Self-Custody: Some whales prefer to move assets off centralized exchanges like HTX into self-custodied wallets or protocols like Aave, where they retain more control over their private keys. However, moving to a DeFi protocol introduces smart contract risk. Implications of Such a Large USDT Transfer A $200 million USDT transfer is significant, even in the crypto market. While it’s unlikely to cause massive price swings for USDT itself due to its large market cap and stable nature, it highlights several points: Continued Confidence in DeFi: A transfer of this magnitude to Aave suggests continued trust and interest from large capital holders in the DeFi ecosystem’s potential for yield and financial services. Whale Activity Monitoring: It reinforces the importance of tracking crypto whale movements via services like Whale Alert . These large transactions can sometimes precede significant market moves or signal trends in how large capital is being deployed. Liquidity Inflow for Aave: The deposit of 200 million USDT significantly boosts the liquidity available on Aave for USDT lending and borrowing markets. This can potentially affect lending rates on the platform. Shift from CEX to DeFi: While HTX is a major exchange, this move represents capital flowing out of a centralized platform and into a decentralized one, a trend often observed among users seeking yield or greater control. Challenges and Risks Involved While the potential for yield on Aave is attractive, moving such a large sum isn’t without risks: Smart Contract Risk: DeFi protocols, including Aave, rely on complex smart contracts. While Aave is well-audited, a vulnerability or bug could potentially put deposited funds at risk. Liquidation Risk: If the whale uses the USDT as collateral to borrow other volatile assets, a sudden market downturn could lead to their position being liquidated, resulting in significant losses. Yield Fluctuations: Lending APYs on Aave can fluctuate based on supply and demand. The expected yield might decrease if more capital flows into the USDT market on Aave. Gas Fees: Moving large amounts on the Ethereum network (where Aave is prominent) can incur substantial gas fees, although recent network upgrades aim to mitigate this. Actionable Insights from the Whale Alert What can regular crypto enthusiasts learn from this event reported by Whale Alert ? 1. Pay Attention to Large Transfers: While not every whale move dictates market direction, consistently monitoring large transactions, especially those involving stablecoins and major platforms like HTX and Aave , can provide clues about where significant capital is flowing. 2. Understand DeFi Opportunities: Research platforms like Aave to understand how yield farming, lending, and borrowing work. This USDT transfer highlights the scale of capital seeking opportunities in DeFi. 3. Use Blockchain Trackers: Tools like Whale Alert offer transparency into on-chain movements, helping you stay informed about significant activities. 4. Assess Risk: Understand the risks associated with both centralized exchanges (like HTX) and DeFi protocols (like Aave) before deciding where to hold or deploy your assets. Summary: A Strategic USDT Transfer The movement of 200 million USDT from HTX to Aave , as highlighted by Whale Alert , is a prime example of a large-scale crypto whale maneuver. This substantial USDT transfer underscores the ongoing importance of stablecoins and the growing attraction of decentralized finance protocols like Aave for deploying significant capital in pursuit of yield or other strategic financial operations. While the precise motive remains speculative, such transactions provide valuable glimpses into the strategies of major market participants and the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

44388510,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159093,1746817843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Warning: US Dollar Forecast Points to Further Losses,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-dollar-forecast-rbc/,"In the dynamic world of global finance, shifts in major currencies send ripples far and wide, influencing everything from international trade to the performance of alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. A significant voice in this landscape, RBC, has recently issued a notable perspective on the future of the US Dollar. Their view? Further losses look likely. This outlook prompts crucial questions for anyone watching the financial markets, including those invested in the digital asset space, as currency strength or weakness can indirectly impact capital flows and investor sentiment towards assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. US Dollar Forecast: What RBC Predicts RBC’s latest US Dollar forecast suggests a challenging path ahead for the greenback. The institution’s analysis points towards continued depreciation against a basket of major currencies. This isn’t presented as a short-term blip but potentially a more sustained trend driven by underlying economic and policy factors. Key points from their forecast include: Expectation of the dollar losing ground against currencies like the Euro, British Pound, and potentially some commodity-linked currencies. The prediction is rooted in specific economic models and forward-looking indicators analyzed by their research team. This outlook contrasts with periods of strong dollar performance seen previously, marking a potential shift in the global currency landscape. RBC Analysis: Deconstructing the Bearish View Understanding the reasons behind RBC’s prediction is key. Their RBC analysis likely hinges on several interconnected factors influencing the USD outlook : 1. Interest Rate Expectations: Central bank policy is a primary driver of currency value. If the market anticipates the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates sooner or more aggressively than other central banks, it can reduce the yield attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, putting downward pressure on the USD. 2. Inflation Dynamics: While inflation has been a concern globally, the path of disinflation in the US relative to other economies could influence policy divergence and, consequently, currency strength. 3. Economic Growth Differentials: The relative economic performance of the US compared to other major economies matters. If growth outside the US accelerates while US growth moderates, capital flows might shift, impacting the dollar. 4. Fiscal and Debt Concerns: Long-term concerns about the US fiscal situation and rising national debt can sometimes weigh on currency sentiment, although this is often a slower-burning factor. 5. Global Risk Sentiment: The dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency during times of global turmoil. If global risk sentiment improves, demand for safe assets like the dollar can decrease. Forex Market Analysis: Implications Across Pairs A weaker USD outlook has direct implications for the entire Forex market analysis . Currency pairs involving the dollar would see corresponding movements: EUR/USD: A weaker dollar would likely push this pair higher, meaning it takes more dollars to buy one Euro. GBP/USD: Similarly, this pair could strengthen, indicating a stronger British Pound relative to the dollar. USD/JPY: This pair might fall, meaning fewer Yen are needed to buy one dollar, indicating Yen strength relative to the USD. USD/CAD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD: Commodity-linked currencies could strengthen against a weaker dollar, potentially benefiting from both USD weakness and commodity price movements (as commodities are often priced in USD). Traders and investors in the Forex market closely watch these shifts, adjusting strategies based on perceived currency strength and weakness driven by analysis like RBC’s. Currency Trends and Their Wider Impact The predicted currency trends extend beyond just major pairs. A weaker dollar can influence: Commodity Prices: Many major commodities (oil, gold, metals) are priced in US dollars. A weaker dollar makes these commodities cheaper for buyers using other currencies, potentially increasing demand and prices. This is particularly relevant for gold, often seen as an alternative store of value. Emerging Markets: Many emerging market countries hold significant dollar-denominated debt. A weaker dollar makes it easier for these countries to service their debt, potentially improving their economic outlook and the performance of their local currencies and assets. Corporate Earnings: US multinational corporations earning revenue overseas might see their foreign earnings translate into more dollars when the USD is weaker, potentially boosting reported profits. Conversely, companies importing goods might face higher costs. Capital Flows: Persistent currency trends can influence where international capital flows. If the dollar is expected to depreciate, investors might look to diversify into assets denominated in other currencies or into alternative asset classes. For those in the cryptocurrency space, while not directly pegged to the dollar, Bitcoin and other digital assets sometimes exhibit inverse correlations with the USD, especially during periods of significant macroeconomic shifts or monetary policy changes. A weakening dollar environment, particularly if driven by inflation concerns or expansionary monetary policy, can sometimes be viewed positively by crypto proponents who see digital assets as a hedge against traditional currency devaluation. Actionable Insights from the Outlook Given RBC’s US Dollar forecast , what are some actionable insights? Stay Informed: Keep track of economic data releases (inflation, employment, GDP) and central bank communications (Federal Reserve, ECB, BoE, etc.), as these heavily influence currency movements. Consider Diversification: A potentially weakening dollar environment reinforces the case for geographical and currency diversification in investment portfolios. Review Forex Exposure: Businesses with international operations should review their currency exposure and hedging strategies. Evaluate Asset Performance: Understand how different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, have historically performed during periods of dollar weakness or strength. While past performance is not indicative of future results, it can provide context. Consult Experts: For significant financial decisions, consulting with financial advisors who understand currency risk and global markets is advisable. It’s important to remember that currency markets are complex and influenced by a multitude of factors. While a forecast from a reputable institution like RBC provides valuable insight, it is one perspective among many, and market conditions can change rapidly. Summary: The Path Ahead for the Greenback RBC’s RBC analysis presents a clear view: the USD outlook points towards further depreciation. This forecast is grounded in expectations surrounding interest rates, economic performance, and global financial conditions.

In a May 9 X post , ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. “It’s unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said. The attacker stole 14 Bored Ape NFTs in 2022. Source: ZachXBT Related: Crypto sleuth ZachXBT says he unmasked 50x Hyperliquid whale Anonymous attacker In December 2022, an anonymous attacker stole 14 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which at the time traded for roughly $86,000 each, according to data from CoinSlam. Law enforcement then “mistakenly reviewed logs from OpenSea which included [Curry’s] home IP address and used this to incorrectly link him as the suspect,” ZachXBT wrote. “In reality as part of his security work at Yuga, [Curry] had been investigating the theft and used a private key put in the JavaScript of the website by the threat actor,” ZachXBT said. ZachXBT said he used forensic tracing — including reconstructing the flow of funds through Tornado, an Ethereum mixer — to identify a person he alleges is a likely suspect in the 2022 theft. He said law enforcement officials should “request all data related to [the individual’s] social media accounts” and dig into on-chain transactions associated with their alleged wallet. Launched in 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club is among the most valuable NFT collections, with a cumulative market capitalization of more than $300 million, according to data from CoinGecko. As of May 9, Bored Ape NFTs trade for roughly $30,000 each, according to NFT marketplace OpenSea. Individual NFTs vary in price due to unique characteristics.

The analyst’s projections are based on recurring patterns observed during previous market cycles, suggesting that XRP is poised for multiple upward movements. In his latest commentary shared on X, EGRAG revisited a study he initially released in September 2023 when XRP was trading around $0.5789. At that time, he argued that the asset had the potential to follow several significant price rallies seen in its past, using previous price behavior as a roadmap for future performance. By comparing past bull runs and marking them with different color codes for clarity, EGRAG developed a model to identify possible price targets. #XRP — 5 Colors / 5 Scenarios : White: Confirmed and solid — all systems go! Yellow: Coming very soon — keep an eye out! Red: Coming soon — major movement ahead! Blue: Coming for sure — no doubt about it! Green: Coming, and it’s inevitable — a… https://t.co/5f0UOa8gwS pic.twitter.com/voHWbYrPsW — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 8, 2025 Previous Rallies and Current Expectations The first historical rally in his model, marked as “White,” took place between July and December 2014 when XRP rose by approximately 932%, from $0.00281 to $0.02803. EGRAG stated that applying the same growth rate to XRP’s cycle low of $0.2870 (recorded in June 2022) would produce a price of around $3. He noted that this target was already achieved when XRP briefly reached the $3 range in January 2025. With the initial milestone met, EGRAG now anticipates the next rally, represented by the “Yellow” phase, which he believes is imminent. This phase is based on the 1,563% increase XRP experienced from March 2020 to April 2021, when it rose from its bottom to $1.96. If this same percentage growth occurs from the current cycle bottom of $0.2870, the resulting price would be approximately $4.85. According to EGRAG, this is the next significant price move expected “very soon.” Further Price Projections: $6.22, $7.68, and Beyond Following the projected $4.85 level, EGRAG predicts an even larger surge, labeled the “Red” rally. This projection is modeled on XRP’s 2,035% rise between August and December 2013. Applying that growth rate to the current bottom would bring the token to a new high of $6.22. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional potential rallies were also outlined. The “Blue” phase, based on a 2,536% price increase from July 2017 to January 2018, would raise XRP to an estimated $7.68. EGRAG maintains confidence in this price target, asserting that such a move is not only possible but likely. The final and most ambitious projection is marked “Green,” referencing XRP’s explosive growth of 9,468% between January and May 2017, during which it rose from $0.0042 to $0.3988. Replicating this increase from the $0.2870 base would result in a price near $27 . EGRAG considers this long-term target to be the culmination of XRP’s potential growth, calling it inevitable in several of his past analyses. Currently trading at $2.30, XRP would need to climb by approximately 1,073% to reach the $27 target. While these projections are speculative, EGRAG’s analysis is rooted in historical patterns that have repeated across various market cycles. Investors and observers are closely monitoring XRP to see if it can continue this upward trajectory and meet the forecasted milestones. With the broader crypto market experiencing renewed momentum, XRP’s price movements in the coming weeks may offer more insight into whether these long-term targets are within reach.

This is the future envisioned by T-Rex, a blockchain project making waves in the burgeoning world of Web 3.0 entertainment. The big news shaking up the space? T-Rex blockchain has successfully secured a significant $17 million in recent blockchain funding , setting the stage for a new era of digital interaction. The announcement, reported by The Daily Hodl, highlights T-Rex’s ambitious goal: to directly reward users for their everyday online interactions. This isn’t just about passive consumption; it’s about recognizing and compensating the engagement that fuels the digital economy. With backing from strategic investors like Portal Ventures and Arbitrum Gaming Ventures, T-Rex is poised to bring its innovative approach to a wider audience. What is T-Rex Blockchain and Its Mission? At its core, T-Rex blockchain positions itself at the intersection of blockchain technology and online entertainment. The project focuses specifically on the Web 3.0 space, aiming to build an ecosystem where value flows back to the users who generate it through their participation. The traditional online model often sees platforms accumulating vast amounts of value from user activity – attention, data, content creation – without directly compensating the users themselves. T-Rex seeks to disrupt this model by implementing a system where user engagement translates into direct rewards. Think of it as shifting from being merely a user to becoming a participant with a stake in the ecosystem’s success. This aligns perfectly with the core principles of Web 3.0, which emphasize decentralization, user ownership, and value distribution. The Significance of $17M in Blockchain Funding The successful closure of a $17 million funding round is a major milestone for T-Rex. This substantial investment signals strong confidence from strategic players in the potential of T-Rex’s model and its vision for Web 3.0 entertainment. Blockchain funding rounds like this provide the necessary capital for projects to: Develop and refine their core technology (in this case, the Proof-of-Engagement mechanism). Expand their team and operational capacity. Build partnerships with existing platforms and content creators. Market their platform and attract a large user base. Ensure the security and scalability of the blockchain infrastructure. The involvement of investors like Portal Ventures and Arbitrum Gaming Ventures is particularly noteworthy. Portal Ventures focuses on Web3 infrastructure and applications, while Arbitrum Gaming Ventures highlights T-Rex’s potential relevance in the rapidly growing blockchain gaming and entertainment sectors. This backing provides not just capital, but also strategic guidance and connections within the Web3 ecosystem. Proof-of-Engagement: Earning Crypto Rewards for Being You The technical heart of T-Rex’s value proposition lies in its innovative Proof-of-Engagement (PoE) mechanism. Unlike traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which validate transactions based on computational power or staked assets, PoE focuses on verifying and valuing genuine user interaction. How does this work in practice? T-Rex aims to integrate with popular online platforms – the article specifically mentions TikTok as an example – to track verifiable user activities. These activities could include: Creating and posting content (videos, posts, etc.) Interacting with content (likes, shares, comments) Spending time on the platform Participating in community activities The PoE mechanism is designed to distinguish between authentic engagement and bot activity, ensuring that rewards go to real users contributing value. By turning activities on platforms like TikTok into verifiable data points on the blockchain, T-Rex can then distribute crypto rewards directly to those users. This system creates a direct link between user activity and tangible value, offering a compelling incentive for people to engage more deeply and authentically within the digital ecosystem. Revolutionizing Web 3.0 Entertainment T-Rex’s focus on Web 3.0 entertainment is strategic. Entertainment platforms, from social media to streaming to gaming, are massive drivers of online engagement. By targeting these areas, T-Rex can tap into huge existing user bases and demonstrate the power of its Proof-of-Engagement model on a large scale. The concept of earning crypto rewards for engaging with entertainment content is a powerful one. It transforms passive consumption into an active, potentially rewarding experience. For content creators, it could open up new revenue streams beyond traditional advertising or subscription models, directly compensating them for the engagement they generate. This approach could significantly boost user participation in the broader digital ecosystem, encouraging more creation, interaction, and community building, all while distributing value more equitably. Benefits for Users and the Ecosystem The T-Rex model, powered by its Proof-of-Engagement mechanism and supported by substantial blockchain funding , promises several key benefits: Direct Rewards for Activity: Users earn crypto rewards simply for using platforms they enjoy. Increased User Participation: Incentives can drive deeper engagement and content creation. Value Alignment: Aligns the interests of users and platforms by sharing the value generated by engagement. New Opportunities for Creators: Provides alternative or supplementary income streams for content creators. Growth of Web 3.0 Entertainment: Accelerates the adoption and development of decentralized entertainment experiences. While the concept is promising, successful implementation requires navigating challenges such as integrating with existing platforms, ensuring the accuracy and fairness of the PoE system, and educating a broad audience about the benefits of T-Rex blockchain and crypto rewards . Looking Ahead: The Future of Digital Engagement The $17 million funding round is just the beginning for T-Rex. The project’s success will depend on its ability to execute its vision, build robust technology, and foster strong partnerships. If successful, T-Rex could become a leading example of how blockchain technology can empower users and create more equitable digital ecosystems. The idea of earning rewards for online activity is not entirely new, but T-Rex’s focus on a verifiable Proof-of-Engagement system integrated with popular platforms represents a significant step forward. This development is worth watching for anyone interested in the evolution of the internet, the growth of Web 3.0 entertainment, and the potential for users to gain more control and value from their online presence. Conclusion: A New Era of Digital Value The $17 million funding secured by T-Rex blockchain marks a pivotal moment for the project and highlights the growing interest in models that reward users for their online engagement. By leveraging its Proof-of-Engagement mechanism, T-Rex aims to redefine Web 3.0 entertainment , turning everyday online interactions into opportunities to earn crypto rewards . This significant blockchain funding injection provides the resources needed to build out their platform and potentially usher in a new era where users are valued participants, not just passive consumers, in the digital world.

These changes are arousing investors’ concerns even as the Ethereum price enters deep bearish zones. As a result, ETH holders have started looking for more sustainable prospects in the market, with Remittix appearing on their radar. The new crypto has surged by more than 550% amid Ethereum’s sluggish price movements, hence industrial experts are calling it the Ethereum saviour. Remittix: Ethereum-based token gains traction with innovative global payment solutions Source: Remittix With the winds of change in market forces, Remittix is making investors take notice with an interesting value proposition. This PayFi thesis is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. The platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and Ethereum. It provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients’ bank accounts. This immediate utility makes Remittix stand out in a market crowded with dormant layer 1s and hype driven projects. Furthermore, Remittix offers an open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. With its simplicity, Remittix guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient. This potential is why industrial experts anticipate Remittix to be the game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. For businesses, Remittix offers its powerful Pay API, which allows them to accept cryptocurrency payments and automatically convert them into fiat currency. The API functionality removes technical hurdles, making it easier for companies to adopt crypto while streamlining operations in the rapidly expanding digital economy. With these innovative measures from Remittix , the Ethereum blockchain is gaining momentum again, and analysts believe it could launch the changing tide for its market sentiment. Ethereum’s network overhaul: What does it mean for investors? Buterin has clearly stated that switching to RISC-V technology would result in substantial speed and cost improvements for Ethereum’s execution layer. The unveiling of these plans came during the activation of the Pectra update in May. The Pectra upgrade focused on bettering the user experience, boosting rollup scalability and raising the validator stake maximum threshold. Buterin’s RISC-V overhaul, however, aims to enhance smart contract-proving operations, directly impacting scalability. This overhaul plan is raising doubts in Ethereum’s ecosystem while dampening investors’ sentiment, even as its on-chain metrics continue to drop. Data from DeFiLama indicates that Ethereum’s total value locked has been in sharp decline since peaking at $86.6 billion in December, its highest level since mid-2022. As of now, Ethereum’s TVL has dropped to $50 billion, marking a steep 43% decrease in just a few months. This decrease highlights waning user activity and capital outflows from Ethereum-based protocols. Source: DefiLama However, the Remittix PayFi revolution is bringing attention back to Ethereum through its immediate utility in the global remittance sector. If its presale momentum continues, Remittix is on track to achieve a $30 billion market cap, generating massive inflow for Ethereum in the process. Conclusion Remittix is on the front line for Ethereum-based projects with massive inflows, due to its revolution of the $190 global remittance sector. Currently priced at $0.0757 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth, with a 10x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise.

Yet, major geopolitical and trade shifts can send ripples that eventually reach digital asset markets. Recent comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding potential Trump tariffs on Chinese imports are a prime example of a development that warrants attention from anyone navigating the crypto space. Understanding the Potential for Steep China Tariffs According to a report from Walter Bloomberg on X (formerly Twitter), former President Donald Trump suggested that an 80% tariff on goods imported from China seemed ‘appropriate’. This statement, while not a current policy given he is not in office, harks back to the trade tensions that defined much of his previous presidency and signals a potential approach should he return to power. Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods or services. Their purpose can vary – from protecting domestic industries to generating revenue for the government, or as a tool in international negotiations. An 80% tariff is extraordinarily high and would represent a significant barrier to trade between the two largest economies in the world. During his previous term, Trump implemented tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods, citing unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft, and the large U.S. trade deficit with China. China retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. products, escalating into what became widely known as the US-China trade war. The prospect of an even higher, 80% tariff suggests a potential intensification of this economic conflict. Such a move would likely have profound effects on supply chains, consumer prices, corporate profits, and overall economic stability globally. What is a Trade War and Why Does it Matter for Markets? A trade war occurs when countries try to hurt each other’s trade by imposing tariffs or quotas. It’s a tit-for-tat cycle of protectionist measures. The trade war impact extends far beyond just the cost of imported goods. Here’s a breakdown of potential consequences: Increased Costs for Businesses and Consumers: Tariffs make imported goods more expensive. Businesses relying on imported components face higher costs, which they may pass on to consumers. This can lead to inflation. Disruption of Supply Chains: Companies might need to find new suppliers outside the tariffed country, which can be costly and complex. This can lead to shortages or delays. Reduced Exports: The country facing tariffs often retaliates, making the first country’s exports more expensive in the retaliating country. This hurts businesses that export goods. Economic Uncertainty: Trade wars create unpredictability, making businesses hesitant to invest and hire. This can slow down economic growth. Currency Fluctuations: Countries involved in a trade war might see their currencies weaken or strengthen based on trade flows and economic sentiment. These impacts ripple through traditional financial markets. Stock markets often react negatively to escalating trade tensions due to concerns about corporate profits and economic growth. Bond yields can fluctuate as investors seek safe havens or react to inflation fears. Commodity prices are also sensitive, particularly those heavily traded between the involved nations. How Could Potential Trump Tariffs Spark a New Trade War? While Trump is currently a private citizen, his past actions and continued influence mean his statements carry weight, particularly as he is a leading candidate for the next presidential election. An 80% tariff would be a drastic measure, significantly higher than the tariffs imposed during his first term (which generally ranged from 10% to 25% on broad categories of goods, with some specific items higher). Implementing such a high tariff would almost certainly provoke a strong retaliatory response from China. This would rapidly escalate tensions and re-ignite a full-blown US-China trade war, potentially more severe than the previous one. The economic consequences, as outlined above, would be amplified. The stated rationale for such tariffs often centers on correcting trade imbalances or addressing perceived unfair practices. However, economists widely debate the effectiveness of high tariffs in achieving these goals, often pointing to the negative impacts on domestic consumers and businesses that rely on imports or exports. Analyzing the Trade War Impact on Global Stability A significant escalation in the US-China trade conflict wouldn’t just affect these two nations; it would have global ramifications. The interconnectedness of the modern economy means disruptions between the two largest players send shockwaves everywhere. Consider the global supply chain: Impact Area Potential Consequence of 80% Tariffs Manufacturing Companies forced to relocate production or find new suppliers, leading to delays and increased costs. Technology Sector Disruption in the supply of electronic components; potential impact on product pricing and availability. Agriculture U.S. farmers could lose access to the Chinese market due to retaliatory tariffs. Retail Higher prices for consumer goods imported from China, reducing consumer purchasing power. Global Growth Increased uncertainty and reduced trade volume could slow down global economic expansion. Beyond economics, trade wars can also strain diplomatic relations, making cooperation on other global issues (like climate change, pandemics, or security) more difficult. The instability created by a trade war can spill over into geopolitical tensions, adding another layer of complexity to the international landscape. Potential Crypto Market Reaction to Escalating Trade Tensions Now, let’s connect these global economic tremors back to the world of digital assets. How might the prospect or reality of an intense US-China trade war, potentially triggered by steep Trump tariffs , influence the crypto market reaction ? Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown varied reactions to macroeconomic events. Sometimes they act as risk-on assets, moving in tandem with stocks. Other times, they are speculated to be uncorrelated or even act as a ‘digital gold’ or safe haven asset during times of traditional market turmoil or economic uncertainty. Here are a few ways an escalated trade war could impact the crypto market: Increased Demand for Safe Havens: If the trade war creates significant instability in traditional markets (stocks, bonds, fiat currencies), investors might look for alternative assets perceived as outside the direct control of governments and central banks. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and limited supply, could potentially benefit from this ‘flight to safety’ narrative. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs can be inflationary. If the cost of goods rises significantly due to tariffs and supply chain issues, investors might seek assets perceived as hedges against inflation. Bitcoin is often discussed in this context, although its effectiveness as an inflation hedge is still debated and historically volatile. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Conversely, if the trade war leads to a significant global economic slowdown or recession, it could negatively impact risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Reduced consumer spending and investment capital might lead to outflows from speculative markets like crypto. Currency Devaluation/Control: If the Chinese Yuan or other currencies face pressure due to the trade war, individuals or businesses in those regions might seek alternative stores of value or means of exchange, potentially increasing interest in stablecoins or decentralized cryptocurrencies. Capital controls, if implemented by governments during times of economic stress, could also drive interest in assets that are easier to move across borders. Increased Volatility: Macroeconomic uncertainty generally leads to increased volatility across all markets, including crypto. The prospect of a trade war alone can cause market jitters, leading to price swings. It’s important to note that the crypto market reaction is complex and influenced by numerous factors, not just trade policy. However, a major disruption like a severe US-China trade war would undoubtedly be a significant variable in the market’s calculus. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for renewed Trump tariffs and an escalated US-China trade war, what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments regarding trade policy, particularly statements from political figures and official government actions. Monitor how traditional markets (stocks, currencies) are reacting, as this can often precede or influence crypto movements. Understand the ‘Safe Haven’ Narrative: While appealing, the ‘digital gold’ narrative for Bitcoin during economic crises is not guaranteed. Its price can still be subject to significant downturns during broad market sell-offs. Consider your risk tolerance. Diversification: As with any investment strategy, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket based solely on a potential trade war scenario. Assess Your Time Horizon: Short-term market reactions to trade news can be volatile. Consider your long-term investment goals versus short-term trading opportunities or risks. Look Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin is the most prominent, consider how other cryptocurrencies might be affected. Some altcoins might be more sensitive to overall market sentiment, while others might have specific use cases (like supply chain or decentralized finance protocols) that could be indirectly impacted. The potential for an 80% tariff on Chinese imports, while currently just a statement, highlights the ongoing risk of trade tensions between the US and China. This risk is a significant factor in the global economic outlook and, by extension, a potential influence on the complex dynamics of the crypto market reaction . Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in the Age of Global Trade Wars The suggestion of imposing an 80% tariff on Chinese imports by former President Trump serves as a potent reminder that global trade policy remains a potential flashpoint. Such a drastic measure would undoubtedly reignite and escalate the US-China trade war, causing significant disruption to supply chains, increasing costs, and injecting considerable uncertainty into the global economy. The trade war impact would be felt across traditional markets, potentially leading investors to reconsider their positions. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are multifaceted. While some argue that Bitcoin could act as a safe haven asset during times of such economic turmoil, others caution that a global downturn could negatively affect all risk assets. The crypto market reaction will depend on a complex interplay of factors, including the severity of the trade war, investor sentiment, and the broader economic climate. Staying informed and understanding the potential connections between macroeconomic events like trade wars and the crypto space is crucial for navigating the volatile markets ahead.

According to a May 9 Bloomberg report, Democratic senators asked Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to report on the steps Binance had taken as part of its November 2023 plea agreement with US authorities, amid reports that Trump and his family had deepened connections with the exchange. That settlement saw Binance pay more than $4 billion as part of a deal with the Justice Department, Treasury, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and had then-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao step down. However, since Trump won the presidency in 2024, many lawmakers have accused the president of corruption from profiting off crypto while being in a position to influence laws and regulations over the industry. Trump has launched his own memecoin — which earns the project millions of dollars in transaction fees — and offered the top tokenholders the opportunity to attend an exclusive dinner in Washington, DC. His family-backed crypto venture World Liberty Financial also recently announced that an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, MGX, would settle a $2 billion investment in Binance using the platform’s USD1 stablecoin. “Our concerns about Binance’s compliance obligations are even more pressing given recent reports that the company is using the Trump family’s stablecoin to partner with foreign investment companies,” the senators said in the letter, according to Bloomberg. Related: Trump tricked into pushing XRP for crypto reserve: Report Stablecoin bill fails to pass the US Senate The letter came less than 24 hours after some of the same senators blocked a crucial vote on a bill to regulate stablecoins, named the GENIUS Act. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who reportedly signed the letter and opposed moving forward on the stablecoin bill, suggested the Senate should not be aligned with “facilitat[ing] this kind of corruption” from Trump. Bessent said the Senate “missed an opportunity” by not passing the stablecoin bill, but did not directly address any of the concerns over Trump’s crypto interests. It’s unclear if or when the chamber could consider another vote on the bill. In an April 23 report, the nonpartisan organization State Democracy Defenders Action said roughly 40% of Trump’s net worth was tied to crypto. The group noted that the GENIUS Act, in its current version, “would not prevent President Trump from using his executive powers to establish a regulatory environment and enforcement agenda that prioritizes his personal enrichment over the broader interests of US stakeholders.” Amid the concerns with the stablecoin and proposed market structure bills, Zhao reportedly applied for a federal pardon from Trump. Though the former CEO already served four months in prison, a pardon for his felony charge could allow him to get more involved with the crypto industry through a management position.

Yakovenko stated that with the Solana v2.2 release, there was a 20% increase in the network's processing power, which corresponds to a capacity increase five times that of Ethereum's Pectra update. On Wednesday, the Ethereum network successfully launched Pectra, its third major update since Merge. The update aims to improve the network’s user experience, increase scalability, and strengthen staking flexibility. Pectra includes innovations such as account abstraction, adjustments to data storage requirements, increased validator staking limits, and greater flexibility in withdrawals.

Wood’s comments came during an exclusive interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC’s Squawk Box . The discussion began with commentary on US president Donald Trump’s “interesting way of negotiating.” Wood stated that the current economic upheaval will result in lower global taxes, something she claims will be a net positive for the world economy. The conversation quickly pivoted to focus on the US, which, according to Woods, is emerging from a so-called “rolling recession,” a period where certain industries experience growth while others wither. Wood explained, in the US, “the rolling recession we’ve been in for the last three years since the Fed upped rates” had proven cause for worry, saying “more people are getting concerned about an extended recession.” She cited a negative first quarter for 2025, leading into a turbulent second, but then added that there was cause for optimism. “Amid all the uncertainty,” said Wood, “we actually think we’re at the end of this rolling recession … I think we’re going to see a lot more productivity-driven growth, which means inflation is going to be much lower than expected.” She added that this turn of events would be very “capital friendly.” Wood expressed unbridled bullishness for AI, Bitcoin, and Tesla When asked about the primary drivers contributing to the end of the described rolling recession, Wood maintained her longstanding support for the technology sector with a primary focus on automation, Bitcoin, and Tesla. According to a recent filing, ARK Invest purchased 107,661 shares of Nvidia valued at approximately $12.2 million alongside increased investments in chipmaker AMD and science stock CRISPR. Alongside her bullishness for these firms, she reiterated her full-throated support for Bitcoin, citing an upside price target of more than one million USD. “We have always had a 2030 target,” Wood told Sorkin, adding that she viewed “the base case in the $700,000 to $750,000 range” and the bull case “in the $1.5 million range.” Tesla expected to serve as the workhorse for US economic growth The Ark Invest CEO saved her most bullish predictions for Elon Musk’s Tesla , which she touted as a three-pronged booster for economic growth. Per Wood, “the reason Tesla is ahead of the game is … the three platforms it’s already innovating on: robots, energy storage … and AI. According to Wood, those three technologies will drive a massive market for robotics in the form of autonomous vehicles, energy storage (likely related to data clusters and AI infrastructure), and the artificial intelligence sector as a whole. “We think that’s a $26 trillion revenue opportunity,” said Wood. She added that the gains would be “split between home and industrial” and realized in the next five to ten years.

Such activity raises the question: is a new memecoin surge on the horizon? With investors buzzing and market dynamics shifting, the potential for growth in these coins sparks curiosity. Will this be the beginning of another exciting phase in the world of memecoins? Pepe Altcoin: 80% Surge with Steady Consolidation The past month PEPE saw an 80.08% price jump, while the last six months registered a modest 2.70% decline. Weekly performance added a 24.45% boost, showing a mix of rapid short-term gains and tempered medium-term changes. The coin's price behavior has been volatile yet engaging, reflecting active trading sentiment during different periods. Current levels lie between a support of $0.00000404 and a resistance near $0.00001223, with a secondary resistance at $0.00001633. Bulls appear to be pushing the price upward despite an RSI of 72.54 hinting at caution. Traders might consider stepping in near support to ride the upswing while monitoring resistance for exit opportunities. Brett Price Analysis: Rapid 1-Month Surge with Mixed 6-Month Trend BRETT recent performance shows a striking monthly gain of over 200%, contrasted by a notable drop in the past six months. Price movements have been volatile, reflecting a strong short-term upward burst amid longer-term weakness. Significant spikes occurred during the month, while the half-year trend reveals a corrective pullback that tempers the recent rally. Current pricing hovers between key levels of $0.0333 and $0.0810, with resistance at $0.0999 and support near $0.0045. Bulls appear to dominate the market; however, caution is warranted as the RSI approaches overbought territory. Traders might consider buying dips within this range and targeting the first resistance level for potential short-term gains. Conclusion PEPE and BRETT have shown impressive price movements recently. This suggests that interest in these memecoins is growing. An influx of new investors could be driving this trend. The behavior of these coins might indicate a broader pattern in the market. Watching their progress can provide insights into the potential resurgence of interest in memecoins. This momentum could mark the beginning of a new cycle in this particular segment.

A significant step towards a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem has just been announced. Omnichain liquidity infrastructure provider Stakestone (STO) has officially gone live with its integration supporting World Liberty Financial’s (WLFI) USD1 stablecoin . This move is set to dramatically enhance cross-chain liquidity for the USD1 asset, making it more accessible and usable across various networks. What Does This Stakestone Integration Mean for USD1 Stablecoin? At its core, this integration means that WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin can now flow more freely between different blockchain networks supported by Stakestone’s infrastructure. Traditionally, moving assets between blockchains has been a complex, often expensive, and time-consuming process. This is where Stakestone, as an omnichain provider, steps in. Stakestone specializes in building the bridges and underlying mechanisms that allow assets to exist and be utilized natively across multiple chains without needing wrapped or synthetic versions that can introduce additional risks or complexities. By integrating USD1, Stakestone is essentially adding this stablecoin to its growing roster of supported assets that can benefit from true cross-chain liquidity . Why is Cross-Chain Liquidity So Important? Think of blockchain networks as individual countries, each with its own currency and regulations. Moving money between them requires exchanges, fees, and often delays. In the crypto world, this fragmentation limits user experience and the potential of decentralized applications (dApps). Cross-chain liquidity breaks down these barriers. It allows users to: Access DeFi protocols on different chains using the same asset (like USD1). Move value efficiently for trading, lending, or yield farming opportunities wherever they exist. Avoid the hassle and cost of multiple swaps or bridges that create fragmented liquidity. Unlock greater capital efficiency across the entire DeFi landscape. For a stablecoin like USD1, which aims to provide a stable store of value pegged to the US dollar, being readily available and usable across numerous chains is crucial for its adoption and utility within the broader crypto ecosystem. The Stakestone integration directly addresses this need. Who Benefits from This WLFI and Stakestone Collaboration? Several parties stand to gain from this integration: USD1 Holders: They gain unprecedented flexibility to use their USD1 stablecoin on various chains without cumbersome bridging. DeFi Protocols: Protocols on supported chains can potentially see increased liquidity and usage if they integrate or support the cross-chain USD1. Stakestone Users: Users of the Stakestone platform gain access to another stable asset with enhanced cross-chain capabilities. WLFI: This significantly expands the reach and utility of their USD1 stablecoin , fostering greater adoption and integration into the decentralized economy. This collaboration leverages Stakestone’s expertise in omnichain infrastructure to solve a key challenge for WLFI and its users. Looking Ahead: The Future of Omnichain Stablecoins The move by Stakestone to integrate WLFI ‘s USD1 stablecoin highlights a growing trend towards building truly interconnected DeFi ecosystems. As more assets and protocols embrace omnichain solutions, the user experience in DeFi will become smoother and more intuitive. The need for complex bridging or wrapping will diminish, leading to a more unified and efficient market.

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Crypto Capo tells his 132,000 followers on the instant messaging app Telegram that taking profits may be the optimal play as altcoins look primed to crash after a sharp increase. “Analysis has been playing out as expected. Very strong bullish move. Bitcoin reached $98,000 and went even higher (deviation above probably). Ethereum has reached $2,300. Solana is also at the $170-200 main resistance. Altcoins have pumped 30%-100% What now? I’m taking more profits here. 50% [took profits] already. Reversal should be strong.” According to Capo, Ethereum ( ETH ) – the second-largest digital asset by market cap – has reached its resistance zone and will soon form a local top before making a “strong bearish move.” “The $1,500 support held and price has now reached the resistance zone of $2,000-2,300. Expecting a local top formation here and then a strong bearish move.” Source: CryptoCapo/Telegram ETH is trading for $2,290 at time of writing, an 11.5% increase during the last 24 hours. The trader’s chart appears to indicate that Ethereum could dip below $1,200 sometime near June. However, moving on to ETH rival Solana ( SOL ), Capo says the smart contract platform could continue its upward momentum as it is outpacing the flagship crypto asset. “SOL looks ready to reach the main target of $170-200, outperforming BTC. The Solana ecosystem should keep going up.” Source: CryptoCapo/Telegram Solana is trading for $170.68 at time of writing, a 7% increase during the last day.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has radically shifted its policy on crypto, bringing voices such as that of Commissioner Hester M. Peirce to the forefront. However, some still believe that her pro-crypto approach has important limitations. Cathy Yoon, General Counsel at Wormhole Foundation, recently commented on the remarks made by Commissioner Peirce. While she agreed to some extent that regulatory exemptions for crypto are needed, she criticized Peirce’s idea of a regulatory sandbox. You might also like: SEC’s Hester Peirce pushes back on crypto regulation stance Notably, the debate centers around tokenized securities, which fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. Any type of security must meet stringent regulatory requirements before the SEC deems it compliant. However, there are significant challenges ahead. Sandboxes are great in theory, but there are risks: Yoon Peirce points to ongoing technical issues as a key obstacle. In particular, the technical infrastructure remains underdeveloped. Yoon acknowledged this as a compelling argument in favor of regulatory exemptions for tokenized securities projects. “The infrastructure needed to support tokenized securities is still rather undeveloped and expensive to implement,” Yoon, Wormhole. Still, Yoon noted that she disagrees with Peirce’s concept of a regulatory sandbox. The concept, which Peirce has long advocated, refers to allowing startups to test certain products that exist in a regulatory gray area. These firms are closely monitored by regulators but face fewer penalties and a reduced compliance burden. Yoon argues that sandboxes sound promising in theory but introduce risks such as arbitrary enforcement and favoritism. “A sandbox is only as good as the leeway and support a regulator offers to the sandbox participants. There is also a concern that regulators may favor sandbox participants, leading to biased oversight or even weakened enforcement in the long term,” Yoon, Wormhole. Instead of a regulatory sandbox, Yoon proposed a limited-duration regulatory exemption. This would allow companies to test their products in a real environment, helping them adapt to actual conditions and scale more effectively.

SEC Brings Wall Street to Washington for Tokenization Roundtable In a bid to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), the SEC will host a much-anticipated roundtable on tokenization in Washington, D.C., on May 12. The SEC will host a public roundtable on tokenization on May 12, bringing together major financial and crypto firms to discuss regulatory implications. #sec #tokenization #rwa https://t.co/6c3ctdxv5D — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 5, 2025 Spearheaded by Commissioner Hester Peirce, a longstanding crypto advocate within the Commission, the event indicates a growing interest among regulators in the tokenization of real-world assets. The session, titled “Tokenization—Moving Assets Onchain: Where TradFi and DeFi Meet,” features two panels. The first will include powerhouse institutions such as BlackRock, Nasdaq, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton—entities already exploring tokenized financial instruments. The second will delve into regulatory frameworks and long-term industry impacts, with speakers from Robinhood, Securitize, and Blockchain Capital. This roundtable forms part of the SEC’s broader initiative to engage with emerging crypto technologies and solicit public feedback—a rare moment of openness in an otherwise tense regulatory environment. The event may also provide clues about the agency’s stance on tokenization, particularly as firms explore digital versions of bonds, equities, and money market instruments. Trump’s Crypto Ties Under Senate Scrutiny While the SEC fosters dialogue, the political arena has ignited a firestorm over Donald Trump’s growing crypto ties. A Senate investigative panel, led by Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, has launched an inquiry into the president’s involvement in two crypto ventures: the $TRUMP meme coin and World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project linked to Trump’s sons. A US Senate panel is preparing to investigate Trump’s financial stakes in $TRUMP coin and World Liberty Financial, citing concerns over conflicts of interest and foreign influence. #SenateProbe #Trump https://t.co/DYUG2rdg4w — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 7, 2025 The probe seeks to assess whether these projects pose ethical conflicts or risk undue foreign influence. Blumenthal’s letter, sent on May 6, requested information from key figures involved in these initiatives, including Bill Zanker of Fight Fight Fight LLC (the entity behind $TRUMP) and Zach Witkoff of WLFI. The concern is that Trump’s financial stake in these ventures could influence policy decisions, particularly as he mounts a fresh presidential campaign. The inquiry shows the increasingly murky boundary between political influence and financial innovation, especially in the still-evolving crypto ecosystem. If Trump is found to have used his political stature to drive interest or profits in these ventures, it could trigger broader legislative action or ethics reforms. Senate Democrats Propose Act to Curb Crypto Conflicts of Interest In tandem with the inquiry, Senate Democrats have introduced new legislation designed to prohibit federal officials—including former presidents—from launching or profiting from cryptocurrency projects. Titled the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act , the bill was introduced on May 6 by Senator Chris Murphy. The proposed law would ban the issuance of cryptocurrencies by current or former federal officials, reflecting a heightened concern over the potential for digital assets to be used for self-enrichment or influence-peddling. While critics argue that the bill is politically motivated, proponents say it is necessary to prevent what they see as the monetization of political brand capital in the volatile crypto markets. Whether the MEME Act gains traction is uncertain, but its introduction reflects the rising political sensitivity around crypto, particularly when public trust and digital assets collide. GENIUS Act Falters, Leaving Stablecoin Regulation in Limbo Perhaps the most consequential setback of the week came in the form of a failed Senate vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill seeking to create a comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins. Touted as a key moment for the future of U.S. crypto regulation, the bill was narrowly defeated in a 49–48 vote. Senate Republicans press for crucial Thursday floor vote on the GENIUS Act to establish federal stablecoin oversight, even after several key Democrats withdrew support. #GeniusAct #Stablecoins https://t.co/CLNuvTqp05 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 6, 2025 Introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and co-sponsored by Republican lawmakers Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act sought to unify stablecoin regulation under federal oversight. The legislation would have allowed stablecoin issuers to operate under a standardized legal structure, promoting innovation while reinforcing consumer protections. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed disappointment following the vote, calling the bill a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to strengthen the dollar’s global position. “Without it, stablecoins will be subject to a patchwork of state regulations,” Bessent warned in a May 8 post on X (formerly Twitter). The defeat reveals deep partisan divides over how best to regulate digital assets, despite bipartisan acknowledgment that stablecoins are now a permanent fixture in financial markets. With the GENIUS Act stalled, stablecoin issuers must continue working through a fragmented regulatory environment, which poses challenges for scalability and market confidence. Looking Ahead This week’s developments reflect the rapidly evolving intersection of politics, regulation, and digital finance. As the SEC attempts to engage with innovators through forums like its tokenization roundtable, Congress continues to wrestle with ethical dilemmas and regulatory frameworks that could shape the future of crypto in the U.S. With Donald Trump’s crypto connections under investigation, and key legislation like the GENIUS Act faltering, the road ahead for crypto regulation remains bumpy. However, what’s clear is that digital assets are no longer a fringe issue—they are front and center in both Wall Street and Washington. Stay tuned as these stories unfold.

SHIB, currently hovering around $0.000013, has seen a surge in large transactions, hinting at renewed confidence in its memecoin magic. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, is drawing heavy accumulation thanks to its utility-driven model and sky-high return forecasts. Currently in Phase 4 in presale, Mutuum Finance has already pulled in over $7.9 million from more than 9,600 investors. The token is currently priced at $0.025, but that’s set to increase by 20% to $0.03 once Phase 5 begins. With over 60% of Phase 4 already sold out, this is the ideal moment for investors to get in before prices climb. Analysts say when whales start circling like this, a broader market breakout may not be far behind. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big Thing in DeFi Mutuum Finance presents itself as an outstanding innovator in decentralized finance through its dual-lending model that has impressed the entire crypto community. The project stands out for its combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models through its new uniquely connected system. The project has gained substantial investor trust as it already surpasses 9,600 investors together with its $7.9 million presale total. Despite the $0.025 token price in Phase 4 it is expected to rise to $0.03 in the upcoming phase as demand intensifies before the supply dwindles. Mutuum Finance has introduced a dynamic dashboard featuring real-time leaderboards of the 50 highest token holders and provides additional MUTM tokens for leaders. The additional MUTM token rewards for board leaders create friendly competition which motivates investors to spend more time in the platform. This gamified aspect contributes to the development of an extremely interactive environment. How Mutuum Finance’s Dual Lending System Works At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its hybrid lending system. Through the P2C model, users can earn passive income by lending USDT to smart-contract-powered liquidity pools that handle everything automatically. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates third-party interference entirely giving users the freedom to borrow or lend directly ensuring more privacy, flexibility, and control. This blend of two systems strikes a strong balance between decentralization and efficiency, offering something that appeals to both cautious and adventurous DeFi users alike. The$100,000 Giveaway and Growing Community Mutuum Finance isn’t stopping at just building tech, it’s also building a thriving user base. To that end, the team has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. There’s also a referral program designed to reward users for bringing others into the ecosystem, with incentives for individuals and organizations alike. Holders of MUTM tokens gain access to exclusive updates and features, helping them stay closely connected to the platform’s progress and direction. Massive whale activity in both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fueling speculation that altcoin season is on the horizon. SHIB is showing signs of renewed momentum, but it’s MUTM that’s capturing serious investor attention. Over $7.9 million has already been raised from more than 9,600 backers, and 60% of Phase 4 is gone. The current price of $0.025 will jump 20% to $0.03 in the next phase, making this the final window to buy in low. Don’t wait, whales are moving in and the next breakout project is already here. Grab your MUTM tokens now before the price explodes.

In a post on the social media platform Truth Social, Trump says the deal will raise $6 billion in external revenue from 10% tariffs. The president says the agreement will also open $5 billion in export opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers, and producers and bolster national security for both the US and the U.K. by creating an aluminum and steel trading zone and a pharmaceutical supply chain. “Today is an incredible day for America as we deliver our first Fair, Open, and Reciprocal Trade Deal — Something our past Presidents never cared about.

A recent attempt to establish comprehensive US Stablecoin Regulation has reportedly failed, with a prominent figure pointing the finger at political infighting. According to Cointelegraph, U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott stated in a May 8th speech that the proposed legislation, known as the GENIUS Act , did not pass due to partisan politics. What Was the GENIUS Act All About? Senator Scott explained that the intention behind the GENIUS Act , a significant Stablecoin Bill , was to introduce a regulatory framework that would ultimately benefit consumers and the industry by reducing costs and fostering innovation. The bill aimed to provide much-needed clarity for stablecoin issuers and users alike. However, Scott believes the bill’s failure was less about its actual content and more about strategic political obstruction. His argument is that the bill was blocked by political divisions within the Senate, driven by a desire to prevent then-President Trump from claiming a legislative success in the burgeoning crypto sector. This highlights the challenging political environment surrounding Crypto Regulation US . Key Provisions of the GENIUS Act The GENIUS Act proposed a detailed structure for regulating stablecoins in the U.S. Its framework included several critical components designed to ensure stability and transparency: Licensing Requirements: Establishing a clear process for entities to become authorized stablecoin issuers. Full Reserve Backing: Mandating that stablecoins be fully backed by high-quality, liquid assets to ensure they can maintain their peg. Mandatory Disclosures: Requiring issuers to regularly disclose information about their reserves and financial health to the public and regulators. These provisions were intended to build confidence in stablecoins and integrate them safely into the financial system, potentially unlocking new use cases for digital currencies. Why is US Stablecoin Regulation So Crucial? The debate around US Stablecoin Regulation is important because stablecoins bridge the gap between traditional fiat currencies and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. They are essential for trading on exchanges and are increasingly being explored for payments and remittances. Without clear rules, there are significant risks: Consumer Risk: Lack of reserve requirements or transparency can lead to stablecoins losing their peg, causing significant losses for holders. Financial Stability Risk: If a large stablecoin were to fail, it could potentially impact broader financial markets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The absence of clear rules makes it difficult for legitimate businesses to operate and innovate in the US, potentially pushing activity offshore. A well-designed Stablecoin Bill could mitigate these risks while allowing the technology to flourish responsibly. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation US? The failure of the GENIUS Act underscores the current difficulties in passing comprehensive Crypto Regulation US through Congress. Despite bipartisan agreement on the need for some form of stablecoin oversight, disagreements on the specifics – such as which regulators should have authority or the exact nature of reserve requirements – combined with broader political dynamics, continue to stall progress. Senator Tim Scott ‘s comments suggest that these political dynamics were the primary impediment in this instance. Challenges and Opportunities The main challenge is finding a path forward that satisfies different political viewpoints while still being effective regulation. The opportunity lies in creating a framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring financial stability. The failure of this bill is a setback, but the conversation around US Stablecoin Regulation is far from over. Actionable Insight For those following the crypto market, it’s important to recognize that regulatory progress in the US is heavily influenced by the political climate. Stay informed about legislative proposals and the positions of key policymakers like Tim Scott , as these political battles directly impact the future of digital assets in the country. Summary: A Victim of Politics In summary, U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott attributes the failure of the GENIUS Act , a key Stablecoin Bill aimed at comprehensive US Stablecoin Regulation , to partisan politics. The inability to pass this legislation highlights the ongoing challenges facing Crypto Regulation US and leaves the regulatory path for stablecoins uncertain. This political gridlock underscores the difficulty of achieving consensus on digital asset policy in the current environment.

The analyst predicts this crypto token could also witness a remarkable surge and enjoy up to a 3,350% gain as bullish metrics emerge. XDC To Rally To $2 As Indicators Turn Bullish In an X post, Egrag Crypto stated that XDC will rally to $1 and then easily surge to $2. This came as he remarked that the altcoin’s chart looks “amazing.” First, the XRP analyst noted that the RGB (Red-Green-Blue) indicators perfectly align with the XDC token. Based on this, he asserted that the next move for the altcoin could be a 10x pump. Related Reading: Fartcoin Reaches Critical Make-Or-Break Level: Analyst Reveals What Could Happen From $0.77 This XDC price surge is expected to target the Fibonacci levels between 1.414 and 1.618, rallying to between $0.50 and $0.80. The XRP analyst remarked that this is still below the previous cycle’s blow-off top, when the token soared by 3,350%. He expects XDC to replicate this explosive move, potentially surging to the $2 target. The XRP analyst alluded to the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI) as another bullish indicator. He revealed that the SRSI is waving bullish signals. The analyst admitted that there is still a long road for XDC to reach and sustain RSI levels above 80, but claimed that the momentum is definitely on the bulls’ side. In line with this, Egrag Crypto asserted that big moves could just be around for the altcoin. The Bearish Angle For The Altcoin The XRP analyst also provided a bearish angle for the XDC price. He revealed that the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is on the verge of crossing below the 33 Moving Average. If that happens, the analyst warned that it could turn super bearish. Related Reading: Altcoin Season In Danger If Bitcoin Dominance Closes April Above This Level However, he added that this crossover will most likely be avoided and that there could be a blow-off top before the inevitable retracement. The analyst also urged market participants to be attentive as the sharp move higher would come unexpectedly before a big crash to the downside. From a fundamental perspective, XDC’s outlook also looks bullish. The XDC network just officially joined the MiCA alliance, which is a major step forward in aligning blockchain innovation with regulatory clarity in Europe. The team stated that the network is deeply committed to compliance, transparency, and building long-term trust. Like Ripple’s offering using XRP for cross-border payments, XDC is a layer-1 that offers real-world applications like trade finance, cross-border payments, and RWA tokenization. At the time of writing, the XDC price is trading at around $0.07, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

By 2028, the minimum WLD price might drop to $3.69 while its maximum can reach $4.39 The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $7.18 in 2031. Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure, which aligns with the wld prediction . In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency.

Despite bullish pressure, WLD has yet to break through the $1.17 resistance level. Buyers consistently defend the $1.02–$1.10 range, confirming it as a strong support zone. Worldcoin (WLD) is trading at $1.15 as of May 9, 2025, showing an impressive 11.06% gain over the past 24 hours. The token has surged from its daily low of $1.02 to an intraday high of $1.17, forming a strong upward trajectory during the session. Despite the strong buying demand, bears maintain their position around immediate resistance above $1.17. On the downside, $1.02 has proven to be a key support level, absorbing earlier selling pressure. After bottoming out at $0.5817 on April 7, 2025, its all-time low WLD has rebounded by 98.4%, showing significant strength over the past month. While it remains far from its all-time high of $11.82 (set on March 10, 2024), the current fresh rally signals potential of reaching new highs. Worldcoin 1-day chart daily chart: WLD prepares for a move above $1.17 On the daily chart, WLD exhibits a classic bullish continuation pattern from the low of $0.86. Following the price drop in April, the coin has been forming higher lows and higher highs in recent hours, signaling a trend reversal from bearish to bullish. Analysis shows a bullish trend continuation today as buyers continued to break above each Fib levels around $1. The decisive move toward the $1.17 level, which has been tested multiple times, highlights buyer dominance. However, a clean breakout has yet to materialize. WLDUSDT Price Chart The surge in trading volume supports the bullish push, especially as the price cleared the psychological $1.10 level. The RSI level is trending at 63.22, just below the overbought region. A sustained trading above $1.10 would keep the bullish sentiment intact. A confirmed break above $1.17 may pave the way for a push to $1.25, while failure to hold above $1.10 could bring a test back to $1.02. Worldcoin 4-Hour Chart: Buyers struggles around $1.17 On the 4-hour chart, WLD has broken out from a short-term consolidation range with strong bullish candles. However, buyers are struggling to push the price above $1.17. WLDUSDT Price Chart The RSI level trades within the overbought region at level 76.33, hinting at an upcoming bearish reversal. However, MACD’s bullish candles above the signal line hold buyers’ hope. As of now, the $1.17 resistance level remains the key cap. A strong close above this on the 4-hour chart could initiate the next leg up toward $1.25. Conversely, a drop below $1.10 could see WLD retest the $0.86-$0.9 support region. What to expect from Worldcoin price next? A confirmed breakout above the $1.17 resistance level could soon fuel a rally toward $1.25. However, if the price fails to clear this level, WLD may enter a short consolidation phase between $1.10 and $1.17. Should the altcoin lose the $1.10 level, a pullback below $1 remains possible. In such a case, we might see a consolidation around $0.86-$0.9 support zone.

Worldcoin (WLD) has shown strong short-term momentum, climbing 96% from its April 2025 low of $0.5817 and gaining 11.06% in the past 24 hours alone. This aggressive rebound, paired with solid support at $1.02–$1.10 and sustained buyer interest, indicates growing confidence from market participants. However, WLD remains far below its all-time high of $11.82, and key resistance at $1.17 has not yet been broken. The token may remain range-bound until a decisive breakout above this level occurs. WLD offers volatility and opportunity for short-term traders, while long-term investors should weigh its past performance, adoption, and broader project fundamentals before considering entry. Why is WLD Price up today As the tariff war between the US and China cooled down, the crypto market gained boost. Additionally, the recent pause in interest rates helped the market in escaping from its bearish pressure. This resulted in a strong push in BTC price, pushing several altcoins upward including Worldcoin. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, requiring substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption.

According to reports , the platform is under investigation for money laundering linked to major crypto breaches, including the Bybit hack and Genesis creditor theft. German Authorities Not Taking Chances on Illicit Activities Authorities affirmed that eXch played an important role in allowing illegal cryptocurrency transactions. Investigators also estimated that the platform processed over $1.9 billion in cryptocurrency. Much of this amount is thought to come from criminal activities, such as stolen funds and money made from cybercrime. The investigation started after the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor’s Office and Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) noticed suspicious activity linking the eXch platform to cybercrime groups. Officials found that eXch offered anonymous trading services and did not have proper know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. This lack of oversight made it attractive to criminals looking to hide the source of stolen cryptocurrency. Undoubtedly, the eXch crackdown highlights growing concerns among global regulators about unregulated crypto exchanges. As the crypto market changes, authorities increasingly focus on exchanges that allow bad actors to bypass traditional financial oversight. German Government BTC Transfers, Now a Trend Meanwhile, the German government has transferred substantial Bitcoins to major cryptocurrency exchanges. In July 2024, the government transferred 282.4 BTC, valued at approximately $17.6 million, to Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken. The transaction continues a pattern of significant Bitcoin transfers by the government. The reasons behind these substantial transfers remain speculative, but they indicate a strategic approach by the German authorities toward managing seized or forfeited digital assets. Also, these transfers suggest the government liquidation of Bitcoin holdings, derived from criminal investigations, asset seizures, or tax enforcement actions. Indian Authorities Seize $190M in Fraud Case Notably, German authorities aren’t the only ones seizing criminal funds. In February, Indian authorities seized a Laxus car, cash, and cryptocurrency worth approximately 16.5 billion rupees ($190 million). This seizure is part of an ongoing investigation into the collapse of the BitConnect cryptocurrency scam. BitConnect, established by Satish Kumbhani , promised investors a 10% return on their investments, attracting billions of dollars. However, the platform collapsed in 2018, exposing it as a Ponzi scheme. According to reports, from November 2016 to January 2018, the accused collected money from investors worldwide, including in India. India’s Directorate of Enforcement (ED) confirmed that BitConnect’s investment claims were fraudulent. The company misled investors and siphoned the funds for personal enrichment.

Gemini, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, has just achieved a significant milestone that could reshape access to Crypto Derivatives Europe . They’ve successfully obtained a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). This isn’t just a piece of paper; it’s a key that unlocks the door for Gemini to offer advanced crypto products, like perpetual futures, to eligible traders across the European Union. Understanding the MiFID II License: Why It Matters for Crypto Trading So, what exactly is a MiFID II License , and why is it such a big deal in the context of crypto? MiFID II is a comprehensive regulatory framework in the EU that governs financial markets and aims to increase transparency, investor protection, and market efficiency. While initially designed for traditional financial instruments, its principles are increasingly being applied to the burgeoning crypto space. Obtaining a MiFID II license signifies that an entity meets stringent requirements related to: Capital Adequacy: Ensuring the firm has sufficient financial resources. Organizational Structure: Having robust internal controls and governance. Client Protection: Implementing measures to safeguard client assets and ensure fair treatment. Transparency: Reporting trading data and ensuring clear pricing. For a crypto firm like Gemini, securing this license demonstrates a commitment to operating within established financial regulations. This can build trust with both retail and institutional participants who are often hesitant due to the perceived lack of regulation in the crypto market. Gemini’s Strategic Move: The Malta MFSA Approval Gemini’s choice to secure its MiFID II License from the Malta MFSA is a strategic one. Malta has positioned itself as a forward-thinking jurisdiction for blockchain and crypto businesses, establishing regulatory frameworks designed to attract innovation while maintaining oversight. The MFSA is the primary financial regulator in Malta, responsible for licensing and supervising financial services. By obtaining the license here, Gemini gains a foothold within the EU regulatory landscape. This allows them to ‘passport’ certain services into other EU member states, subject to specific notification procedures and host-country rules. This is a common approach for financial firms seeking to offer services across the single market. This move is a clear signal of Gemini’s long-term vision for Gemini Europe , aiming to become a major player in the region’s evolving crypto ecosystem. What Does This Mean for Gemini Europe Users? Access to Crypto Derivatives The most immediate and exciting impact of this license is the ability for Gemini Europe to offer Crypto Derivatives Europe . Previously, access to these products on regulated platforms within the EU was limited for many traders. Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset – in this case, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The license specifically permits Gemini to offer products like perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts with expiry dates, perpetual futures have no expiry, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely while managing funding rates. These instruments are popular among advanced traders for several reasons: Leverage: Traders can control a large position with a smaller amount of capital. This amplifies potential profits but also potential losses. Hedging: Derivatives can be used to hedge against price volatility in underlying spot holdings. Short Selling: They make it easier to bet on falling prices. It’s important to note that while the license allows Gemini to offer these products, access will likely be restricted to ‘eligible counterparties’ and ‘professional clients’ under MiFID II rules. Retail traders typically face stricter regulations and may not have immediate access to all derivative products, or they might have leverage limits imposed for their protection. Gemini will need to classify its clients according to these rules. Benefits of Regulated Crypto Derivatives Europe The expansion of regulated Crypto Derivatives Europe trading through platforms like Gemini brings several potential benefits: Increased Market Maturity: Regulated derivatives markets provide better price discovery and liquidity. Enhanced Investor Protection: Operating under MiFID II means stricter rules around risk disclosure, best execution, and handling client funds. Attracting Institutional Capital: Institutions often require regulated venues to participate in crypto markets, especially for complex products like derivatives. This license can help bridge that gap. Regulatory Clarity: A clear regulatory status reduces uncertainty for both the platform and its users. This move contributes to the overall maturation of the Crypto Trading landscape in Europe, bringing it closer to traditional financial markets in terms of structure and oversight. Are There Challenges Ahead for Gemini in Europe? While securing the MiFID II License is a major win, challenges remain for Gemini in expanding its Crypto Derivatives Europe offerings. Passporting rights under MiFID II aren’t always seamless, and individual EU member states can have specific rules or interpretations that affect how services can be offered locally. Navigating this complex regulatory mosaic requires significant legal and compliance effort. Furthermore, the competitive landscape for Crypto Trading in Europe is intensifying, with both traditional financial firms and other crypto-native platforms vying for market share. Gemini will need to differentiate its offerings and provide competitive pricing and features. Finally, educating users about the risks associated with derivatives, particularly leverage, is crucial. While the license implies protection, derivatives are complex instruments and are not suitable for all investors. Gemini will have a responsibility to ensure appropriate risk warnings and suitability assessments. Actionable Insights for European Traders For traders in Europe interested in accessing regulated crypto derivatives through platforms like Gemini Europe , here are some actionable insights: Understand Your Client Classification: Be aware that access to certain products may depend on whether you are classified as a retail, professional, or eligible counterparty client under MiFID II rules. Educate Yourself on Derivatives: Before trading derivatives, especially with leverage, ensure you fully understand how they work, the potential risks, and margin requirements. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Derivatives are high-risk instruments. Only trade with capital you can afford to lose. Compare Platforms: As the regulated market grows, compare Gemini’s offerings, fees, and trading interface with other licensed platforms in Europe. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep up-to-date with how regulations evolve in your specific country within the EU, as this can impact product availability. This development opens new avenues, but responsible trading remains paramount. The Future of Crypto Trading and Gemini Europe Gemini’s success in obtaining the MiFID II License from the Malta MFSA marks a pivotal moment for the exchange and for the broader Crypto Derivatives Europe market. It signals a move towards greater regulatory compliance and the potential for more sophisticated financial products within a regulated environment. This could pave the way for increased institutional participation and a more mature market overall. As Gemini rolls out its derivatives offerings, it will be interesting to see the uptake from European traders and how this impacts the competitive landscape. This regulatory approval is not just about derivatives; it positions Gemini as a credible, regulated entity within the EU, potentially facilitating the expansion of other services in the future. Summary: A New Era for Crypto Derivatives Europe In conclusion, Gemini securing a MiFID II License from the Malta MFSA is a significant step forward for Gemini Europe and the accessibility of regulated Crypto Derivatives Europe . This allows the exchange to offer advanced products like perpetual futures to eligible clients, bringing greater sophistication and regulatory clarity to the market. While challenges remain in navigating the EU’s diverse regulatory landscape, this move is a strong indicator of the increasing maturity and institutionalization of Crypto Trading within Europe. It opens up exciting new possibilities for traders, provided they approach these complex instruments with caution and a thorough understanding of the associated risks.

Bitcoin price is expected to record a parabolic rally in the coming months after regaining $100k again. The momentum for approving Strategic Bitcoin Reserves (SBRs) at the state level has gained significant traction after New Hampshire and Arizona led the way. According to Dennis Porter, the CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, there is a strong chance that two more U.S. states will approve and sign into law the SBR bills in less than 60 days. “This also isn’t just me guessing. There are two states with very high odds of getting it done, especially now that two have already passed it into law,” Porter noted . Among the other likely states to approve the SBR bills include Utah , especially after the Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments bill passed a house committee with an 8-1 vote earlier this year. Texas is also another state likely to approve the SBR bill in the next two months. Impact of SBRs on Bitcoin Price Action The rising demand for Bitcoin by sovereign funds in addition to institutional investors has played a crucial role in the underlying bullish sentiment. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s fear and greed index has surged to over 70 percent, signaling an overall market greed. In the past few days, Bitcoin price outshined Gold and the wider stock market to rally beyond $100k for the first time since U.S. President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. According to Kalshi , a U.S.-based prediction market platform, Bitcoin price has a high chance of rallying to a peak of $131k before the end of 2025.

Revenue fell to $34.4 million from $42.4 million in the same period of 2024, according to the company's earnings report , published May 9. Cost of revenue rose sharply to $24.5 million, up from $14.4 million a year earlier. As a result, TeraWulf's cost of revenue accounted for 71.4% of total income from operations in Q1 2025, more than double the 34% recorded in the prior-year quarter. In Q1 2024, the company posted a net loss of $9.6 million. TeraWulf’s profit and loss statement for Q1 2025. Source: TeraWulf TeraWulf attributed the decreased revenue to Bitcoin's ( BTC ) post-halving economics that reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC per block mined to 3.125 BTC per block mined, rising network difficulty, and severe weather in the upstate New York area that is home to a TeraWulf mining facility. The company is not alone in posting losses for the quarter, as the already competitive mining industry faces reduced block rewards and the macroeconomic uncertainty of geopolitical trade tensions that have created turmoil for financial markets and businesses alike. Related: Riot Platforms posts Q1 loss, beats revenue estimates Miners hit by trade tariffs, high uncertainty The trade tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump have raised concern among mining companies and analysts that the import duties will drive up the costs of hardware and other physical infrastructure necessary to run crypto nodes. Rising Bitcoin network difficulty means miners must expend computing resources to mine blocks. Source: CryptoQuant Imposing tariffs on mining hardware like application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) will also give miners outside the United States a price advantage over US-based competitors in obtaining the critical equipment needed. As a result of the ongoing tariff negotiations, miners sold 40% of their mined BTC in March 2025, reversing the post-halving trend of miners accumulating BTC for corporate treasuries or reserves. March's sell-off was the highest month for miner BTC liquidations since October 2024 — the month ahead of the 2024 US presidential election, which was pivotal for the crypto industry and represented high uncertainty for businesses and investors.

A significant development from Tidal Financial Group’s Battleshares brand is set to offer a novel way to navigate this dynamic. They have filed with the U.S. SEC to launch two groundbreaking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed specifically for hedging between these two distinct asset classes. Understanding the Strategy: Hedging Bitcoin Against Gold The core idea behind these new ETFs is to allow investors to capitalize on the relative performance of Bitcoin and Gold . Rather than simply holding one asset or the other, these products are structured to enable sophisticated strategies that bet on which asset is likely to perform better over a given period. This approach acknowledges the shifting landscape where Bitcoin is increasingly seen by some as a potential digital store of value, challenging gold’s long-held status. According to reports, these ETFs will employ advanced financial instruments, including: Short Selling: The ability to profit from a decrease in the price of one asset relative to the other. Swap Contracts: Agreements to exchange cash flows or returns from two different financial instruments, based on the relative performance of BTC and Gold. Options: Contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price by a certain date, allowing for leveraged bets on relative price movements. This complex structure is intended to provide investors with tools to express views on the ‘Bitcoinization’ trend – the idea that Bitcoin’s market share and adoption will continue to grow, potentially at the expense of gold’s traditional dominance as a hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty. Why This New Investment Vehicle Matters For years, investors have debated the merits of Bitcoin versus Gold . Gold has millennia of history as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a digital-native asset with a fixed supply, decentralized nature, and high volatility, often dubbed ‘digital gold’. The introduction of these hedge ETFs signifies a maturation in the financial markets’ approach to cryptocurrencies. It moves beyond simple spot price exposure to Bitcoin and offers a way to trade the relationship between a nascent digital asset and a centuries-old commodity. This provides a new layer of sophistication for portfolio management. Here’s a simplified look at how these assets often compare: Feature Bitcoin Gold Nature Digital Asset, Cryptocurrency Physical Commodity, Precious Metal Supply Fixed (21 million coins) Limited, but new supply added Volatility High Moderate Store of Value Narrative Emerging (‘Digital Gold’) Established Portability/Divisibility High Moderate (difficult for large physical amounts) Regulation Evolving, Varies by Jurisdiction Established, Mature Markets These ETFs allow investors to potentially profit whether Bitcoin rises faster than gold, or even if gold falls faster than Bitcoin, depending on the specific structure and the investor’s view on the relative performance. Potential Benefits for Your Investment Portfolio What makes these specific ETFs potentially attractive? They offer a way to gain exposure to the relative performance of Bitcoin and Gold without directly holding either asset. This can simplify trading and portfolio management for some investors, especially those in traditional finance who may face hurdles in directly acquiring and securing cryptocurrencies. Key potential benefits include: Sophisticated Strategy Access: Provides access to shorting, swaps, and options strategies that might be complex or costly for individual investors to implement directly. Relative Performance Play: Allows investors to express a view specifically on the BTC vs. Gold dynamic, rather than just their absolute price movements. Potential Diversification: While both are often considered hedges, their performance drivers can differ, offering a unique diversification angle within a broader portfolio. Ease of Trading: As regulated ETF products, they will trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This development underscores the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin and its evolving role in the global financial system. Challenges and Considerations for Hedge Strategies While the concept is innovative, investors should be aware of the potential challenges and risks associated with these types of ETFs . The strategies employed, involving short selling, swaps, and options, can be complex and carry significant risk. Potential challenges include: Complexity: Understanding how the swap and options components work and how they track the relative performance requires a higher level of financial literacy. Counterparty Risk: Swap contracts involve counterparty risk, meaning the risk that the other party in the agreement may default. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly track the intended relative performance due to fees, expenses, and the complexities of managing the underlying instruments. Market Volatility: Both Bitcoin and Gold can experience significant price swings, and a strategy based on their relative movement can still be highly volatile. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for crypto-related financial products is still evolving, which could introduce uncertainty. These products are likely best suited for sophisticated investors who fully understand the mechanics of hedging, derivatives, and the specific risks associated with both Bitcoin and Gold markets. It’s crucial to read the prospectus carefully once available. The Future of Bitcoin and Gold in Investment Portfolios The launch of these hedge ETFs by Tidal Financial Group reflects a growing trend: the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset space. As Bitcoin matures and its market infrastructure develops, we are likely to see more innovative products designed to integrate it into mainstream investment strategies. Will Bitcoin truly replace Gold as the preferred store of value? That remains a subject of intense debate. However, products like these allow investors to directly trade on the outcome of that debate, providing a new avenue for speculation and hedging within their portfolios. This move could also pave the way for other similar products focusing on the relative performance of different asset classes, using cryptocurrencies as one component. It highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate part of the broader financial ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Investors If you are considering these new ETFs once they launch, here are some actionable insights: Educate Yourself: Understand how short selling, swaps, and options work and how they are used to create the hedge strategy. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: These are likely complex and potentially volatile products. Ensure they align with your overall investment goals and risk profile. Read the Prospectus: Wait for the official filing documents to be public and study the specific details of how each ETF will operate, including fees and the exact strategy employed. Consult a Financial Advisor: Discuss whether a Bitcoin-Gold hedge strategy fits into your existing portfolio with a qualified professional. Monitor Market Developments: Keep an eye on the performance of both Bitcoin and Gold, as well as the regulatory environment surrounding crypto ETFs. The filing is just the first step. The products still need SEC approval, and the launch timeline is subject to change. However, the intent is clear: to offer investors a sophisticated tool to trade the evolving relationship between digital and traditional safe-haven assets. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin and Gold Investment Tidal Financial Group’s proposed Bitcoin – Gold hedge ETFs represent a significant step in the financial world’s integration of digital assets. By allowing investors to strategically position themselves based on the relative performance of these two distinct stores of value, these products offer a novel approach to managing risk and seeking returns in an increasingly complex global market. While they utilize sophisticated instruments and require careful consideration, their potential launch signals a new era where the dynamic interplay between crypto and traditional assets can be directly traded within familiar investment structures.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow. Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021. Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether ( ETH ), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Although the short-term picture has turned positive, Bitcoin bulls are expected to face significant resistance near the all-time high of $109,588. During pullbacks, traders will have to maintain the price above $100,000 to retain the bullish momentum. Could Bitcoin continue its upward move and pierce the all-time high? Are altcoins getting ready for a short-term rally? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin rallied more than 6% and closed above the $100,000 barrier on May 8, indicating that buyers have asserted their supremacy. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The BTC/USDT pair could reach the $107,000 to $109,588 zone, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. The overbought level on the relative strength index (RSI) suggests a short-term pullback is possible. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance but finds support at the 20-day exponential moving average ($94,879), it signals a positive sentiment. The bulls will then make one more attempt to push the price above the all-time high. The first sign of weakness will be a close below the 20-day EMA. That suggests profit booking at higher levels. The pair may then tumble to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,139). Ether price prediction Ether ( ETH ) skyrocketed above the $2,111 resistance on May 8 and extended its up move to nearly $2,550 on May 9. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The long wick on the candlestick shows solid selling near $2,550. If the price turns down from $2,550 but finds support at $2,111, it indicates that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive the ETH/USDT pair above $2,550. If they succeed, the pair could climb to $2,850. Sellers will have to pull the price below the $2,111 level to weaken the bullish momentum. The pair may then slide to the 20-day EMA ($1,867). XRP price prediction Buyers have pushed XRP ( XRP ) to the resistance line, which is a crucial near-term level to watch out for. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers are expected to defend the resistance line aggressively because a break and close above it signals a potential trend change. The XRP/USDT pair could rise to $2.60 and subsequently to $3. If the price turns down from the resistance line but finds support at the moving averages, it suggests that the bulls are buying the dips. The bulls will then again attempt to propel the price above the resistance line. Sellers will have to tug the price below the $2 support to seize control. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) made a decisive move higher on May 8 and rose above the immediate overhead resistance at $620. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The BNB/USDT pair reached the $644 level on May 9, which is expected to behave as a strong barrier. However, if buyers keep up the pressure and pierce the $644 resistance, the pair could soar to $680. Time is running out for the bears. If they want to halt the uptrend, they will have to fiercely defend the $644 level and pull the price below the moving averages. The pair could then descend to $580. Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) broke and closed above the $153 resistance on May 8, indicating that the bulls are in charge. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The SOL/USDT pair could reach $180, which is expected to behave as a formidable obstacle. If the price turns down from $180 but rebounds off $153, it suggests that buyers are trying to form a higher low. That enhances the prospects of a rally to $200. This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and plummets below the $140 support. That suggests traders are booking profits at higher levels. Dogecoin price prediction Buyers successfully defended the moving averages and pushed Dogecoin ( DOGE ) to the overhead resistance at $0.21. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers will try to halt the up move at $0.21, but if the bulls pierce the resistance, the DOGE/USDT pair could rally toward $0.25. If the price turns down from $0.25 but finds support at $0.21, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That suggests the downtrend could be over. Contrarily, if the price turns down sharply from $0.21 and breaks below the moving averages, it indicates that the pair may oscillate inside the range for some more time. Cardano price prediction Cardano ( ADA ) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($0.67) and completed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on May 8. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($0.69) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, signaling an advantage to buyers. If the price remains above the neckline, the ADA/USDT pair could surge toward the pattern target of $1.01. There is resistance at $0.83, but it is likely to be crossed. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to yank the price below the 50-day SMA. That could sink the pair to $0.60 and eventually to $0.50. Related: Chance of Bitcoin price highs above $110K in May increasing — Here’s why Sui price prediction Sui ( SUI ) rallied sharply from the 20-day EMA ($3.29) and climbed above the $3.90 overhead resistance on May 8. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI near the overbought zone signal that the bulls are in command. If the price maintains above $3.90, the SUI/USDT pair could rally to $4.25 and eventually to $5. Alternatively, if the price turns down and closes below $3.90, it suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback. The pair could then slump to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to act as solid support. Chainlink price prediction Chainlink ( LINK ) turned up sharply from the 50-day SMA ($13.72) on May 8 and completed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers are trying to pull the price back below the neckline, but if the bulls successfully hold the level, the LINK/USDT pair could break above the resistance line and rally toward the pattern target of $21.30. This optimistic view will be negated if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the moving averages. That opens the doors for a fall to $12, indicating that the pair may remain inside the channel for a while longer. Avalanche price prediction Avalanche ( AVAX ) bounced off the moving averages on May 8 and reached the overhead resistance of $23.50 on May 9. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers are expected to defend the $23.50 level with all their might because a break and close above the resistance could clear the path for a potential rise to $28.78 and, after that, to $31.73. On the contrary, if the price turns down sharply from $23.50 and breaks below the moving averages, it suggests that the AVAX/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.

Analysts are now speculating that XRP is positioned for an even bigger rally, with targets such as $4.85 on the horizon. While Ripple’s upward momentum has created a buzz, it also raises an important question for investors looking for extraordinary returns: is XRP the best opportunity out there? Enter Ruvi , a groundbreaking cryptocurrency project leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to reshape industries and deliver exponential returns for early investors. Ruvi offers something uniquely compelling compared to legacy projects like XRP, combining real-world utility with massive upside potential. Ripple’s latest developments Ripple’s ascent to $2.30 has been fueled by multiple factors, including a weakened US dollar and Ripple’s strategic acquisition of Hidden Road, a financial giant serving over 300 institutional clients. This acquisition lays the groundwork for Ripple to integrate Hidden Road’s $10 billion daily transaction volume into the XRP Ledger, further increasing XRP’s utility and appeal. Additionally, Ripple’s ecosystem continues to thrive as cross-border payment solutions gain traction. The favorable macroeconomic environment, including risk-on sentiment in broader tech markets, has added momentum, with predictions that Ripple could eclipse $4.85 in the near term. The allure of $4.85 and beyond Market analysts suggest that XRP’s rally could surpass its previous all-time high of $3.30, with targets like $4.85 and even $7 being floated under optimal market conditions. However, for investors looking to maximize returns rather than play it safe, the real opportunity lies in innovative projects that are still in their early stages of growth. This is where Ruvi outshines Ripple, offering not just utility but unmatched growth potential for those who act early. Why Ruvi stands out Ruvi is redefining what it means to integrate blockchain with AI. Unlike Ripple, which primarily targets institutional clients for cross-border payments, Ruvi delivers products and services aimed at solving diverse real-world challenges, from logistics optimization to fraud detection and personalized healthcare. Game-changing features of Ruvi Deflationary Tokenomics Ruvi has a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity and potential for significant value appreciation over time. AI Integration By harnessing the power of AI, Ruvi provides data-driven insights that help businesses improve efficiency and reduce costs, making it indispensable across multiple sectors. Presale Perks Early investors in Ruvi enjoy tiered bonus rewards during its presale , amplifying their holdings and setting them up for exponential returns before the token is even listed on major exchanges. These features position Ruvi not only as a cryptocurrency but as a technological solution with unlimited potential. The investment potential of Ruvi Ruvi is currently forecasted to have a token price range of $1 to $3, offering an unprecedented opportunity for growth. Whether you’re a cautious investor or a high-stakes risk-taker, Ruvi’s early investment phase has the potential to deliver life-changing returns. $500 investment Tokens Bought: 50,000 Presale Bonus: 40%, increasing the total to 70,000 tokens Potential Value (at $2 per token): $140,000 $3,000 investment Tokens Bought: 300,000 Presale Bonus: 80%, boosting the total to 540,000 tokens Potential Value (at $2.50 per token): $1.35 million $10,000 investment Tokens Bought: 1,000,000 Presale Bonus: 100%, doubling the total to 2,000,000 tokens Potential Value (at $3 per token): $6 million With returns like these, Ruvi offers a far more lucrative entry point than the relatively mature Ripple market. Ruvi vs Ripple While Ripple continues to establish its place in the world of institutional financial systems, its growth is constrained by its established reputation and focus on a single use case. Ruvi, by comparison, is still in its early-adopter phase, with limitless potential for expansion. Here’s how they stack up: Versatility Ripple specializes in cross-border payments, while Ruvi’s AI-driven solutions impact a broad range of industries. Upside Potential Ripple’s price may eventually hit $4.85, but Ruvi provides ground-floor opportunities to multiply investments by 10x or more. Accessibility Ripple is largely dominated by institutional players, whereas Ruvi’s presale is designed to benefit small and large investors alike. Don’t miss out on Ruvi Ripple’s rise to $2.40 and its anticipated rally to $4.85 signal robust market confidence, but they pale in comparison to the opportunities available with Ruvi. With its deflationary token model, AI-powered innovation, and presale bonuses, Ruvi is the kind of investment that could redefine your financial future. Whether you’re looking to invest $500, $3,000, or $10,000, the time to act is now. Ruvi is uniquely positioned to become the next big player in blockchain technology, offering unparalleled returns for those who get in early.

Jury selection, initially expected to conclude on May 9, was postponed to the following Monday due to concerns that some jurors might get ""cold feet."" A key witness, referred to as ""Victim 3,"" who was central to the prosecution's case and was expected to testify with ""very personal and explosive details"" about alleged abuse, has reportedly gone missing. Prosecutors and her legal team have been unable to locate her, complicating the trial proceedings. Additionally, a child witness is scheduled to testify for logistical reasons, alongside other witnesses including an escort and Combs’ ex-girlfriend, Casandra ""Cassie"" Ventura, who is a star witness. Combs’ defense team has indicated plans to portray Ventura as ""aggressive and violent"" and capable of physical confrontations. Furthermore, Combs’ lead attorney admitted in court that Combs committed domestic violence in his past relationship with Ventura, describing the violence as ""mutual."" The trial is being held in Manhattan and is considered one of the highest-profile cases for a new unit in the U.S. Attorney's office focused on prosecuting civil rights violations. Meanwhile, Combs has reportedly launched a meme coin valued at around $180 million amid the trial, which some legal experts suggest could negatively impact his sentencing if convicted.

The latest Ethereum (ETH) price prediction keeps ETH steady near $1,800, with traders eyeing a breakout above $1,850. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast shows modest gains ahead, supported by token burns and the growing Shibarium network. But while those two fight for momentum, another name is quickly making headlines, BlockDAG . One early user reportedly earned close to $10,000 worth of BDAG without buying much themselves. They simply shared a referral link during the early stage of the presale. Thanks to BlockDAG’s 25% referral reward, those bonus coins grew fast in value. At the presale rate of $0.0019 and a listing goal of $0.05, the return now sits at a projected 2,500%. For anyone looking past short-term charts, BlockDAG is now considered one of the top crypto picks for 2025. One User Turns BlockDAG Referral Into a $10,000 Win BlockDAG’s referral program is proving it’s more than a promotional strategy, it’s making early participants big winners. A user recently shared in a Telegram group that they earned nearly $10,000 in BDAG just by distributing their referral link during the early presale batches. Because they earned 25% of all purchases made through that link, their referrals generated over $40,000 in volume, resulting in a massive bonus balance. At the presale rate of $0.0019, that equaled millions of coins, at zero cost. Those coins looked good on paper, but the real value came with price projections. With BlockDAG planning to list at $0.05, those free coins could grow by 2,500% once exchanges go live. And if BDAG reaches $1, as some forecasts suggest for late 2025, that original referral bonus could turn into something much larger. This kind of reward structure is drawing more eyes to BlockDAG as one of the top crypto picks this year. So far, the presale has brought in $231.5 million, selling 19.8 billion coins. With just days left before the next price increase, interest is surging. The Buyer Battle leaderboard and referral rankings are heating up, as users hurry to grab bonuses before the May 13 price change. Between daily contests, gamified presale tools, and a hybrid DAG plus PoW design capable of handling thousands of TPS, BlockDAG isn’t just on the radar; it’s earning a real spot on the list of top crypto picks ahead of launch. Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Eyes Breakout as Bulls Defend $1,800 ETH is holding above $1,800, trading near $1,806 within a tightening symmetrical triangle. RSI is at 45.88, and MACD is flat near zero, indicating a wait-and-see market. Key support is $1,785-$1,800, with resistance at $1,845-$1,850. A breakout could push ETH to $1,910, while a drop below $1,775 may test $1,740. Market watchers are focused on the triangle’s apex. Volatility is dropping and EMAs are tightening between $1,779 and $1,818, setting the stage for a potential breakout this month. Short-term Ethereum (ETH) price prediction still leans toward sideways consolidation, but a quick flip in sentiment could follow if ETH retakes the $1,850 level. Traders are watching closely to see if ETH will finally break out and start its next climb. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Forecast Supported by Token Burns & Ecosystem Growth The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast for May shows the token trading steadily at $0.00001243, with predictions ranging from $0.00001160 to $0.00002858. SHIB burned 284 million tokens on April 30, boosting long-term value. Shibarium upgrades also strengthen fundamentals, despite calm price action. Forecasts from CoinCodex and Changelly put SHIB’s average May price between $0.00001497 and $0.0000201. While the climb isn’t massive, the upside has real backing, active holders and ecosystem developments. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast is cautious but leans positive, especially if the overall market turns bullish. Technical indicators like RSI and MACD remain neutral for now, meaning even minor news could move the needle quickly. SHIB may not be loud right now, but it’s holding its ground in the 2025 altcoin mix. The Bottom Line The Ethereum (ETH) price prediction and Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast both point to steady setups with possible upside ahead. ETH is maintaining support above $1,800, waiting for a breakout, while SHIB is gaining strength from consistent token burns and project updates. But the most surprising development comes from BlockDAG. BlockDAG has raised $231.5 million in its crypto presale . With a $0.0019 presale price and a confirmed listing at $0.05, BlockDAG offers a 2,500% return potential to early adopters. One user has already banked $10,000 in BDAG just through the 25% referral program, showing that real rewards are already in play. BlockDAG isn’t just earning attention because of its design or transaction speed. It’s doing so by actually rewarding people right now. With listings and price jumps on the horizon, it’s no surprise that BlockDAG is being named one of the top crypto picks for 2025.

The exchange announced on May 9 that it has secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), allowing the exchange to offer crypto derivatives in the European Union. Gemini sets the stage for EU-wide derivatives launch with MiFID II license Mark Jennings, Gemini’s Head of Europe, noted that when they commence business activities, they can offer regulated derivatives throughout the EU and EEA under MiFID II. The executive noted that Gemini’s upcoming derivatives offering will include perpetual futures and other derivatives, which will be available to advanced users of Gemini. The license, issued on May 8 to Gemini’s Maltese entity , Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, allows the firm to offer sophisticated financial instruments—most notably, crypto derivatives such as perpetual futures—to both retail and institutional investors across the region. Although Gemini hasn’t launched these products yet, the MiFID II license sets the stage for the exchange to begin offering perpetual futures and other complex instruments to experienced traders on its European platform in the coming months. Jennings noted that they would be working towards meeting the required conditions to launch these products across Europe over the coming months. The license further highlights Gemini’s expanding influence in the region. In December 2024, the exchange was granted a sixth VASP registration from the MFSA. Gemini named Malta its main partner for compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework by January 2025. But, to date, Gemini has not received its full MiCA license as of May 2025, though its current MiFID II approval is deemed an important precursor. Crypto derivatives arms race heats up as Gemini joins Coinbase and Kraken in global expansion push Gemini’s latest regulatory victory comes amid a surge in interest and activity surrounding crypto derivatives worldwide. Just this week, on May 8, Coinbase made headlines with its $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, one of the globe’s largest crypto derivatives platforms . The move followed Kraken’s announcement on May 1, confirming its $1.5 billion acquisition of derivatives trading platform NinjaTrader, signaling an arms race among major exchanges to capitalize on the rapidly growing derivatives market. According to Bo Pei, an analyst at US Tiger Securities, Coinbase’s acquisition of Deribit strengthens its presence in international markets, particularly in Asia and Europe, where leveraged crypto trading is more common. The cash-and-stock transaction will enable Coinbase to expand its global offerings by introducing crypto options—financial instruments widely used for hedging and often in demand during periods of market volatility. Shares of Coinbase, which have fallen nearly 21% year-to-date, rose 5.7% following the news. The company already supports crypto futures trading for both U.S. and international users. According to a blog post, the deal includes $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock. While Coinbase is still an emerging player in the derivatives sector, it achieved record market share in both retail and institutional derivatives trading in the last quarter. During this first quarter, shares of the first quarter revenue came shy of Wall Street’s expectations despite the growth in stablecoin revenue. In the quarter ended March 31, Coinbase earned $65.6 million, or 24 cents per share, down from $1.18 billion, or $4.40 a share a year ago. Excluding the impact of crypto investments, Coinbase’s adjusted earnings were $527 million, or $1.94 per share. Revenue rose to $2.03 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago but was shy of the $2.12 billion consensus estimate from LSEG. Transaction revenue tallied $1.26 billion in the quarter, while subscription and services revenue reached $698.1 million in the quarter. Gemini’s entry into the European derivatives space aligns it with these broader industry trends and signals the exchange’s ambitions to compete at the highest levels of global crypto finance. As Gemini prepares to roll out its new derivatives suite across the EU and EEA, the exchange is poised to become a key player in a sector that is quickly becoming central to digital asset trading worldwide.

According to a May 9 notice from the event’s organizers, Vance will address conference attendees in person on May 28, making him the first sitting US vice president to speak at a digital asset conference. Trump provided a pre-recorded video of himself from the White House to the organizers of the Digital Asset Summit in March — his first appearance at a crypto event since taking office in January — and spoke in person at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville while campaigning. Though Vance is a Bitcoin ( BTC ) holder — he holds $250,000 to $500,001 worth of the cryptocurrency, according to a financial disclosure filed in August 2024 — it’s unclear whether the vice president intends to make a substantive policy statement at the event. Cointelegraph reached out to Vance’s office for comment but had not received a response at time of publication. Related: Resurfaced clip shows Trump’s VP pick slamming Gensler’s approach to crypto Since taking office alongside Trump in January, Vance has largely stayed out of the media spotlight in terms of crypto-related policy. The president has signed executive orders on establishing a crypto reserve and regulating stablecoins, while Vance’s involvement with overseeing the industry seemed to be limited to speaking on AI regulation. Two of the president’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who are tied to the crypto platform World Liberty Financial , were also scheduled to speak at the May event. Many lawmakers have expressed concerns that the platform , backed by the Trump family, is being used to personally enrich the president. Trump’s ties to crypto holding up legislation? The vice president’s appearance at the crypto conference was announced the same week Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives and the Senate strongly criticized Trump’s connections to the crypto industry. In the House, Representative Maxine Waters halted a joint hearing discussing a crypto market structure bill and led a group of lawmakers to explore “Trump’s crypto corruption.” In the Senate, nine Democrats blocked a crucial vote on a stablecoin bill, saying the legislation lacked certain safeguards, hinting at the Trump family enriching itself through the USD1 stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial.

Other AI-related subsets of tokens lagged, despite the overall market recovery. AI agent frameworks are the most successful crypto narrative in the past month. The coins reflect both the Web3 technology and the ‘trenches’ of AI agent tokens. Based on Messari data , AI agents expanded by over 186.3% in the past month, shooting past utility-type projects. The AI agent platforms offer the potential for speculative trading, while pure AI, infrastructure, computation, and DeFAI tokens move up more slowly, reflecting the general altcoin recovery. Launchpad tokens are valued at $4.3B , and are still a potentially growing sector. After peaking in late 2024, the AI narrative was almost forgotten. Currently, the sector is recovering, drawing attention back to launchpads and already existing AI agents. By contrast, DeFAI tokens are only valued at $1.32B, which also includes some of the agent tokens. Older AI tokens, promising infrastructure or computation, are valued at over $39.1B, but react more slowly. Some of the categories overlap, but overall, growth is more active for the later wave of AI projects. AI agent tokens are drawing new inflows In addition to having utility, AI agent frameworks offer the potential for trading and social media attention, especially for the most successful AI agents. According to Alphanomics, existing agents are already logging more active fund inflows.

One of the leading launchpads that produced top agentic tokens is Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). Activity on the protocol returned to levels not seen since February, though still far from peak fee production in November and December 2024. Top agents AIXBT and AI16Z had the strongest recoveries among analysis-driven AI personalities, along with Freysa and AVA. Top AI agents are already established, with new launches on Virtuals Protocol slowing down in 2025. | Source: Dune Analytics The overall agent recovery drove VIRTUAL close to a three-month high, trading at $1.96. The token has been in accumulation for months and was closely watched for signs of a breakout. AI agent frameworks and individual tokens remain the most volatile asset type, and are also capable of quickly erasing their gains. VIRTUAL is still far from its peak above $4.60, but this time around, it trades with record volumes. Activity expanded to over $970M on centralized markets, and in the past days, VIRTUAL was among the most active tokens on DEX. The platform enjoys renewed interest, despite AI agent launches almost going to zero. For now, the established agents are inviting a new wave of investments, building up since the lows in February and March. Exposure to the AI narrative follows a recent activation of altcoins. The altcoin season index rose to 35 points, driving investors to seek new assets with the potential for breakouts. AI-themed assets are yet to revisit previous all-time highs, but have shown an ability to bounce by more than 100% from lows.

The White House has prepared a list of tariff negotiations covering around 20 countries that Trump has prioritized. The list covers a wide spectrum, from large exporters to smaller economies. The aim is to quickly create model agreements and pave the way for more comprehensive trade arrangements. According to sources familiar with the matter, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) briefed members of Congress. The list includes countries with large shares of US imports, such as Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, as well as smaller economies such as Fiji, Lesotho and Mauritius. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said talks with 18 countries would be a priority, but did not share the full list with the public. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the agreements with these countries would be “template” and would allow the process to proceed more quickly. “We are trying to show people a framework for doing business,” Lutnick said. Related News: Mark Your Calendars: A Very Important Speech Regarding Bitcoin May Be Delivered - Trump Was Here Last Year The list includes major countries like the United Kingdom and India, as well as Australia, Argentina, Cambodia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Israel, Madagascar, Malaysia, Switzerland and Taiwan. While the amount of goods the US imports from Japan in a day exceeds what it imports from Lesotho in a year, the Trump administration aims to set an example by making deals easier and faster with smaller countries. China is being evaluated in a special negotiation process. Talks with Chinese officials are expected to begin this weekend. Trump announced that the 145% tariffs imposed on China could be reduced to 80%. However, officials say that talks with Beijing are progressing on a separate track from other countries. Senator Kevin Cramer said the agreements should be completed before the 90-day tariff suspension that Trump announced on April 2 expires in July, and that some countries, such as Switzerland, claim they are in an advantageous position to negotiate an extension of the tariff freeze. Kevin Hassett, one of the influential figures in the Trump administration's trade policies, told CNBC that approximately 24 countries are close to making a deal with the United States, like the United Kingdom. Argentina is in active trade talks with the US under the leadership of Trump’s close ally Javier Milei. Treasury Secretary Bessent said Argentina was “high on the list” for deals. *This is not investment advice.

One such development poised to make a significant impact is the upcoming launch of the Qtum AI Agent Network . Qtum founder Patrick Dai recently took to X to share groundbreaking news about the platform’s future. He announced that Qtum.ai is preparing to unveil an ambitious AI agent network designed to foster a robust and interoperable ecosystem. This network draws inspiration from projects like AI agent Manus.im and is built upon powerful technologies like multi-party computation (MPC) services and agent-to-agent (A2A) communication. The most anticipated detail? The Agent Network is scheduled to launch next month on Qtum.ai, promising full token integration right from the start. This move signals Qtum’s strong commitment to integrating cutting-edge AI capabilities directly into its decentralized framework. What is the Qtum AI Agent Network Set to Achieve? At its core, the Qtum AI Agent Network aims to create an environment where autonomous AI programs, or ‘agents,’ can interact securely and efficiently on the blockchain. Think of it as building a decentralized marketplace or ecosystem specifically for AI services and computations. By integrating features like multi-party computation (MPC), the network can enable complex computations involving sensitive data without revealing the underlying information to any single party. This is crucial for privacy and security in AI applications. Agent-to-agent (A2A) communication, on the other hand, allows these AI agents to collaborate, share information (securely via MPC), and execute tasks together, leading to more sophisticated and dynamic decentralized applications (dApps). The inspiration from Manus.im suggests a focus on creating intelligent, autonomous entities capable of performing tasks, interacting with users, and communicating with other agents within the network. The goal is to move beyond simple smart contracts to create truly intelligent, self-organizing systems on the blockchain. Why is Decentralized AI on the Blockchain So Powerful? Bringing AI capabilities onto a decentralized ledger like Qtum offers several compelling advantages over traditional centralized AI systems: Transparency and Auditability: Operations and interactions between AI agents can be recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent log. This increases trust and allows for auditing of AI decisions and processes. Security and Tamper Resistance: Data and models used by AI agents can be secured using cryptographic principles inherent to blockchain, making them resistant to tampering and unauthorized access. Censorship Resistance: Decentralized AI applications are harder to shut down or control by a single entity, promoting greater freedom and accessibility. Data Ownership and Privacy: MPC allows AI computations on distributed, potentially sensitive data without requiring the data to be pooled in one location, enhancing user privacy and control over their information. This combination of features positions Decentralized AI as a potential solution to some of the key challenges facing AI today, such as bias, lack of transparency, and centralized control over powerful algorithms. Understanding AI Agents and How They Communicate In the context of the Qtum AI Agent Network , AI Agents are essentially intelligent programs or services designed to perform specific tasks. These tasks could range from analyzing market data and executing trades to managing supply chain logistics or providing personalized recommendations. The crucial element is their ability to communicate and collaborate. A2A communication protocols allow these agents to: Request services from other agents. Share relevant information (potentially using MPC for privacy). Coordinate actions to achieve a larger goal. Negotiate or trade services using the network’s native token. Imagine a scenario where one agent specializes in data collection, another in data analysis, and a third in executing smart contracts based on that analysis. A2A communication allows them to work together seamlessly on the decentralized network, creating complex, automated workflows. How This Project Represents Significant Crypto Innovation The launch of the Qtum AI Agent Network is a prime example of significant Crypto Innovation because it pushes the utility of blockchain technology beyond simple value transfer and smart contracts. It demonstrates how blockchain can serve as a foundational layer for hosting and coordinating complex, intelligent systems. The full token integration mentioned by Patrick Dai is key. This means the native QTUM token will likely play a vital role within the network, potentially used for: Paying for AI services or computations performed by agents. Staking to run or provide AI agent services. Governance within the network. Incentivizing participation and the development of new AI agents. This integration creates a tokenized economy around decentralized AI, opening up new possibilities for passive income, participation, and investment within the Qtum ecosystem. It’s a step towards building truly decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) powered by sophisticated AI. The Future Landscape of Blockchain AI Applications The potential applications for a robust Blockchain AI agent network like the one Qtum is building are vast and exciting. Here are just a few examples: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Automation: AI agents could analyze market trends, manage yield farming strategies, or execute complex trading algorithms autonomously and transparently on the blockchain. Supply Chain Management: Agents could track goods, verify authenticity using IoT data, and trigger payments or actions based on predefined conditions recorded immutably. Healthcare and Research: Securely analyze distributed medical data using MPC while preserving patient privacy, enabling collaborative research without centralizing sensitive information. Content Curation and Recommendation: Decentralized agents could provide personalized content feeds or product recommendations without relying on centralized platforms that control user data. Gaming and Virtual Worlds: Create more dynamic and intelligent non-player characters (NPCs) or automated game elements that interact realistically within a decentralized environment. The interoperable ecosystem inspired by Manus.im suggests a future where different agents, perhaps developed by various parties, can seamlessly connect and collaborate on the Qtum network, leading to a rich and diverse landscape of decentralized AI-powered services. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the potential is immense, building and scaling a decentralized AI agent network isn’t without its challenges. Technical hurdles related to computational efficiency on a blockchain, ensuring the security and reliability of AI models, and achieving widespread adoption are significant tasks. However, the upcoming launch marks a crucial step forward. It signifies that the foundational technology for hosting intelligent, communicating agents on a decentralized network is becoming a reality. The focus on MPC and A2A communication addresses key needs for privacy and interoperability, setting the stage for future development and innovation. Conclusion: A New Era for Qtum and Decentralized AI? Patrick Dai’s announcement regarding the launch of the Qtum AI Agent Network next month is a significant development for both the Qtum ecosystem and the broader field of Decentralized AI . By combining the security and transparency of blockchain with the power of AI agents, MPC, and A2A communication, Qtum is positioning itself at the forefront of Crypto Innovation . This network has the potential to unlock a new wave of intelligent, autonomous, and privacy-preserving applications that can operate without centralized control. As the network goes live with full token integration, it will be exciting to see how developers and users leverage these capabilities to build the future of Blockchain AI and realize the full potential of interconnected AI Agents in a decentralized world.

As the world’s first stateless money ticked higher, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci told podcast host Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano that sovereign wealth funds are already accumulating the asset and are poised to scale those purchases dramatically once Washington finishes writing the rules of the road. Sovereigns Are Pouring Billions into Bitcoin Scaramucci, whose new Little Book of Bitcoin chronicles his own conversion from skeptic to evangelist, said overseas officials are quietly adding the digital asset even before the United States clarifies stablecoin legislation, bank-custody guidance and broader tokenization rules. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resistance Limited Beyond $100,000, On-Chain Data Suggests When asked if sovereigns are buying Bitcoin secretly, Scaramucci answered: “I think they are buying it, I think they’re buying it on the margin,” he said, adding that regulatory green lights will unleash a massive wave of capital inflow. “I don’t think it’s going to be a gigantic ground swell of buying until we green light legislation in the United States,” he stated. This, in Scaramucci’s view, will make “people worth 10, 20, 30 trillion dollars buying a half-a-billion dollars of Bitcoin, buying a billion dollars of Bitcoin.” 🇺🇸 ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI JUST CONFIRMED THAT ALL SOVEREIGNS ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF #BITCOIN THIS IS WILD!!! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/AInDVGR6Jh — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) May 8, 2025 The former White House communications director framed today’s discreet allocations as a rational response to an increasingly erratic policy environment. With tariffs ricocheting through global supply chains and the dollar’s primacy “controlling the global economy,” he argued, officials outside the United States are searching for insurance against what he called “executive-policy behavior.” “We may need to be decoupled from one sovereign currency,” Scaramucci said, predicting that gold’s record highs and Bitcoin’s resilience during this year’s stock-market slump stem from the same instinct for self-protection. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Toward $100,000 As Treasury, Not Fed, Drives Liquidity: Expert He stopped short of predicting that Bitcoin will replace the dollar, but he insisted that sovereign accumulation is the precondition for an eventual seven-figure price tag. “If you want to see a million-dollar Bitcoin, that’s when somebody at a sovereign says, ‘Okay, this is part of the infrastructure of the world’s financial-services architecture.’” In that scenario, he expects official portfolios to target 1%-3% allocations—enough, in his view, to lift Bitcoin’s market capitalization toward gold’s $20-30 trillion domain. Digital Gold Will Win For now, the “digital gold” thesis appears to be holding. While global equity indices have fallen 5%-8% since the latest tariff salvos, Scaramucci noted, Bitcoin is “roughly where it was at the beginning of the year.” Thursday’s breakout above $100,000 underscores that relative strength. SkyBridge itself has ridden that wave. Scaramucci reminded listeners that he began buying Bitcoin for his flagship fund around $20,000, calling the position “quite beneficial to our performance.” Independent fund-database figures show the $1.7 billion vehicle returned 43% in 2024, outpacing its hedge-fund benchmark by more than four-to-one—results Scaramucci attributes chiefly to the Bitcoin stake. “This is the best idea I have seen in my career,” he said. “I knew the risks of not jumping in were far greater than playing it safe.” Generational dynamics are reinforcing those flows. While older asset-managers still lean toward bullion, Scaramucci said, younger allocators already treat Bitcoin as an heirloom asset. “My grandchildren will end up having Bitcoin as a store of value,” he predicted. Still, he cautioned that widespread institutional adoption will not occur until the United States clarifies its regulatory stance. “If we green-light legislation before the end of the congressional term … then I will tell you that there’ll be large blocks of buying,” he said. Absent that clarity, purchases will remain incremental—yet even incremental flows from trillion-dollar institutions can tally in the billions. At press time, BTC traded at $103,077.

The decision follows his December guilty plea to organizing a fraudulent scheme that misled investors and manipulated the market value of Celsius’s native token, CEL. Sentencing Details The U.S. Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York, announced Mashinsky’s prison term on May 8. “The founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Celsius Network LLC and their affiliated entities was sentenced to 12 years for committing commodities fraud and securities fraud at Celsius,” read the press release. U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl delivered the verdict in courtroom 14A of Manhattan’s Southern District courthouse. It comes nearly five months after the former crypto executive’s guilty plea, in which he admitted to exaggerating Celsius’s financial stability and promising investors unsustainable returns. “Alexander Mashinsky targeted retail investors with promises that he would keep their ‘digital assets’ safer than a bank,” stated U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “In fact, he used those assets to place risky bets and to line his own pockets.” During the court session, Mashinsky acknowledged his role in artificially boosting the price of CEL tokens while quietly selling tens of millions of dollars’ worth of his holdings. The accused also agreed to forfeit the proceeds from his illegal activities. Prosecutors had pushed for a 20-year sentence, arguing that the ex-CEO remained “unrepentant” and emphasizing the widespread damage to the crypto lender’s customers. Federal authorities also said that Mashinsky made a profit of $48 million from the scheme. Ultimately, the 59-year-old accepted sentencing guidelines of up to 30 years and waived his right to appeal any prison term within that range as part of his plea deal. Multi-Billion Dollar Fraud Case Mashinsky’s legal troubles began in 2023 when he was apprehended on charges of securities, commodities, and wire fraud. His arrest coincided with Celsius’s agreement to a $4.7 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of the largest in the agency’s history. However, the deal is still contingent on the firm returning customer assets. In September 2023, former Celsius chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon admitted guilt in the same case and agreed to cooperate with authorities. This provided key insights into the company’s inner operations. His testimony contributed to the broader case brought against Celsius and Mashinsky by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for the multi-billion-dollar fraud scheme. Although the former executive initially denied the accusations, his guilty plea and Thursday’s sentencing conclude a case that exposed serious misconduct at one of the most high-profile crypto lending firms.

The discussion could advance institutional interest in the crypto industry. According to a May 9 memo published by the task force, BlackRock sought to “[d]iscuss perspectives on treatment of staking, including considerations for facilitating ETPs with staking capabilities.” The company has previously said that Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded funds, while successful, are less perfect without staking . Other crypto ETF issuers share that view. On Feb. 15, the New York Stock Exchange proposed a rule change to introduce staking services for Grayscale’s spot Ether ETFs. In April, the SEC delayed a decision on whether to approve or disapprove the rule change. BlackRock and Grayscale are behind the largest Ether ETFs by market capitalization, according to Sosovalue. Ethereum ETFs as of May 8. Source: Sosovalue Many blockchains rely on proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms that allow users to lock their native coins for yield. A potential SEC approval of staking for Ether ETFs could lead to future requests among altcoins, including Solana ( SOL ) ETFs. Tokenization on the agenda BlackRock also discussed “tokenization of securities under federal securities regulatory framework.” Securities are traditional financial instruments where the investor expects monetary gain, such as bonds and stocks. Tokenizing securities has many benefits, including faster settlement times, lower costs than with traditional finance infrastructure, and 24-hour markets. BlackRock already offers a US federal debt tokenized fund called BUIDL, the largest fund with a $2.9 billion market cap. Competing products include Franklin Templeton's BENJI fund. Brokerage firm Robinhood is also exploring securities tokenization. The company is reportedly working on a blockchain that would allow retail investors in Europe to trade US securities like stocks.

Michelle Bond Pushes Back Against Plea Deal According to a filing from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bond claims federal prosecutors used deception to secure Salame’s plea deal based on a “promise” that she would not face campaign finance prosecution tied to her 2022 congressional campaign if he pleaded guilty. “The government cannot use its overwhelming bargaining advantage to coerce a plea agreement and then fail to live up to its terms,” the Wednesday court filing reads. “It cannot mislead a defendant into believing there is no active investigation in the hopes of obtaining statements of the defendant that it can use later to his or her detriment,” the document continues. Ryan Salame Sees 7 Years Behind Bars According to a press release from the United States Attorney’s Office, Bond was charged with violating campaign finance laws in August 2024 over a “sham consulting agreement” with crypto exchange FTX orchestrated by Salame that saw her “illegally fund her campaign” with her payout. “Michelle Bond and her co-conspirator romantic partner attempted to fund her campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives by illegally using hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate coffers, among other sources, and then lying to Congress and others to cover it all up,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.

Recent reports indicate that CoreWeave, a significant player in the data center space catering to AI workloads, is navigating a challenging financial landscape. For those following the tech and crypto markets, understanding the financing dynamics of key infrastructure providers like CoreWeave offers valuable insight into broader market sentiment and capital availability. Why is CoreWeave Seeking $1.5 Billion in CoreWeave Debt? CoreWeave is reportedly looking to secure a substantial $1.5 billion through a new debt financing deal. This move comes on the heels of an initial public offering (IPO) that didn’t quite meet expectations. The company is currently holding meetings, or a ‘roadshow,’ with bankers at JPMorgan this week. The primary goal of these sessions is to assess investor appetite and gauge the terms available for this significant debt raise. Securing this funding is crucial for CoreWeave as it continues to build and expand its data center capacity, a capital-intensive undertaking. The company has been rapidly growing to meet the surging demand for specialized cloud infrastructure needed for complex AI computations. The CoreWeave IPO: What Happened? Earlier this year, CoreWeave went public, listing its shares in March. The initial ambition for the CoreWeave IPO was to raise around $2.7 billion. However, the company ultimately had to scale back its target, raising approximately $1.5 billion instead. Several factors contributed to this adjustment. According to reports, investor concerns about CoreWeave’s existing debt burden played a significant role. Additionally, a perceived weakening or increased caution in the broader AI infrastructure market sentiment also impacted the offering. The IPO results highlight the scrutiny public markets place on companies with high growth potential but also substantial financial leverage. Navigating the AI Infrastructure Market The demand for computing power, particularly for AI development and deployment, has exploded. This has fueled massive growth for companies like CoreWeave that provide the necessary AI infrastructure, including specialized GPUs and high-performance computing environments. Customers like Microsoft rely on CoreWeave’s services. However, building and maintaining this infrastructure requires enormous upfront investment. While the market for AI infrastructure remains strong in terms of demand, the financing environment can fluctuate. Reports suggesting a ‘weakening market’ likely refer to investor caution regarding valuations, profitability timelines, and the sustainability of current growth rates amidst rising interest rates and economic uncertainties. Data Center Financing Challenges Building state-of-the-art data centers equipped for AI is incredibly expensive. This necessitates significant data center financing, often involving large amounts of debt. Over the past two years alone, CoreWeave has reportedly raised $12.9 billion in debt specifically to fund its data center expansion efforts. This aggressive financing strategy allows rapid scaling but also accumulates substantial liabilities on the balance sheet. The need for continuous investment means companies in this sector are frequently in the market seeking capital. CoreWeave Debt Burden: A Closer Look CoreWeave’s financial structure includes a considerable amount of debt. As of December 2024, the company had approximately $8 billion in total debt. This figure underscores the capital-intensive nature of the AI data center business. Furthermore, the company faces significant upcoming payment obligations. According to previous reports, CoreWeave has debt and interest payments totaling $7.5 billion due by the end of 2026. Managing this debt load while simultaneously funding future growth is a critical challenge. The current push for an additional $1.5 billion in tech debt financing suggests a need for more capital, either to cover upcoming obligations, fund further expansion, or provide financial flexibility. What Does This Mean? CoreWeave’s situation is a microcosm of the broader trends in the high-growth tech sectors. Rapid expansion requires significant capital, and while equity markets (like IPOs) can provide funding, debt remains a primary tool for financing large-scale infrastructure projects like data centers. The challenges faced during the IPO and the subsequent need for debt financing highlight the delicate balance between growth ambition and financial prudence. Investor confidence in both the business model and the ability to manage debt is paramount. A successful debt raise would provide CoreWeave with necessary capital and potentially signal continued lender confidence in its long-term prospects despite the IPO’s lukewarm reception. Failure to secure favorable terms or sufficient capital could pose further challenges. Summary CoreWeave, a leading provider of AI infrastructure, is actively seeking $1.5 billion in new debt financing. This effort follows an IPO in March that raised less than initially hoped, partly due to investor concerns about the company’s existing debt and conditions in the AI infrastructure market. With substantial debt obligations looming and continuous need for data center financing, securing this new capital is a crucial step for CoreWeave as it navigates the demands of the booming, yet financially complex, AI sector.

The senators raised their concerns in a letter sent on May 9 to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi. The letter noted that the notion of Trump’s administration permitting Binance to continue operating and expanding in the U.S. is troubling. It also highlighted that Binance has repeatedly shown disregard for federal law and regulations that keep Americans safe. Senators raise concerns about Trump’s connection to Binance The potential for corruption here is simply staggering. https://t.co/8nKMcsjU1u — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) May 7, 2025 The senators raised concerns in a Friday letter sent to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi, seeking answers about President Donald Trump’s connection to a crypto exchange found guilty of violating U.S. money laundering and sanctions laws. The letter was also signed by senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Just a day prior to the letter, Senate Democrats blocked a long-anticipated stablecoin bill. The Democrats found that USD1 , a virtual asset issued by a company controlled by the Trump family, was used to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance by MGX in March. The Abu Dhabi-based technology investment company also announced its contribution to pay for Trump’s $100 billion initiative to fund artificial intelligence infrastructure, a day after Trump’s inauguration. MGX made the transaction public on May 1. The deal connects the U.S. President to the world’s largest crypto exchange, which pleaded guilty to sweeping compliance failures less than two years ago. Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, also pleaded guilty and stepped down from his role, after which he served four months in a U.S. prison. “Our concerns about Binance’s compliance obligations are even more pressing given recent reports that the company is using the Trump family’s stablecoin to partner with foreign investment companies.” Senators Chris Van Hollen and Elizabeth Warren expressed in the letter. Senate Democrats blocked the stablecoin legislation Thursday, partly due to the absence of finalized bill language. They also wanted a provision barring Trump and other senior officials from profiting from digital asset ventures while in office. It has been previously reported that the Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial has explored business opportunities with Binance. The President’s family representatives have also held discussions with Binance about taking a stake in its U.S. affiliate, – Binance.US . The report also alleged that Zhao has pushed for a presidential pardon from the Trump administration. The former Binance senior executive revealed on a recent Farokh Radio podcast that he had already gotten lawyers applying for a pardon. Senators Warren and Hollen asked Bessent and Bondi to report by May 21 on the steps they’ve taken to ensure Binance is complying with its plea agreement. The senators also requested an update on the crypto exchange’s planned U.S. exit, including a timeline. They pressed for clarity on whether Binance raised the topic of a potential pardon for Zhao with any Treasury or Department of Justice officials. The senators also asked if Binance had discussed WLFI or its interest in listing a new stablecoin on Binance with department officials.

The seizure, announced on May 9 by Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and Frankfurt’s main prosecutor’s office, involved multiple crypto assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Litecoin ( LTC ) and Dash ( DASH ). The move marks the third-largest crypto confiscation in the BKA’s history. The authorities also seized eXch’s German server infrastructure with over eight terabytes of data and shut down the platform, the announcement added. In the statement, the BKA described eXch as a “swapping” service that allowed users to exchange various crypto assets without implementing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures.

A recent alert from the popular tracking service, Whale Alert, has caught the attention of many, revealing a substantial USDT transfer involving two prominent platforms: HTX and Aave. What Was This Significant USDT Transfer? Whale Alert, known for tracking large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains, recently reported a monumental transfer of 200,000,000 USDT. For those unfamiliar, USDT is Tether, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. This specific transaction was initiated from the cryptocurrency exchange HTX and directed towards the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, Aave . At the time of the report, the value of this transfer was approximately $200 million. Here are the key details of the transaction: Amount: 200,000,000 USDT Source: HTX (formerly Huobi) Destination: Aave (DeFi Protocol) Reported By: Whale Alert Approximate Value: $200,000,000 USD Such a large movement of stablecoins is not an everyday occurrence and often signals strategic decisions by the holder, commonly referred to as a crypto whale . Why Would a Whale Move $200 Million from HTX to Aave? Understanding the ‘why’ behind a large USDT transfer like this requires looking at the nature of both the source (HTX, a centralized exchange) and the destination (Aave, a leading DeFi protocol). Here are some potential reasons: Seeking Yield Opportunities on Aave Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to earn a passive income, while borrowers can borrow in an overcollateralized (or undercollateralized in some specific cases) way. Moving a large sum of USDT to Aave likely indicates the whale intends to deposit these funds to earn yield. Aave offers variable and stable interest rates on deposited assets, which can be attractive compared to traditional finance options or simply holding the stablecoin dormant on an exchange. Preparing for Borrowing Activities Alternatively, the whale might be positioning themselves to borrow other assets on Aave. By depositing 200 million USDT, they establish significant collateral, allowing them to borrow other cryptocurrencies (like ETH, WBTC, or other altcoins) for various purposes, such as shorting, leveraging positions, or participating in other DeFi protocols without selling their primary USDT holdings. Diversification or De-risking from Centralized Exchange While HTX is a major exchange, some large holders prefer to move significant assets off centralized platforms into self-custody or decentralized protocols like Aave. This could be a move to diversify risk away from a single point of failure (the exchange) or to gain more direct control over their funds within the DeFi ecosystem. Strategic Positioning for Future Market Moves A large stablecoin position on a platform like Aave provides flexibility. The whale can quickly react to market changes by either withdrawing the USDT, borrowing other assets, or using their deposited USDT as collateral for other DeFi activities. This positions them to potentially capitalize on volatility or opportunities within the DeFi space. The Role of Whale Alert in Tracking Large Movements Services like Whale Alert play a crucial role in bringing transparency to the blockchain. By automatically detecting and reporting large transactions across various networks, they allow market participants to gain insights into the activities of major holders. While these alerts don’t always reveal the exact identity of the whale or their precise intentions, they highlight significant shifts in capital that could potentially influence market dynamics, liquidity pools, or sentiment. Tracking whale movements is a common strategy among traders and analysts trying to anticipate potential market shifts. A large inflow to an exchange might signal selling pressure, while a large outflow could indicate accumulation or movement to cold storage/DeFi, as seen in this USDT transfer . Potential Impact on Aave and the DeFi Ecosystem A deposit of 200 million USDT represents a significant liquidity injection into the Aave protocol, specifically into the USDT lending pool. This influx has several potential effects: Increased Lending Capacity: More USDT available means more users can borrow USDT from Aave. Adjusted Interest Rates: According to Aave’s Airdrop Protocol (AIP), interest rates are dynamically adjusted based on the utilization rate of the pool. A large deposit (lowering utilization) could potentially lead to a decrease in the borrowing rate for USDT, making borrowing cheaper. Conversely, the lending rate for depositors might also decrease slightly due to increased supply, though this depends heavily on simultaneous borrowing activity. Enhanced Protocol Health: Large deposits contribute to the overall Total Value Locked (TVL) on Aave, reinforcing its position as a leading DeFi platform and increasing confidence in its liquidity. This move underscores the growing importance of stablecoins like USDT within the DeFi landscape, acting as the primary medium for lending, borrowing, and yield generation. Challenges and Considerations While this transfer highlights potential opportunities, it also comes with inherent considerations: Smart Contract Risk: Depositing funds into a DeFi protocol like Aave exposes the user to potential smart contract vulnerabilities or bugs, although Aave is one of the most audited and battle-tested protocols. Liquidation Risk: If the whale uses the USDT as collateral to borrow other volatile assets, they face liquidation risk if the borrowed assets’ value drops significantly against the USDT collateral value. Market Reaction: While a single large transfer might not cause immediate market volatility for major assets, sustained large movements tracked by Whale Alert can sometimes precede or coincide with significant market events. What Can We Learn From This Crypto Whale Activity? This $200 million movement provides a tangible example of how large players operate within the crypto ecosystem. It demonstrates the continued trust and utilization of leading DeFi protocols like Aave by significant capital holders. It also reinforces the narrative that stablecoins are not just a safe haven during volatility but active components in yield generation and leveraging strategies within DeFi. For the average market participant, keeping an eye on reports from services like Whale Alert can serve as an indicator of potential shifts in large-scale strategies, although it’s crucial not to base investment decisions solely on individual whale movements without broader market analysis. Concluding Thoughts: The Significance of the $200 Million USDT Transfer The transfer of 200,000,000 USDT from HTX to Aave is a significant event in the crypto space. It represents a major movement of capital by a crypto whale , likely aimed at leveraging the opportunities available within the decentralized finance ecosystem, particularly on Aave . This transaction, brought to light by Whale Alert , underscores the dynamic interplay between centralized exchanges and DeFi protocols and highlights the strategic importance of stablecoins like USDT for large-scale operations. As the crypto market evolves, tracking such large flows remains a key method for gaining insight into the potential strategies of its most influential participants.

MUTM’s Price Model Suggests It Could Climb 60x Before BTC Hits a New ATH,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-now-mutms-price-model-suggests-it-could-climb-60x-before-btc-hits-a-new-ath/,"With Bitcoin (BTC) moving steadily but cautiously toward a new all-time high, investors are starting to zoom out and ask a bigger question: which early-stage projects could multiply in value before BTC finishes that climb? While most of the focus is on legacy tokens, some are quietly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a presale-stage protocol priced at $0.025 that’s gaining traction for reasons far beyond market speculation. MUTM’s pricing structure, combined with its fundamentals and treasury-linked incentives, has given some early analysts reason to believe it may grow 60x or more from current levels — potentially before Bitcoin crosses its next major threshold. That kind of upside isn’t based on hype but rather the math behind how Mutuum is built and where it’s heading. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike many presale tokens that rely on vague roadmaps or soft timelines, Mutuum Finance has anchored its development around a tangible sequence: build, fund, and deliver. The protocol is currently raising through its fourth presale phase, which has already seen over $7.7 million contributed by more than 9,500 holders. Since the price is scheduled to rise from $0.025 to $0.03 in the upcoming phase and debut at $0.06, getting in now secures a profit ahead of any exchange listings. What makes this even more compelling is how the price model reflects potential market expansion. If BTC were to revisit a new high, it’s likely that strong-performing DeFi tokens — especially those with actual on-chain use — would follow. MUTM, being backed by a working model and a real financial mechanism, positions itself for that momentum. The projected 60x surge doesn’t come from thin air. The model begins with Mutuum’s launch price of $0.06 and assumes long-term growth driven by real adoption and increased lending volume. As revenue flows into the protocol, it’s used to buy back tokens on the open market — which are then distributed to users who hold mtTokens, the platform’s deposit-backed utility tokens. As more lending and borrowing happens, more tokens are bought and distributed without creating new supply. As a result, demand increases while sell pressure stays limited — a formula that supports gradual price appreciation as usage grows. So if BTC’s movement signals a broader market run, and Mutuum’s adoption scales with it, that 60x target reflects a scenario where early participants benefit directly from increased protocol utility, not just speculative flow. At the moment, opportunities to purchase MUTM at the $0.025 price point are becoming limited. The fourth presale phase is more than 63% complete, and the price increase to $0.03 is just around the corner. Given that the token is expected to launch at $0.06 — and that new participants are joining daily — each phase compresses the potential return for those entering late. This is exactly why traders looking for the best crypto to buy now are not just watching BTC — they’re acting ahead of it. The logic is simple: entering utility-driven protocols early provides a stronger upside than joining a top-tier asset at its peak. Mutuum’s developers have taken a clean, structured approach to their rollout. The smart contracts powering the protocol are undergoing a full audit by CertiK, and the team recently introduced a public dashboard that showcases the top 50 contributors — each of whom receives a unique bonus based on their ranking in the presale. In addition, the platform is set to launch a beta version at the time of the token’s release, meaning that utility will be available right from the start. This helps avoid the post-launch delay seen in many DeFi projects, where hype fades before the product arrives. Bitcoin’s path to a new high may still take time — but smart capital isn’t waiting on BTC alone. Projects like Mutuum Finance, with real-world use and a sustainable model, are seeing early accumulation from those who understand timing and value. With its current price still under $0.03, a well-structured buyback model, and utility set to go live at launch, MUTM is increasingly being considered one of the top cryptocurrency opportunities before the next major market move.

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence. Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus. Solana 1-week chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Historical patterns reinforce a bullish outlook. In October 2023, SOL breached the 50- and 100-week EMAs, consolidating above these levels before rallying 515% by March 2024. Notably, the relative strength index (RSI) was below 50 during both periods, mirroring the current setup, with the indicator rebounding above 50 after the 50-week EMA flipped to support. If the 50-week moving average holds, the price targets for SOL could be between $250 and $350 by September 2025. Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The daily chart bolsters this narrative. Solana recently closed above the 200-day EMA, with immediate resistance at $180. A break above this level in the coming weeks and turning the range into a support level could potentially ignite a parabolic rally by Q3 2025.

He urged Taipei to fortify its $577 billion reserve chest with BTC before currency shocks or conflict strike. Taiwan Legislator KO, JU-CHUN advocates for Bitcoin as part of a diversified reserve strategy at the National Conference on May 9th. Citing global risks & Bitcoin’s hedge potential, he urges Taiwan to consider it alongside gold & forex reserves to bolster financial resilience.… pic.twitter.com/KHKcHLQ2uB — 科技立委葛如鈞 Ko Ju-Chun (@dAAAb) May 9, 2025 Speaking at the National Finance Conference on Friday, Ko emphasized that Bitcoin, like gold and foreign currencies, deserves recognition as a sovereign reserve asset. His remarks followed his recent engagement with Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3 and a prominent advocate for national-level Bitcoin adoption, particularly in countries like El Salvador. Ko, who serves as a legislator-at-large in Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan, argued that Bitcoin could play an important role in strengthening Taiwan’s financial defense mechanisms. The lawmaker said, “We currently hold 423 metric tons of gold, and our foreign exchange reserves total $577 billion—including U.S. Treasury bonds. But in the event of rising currency volatility or potential regional conflict, Taiwan may not be able to ensure the safety and liquidity of these reserves.” Bitcoin as a Strategic Hedge Amid Rising Economic and Geopolitical Risks In his speech, Ko explained that Bitcoin’s characteristics, including a fixed supply, decentralization, and censorship resistance, make it a suitable hedge as traditional financial instruments are increasingly vulnerable to external pressure. Ko said Bitcoin has operated for over 15 years without a central authority and remains resistant to embargoes. “It’s time for Taiwan to think strategically,” he urged. “Bitcoin may not just be a currency. As former Dean Chen Chong said, it could be the gun, the gold, the silver, or even the gunpowder of the digital era. A wise country should never leave such weapons in the hands of others.” The lawmaker further suggested that a small allocation of Bitcoin, of up to 5% of Taiwan’s $50 billion reserve, would be prudent. He stressed that it would be part of a diversified strategy, not a total shift. Ko’s proposal is grounded in growing concerns over Taiwan’s economic exposure as an export-reliant nation. He noted that the New Taiwan dollar has faced wide fluctuations due to global inflation and tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. “In moments of severe crisis or regional unrest, traditional reserve assets like bonds or even gold may not guarantee rapid liquidity or security. Bitcoin, with its cross-border, seizure-resistant design, gives us options,” Ko argued. He carefully framed Bitcoin as an additional tool rather than a replacement for existing reserves. “I’m not saying Bitcoin is the only answer,” Ko clarified. “But in a world where exchange rate risks and regional instability are increasing, it’s essential to introduce new tools that can help us build a more flexible and resilient financial strategy.” Taiwan’s Regulatory Push: FSC Advances Virtual Asset Oversight with New Legislative Draft Ko’s remarks also coincide with Taiwan’s developing crypto regulatory environment. As Ko pushes for Bitcoin adoption nationally, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is laying the groundwork for comprehensive virtual asset regulation. On March 25, the FSC unveiled its draft of the “Virtual Asset Service Act,” a proposed legislative framework that would regulate the crypto industry while enhancing market integrity and investor protections. The draft outlines rigorous licensing requirements for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), including standards for organizational structure, capital thresholds, and qualified personnel. It also allows local banks to issue stablecoins pegged to the New Taiwan dollar, pending FSC approval and strict compliance with issuance guidelines. To uphold these standards, the FSC will be empowered to conduct inspections, monitor compliance, and impose penalties on non-compliant entities. Taiwan FSC approves access to foreign crypto ETFs for professional investors, requiring strict assessments by brokers. A cautious yet vital move for digital assets. #CryptoRegulations #TaiwanCrypto https://t.co/7FvpA5Lcex — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 30, 2024 The FSC’s commitment to building a secure and well-regulated crypto ecosystem extends beyond compliance. In early 2025, the agency launched a pilot program for institutional crypto custody services and approved several foreign crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for professional investors. Together, these regulatory and institutional initiatives indicate Taiwan’s intent to grow into a fully fledged, regulated, and innovation-friendly cryptocurrency jurisdiction and an environment that a lawmaker like Ko believes Bitcoin can become a sovereign asset.

44394337,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=159129,1746828042,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Binance Investigation Launched by US Senators Over Trump Family Crypto Links,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-investigation-trump-crypto/,"The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to regulatory scrutiny, but a recent development has brought together two unexpected names in a high-stakes inquiry: Binance and the Trump family. A significant Binance investigation is now underway, initiated by powerful figures within the U.S. Senate, probing potential links that raise serious questions about regulatory compliance and market integrity. Why Are US Senators Looking into Binance’s Connections? A group of prominent US senators , including Senator Elizabeth Warren, has formally requested investigations from the Treasury Secretary and the Attorney General. Their concern centers on an alleged relationship between the global cryptocurrency exchange Binance and cryptocurrency projects associated with the Trump family. The senators’ focus intensified following reports from Bloomberg detailing a substantial $2 billion investment in Binance by Abu Dhabi firm MXG in March 2024. What makes this investment particularly noteworthy is that it was reportedly facilitated through the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) stablecoin, USD1. This intricate connection has sparked alarms among lawmakers regarding potential regulatory compliance risks, especially considering Binance’s recent history with U.S. authorities. The senators are essentially asking whether this arrangement could somehow circumvent or complicate the terms of Binance’s previous legal settlement. Unpacking the Concerns: What the Senators Want to Know The letter sent by the senators poses specific, pointed questions to the Treasury and Justice Departments, demanding responses by May 21. These questions highlight the core areas of concern regarding Binance’s operations and its future relationship with the U.S. regulatory environment. The key inquiries include: Binance’s progress in implementing the plea bargain: Authorities want an update on how effectively Binance is adhering to the terms agreed upon in its settlement. Binance’s schedule for withdrawing from the U.S. market: Following the settlement, Binance committed to exiting the U.S. This question seeks clarity on the timeline and execution of this withdrawal. Whether a pardon for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) will be discussed: CZ stepped down as CEO as part of the settlement and faces sentencing. The senators are asking if there’s any consideration being given to a potential pardon for him. These questions underscore the senators’ intent to ensure that Binance is held accountable for its past actions and that its future operations, particularly those potentially linked to politically connected entities like the Trump family crypto ventures, do not pose new risks to the U.S. financial system or national security. The Context: Binance’s Previous Regulatory Challenges and Binance Regulatory Compliance This latest inquiry doesn’t occur in a vacuum. It follows Binance’s significant legal troubles in the U.S. and its efforts towards Binance regulatory compliance under intense pressure. Previously, Binance pleaded guilty to violating crucial U.S. laws, including the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This resulted in a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The terms of this landmark Binance plea bargain were substantial: a total fine of $4.3 billion, a commitment for Binance to withdraw entirely from the U.S. market, and the resignation of its then-CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). This settlement was seen as a major step by U.S. authorities to rein in one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges and enforce compliance with financial regulations. The senators’ current investigation appears aimed at ensuring that the spirit and letter of this plea bargain are being upheld, and that new business relationships, such as the one potentially involving the Trump family’s crypto project and foreign investment, are not creating loopholes or new avenues for non-compliance. What This Means for the Crypto Landscape The convergence of a major crypto exchange like Binance, political figures, and significant foreign investment highlights the increasing intersection of cryptocurrency with global politics and traditional finance. This Binance investigation serves as a potent reminder that regulatory oversight in the crypto space is intensifying, and even complex, multi-party transactions involving seemingly disparate entities will attract scrutiny from lawmakers concerned about market integrity, financial stability, and national security. For the crypto market, this development could signal continued pressure on exchanges to demonstrate robust Binance regulatory compliance frameworks and transparency in their operations and partnerships. For ventures like the Trump family crypto projects, it underscores the heightened level of examination they will face simply due to their association with prominent political figures and the sensitive nature of financial regulation. As the May 21 deadline for the departments’ responses approaches, the crypto community and political observers will be watching closely. The outcome of this inquiry could have implications not only for Binance and those associated with the Trump family’s ventures but also for the broader narrative around crypto regulation and its interaction with global political and financial power structures.

33767162,[object Object],1746828049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Breakout Is Programmed, Here’s Why",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-breakout-is-programmed/,"Dogecoin has spent the past few weeks oscillating in a tight range, with prices hesitating around the $0.17 level and facing consistent pressure near the $0.185 resistance zone. Despite several attempts to push higher, the meme coin has lacked sustained momentum until the past 24 hours after Bitcoin’s break above $100,000 again. A recent post by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade points to the bullish sentiment, suggesting that Dogecoin’s next leg up is programmed and perfectly on schedule. Dogecoin’s Rally Is Programmed Due To Repeating 29-Day Cycle According to Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s price action is showing an interesting regular rhythm. Noting a chart that tracks the Relative Strength Index (RSI) against Dogecoin’s daily candlestick price chart, the analyst pointed out that every 29 days, Dogecoin completes a cycle that ends with a breakout. The exact sequence has now occurred three times: each time followed by a sharp rally. The image accompanying his post illustrates three distinct RSI breakout points spaced exactly 29 days apart, with each initiating a powerful upward move in Dogecoin’s price. This repeating cycle appears to be driven by RSI downtrend breakouts. The first breakout occurred in early March, while the second breakout occurred in early April. In each of the two previous occurrences, Dogecoin’s RSI formed a descending trendline that was broken just as the cycle reset, which sent price action upward. Now, with the most recent RSI downtrend line also broken and the 29-day interval completed once again, the conditions for another programmed move are, in Tardigrade’s words, “on time.” Programmed Uptrend To Send DOGE Above $0.23 Again The technical basis behind Trader Tardigrade’s prediction is in the RSI behavior. The RSI is a momentum indicator often used to detect potential reversals or continuations in price action. In Dogecoin’s case, the RSI has consistently reset downwards since it broke below oversold levels on March 9. However, the past two cases have led to a slow build-up, eventually breaking above a local resistance line. Notably, the RSI breakout is occurring at the exact same interval as the one seen in the previous two rallies. The green arrows on the chart, placed directly after each RSI breakout, show clear and steep price increases, showing these moments mark the beginning of bullish phases. If the pattern holds, Dogecoin may enter another strong upward phase that could take it beyond the $0.20 level. Particularly, a measured move based on the two previous playouts put the price target toward the next psychological resistance zone around $0.24. This price target resonates with a different technical outlook, which is based on a head and shoulder formation showing up on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1971, up 9% and 8.9% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This latest uptrend is caused by Bitcoin’s recent break above the psychological $100,000 price level.",Altcoins|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-09 22:00:49

In a new announcement, Binance says it’s adding the NFT ecosystem Doodles ( DOOD ) to Binance Alpha, a platform within the Binance wallet that showcases early-stage digital assets and offers futures contracts for them. “Binance is excited to announce that Doodles (DOOD) will open for trading on Binance Alpha at 2025-05-09 13:00 (UTC). In addition, Binance Futures will launch DOODUSDT Perpetual Contract with up to 50x leverage at 2025-05-09 13:30 (UTC).” Despite the news, DOOD fell through the floor, as the digital asset went from a price tag of $0.00807 on the morning of May 9th to a low of $0.00686, a 12.8% decrease during the last 24 hours. Doodles is a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs that launched in 2021, created by the pseudonymous Canadian artist Burnt Toast. According to its website , it has since expanded into live storytelling and gaming as well. “Within the Stoodio, Doodles’ proprietary fandom hub, users can create and customize their own Doodles avatars, collect digital items from online and real life experiences, connect with a global community, and unlock award-winning content based on their engagement.” Last year, Doodles – in collaboration with artists Lil Wayne, Lil Yachty and Pharrell Williams – released a music video in the art style of the brand.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.87 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $8. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis.

Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ shows a strong bullish push As of May 9, 2025, Tezos (XTZ) is showing a strong bullish push, trading at around $0.633 with a solid +6% gain on the day. The price has broken out of a short-term consolidation range and is now pushing toward resistance at $0.657. XTZ shows a strong bullish push The Money Flow Index (MFI) sits at 49.66, suggesting that Tezos isn’t overbought yet and still has room to climb before hitting exhaustion levels. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is at a healthy 0.30, confirming strong buying pressure and capital inflow into XTZ. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Buyers to push XTZ above $0.641 Tezos (XTZ) is showing a steady upward climb on the 4-hour chart. The price is hugging the upper Bollinger Band at $0.641, which signals strong bullish momentum — though it’s also a zone where short-term pullbacks often happen. Buyers to push XTZ above $0.641 The Balance of Power indicator is at a strong 0.69, confirming that buyers are firmly in control of the market. Additionally, the MACD is bullish, showing that upward momentum remains intact and the possibility of a breakout above $0.641.

XTZ looks bullish but may face a brief pullback near $0.641 resistance. If it breaks above, it could target $0.657 next. Support sits around $0.590–$0.600, keeping the uptrend safe for now. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) is up today after bouncing off support at $0.5316, a move spurred by a significant capital inflow. However, the coin faces resistance at $0.6917. XTZ price chart Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon.

He unveiled Meta’s ambitious new AI advertising engine, pitching it as the ‘ultimate business machine’. This system aims to automate the entire advertising process, potentially replacing traditional agencies, creatives, and media buyers with a single AI-driven platform. For readers of Bitcoin World interested in the intersection of technology, business, and disruptive innovation, this development signals a significant shift. What is Meta’s AI Advertising Engine? Zuckerberg described this system as a fully automated, end-to-end solution for businesses. The core idea is simple yet powerful: feed the AI your business goals and connect your bank account, and it handles the rest. Key features highlighted include: Automated generation of thousands of ad variations (images, copy). Real-time testing and optimization of ads across platforms. Elimination of manual processes traditionally handled by agencies and media buyers. The potential to be one of the most valuable AI systems ever built due to its direct revenue impact. This vision accelerates the shift from traditional ‘Mad Men’ creative approaches to ‘Math Men’ data-driven strategies, leveraging advanced Meta AI capabilities. Is This the Future of AI Advertising or Just ‘AI Slop’? While the efficiency promised by Meta’s engine is appealing, it raises critical questions. Will this system deliver genuinely creative and effective campaigns, or will it flood feeds with generic, algorithmically generated ‘AI slop’? The AI advertising landscape is evolving rapidly, and this move by Meta is a major step, but the quality of the output remains a subject of debate. For creative agencies, this represents a potential nightmare, threatening traditional business models. For marketers, it could be a dream, offering unprecedented scale and efficiency. This tension between automation and human creativity is a central theme in the current AI revolution.
