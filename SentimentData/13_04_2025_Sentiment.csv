Despite its loyal community and previous hype, the momentum appears to be shifting. Ethereum (ETH), trading at $1,476, is gaining fresh institutional interest ahead of the ETF momentum, while emerging DeFi performing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is capturing attention with its next-generation lending protocol. The presale is now in phase 4 after selling out the third one faster than expected. Over $6.5 million has been raised, attracting more than 8100 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.025 before the price jumps 20% to $0.03 in phase 5. Those buying today are set for a 140% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. ADA could be left behind as ETH and MUTM move into the spotlight, with analysts forecasting a reshuffling of the altcoin leaderboard. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending with its cutting-edge dual-lending model, which has driven rapid adoption. With over 8100 investors contributing $6.5 million during the presale, confidence in the project continues to grow. Currently trading at $0.025 in Phase 4, the price is set for a 20% jump in Phase 5, giving investors an opportunity for significant gains. Combining high market demand with unique lending mechanics, analysts see MUTM as one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi projects, with the potential to surpass $2 post-launch. In a recent update that’s generating serious buzz, Mutuum Finance launched an interactive dashboard with a real-time leaderboard, showcasing its top 50 token holders. These elite investors aren’t just getting recognition, they’ll also be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their position. Transforming DeFi with a Hybrid Lending Approach Mutuum Finance makes its lending platform stand out because it unites both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Users participating in P2C model liquidity pools can obtain passive income through smart contract-based automated USDT lending operations. Users who select P2P transactions handle their money directly through peer-to-peer deals which bypass financial institutions. Mutuum Finance combines P2C and P2P models to create features which improve protection along with efficiency and decentralization and thus aligns well with DeFi investors who want yield-bearing alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem As proof of its commitment to stability, Mutuum Finance is issuing a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins, which have been criticized for potentially leading to insolvency, this token will be over-collateralized to minimize risk and make it trustworthy in the long term. Combined with open financial architectures and audited smart contracts, this architecture increases investor trust while filling the biggest gaps seen in past DeFi projects. The company makes continuous community expansion possible through generous rewards programs. The giveaway provides 10 lucky winners with MUTM tokens worth $10,000 from a $100,000 fund and the referral program compensates users for referring new investors. Platform users who join at an early stage get premium staking pools alongside governance power along with exclusive updates while continuing their relationship with the platform. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Tokenomics mechanisms of the project create controlled distribution and maintain lasting value growth. The presale token distribution limitation together with deflationary mechanisms enables Mutuum Finance to maintain token scarcity that might fuel price elevation. Through its staking system the project offers valuable benefits which motivate constant user engagement while supporting the token’s continuous development throughout the system. Mutuum Finance is making waves with its next-gen lending platform. With over $6.5 million raised from more than 8,100 holders, and a presale price currently at $0.025 set to jump 20% in the next phase, MUTM offers early investors a potential 140% ROI at launch. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in decentralized finance.

While Cardano is a well known brand in blockchain, Ruvi AI’s presale model, VIP bonuses and leaderboard rewards are attracting early investors looking to get in and maximize their gains in the short term. Cardano’s Slow and Steady Growth Cardano has always been known for its academic rigor and scalability features. Currently trading at $0.63, ADA is expected to go to $0.84 by year end. That’s 33% ROI. Not bad but not life changing for early crypto investors. Even with Cardano’s progress in building dApps and improving smart contracts, its growth is minimal for risk takers looking for big gains. That’s where Ruvi AI comes in. Ruvi AI’s $0.01 Presale and the VIP 5 Advantage The presale got investors attention fast and reached its first milestone in just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. Ruvi AI is breaking the mold with a $0.01 presale that offers unmatched ROI. The platform combines AI and blockchain to provide practical solutions for dApps, content creation and analytics. But that’s not all. Ruvi AI’s VIP bonus tiers offer an opportunity to maximize returns like never before. Take the VIP 5 tier for example. With a $5,000 investment, you get 500,000 $RUVI tokens at $0.01 each. But here’s the game changing part: VIP 5 members get a 100% matching bonus, doubling their tokens to 1,000,000. At the public listing price of $0.07, those 1,000,000 tokens will be worth $70,000, that’s 1,300% initial ROI. Analysts predict Ruvi AI could go even higher, to $1 per token. That would make those 1,000,000 tokens worth $1,000,000, making Ruvi AI a wealth building opportunity like no other. Leaderboard Rewards Make Ruvi AI Irresistible Ruvi AI’s leaderboard rewards takes investment incentives to the next level. Designed to reward its most loyal community members, the program distributes fixed token rewards to the top holders based on their total holdings. This encourages investors to grow their $RUVI portfolio and gives tangible benefits to those who participate actively. Rewards are given to the top 1,000 holders, with the biggest bonuses for the top ranks. From generous rewards for the top 10 holders to incentives for the top 1,000, the program makes sure every achieved rank gets meaningful rewards. And these rewards are on top of the VIP bonuses, giving more token allocation to investors portfolios. For the top of the leaderboard, this is a golden opportunity to accumulate more wealth while solidifying their support for Ruvi AI’s long term goals. How Ruvi AI Will Outperform Cardano The main difference between Ruvi AI and Cardano is the scope of their ROI. Cardano’s stability and slow growth is good for long term but not enough for the exponential gains Ruvi AI offers. With the opportunity to get in at $0.01 per token and robust reward systems like VIP bonuses and leaderboard prizes, Ruvi AI gives investors a real shot at big returns. What sets Ruvi apart is its ability to tap into the growing demand for AI driven blockchain applications. This real world utility adds credibility to its growth projections, making it more than just a speculative play. Time to Act Ruvi AI’s presale is a rare chance to get in at $0.01 before the listing and the price surge. While Cardano will deliver stable gains in the coming months, Ruvi AI’s innovative approach and multi layered incentives makes it a once in a lifetime investment opportunity. With only 3 months until Ruvi AI’s full potential kicks in, the clock is ticking for investors to get in the presale. By October, Ruvi AI might not only outperform Cardano but redefine what’s possible in the crypto space. Get in now and be part of the story everyone will be talking about.

43265605,https://thecoinrise.com/blockchain-developer-activity-decline-by-40-sparks-concern/,1744495201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/43265605.jpeg,Blockchain Developer Activity Decline By 40% Sparks Concern,https://thecoinrise.com/blockchain-developer-activity-decline-by-40-sparks-concern/,"The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is experiencing a sharp drop in developer activity. Developers are important in building and maintaining the decentralized applications (Dapps), platforms, and networks that run the crypto space. This decline in developer participation has raised concerns in the crypto community. Many are worried about whether the industry can keep growing and come up with new innovative ideas in the future. Blockchain Developer Activity Has Dropped Sharply Data from Artemis Terminal shows that the number of weekly active crypto developers has dropped to 40% in just one year. In April 2024, about 12,000 developers were working in the crypto space. However, by March 2025, developer activity had fallen to just 7,290. The situation became more concerning in December 2024, when the number dropped below 5,300 before experiencing a slight recovery in January. This decline suggests that fewer people are working on new ideas and updates. If this continues, it could lead to slower growth and more issues across the industry. What’s Causing the Drop? Binji Pande, who works on the Ethereum-based Optimism network, thinks the drop in developer activity shows that the crypto industry is changing its focus. He says developers are getting less support and fewer rewards. More people now care about making quick money instead of building useful tools that last. In a recent X post , Pande said that crypto projects are now based on popular trends rather than real needs. This approach leads to weak results and fails to support long-term growth. Pande also addressed the challenges faced by developers working on innovative applications. He noted that many developers working on real and useful applications are not getting enough attention or funding. On the flip side, capital flows into projects designed for quick gains. He argued that this imbalance has created an unhealthy system where short-term excitement is more valued than long-term development. This has made on-chain experiences less engaging. It has also reduced how much people use decentralized apps. Top Ethereum developer Eric Conner reportedly left the community in January to explore the AI sector. Conner said he lost interest in Ethereum because leaders and the community no longer share the same values. A Call for Renewed Focus and Support In Crypto Industry Pande believes that the industry needs to support and fund developers so that they can focus on building complete, end-to-end products. He believes real adoption comes from building products people need and use, not just new tech or market trends. The Optimism contributor warned that the next big growth in crypto will not come from market hype or another bull market. Instead, it will come from real and useful blockchain activity that keeps people involved.

Cardano is pushing toward the $1 mark but remains weighed down by resistance and investor caution. Solana, backed by ETF optimism and a tightening supply, is showing strength with eyes on $1,000. But then there’s BlockDAG , quietly shifting the narrative with its early airdrop, 600% bonus, and a presale ROI already hitting 2,380%. While ADA and SOL work to maintain their positions, BlockDAG is rewarding early adopters and offering what many investors are hunting for: access, timing, and a spot among the top crypto gainers. Cardano’s $1 Challenge Amid Lightchain AI’s Rise Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at approximately $0.63, maintaining a strong position with its scalable infrastructure and loyal community. However, it faces resistance at the $1 mark, with analysts viewing the $0.66 support line as critical; failure to maintain this level could lead to further declines. Furthermore, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties have also contributed to investor caution, inhibiting ADA’s upward momentum. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI, an AI-powered blockchain project, has raised $18.3 million during its presale, reflecting growing belief in its approach to decentralization. With that in mind, features designed to tackle transparency, governance, and scalability are helping Lightchain AI quickly become a serious player in the altcoin space. As a result, while ADA pushes upward, Lightchain AI is building momentum that could outpace expectations. Solana Targets $1,000 as ETF Optimism and Tariff Policy Shift Boost Momentum Solana (SOL) experienced a 15% rebound to $116 following former President Donald Trump’s announcement to roll back global tariffs, signaling potential economic shifts. Additionally, this policy change, coupled with the appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to the SEC, increased the likelihood of a Solana ETF approval to 81%, enhancing institutional interest. Moreover, on-chain data revealed that over 64% of SOL is staked, reducing circulating supply and alleviating sell pressure. At the same time, the slowdown in token unlocks further tightens supply dynamics. According to analysts, technical analysis by CryptoCurb suggests a parabolic trajectory for Solana, with historical patterns indicating a possible surge to $1,000, supported by strong accumulation zones between $100 and $115. Therefore, the combination of favorable regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and constrained supply positions Solana for a significant upward movement. Altogether, this confluence of factors contributes to the current Solana (SOL) price surge. BlockDAG’s Early Airdrop Gives Golden Ticket Holders a Head Start BlockDAG is giving new users a serious advantage with its “Golden Ticket” promo, offering a 600% bonus and early airdrop access for those who use the code BDAG1200. In practical terms, this means first-time buyers get six times the tokens during presale and receive them before the general public, even before the presale ends. This is especially beneficial if the token hits exchanges shortly after mainnet launch. Not surprisingly, this first-mover advantage is already gaining attention. With $213.5 million raised, 19.2 billion tokens sold, and a 2,380% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG’s presale ranks among the most successful in the space. Currently, Batch 27 is live at $0.0248, making timing critical for anyone eyeing potential gains. Looking ahead, an upcoming AMA on April 17 could bring key updates—mainnet launch details, testnet results, or international expansion news. In parallel, the project is kicking off its first global convention tour, bringing the community closer to the team and building long-term confidence. Ultimately, for those scanning the space for the top crypto opportunities, BlockDAG’s early airdrop isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a tactical edge. Getting tokens ahead of public distribution lets holders ride the momentum and potentially capitalize on post-listing demand, making it a smart play for those who act fast. BlockDAG’s Early Access Model Sets It Apart from ADA and SOL While Cardano wrestles with key resistance and Solana rides regulatory optimism, BlockDAG is offering something different—early access and real traction. Its 600% bonus and pre-distribution airdrop aren’t just promotions; they represent a head start that other projects aren’t offering right now. With over $213 million raised and a 2,380% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG is making timing matter. For those comparing top crypto plays, the edge goes to the one that rewards first movers. BlockDAG isn’t waiting for market approval—it’s already giving its community a reason to stay ahead of the curve.

The community-first approach, along with smart tech additions, gives Dogs a hybrid appeal that combines meme-driven hype with real-world utility. Analysts predict that projects like Dogs, which straddle culture and tech, could dominate the next wave of meme coin adoption. Why Dogs Made It to This List: Its combination of meme culture and real blockchain utility positions it as a future heavyweight. 7. Pudgy Penguins: Cool, Collectible, and Climbing While technically starting as an NFT project, Pudgy Penguins has evolved into a full-on meme ecosystem. With their adorable designs and viral marketing efforts, Pudgy Penguins have captured mainstream attention far beyond typical crypto circles. They’re branching into toys, media, and branding deals, showing how meme-driven projects can create real-world value. This pivot toward brand building rather than just relying on crypto hype is what sets Pudgy Penguins apart and keeps them relevant as both collectibles and tokens. Why Pudgy Penguins Made It to This List: Its successful transition from NFTs to broader cultural icons gives it an edge most meme coins envy. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Top Meme Coin Launches Set to explode in 2025 are Troller Cat, Book of Meme, Turbo, Memecoin, Baby Doge Coin, Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins.

Kang opened a 40x long position in Bitcoin worth $100 million on April 9, following US President Donald Trump’s statement that it was “a good time to buy.” Bitcoin has since risen and is trading above $85,000 at the time of writing. In today’s move, the trader doubled his position and now holds a $200 million BTC long position with 40x leverage. Kang’s current position has an average entry level of $82,076 and an unrealized gain of $7.7 million. Kang has paid $115,000 in funding fees to date. Kang will be liquidated if the Bitcoin price drops to $83,410. Kang's position at 0xBb876071A63Bc4D9bfCf46B012b4437Ea7Ff4281 can be tracked via this link. Related News: Prominent Analyst Makes Unbelievable Prediction For Bitcoin (BTC) Price In 2035 On Live Broadcast - ""It May Even Exceed This"" On the other hand, when Kang’s other positions on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Hyperliquid are examined, it is seen that he has a short position in Ethereum worth $6.7 million at 25x. Kang has lost $370,000 from this position so far and paid a funding fee of $24. The trader also has another position in Ethena (ENA). Kang has a $5.5 million long position in ENA at 10x and has made $118k in profits to date, paying $399 in funding fees. However, it is necessary to remember that leveraged trading is very risky, and when combined with the high risk of cryptocurrencies, losses, including the entire principal, are inevitable. *This is not investment advice.

Select electronics spared from reciprocal tariffs Select electronic products, including smartphones, processing chips, and computers are exempt from ‘reciprocal’ tariffs under President Trump’s sweeping tariff order, a relief to US tech companies and shareholders. According to a release from the US Customs and Border Protection, other consumer electronics such as internet modems, storage devices, and components such as semiconductors are also exempt from the additional reciprocal tariffs. Notice exempting select electronics from reciprocal trade tariffs. Source: US Customs and Border Protection The price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged by approximately 2.5% on the same day of the announcement and broke the $85,000 level. Bitcoin's price reaction could signal that at least some investors are entering the market again as risk appetite rebounds on positive macro headlines. CZ claps back against “baseless” US plea deal allegations Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, former CEO of Binance, has denied claims that he agreed to provide evidence against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). In an April 11 report , The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed sources alleging that CZ had agreed to testify against Sun under the terms of his settlement with US prosecutors. “As part of Zhao’s plea deal, he agreed to give evidence on Sun to prosecutors,” an “arrangement” that “hasn’t previously been reported,” the WSJ report stated, citing sources familiar with the matter. “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn't,” Zhao wrote in an April 12 X post . “People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.” Source: Changpeng Zhao CZ was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations. He walked free from federal prison on Sept. 27 as the wealthiest person to ever serve a US prison sentence, with a $60 billion net worth at the time. In a separate April 11 post , CZ claimed multiple individuals had warned him about the Journal’s intentions to publish what he described as a “hit piece.” US crypto industry needs band-aid now, “long-term solution” later — Uyeda A fast-tracked temporary crypto regulatory framework could bolster innovation within the US crypto industry while permanent regulations are still in the works, says acting US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Mark Uyeda. “A time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term,” Uyeda said at the SEC’s April 11 Crypto Task Force roundtable titled “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading.” Uyeda said this might be the short-term answer as the SEC works toward a “long-term solution,” at the roundtable with SEC members and crypto industry executives , including Uniswap Labs’ Katherine Minarik, Cumberland DRW’s Chelsea Pizzola, and Coinbase’s Gregory Tusar.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ZK|WLD|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-12 22:25:19

They command massive networks, institutional trust, and deep market presence.

Amidst a major downtrend, Martinez’s latest forecast reveals the altcoin could soon see a significant market rebound. Related Reading: Is It Time For Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance Rises To Major Rejection Zone Inverse Head-And-Shoulders Pattern Forms As NEAR Prepares For Rally In an X post on April 11, Ali Martinez shows a technical analysis of the NEAR 3-day chart revealing the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern which signals a potential price upswing. In financial markets, the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is a bullish formation that often acts as a reliable indicator of a trend reversal. As the name implies, it consists of three troughs in the form of the left shoulder, the deeper “head”, and the right shoulder as evidenced by the price action between April 7 and April 11 on the NEAR chart. Notably, a descending neckline connects the highs between these troughs and serves as a key resistance level. According to Ali Martinez, NEAR is gradually approaching this neckline, a decisive breakout above which would confirm the bullish reversal and initiate a price rally toward 2.40. Interestingly, NEAR’s relative strength index on its daily chart has recently left the oversold zone backing Martinez’s prediction of an impending price reversal. However, market bulls should still expect to face some resistance at the 1.000 and 1.272 Fibonacci extension levels at $2.10 and $2.34. On the other hand, if the NEAR bulls fail to break above the descending neckline, it could invalidate the current bullish setup and potentially force a price fall to support levels around the $1.96 and $1.82 price zones. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Symmetrical Triangle From 2017, A Repeat Could Send It as Flying To $30 NEAR Price Outlook At the time of writing, NEAR is trading at $2.09 following a price gain of 4.34% in the past day. On larger time frames, the altcoin is down by 16.12% on the weekly chart and 17.58% on the monthly chart showing short-term investors are holding significant losses. According to data from CoinCodex, the general sentiment in the NEAR market remains highly bearish. Meanwhile, the Fear & Greed Index stands at 25 reflecting an Extreme Fear among investors. Contrary to Martinez’s positive predictions, these analysts predict NEAR to maintain its current downtrend in the short term with predictions of $2.07 in five days and $1.90 in a month. In the long term, Coincodex still maintains a bearish outlook on the NEAR market projecting a market price of $1.58 in three months i.e. a potential 24% decline from current market prices.

Citing “people with knowledge on the matter” who asked not to be identified, Bloomberg reports that BlueCrest is up 20% on the year already, while taking into account fees and expenses. Platt reportedly used aggressive amounts of leverage to exploit the extreme volatility triggered by President Trump’s trade war, with BlueCrest now on track to complete a decade of consecutive returns. BlueCrest returned capital to outside investors, turning the firm into a privately owned and managed family office, so its exact assets under management (AUM) is unclear – though court documents show that BlueCrest held $3.9 billion in 2022. According to Forbes , Michael Platt is Britain’s richest hedge fund manager, worth about $18.8 billion as of December 2024, and currently stands with only a select few who have managed to profit in 2025 despite the global market sell-off induced by President Trump. Billionaire Warren Buffett also recorded billions of dollars in gains this year, upping his net worth over $11.5 billion this year alone, and his gains come despite this month’s sell off, which reduced Buffett’s 2025 winnings by $14.5 billion. Buffett, who is now ranked fourth among global billionaires, is one of only two in the top 20 that grew richer this year. He’s alongside L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has added $1.8 billion.

He cites growing institutional interest and a friendlier US regulatory landscape as key drivers for long-term growth. A Bold but Grounded Prediction Speaking on Fox Business Network’s The Claman Countdown , Garlinghouse remarked, “I think $200,000 is not unreasonable.” He clarified that he wouldn’t predict XRP’s price, adding, “It’s too close to home.” Bitcoin is currently trading around $83,500, a 3% daily increase, though still 23% below its January 20 peak. Despite short-term fluctuations, Garlinghouse believes long-term macroeconomic trends are far more important than day-to-day movements. Regulatory Shift Could Unlock Crypto Growth Garlinghouse emphasized the dramatic change in the US regulatory environment, noting the transition from “headwinds, hostility” to “tailwinds.” He believes this positive shift hasn’t yet been fully appreciated by the market. “The largest asset managers in the world go from relatively frozen out or hostile to now a friendly market. This has sensible regulation that is thinking about pro-innovation here at home,” he said. He also underscored crypto’s role as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. “The long-term value here is going to be very clear. It (crypto) is a hedge against inflation. It is a dynamic where the more utility we drive in the crypto markets, the more we’re going to see value accrete to that market,” Garlinghouse added. XRP ETF Momentum Grows New developments on the ETF front are also supporting the broader market. Teucrium recently launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the US—the 2x Long Daily XRP ETF—which saw strong debut volume of $5 million. Garlinghouse remains optimistic about XRP ETF approvals, predicting launches in the second half of the year. Analysts from JPMorgan and Standard Chartered estimate up to $8 billion in inflows during the first year if ETFs gain approval. Ripple’s Strategic Moves and Expansion Garlinghouse discussed Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road, which he said would not have occurred under the previous regulatory environment. The acquisition aims to help institutions like BlackRock enter the crypto market with the infrastructure they trust. “This allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that. It’s good for the whole industry,” he noted. Ripple’s headcount has also grown to around 1,100 employees, further signaling confidence in the company’s trajectory. Stablecoins and Legislation on the Horizon Garlinghouse highlighted growing momentum behind crypto regulation on Capitol Hill. Market structure bills and stablecoin legislation are gaining traction, with expectations that both could soon pass. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, launched under a New York trust license, has already surpassed $250 million in market cap and is nearing the $300 million mark. Garlinghouse believes these developments point to a maturing and increasingly integrated crypto ecosystem.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-12 22:46:39

With countless tokens launching and vanishing each year, knowing which ones truly offer long-term value can be tough. The real winners usually have strong use cases, engaged communities, and a development roadmap that extends well into the future. In this guide, we’ve gathered the top-performing cryptos of 2025. These aren’t just trending names—they’ve earned their place through resilience, innovation, and real network progress. Whether you’re building for the long run or rethinking your current portfolio, these projects stand out for a reason. 1. BlockDAG: Speed, Simplicity, & Real-World Scale BlockDAG is quickly gaining attention as one of the top-performing cryptos of the year, and its architecture is a big reason why. Instead of confirming one block at a time, its hybrid DAG and PoW structure processes multiple blocks simultaneously. The result? Faster speeds, lower costs, and serious scalability. Its beta testnet recently went live and already outpaces the alpha version, offering double the performance. Features like DeFi integration, NFT tools, and a token builder are built into its enhanced explorer. With mainnet set to launch later in 2025, BlockDAG is aiming for 15,000 TPS and will include core tools like swaps, staking, governance, and bridging. The numbers are impressive. Over $213.5 million raised, 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold, and a user base that includes 1 million X1 Miner app downloads. Global partnerships with Inter Milan and HackerEarth, plus dev-focused incentives like grants and bug bounties, show BlockDAG is serious about long-term growth. For those tracking top-performing cryptos in terms of innovation and adoption, BlockDAG leads the pack. 2. Solana: Fast, Efficient, and Backed by Institutions Solana keeps proving its place among the top-performing cryptos through speed, growth, and institutional interest. Currently priced at around $110, SOL recently unlocked over $213.5 million in tokens—but its price stayed strong, and some forecasts suggest a peak near $300 this year. Big players are noticing. Franklin Templeton just filed for a Solana ETF, showing growing interest beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin. After past struggles with downtime, Solana has rolled out updates to boost reliability. Its ecosystem—rich with NFTs, DeFi apps, and blockchain gaming—is thriving thanks to ultra-low fees and fast confirmations. Solana remains a key player for those seeking both performance and adoption. 3. Ethereum: The Core Network Still Building the Future Ethereum remains a go-to choice for investors focused on long-term fundamentals. Despite dropping below $1,500—levels not seen since 2013—Ethereum still powers most DeFi apps, NFTs, and smart contracts. A short-term dip doesn’t change the fact that it remains the backbone of Web3. CoinDCX projects ETH could reach over $5,500 by the end of 2025. This outlook is backed by ongoing upgrades, broad developer activity, and reliable integration across platforms. Even after a $105 million whale liquidation, Ethereum’s roadmap stays on course. Its efforts toward lower gas fees and improved scalability continue to support its standing among the top-performing cryptos heading into the next phase of the market cycle. 4. Cardano: Building Slowly, But With Long-Term Focus Cardano continues to attract attention from investors focused on steady growth. ADA is currently trading at $0.59, bouncing back with an 8% rise after nearly dropping below $0.50. While technicals showed a potential “Death Cross,” analysts at Benzinga still predict it could hit $0.94 or higher this year. What keeps Cardano among the top-performing cryptos is its methodical, research-driven approach. It skips hype and leans into academic peer review and slow-but-consistent updates. Its ecosystem is growing steadily, especially across Africa, with expanding DeFi support and real-world use cases. Cardano may not rise fast, but it also tends to hold up during downturns—making it a reliable option for patient investors. 5. TRON: Quiet Growth Backed by Real Usage TRON might not dominate headlines, but its consistent metrics show why it belongs on this list of top-performing cryptos. TRX trades near $0.23 and may climb to $0.26 in the near term—and as high as $0.73 by the end of 2025. TRON may not spike aggressively, but it also doesn’t crash—it moves steadily upward. TRON’s strength lies in utility. With high daily user counts and transaction volumes—driven by stablecoins like USDT—it continues to rank near the top for network activity. Its low fees and fast speeds make it especially attractive in cost-sensitive markets. While not flashy, TRON delivers consistent results, making it a solid pick for accumulation-focused strategies. Looking For the Top-Performing Crypto? If you’re thinking beyond the next trend, these top-performing cryptos deserve serious attention. Each one brings something distinct—whether it’s BlockDAG’s scalable tech and presale success, Ethereum’s smart contract dominance, Solana’s real-world usage, Cardano’s disciplined development, or TRON’s steady expansion. Together, they offer a mix of innovation, reliability, and community power. For anyone building a portfolio with lasting potential, these networks provide solid foundations. With strong fundamentals, active ecosystems, and big plans ahead, these top-performing cryptos are shaping up to be some of the smartest bets as the next crypto cycle unfolds.

Enthusiasts and traders alike are buzzing about promising choices, eyeing substantial growth. Delving into the spotlight are JasmyCoin , BONK , and PI , all showing potential to make significant strides. Find out which coins could lead the charge and why they are garnering attention. JasmyCoin: Recent Rally and Long-Term Dip Set the Stage JasmyCoin demonstrated significant volatility in recent periods, experiencing a strong weekly gain of 38.34% while achieving a modest monthly uptick of 6.24%. However, the coin faced a more considerable decline of 24.04% over the past six months. These fluctuations highlight a pattern of rapid short-term rallies intertwined with an overall long-term downtrend, attracting interest from traders looking for quick opportunities. Price actions range between $0.007 and $0.0175, with critical support around $0.0034 and resistance near $0.0244. Current indicators, including an RSI of 61.38 and a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator, suggest that bulls are trying to establish control. Traders may find potential opportunities to enter positions near the support level, aiming for profits at resistance. Bonk’s Mixed 1-Month Rally vs 6-Month Decline BONK price action recorded an 18.54% surge in one month, along with an 11.35% weekly gain, but a 39.87% drop over the past six months. The coin showed significant volatility, marked by a short-term upward movement countered by a long-term downtrend. Data indicates notable swings in performance, revealing an asset with rapid changes yet persistent overall weakness. Current levels show a key resistance at $0.00001872 and another at $0.00002552, with solid support at $0.00000515. The RSI at 54.90 and slight positive momentum reveal mild bullish pressure. Although no clear trend is established, traders might consider buying near support and taking profits at resistance as the market remains volatile. Pi Network Momentum: 6-Month Rally Meets Short-Term Correction Pi Network shows contrasting trends with a six-month surge of 567.3% and a sharp one-month drop of 62.78%. A one-week gain of 28.11% highlights swift market swings that add to recent volatility. The coin’s past performance reflects strong long-term expansion followed by notable short-term pullbacks, indicating varying investor sentiment and reaction to market forces. Current price moves between $0.15 and $1.82, with nearest resistance at $2.93 and a second barrier at $4.60. Technical indicators are mixed with a slightly bearish RSI at 43.32 and a negative moving average signal, though the positive oscillators show faint buying interest. Price action appears range-bound with bears holding near resistance but awaiting any breakout signals. Conclusion JASMY shows promise for its focus on data privacy and IoT integration. BONK offers an appealing meme coin vibe with a growing community. PI attracts attention due to its unique mining approach on mobile devices. These coins stand out this weekend as potential interests for those closely watching the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43267241,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63883,1744499611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Teucrium CEO: XRP ETF Was Our Most Successful Launch Day to Date,https://timestabloid.com/teucrium-ceo-xrp-etf-was-our-most-successful-launch-day-to-date/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) highlighted a recent interview clip featuring Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie, where he discussed the successful launch of the first XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. Speaking with Nate Geraci, Gilbertie described the fund’s debut as the most successful launch in Teucrium’s history. Gilbertie stated there was “overwhelming excitement” surrounding the ETF, noting that the firm had initially been overlooked despite being the only one to file with a ticker. “It kind of took people by surprise,” he said, pointing out that their filing was made immediately after changes at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). TEUCRIUM CEO: “THE XRP ETF WAS OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH DAY TO DATE FOR FUND WE’VE EVER DONE” “Terrific response” “Overwhelming excitement” Institutional investors are eager to acquire XRP through their preferred investment vehicles. Listen closely. https://t.co/W2n4f2OyjR pic.twitter.com/ypi5GQVAhr — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 11, 2025 In late 2024, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced he would on January 20, giving way to a crypto-friendly administration under Donald Trump and his new SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Teucrium filed for the ETF around this time, and according to Gilbertie, the effectiveness period concluded over the weekend, leading to seeding on Monday and the official launch on Tuesday, April 8. Details of the ETF Listing and Performance The new Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca). The fund is designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP, offering a leveraged investment vehicle aimed at institutional investors and experienced traders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Gilbertie indicated that nearly two hundred thousand shares traded on day one, calling it a “terrific” result and confirming it was their most successful ETF launch to date. Regulatory Position and Market Implications The ETF’s structure makes it operate without requiring direct approval from the SEC due to its leveraged commodity-style format. This structure enabled the product to come to market quicker than other applications awaiting ETF approval and potentially set a model for similar offerings tied to other digital assets. Teucrium has historically focused on commodity-based ETFs but is now expanding into cryptocurrency, signaling the maturing relationship between institutional finance and digital assets. The recent conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has also boosted the XRP’s legal clarity and removed the uncertainty that plagued the market for years. This legal clarity likely supported the product’s approval path and market appeal. SMQKE, who shared the interview excerpt, emphasized Gilbertie’s remarks about the fund’s performance, including his description of a “terrific response” and strong interest from institutions. While the ETF’s leveraged nature may not suit all investors, it represents a new avenue for those seeking amplified XRP exposure through regulated investment platforms.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs finally lit the fuse Wall Street had been tiptoeing around, and with TradFi scrambling to adapt, crypto’s grassroots are thriving once again. Meanwhile, with inflationary pressure squeezing emerging economies, particularly in South America, folks are looking to digital assets not just as a hedge, but as a legit alternative to traditional savings and business tools. Amid all this momentum, Qubetics has caught the crypto community’s eye. It’s not some recycled DeFi clone or anonymous chain. It’s the world’s first web3 aggregator, and it’s making serious waves in cross-border utility. The upside potential is drawing massive attention from folks looking for the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Qubetics: Cross-Border Simplicity with Big ROI Ambitions Qubetics isn’t just riding hype—it’s solving real-world problems. Right now, businesses across Latin America wrestle with slow, costly cross-border payments. Ever tried wiring cash from Colombia to Chile for a freelance gig? Banks choke it with delays and fees. Qubetics fixes that. By acting as the world’s first web3 aggregator, it’s streamlining cross-border crypto transactions for freelancers, merchants, even expats sending cash home. Imagine a tech startup in Buenos Aires paying a contractor in Mexico City. With Qubetics, they bypass bank queues and FX gouges. A Brazilian digital artist selling NFTs to clients in Canada? Instant settlement with transparent fees. It’s what the crypto scene’s been missing: something that makes Web3 work like Web2—but cheaper, faster, smarter. Sitting comfortably in its 29th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already raked in over $16 million, moved more than 507 million $TICS, and attracted over 24,600 token holders. Priced at just $0.1573, the presale stats aren’t just a flex—they signal strong community traction. That’s why crypto analysts are quietly naming Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025—it’s early-stage, utility-packed, and backed by a hungry, growing community. What Happens If You Drop $500 on Qubetics Right Now? Let’s break it down. At the current presale price of $0.1573, a $500 investment would score you approximately 3,178 $TICS tokens. If the token hits $1, that’s $3,178—easy math. But let’s say $TICS climbs to $10 like some analysts are predicting. That same $500 would be worth $31,780. If it stretches to $15, you’re sitting on $47,670. That’s rent for a year, a motorcycle upgrade, or the seed cash to start a business. And the presale stats aren’t just a flex—they signal strong community traction. With $0.1573 per token and bullish predictions of $TICS hitting $1 to $15, we’re talking potential ROIs from 536% to a whopping 9,435%. That’s why crypto analysts are quietly naming Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025—it’s early-stage, utility-packed, and backed by a hungry, growing community. Injective: Built for Builders, Backed by Giants Injective has carved out its niche among decentralized finance platforms by being fully interoperable and optimized for speed and low fees. Its native token, $INJ, is well-known for its lightning-fast throughput and custom-built layer-1 infrastructure designed specifically for DeFi apps. Binance, Pantera Capital, and Mark Cuban are just some of the high-profile names backing Injective, and that’s no coincidence. Whether you’re into derivatives, prediction markets, or launching your own dApp, Injective makes it seamless. It’s also taken smart strides in real-world asset tokenization, something that more buyers in South America are looking into as inflation dents fiat trust. With a limited supply of just 100 million $INJ, scarcity meets utility, and the community knows it. This is why it’s still one of the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Over the years, Injective has proven it’s not just another DeFi playground—it’s the go-to for builders who want scalability without giving up decentralization. If you’re looking for an altcoin, solid tech, and a growing list of use cases, $INJ still deserves a hard look. Bittensor (TAO): The AI-Powered OG Crypto Brains Trust Bittensor, or $TAO, has been riding a very different kind of wave: the AI and machine learning gold rush. But instead of just riding the hype, Bittensor built a decentralized neural network that rewards folks who contribute data, computation, or modeling power. Picture a system where anyone can plug in and train models, and get rewarded in $TAO tokens for it. This has led to a community that’s part-developer, part-AI researcher, and all in. It’s not for the faint of heart, but if you’ve ever looked at the future and seen AI stitched into everything—from logistics to entertainment—then Bittensor becomes more than just another coin. It’s infrastructure for a decentralized AI economy. Adopters love it because it pays out for effort and transparency. The tokenomics are tight, the use case is niche but powerful, and TAO’s been making consistent moves upward. It’s not your average buy-and-hold play—it’s more like betting on the future of how AI should work. And that’s why Bittensor is repeatedly ranked among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Why These Altcoins Matter Right Now Crypto’s no longer just a moonshot playground—it’s become a toolkit. And for South Americans dealing with inflation, weak currencies, and tight capital controls, the demand for these tools is climbing fast. Whether it’s Qubetics helping remote teams get paid across borders, Injective powering new DeFi ventures, or Bittensor enabling a fairer AI race—these aren’t just tokens, they’re working systems with real-world traction. For those scouring the scene for the best altcoins to buy in April 2025 , you’re not just looking for hype—you’re hunting for fundamentals, early access, and long-haul value. Qubetics is still in presale. Injective’s already proven. Bittensor is carving the next big trend. They serve different needs, but they’ve each earned their spot at the table. The presale window for Qubetics won’t stay open forever, and the numbers already point to rising momentum. Don’t wait until $TICS hits a centralized exchange to try and jump in—by then, the easy wins may be long gone. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics ideal for cross-border transactions?

Is Injective a good option for DeFi builders? Absolutely. Injective provides a scalable, low-fee environment for building decentralized apps, prediction markets, and financial tools without compromising on decentralization. Why is Bittensor (TAO) gaining attention in 2025? Bittensor stands out by merging blockchain with AI, rewarding users who contribute to a decentralized neural network. It’s the future of decentralized intelligence.

Key Insights into Their Price Movements,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/are-sui-and-sei-poised-for-another-breakout-rally-key-insights-into-their-price-movements,"Cryptocurrency markets are always buzzing with potential. Sui and Sei have recently drawn significant attention due to their price dynamics. Curious about which coins might see a surge next? This article dives into the latest trends and key insights, hinting at possible breakout rallies for these digital assets. Stay tuned for an in-depth look. SUI Coin Insights: Price Trends and Key Levels for Trading SUI price changes over recent timeframes show a steady decline with a one-week drop of 2.31%, a one-month loss of 3.63%, and a half-year fall of 5.95%. The downward movement reflects persistent selling pressure with gradual erosion in value. This trend indicates a bearish sentiment over the longer term without any sudden spikes, marking a period of consolidation and cautious market behavior. The coin currently trades between $1.74 and $3.03, with key support near $1.21 and first resistance around $3.78. Technical indicators show a slight bearish tilt, providing mixed signals from momentum measures. Trading opportunities may arise near the support level, while short sellers could consider the resistance area as a potential exit point. Sei Price Dynamics: Past Declines and Key Levels in Focus SEI recent performance shows a one-week gain of 2.8%, a one-month drop of 9.82%, and a six-month decline of 65.39% The price has faced strong downward pressure over the longer term, reflecting a challenging environment in the past half-year, while the last week has brought some slight easing. Current trading sees prices ranging from $0.135 to $0.242, with nearest support at $0.10 and resistance at $0.31. Bears appear to have the upper hand with a mixed trend. The setup invites trades within these levels, with caution needed near the second resistance at $0.42. Conclusion Both SUI and SEI show potential for another rally. Their price actions indicate possible upward movements. Strong support levels have been observed for both coins. Technical indicators also suggest positive momentum. Market conditions and investor interest will play a crucial role. Keeping an eye on trading volumes can provide further insights. Buyers might consider favourable entry points for both SUI and SEI. However, it's essential to monitor any market shifts closely. Future developments and news can impact their trajectories significantly.

43267982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709416,1744501291,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43267982.jpeg,Trump administration exempts smartphones and computers from 125% China tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/smartphones-computers-exempted-from-tariffs/,"The Trump administration has eased its trade stance by exempting smartphones, laptops, and other key consumer electronics from a proposed 125% tariff on Chinese imports. These products are also spared from a separate 10% global tariff, offering major relief to the tech industry and signaling a potential shift in the ongoing US-China trade war. The move represents a major softening of President Trump’s trade policies, which have subjected Beijing to escalating economic pressure. US Customs and Border Protection , the agency that issued the announcement, said the tariff exclusions would take effect retroactively from April 5. The exemption applies to most technology products, including consumer and enterprise-level technology, such as smartphones, laptop computers, memory chips, CPUs, GPUs, hard drives, and solid-state drives. Most of these items are at the heart of consumer markets and cutting-edge computing systems. Most of these devices are produced domestically. Instead, they are pieced together in Asia from key components made in tech powerhouses such as Taiwan, South Korea, China, and Mexico. As a result, the tariffs threatened global supply chains and higher consumer prices in the US — worries registered across the tech world and among analysts. And while the announcement does not resolve the trade dispute, it serves as a clear signal that the administration could be recalibrating its approach — at least concerning The tech industry scores a big win The exemption is a significant victory for the global technology industry, particularly American companies that depend on complicated global supply chains. Apple Inc. is one of the biggest winners. The company’s marquee products, like iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Airtags, are now protected from large tariff increases. One notable exception is AirPods, which are still subject to levies. Apple previously warned that such tariffs would not just hurt profits but also result in price increases for US consumers. After the tariff was first announced in March, Apple’s shares fell as investors worried. Nvidia Corp., whose chips dominate AI and graphics processing, also stands to gain. Most of Nvidia’s chips are made in Taiwan and Mexico and are essential for operating AI data centers and cloud infrastructure. The announcement also includes servers and AI chips, which are core to the growth of both artificial intelligence and cloud computing capabilities in the US. These products had been missing from initial exemption lists, raising alarm from tech industry executives. The exemptions also cover the equipment used to manufacture semiconductors — a key development for ASML Holding NV (Netherlands) and Tokyo Electron Ltd. (Japan). These companies make the specialized tools required to construct advanced chip factories. This action aligns with the wider US aim to increase US semiconductor output under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are investing majorly in building or expanding chip facilities in the United States. The tariff standstill will relieve near-term pressures on the companies as they ramp up their US operations — and may even hasten the pace of your innovation and infrastructure. Exemption raises hopes, but uncertainty remains The Trump administration’s latest move is a temporary win, and industry leaders caution that the situation is fluid. Those exceptions are attached to an older presidential order built to prevent the imposition of cumulative tariffs on a single product. That doesn’t mean existing levies have been removed; new tariffs could be imposed in another form. Some analysts forecast that the administration might also renounce the tariffs enframed into more specific duties collecting to critical sectors such as semiconductors and AI components. These are expected to be less severe than the initial 125% but could still impact pricing & production. Crucially, the exemptions do not apply to a different 20% tariff explicitly targeting China over the fentanyl crisis. That tariff and others that predate Trump’s current term are still in effect. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research report that was key to the decision. He opened with the comment that there was resistance in the White House to driving exemptions at first, but once the reality of the situation hit home within the Beltway, it was a different story. He also cautioned that China could take future steps that would change the dynamics again, mentioning that these negotiations still featured bald uncertainty and volatility. Some of the exempted products are critical to consumers, national security, and innovation. Exempting those from tariffs signals that the United States could move in a more strategic, selective direction on trade rather than across-the-board levies hitting broad portions of the economy. For now, consumers, manufacturers, and tech giants can relax. Devices will remain affordable, AI infrastructure can continue to grow, and the trade war might find a new phase involving targeted diplomacy instead of broad sanctions.

SHIBA turned a modest $100 into over $1.96 million , and DOGE ran from fractions of a cent to over $0.70 , printing millionaires seemingly overnight. Now, in Q2 of 2025 , traders are on the hunt for the next memecoin miracle — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a serious contender. Early investors are now able to scoop up 3.3 million MAGACOIN FINANCE tokens for just $1,000 — a volume that echoes the earliest stages of coins like PEPE and FLOKI, long before their mainstream breakouts. For those looking to maximize exposure at ground-floor prices, this kind of token-to-dollar ratio is a rarity in today’s maturing market. WHY EARLY DOGE AND SHIBA BUYERS ARE WATCHING MAGACOIN FINANCE PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW When DOGE first gained traction, it was trading at around $0.0002 — the kind of entry that turned everyday retail traders into whales once it reached $0.70 . That’s a staggering 35,000x ROI. Analysts are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE with similar excitement, pointing to the massive supply access early buyers receive with its current price of $0.0002908 . Buying 3.3 million tokens for $1,000 offers upside potential that’s increasingly hard to find, especially as many top coins have already run their course. The last time this kind of entry was possible, SHIBA INU jumped 2,900% in just under 60 days. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE be gearing up for a similar trajectory? ANALYSTS SAY “ROTATION SEASON” FAVORS NEW MEME PROJECTS JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW The sentiment around MAGACOIN FINANCE is heating up fast on YouTube and X (formerly Twitter). Someone who influences social media has called it, “major coins are keeping still, we have to turn to something new like MAGACOIN FINANCE — it’s too good an opportunity to pass up.” Despite the current turbulence in the market, the project is developing rapidly. There is even talk in communities that it may turn out to be a standout launch for 2025. Some forecasts call for a move of 30x to 70x once it hits centralized exchanges. Telegram communities are buzzing, Twitter threads are collapsing unintentionally and early whales from previous cycles are sipping their champagne. FINAL WORD: TOO EARLY TO IGNORE? GET 50% EXTRA TOKENS INSTANTLY — USE PROMO CODE: MAGA50X BEFORE IT EXPIRES In a market where even stable coins are facing volatility, the idea of securing 3.3 million tokens for $1,000 feels like a throwback to crypto’s golden age. It’s this kind of positioning that can multiply portfolios if the project reaches even a fraction of DOGE or SHIBA’s highs.

Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction again thanks to its Pectra upgrade, which improves scalability and slashes gas fees. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also heating up, sitting just under a critical level at $0.0000134 — and a potential 20% rally could be in sight. But while these names are making headlines, one project is quietly pulling ahead: BlockDAG . The launch of Keynote 3 revealed that BlockDAG raised $200 million in just 10 months — all without VC support. Now in Batch 27, the presale has surged past $213.5 million. With bold projections placing its price at $1 in 2025, BlockDAG is becoming hard to ignore. Keynote 3 not only celebrated the team’s progress — it also gave the market a clear signal that BlockDAG isn’t just growing, it’s aiming to lead. Ethereum (ETH) Price Outlook: On the Rise After Pectra Launch The Ethereum (ETH) price outlook has improved following the successful deployment of the Pectra upgrade on the Hoodi testnet. The upgrade brings a major improvement — it lets users pay gas fees with tokens other than ETH, making Ethereum easier to use and more inclusive. As ETH moves closer to $2,500, strong fundamentals are backing the trend. Lower gas fees, growing institutional interest, and capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs all support the case for a longer-term climb. With the Pectra mainnet rollout set for April 25, and market sentiment gradually shifting, Ethereum’s trajectory looks more promising — assuming the upgrades deliver as planned. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Forecast: Can It Rally 20%? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is in a critical spot. It’s hovering just below key resistance at $0.0000134, and if it breaks past, analysts suggest a 20% rally could follow — that’s the current Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast. Momentum is building. The RSI recently rose to 54.10, showing increasing strength. At the same time, the MACD crossed above the signal line, which often suggests further upside. Still, the move won’t be confirmed until SHIB clearly clears and holds above that resistance level. If it does, the market could see SHIB take a meaningful leg higher. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Celebrates a Record-Breaking Presale BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 was more than an update — it was a showcase of progress. CEO Antony Turner highlighted that the team raised $200 million in under 10 months — all without any backing from venture capital. That number has since grown to $213.5 million in Batch 27 of the presale. “ This isn’t just capital — it’s fuel for innovation, expansion, and the next evolution of blockchain technology ,” Turner stated. The money raised is being used to push the core protocol forward, enhance the mainnet infrastructure, and scale global operations. It’s also helping fund outreach efforts, bolstered by high-profile partnerships with brands like UFC and Inter Milan — helping BlockDAG become a globally recognized name. The BDAG token has jumped from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in Batch 27, giving early supporters a 2,380% return. The forecasts are just as impressive — with a target of $1 by 2025, $20 by 2027, and even $30 by 2030. That vision is backed by a community of over 170,000 holders, all helping BlockDAG emerge as a major player among the top crypto coins 2025 . Summing Up! The Ethereum (ETH) price outlook remains strong as it heads toward a key upgrade, while the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast hints at a possible 20% rally. But the real story might be unfolding elsewhere. With over $213.5 million raised — and no VC funding — BlockDAG is already breaking norms. Keynote 3 has only added fuel to the fire, reinforcing confidence in the project’s future and positioning it among the top crypto coins 2025. With a presale price of $0.0248 now and projections calling for $1 next year, BlockDAG’s path forward looks ambitious — but achievable. For those looking ahead to the next big breakout, the choice may no longer be just between ETH or SHIB. BlockDAG is emerging as a serious contender with real momentum — and that makes it a project worth watching very closely.

Analyst Identifies Pattern That Suggests So",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-return-to-74000-pattern-suggests-so/,"The Bitcoin price had a rollercoaster journey over the past week, falling to its lowest level in six months on Wednesday, April 9. The flagship cryptocurrency showed some resilience, recovering above the $80,000 level after United States President Donald Trump paused trade tariffs on all countries except China. BTC seems to be starting the weekend on a strong foot, returning to above $83,000 in the late hours of Friday. However, the price of BTC appears to be enjoying only a temporary relief, as a prominent crypto analyst has identified a pattern that could decide the coin’s trajectory over the next few weeks. BTC At Risk Of Another Correction Due To Double Top Pattern In an April 11 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting outlook on the price of Bitcoin following its recent recovery rally. According to the online pundit, this latest surge could be a precursor to another Bitcoin price correction to around the $74,000 level. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Symmetrical Triangle From 2017, A Repeat Could Send It as Flying To $30 This bearish prediction is based on the potential formation of the “double top” pattern on the BTC hourly chart. The Double Top pattern is a technical analysis formation that looks like the letter “M”, consisting of two consecutive price tops. The double top pattern is typically a rare appearance on most charts, indicating that investors are looking to book their profits from an extended bullish trend. Hence, the “M” pattern can be a strong signal of trader exhaustion and bearish reversal. Interestingly, the above chart shows that the Bitcoin price just completed a “double bottom” pattern — the opposite iteration of the Double Top — on the hourly timeframe. The double top saw the premier cryptocurrency fall from above $83,000 to around $74,000 in the space of two days. With the price of BTC seemingly topping out around the $84,000 mark, a potential “M’ pattern appears to be forming on the hourly chart. If the Bitcoin price fails to break the resistance around the $84,000, the market leader could be gearing for another price breakdown. It is worth watching out for the support cushion around the $78,000 level, where the BTC price last bounced back to above $83,000. However, a confirmed close below this support region could imply a deeper correction toward $74,000 — a nearly 15% drop from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $83,800, reflecting an over 5% price jump in the past 24 hours.

The memecoin has reset its bearish outlook and will break crucial price milestones in the coming days. For Shiba Inu, the death cross formation was confirmed on April 6 when the price dropped from $0.00001232 to a low of $0.00001030. Shiba Inu Price Golden Cross Confirmed Market data shows that the SHIB price is gradually disappearing from its earlier consolidation trend. At the time of writing, the coin’s price was changing hands for $0.00001249, up by 2.14% in 24 hours. SHIB recovered after trading at a low price of $0.00001205 to a daily high of $0.00001265 before settling at the current level. This price boost comes as the SHIB burn rate jumped 1000% in early trading, setting the memecoin on a possible revival path. SHIB/USDT 4H Chart. Source: TradingView The SHIB/USDT 4h chart confirms a golden cross pattern for the memecoin. This pattern is formed when the short-term Moving Average switches above the longer-term moving average. Although this pattern is fully formed on the 4-hour chart, it is yet to form on the daily chart. However, with the current momentum, a confirmed breakout is possible. Already, the token has displaced Hedera and now ranks as the 17th largest cryptocurrency. Shibarium Catalyst for Price Rebound Different ecosystem factors can boost the price of Shiba Inu in the long term. One of these factors is closely tied to the outlook of Shibarium and its associated Layer-2 scaling solution. As reported earlier by CoinGape, the Shibarium 200 million addresses milestone is near. If the network attains this landmark, it will show a clear sign of growing adoption, a move that might boost its token valuation. Already, Shibarium has broken the 1 billion total transaction milestone. Should the Shiba Inu network continue to record organic growth, its chances of outranking Dogecoin is higher. Amid the ongoing boost, the question remains how high the memecoin could soar. Drawing on this, a potential SHIB retest of its ATH of $0.00008844 is possible moving forward. While it will require as much as a 710% growth from current levels, SHIB can print this uptick, drawing on its historical trend.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the development team behind Helium ( HNT ) says that the regulatory agency has dropped its lawsuit against the crypto platform, which alleged that they violated securities laws. According to a press release, Helium developer Nova Labs agreed to pay the SEC $200,000 to settle the accusation without admitting to any wrongdoing. News of the dismissal caused HNT to rally as it went from a low of $2.62 on April 10th to a peak of $3.03 just a day later. It has since retraced and is trading for $2.96, a 9.9% increase during the last 24 hours. The SEC, which originally filed the lawsuit in January, had accused Nova Labs of distributing unregistered securities. “The SEC has agreed to dismiss its unregistered securities claims with prejudice. Helium Hotspots and the distribution of HNT, MOBILE, and IOT through the Helium Network are not securities. It also means that the SEC cannot bring these charges against Helium again.” In a recent blog post , Helium says the dismissal of the case is a “landmark outcome” for the digital assets industry and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) technology, which tokenizes real-world infrastructure. “This landmark outcome is a pivotal turning point for the Helium community and the entire crypto industry, removing legal uncertainty for DePIN projects that use crypto incentives to build real-world infrastructure. With the dismissal of the SEC’s unregistered securities claims with prejudice, the outcome establishes that selling hardware and distributing tokens for network growth does not automatically make them securities in the eyes of the SEC.” This marks another lawsuit dropped by the SEC against crypto giants this year after President Donald Trump took office. Other dissolved cases include ones against the crypto exchanges Kraken and Coinbase , retail trading giant Robinhood , non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea , and crypto wallet developer MetaMask .

According to Xaif, it marked the first time the two Ripple leaders shared the stage to speak on these topics directly. Have you ever seen Chris Larsen and David Schwartz share the stage? For the first time in history, they discuss $XRP and the Internet of Value — this is BIG! pic.twitter.com/ZsJkYCG1p5 — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 11, 2025 Incomplete Globalization and the Role of Interoperability Larsen opened by stating that globalization is not failing but remains incomplete. He argued that true globalization requires full interoperability in three key areas: data, goods, and money. While data and goods have achieved this through the internet and containerized shipping, respectively, money still lacks the infrastructure to move seamlessly across systems and borders. “Money networks don’t interoperate,” Larsen said. He described the lack of financial interoperability as a fundamental bottleneck in global economic integration. Traditional systems like SWIFT take days and charge high fees. Larsen asserted that addressing this issue would enable billions of people to participate in a fully functioning global economy through XRP’s advantages . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Foundational Ideas Behind the Internet of Value Schwartz pointed to Ripple’s early work on pathfinding and value exchange as part of what informed the concept of the Internet of Value. The premise, as explained by Larsen, is that “anything of value can be traded.” This concept, combined with protocols like the Interledger Protocol (ILP) and digital assets such as XRP, enables a low-cost, high-speed infrastructure for transferring value globally. Schwartz added that this system would allow international payments to become as seamless as loading a website—performed instantly, with no need to think about cost or intermediaries. He emphasized that such a capability would fundamentally transform how money is used globally. A Multi-Faceted Solution Larsen pointed to ongoing challenges in developing countries where, as he noted, sending even fifty cents is currently unfeasible due to high fees. He described sending $50 from the U.S. to Europe as impossible because of the high fees. The Internet of Value could eliminate those obstacles, making micro-payments accessible to everyone. Larsen was clear in stating that blockchains alone are not the full answer. The broader solution requires the combination of interoperable protocols, fast digital assets, and mechanisms to direct how value moves programmatically. He described the current system as an internet-driven world working with a pre-internet world of money, a mismatch that must be corrected to realize the vision fully. With experts already predicting that XRP will replace SWIFT , it can comfortably serve in this role. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With their institutional appeal and long-term track records, these names continue to dominate headlines. But in April 2025 , the most explosive ROI potential isn’t coming from the old favorites—it’s coming from MAGACOINFINANCE , a fast-growing altcoin project that’s stealing the spotlight with unmatched upside .

A Breakdown of Their Journey to a New Bull Circle,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/can-xrp-ada-rebound-explosively-a-breakdown-of-their-journey-to-a-new-bull-circle,"XRP and ADA are at a crossroads, teetering between stagnation and explosive growth. This article delves into their tumultuous paths, examining whether these digital currencies are on the verge of a significant resurgence. The potential for a new bull market looms, sparking curiosity about their future performance. Find out which of these coins might be poised for a breakout. XRP's 6-Month Rally and Recent Pullback Past month performance shows a notable pullback with an 8.29% decline, but over the last six months, XRP surged by an impressive 286.22%, marking a significant gain in long-term momentum. The market has witnessed extreme fluctuations during this period, reflecting the coin's volatile trading behavior, with bullish forces having powered the recent rally before encountering short-term corrections. Currently, XRP trades within a $1.66 to $2.77 range, testing immediate resistance near $3.45 and finding support around $1.23. The indicators such as an RSI of 46.17 and a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator at -0.24 point to a neutral stance with a hint of bearish pressure. With little evidence of a clear trend, traders might explore positions between these key support and resistance areas, monitoring for signs of renewed bullish activity. Cardano's Volatile Climb: Robust 6-Month Gains Amid Short-Term Setbacks Cardano experienced a notable decline of 13.86% over the past month, contrasting with a remarkable 82.18% increase over the last six months. The recent drop of 3.94% this week indicates short-term bearish pressure following a prolonged upward trend. Overall, the coin has displayed significant volatility, with strong long-term performance somewhat offset by recent price declines. The coin currently trades within a $0.47 to $1.02 range with primary resistance at $1.37 and support at $0.27. Oscillators and momentum indicators show a neutral position, hinting at a lack of clear direction. Traders might see purchasing opportunities around the $0.27 support level, while potential exits could be considered as prices approach the $1.37 resistance. A breakout past $1.92 may indicate renewed bullish momentum. Conclusion XRP and ADA have shown promising signs of potential growth. Both coins have strong backing from their communities and ongoing development projects. Their recent activities suggest that they are positioned for significant gains. However, predicting exact outcomes remains complex. Yet, their paths forward are imbued with opportunities that could lead to explosive rebounds. Keeping an eye on market movements and updates is essential for a clearer picture of their trajectories. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ripple (XRP), currently trading around $0.61, is gaining momentum amid renewed optimism surrounding its ongoing legal clarity. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi gem still in presale, is attracting serious attention from early movers looking for asymmetric upside. MUTM is currently available at an attractive presale. The project has managed to secure over $6.5 million from investors. Over 8100 holders have entered the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale during phase 4 due to the system plans to double its price from $0.025 to $0.03. Those starting to invest now during this phase will earn 140% return at the launch price of $0.06. For investors wondering how to deploy $3,000 in this market cycle, experts say these two could be the smartest bets this month. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized lending market through its revolutionary dual-lending technology which drives its exponential growth. Approximately 8100 investors partook in support of the project by investing $6.5 million after recognizing its value potential during its presale period. The current price of Mutuum Finance Token stands at $0.025 in Phase 4 but investors will experience additional value from the upcoming Phase 5 price increase of 20%. The team behind Mutuum Finance has rolled out a new dashboard equipped with a leaderboard that recognizes the top 50 token holders. Staying in these top ranks will grant participants additional bonus tokens as a reward. Reshaping DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance brings out the revolutionary change to DeFi by incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P provides passive income opportunities to customers by placing them in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract managed automatic lending capabilities. The P2P method enables direct lending relations that allow customers to operate deals without intermediaries while keeping their capital intact. The linkage of P2C and P2P models at Mutuum Finance creates an investment opportunity with enhanced safety alongside improved efficiency and decentralized features as a DeFi investment solution for maximum-yield seekers. Investor Incentives and Community Expansion The company builds its community base through rewarding investors with attractive benefits. The fund will send 10 fortunate participants $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens through its $100,000 token distribution campaign combined with its award-winning referral system that rewards users for acquiring new participants. The platform offers exclusive staking pools and governance rights and VIP update access to its early adopting community members as they develop long-term loyalty with Mutuum Finance. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term. Scarcity of tokens and deflationary mechanisms applied during presales lead Mutuum Finance (Mutuum Finance) to establish price appreciation potential in the long term. High incentive rewards and active token participation are possible through its staking feature which builds long-term functionality and maintains a healthy ecosystem. Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as top investment picks, with the crypto market poised for an April rebound.

Reports reveal that ETH has suffered a staggering 77% price crash against BTC — a decline likely fueled by a mix of technical, macro, and sentiment-driven factors. Notably, On-chain analytics platform, Santiment has now pinpointed and broken down the key reasons behind these price struggles. Ethereum Price Nosedives Against Bitcoin On April 11, Santiment released a detailed report on Ethereum, highlighting its almost four-year underperformance and the reasons behind it. Ethereum, once revered as the cryptocurrency most likely to dethrone Bitcoin, has recently suffered a brutal price decline when measured directly against BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Pain Is Far From Over: Why A Massive Drop To $1,400 Could Rock The Underperformer According to Santiment’s on-chain data, Ethereum has crashed by approximately 77% against Bitcoin since December 2021. While the dollar value of ETH hasn’t completely collapsed, especially compared to other altcoins, the long-term BTC/ETH ratio still paints a gruesome picture for Ethereum holders. Notably, Ethereum has also failed to recover anywhere near its November 2021 all-time high of $4,760. In contrast, Bitcoin has surged ahead, reclaiming much of its market dominance and outpacing ETH across almost every timeframe. This disparity has led many traders and former maximalists to compare ETH to a “shitcoin.” Even worse, various mid to low-cap altcoins have already outperformed Ethereum over the short, mid, and long-term timeframes, causing further embarrassment for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Based on Santiment’s report, the ETH/BTC price ratio chart alone is enough to trigger doubt and uncertainty among long-term holders. Behind The Scenes Of Ethereum Price Struggles Beyond price action and market volatility, Santiment reveals that there are fundamental reasons for Ethereum’s sluggish performance over the years. Some of the major criticisms that analysts and traders have pinpointed include technical, sentimental, and regulatory issues. Related Reading: Ethereum Goes Head To Head With XRP: Analyst Says ETH Will Outperform For This Reason Ironically, Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions are one of the key drivers of its underperformance. L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync are reportedly cannibalizing activity on the mainnet, taking investments from ETH while spreading investor attention thin. Secondly, Ethereum seems to struggle with complex roadmaps and communication, which has led to investor confusion. Major updates like The Merge and Shanghai have been difficult for investors to comprehend, making ETH feel less accessible than BTC. Thirdly, users remain frustrated by Ethereum’s relatively high gas fees and the slow rollout of key upgrades. This has pushed them toward more affordable and faster alternatives, significantly reducing adoption. Another primary reason for Ethereum’s crash against Bitcoin is ongoing regulatory concerns. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a more established legal precedent, Ethereum faces constant uncertainty about whether it could be labeled a security. Other points include ETH’s lack of investment appeal. While Bitcoin maintains the title as a stable digital gold, Ethereum appears to be caught in between, having no clear or attractive investment narrative. Moreover, newer blockchains like Solana and Cardano are also attracting a significant number of users with cheaper and faster solutions, ultimately pulling investments away from ETH. The final reason Santiment has identified for Ethereum’s long-term price descent is rising selling pressure. Post-upgrade withdrawals of stakes ETHs have created steady sell-side pressure, limiting growth and momentum compared to Bitcoin.

Hidden Altcoin Aims for a 458% Run in 13 Days,https://thecoinrise.com/why-is-crypto-down-today-hidden-altcoin-aims-for-a-458-run-in-13-days/,"Amid a sharp decline in the crypto market, driven by massive liquidations, traders are turning their attention to a promising altcoin. The emerging RCO Finance stands out with its innovative features and a presale offering that hints at a potential 458% gain in just 13 days. Curious about what makes RCO Finance stand out?

Bitcoin led the decline, dropping sharply and causing about $361 million in losses, which triggered panic and rapid margin calls on major exchanges. The largest liquidation was a $7.08 million Bitcoin swap on OKX, impacting over 452,000 traders. Ethereum saw $320 million liquidated, while Solana lost $58 million. The total market cap dropped over 10% to $2.51 trillion due to significant declines in other crypto tokens. Volatility surged as traders adjusted positions, with a 24-hour trading volume of $181.97 billion. Analysts linked the crash to overheated sentiment, high leverage, and global economic issues. While some view the correction as stabilizing, sentiment remains fragile as Bitcoin lingers below $70,000. RCOF Presale Stuns The Crypto Market As investors seek high-growth opportunities amid crypto market struggles, attention is shifting to emerging low-cap altcoins like RCO Finance. Currently in its fifth presale stage, RCOF is priced at just $0.10 , making it an attractive entry point for early adopters. Here’s the exciting part: by using the promo code RCOF40, you can enjoy a 40% discount off the current price! Experts believe that once RCOF is listed on exchanges, the token price could surge to $0.60. This presents early investors with the potential for returns of up to 300%. Some experts even think RCOF could mirror the remarkable Bitcoin price rally in 2021. Even better, as the presale comes to an end, RCO Finance is preparing to launch a debit card for investors, marking an important step in its growing adoption. Don’t wait too long!

BlockDAG, XRP, Dogecoin & SHIB Are Breaking Out",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/best-crypto-coins-to-buy-in-2025-blockdag-xrp-dogecoin-shib-are-breaking-out/,"Q2 of 2025 is turning up the heat, and crypto traders are zoning in on a handful of breakout coins. Among them, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu , and BlockDAG are pulling ahead as the best crypto coins to buy this year. Each brings something unique—XRP’s institutional appeal, Dogecoin’s viral backing, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem growth, and BlockDAG’s massive presale. As digital assets evolve at breakneck speed, the traders keeping a close watch on these four may have front-row seats to the next wave of gains. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Surging Ahead With Speed, Tools, & Real Users BlockDAG has become a headline name in 2025—and it’s not by accident. The project raised a massive $213.5 million in presale across 27 batches, starting at $0.001 and climbing to $0.0248 , delivering a jaw-dropping 2,380% return for early participants. After Keynote 3, BlockDAG rolled out Beta Testnet V1, which doubles the speed of its alpha version. New tools like a no-code NFT and coin builder are already live, signaling that this isn’t a whitepaper project—it’s real, usable tech. With over 1 million users mining on its X1 App , adoption is off the charts. And with a mainnet launch locked in for 2025, BlockDAG’s focus on scalability, access, and speed puts it in a league of its own. It’s not just one of the best crypto coins to buy—it’s one of the most promising projects in motion right now. 2. XRP: Legal Wins & Institutional Focus Ignite Optimism XRP is riding high in 2025, trading at $2.06 as of April. Its rebound is backed by a crucial court victory against the SEC, which has revived confidence among institutional investors and fueled talks of an XRP ETF. The probability of ETF approval is sitting at 82%, which could skyrocket demand. With price forecasts between $1.82 and $4.48 this year, XRP is in a strong position. On-chain activity is healthy, and large holders continue to accumulate. With its real-time payments utility and expanding financial relevance, XRP is still one of the best crypto coins to buy for those betting on mass adoption. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Holding Its Ground With Social Power Dogecoin isn’t just surviving—it’s staying relevant. Now trading at $0.164, DOGE recently dropped 8.63%, but major holders are still loading up—220 million DOGE were scooped up in March alone. Support around $0.16 remains solid, and analysts eye $0.1945 and eventually $0.57 as next potential levels—a possible 250%+ upside. With daily mentions across social platforms and continued payment utility, DOGE may be volatile, but it still earns its spot among the best crypto coins to buy—especially for risk-tolerant traders watching social trends. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Scaling Fast With Real Transactions & Burn Rates Shiba Inu isn’t just a meme—it’s showing serious traction. Trading at $0.00001222 with a $7.18 billion market cap, SHIB is sitting comfortably in the top 15. Its ShibaSwap platform posted a 228% surge in 30-day trading volume, now reaching $17.18 billion in total activity. The Shibarium blockchain has processed over 1 billion transactions, and SHIB’s burn rate recently spiked 104,201%, with 115.89 million tokens burned in a single day. With that level of usage and deflationary pressure, Shiba Inu is shifting from meme to meaningful—and securing its place as a top performing crypto in 2025. Choosing the Best Crypto Coins to Buy in 2025 If you’re scouting for the best crypto coins to buy , these four should be on your radar. XRP has momentum from legal clarity and institutional interest. Dogecoin keeps trending thanks to community power and whale support. Shiba Inu is proving its value with major transaction volume and burn mechanics. But BlockDAG stands out the most. It’s already raised over $213.5 million, has a user base of over 1 million mobile miners, and has delivered a 2,380% presale ROI—with more upside ahead. With a mainnet launch, toolset, and exchange listings all ahead in 2025, BlockDAG is leading the pack—and could be the next big thing before the presale window closes.

It looks past the noise and zeroes in on what’s quietly growing beneath the surface. Most people chase pumps. But the biggest gains come from spotting the ones that are already proving their worth. This isn’t about guesswork—it’s about recognizing momentum before it explodes. If you’re serious about finding the best crypto to buy now , these four—BNB, BlockDAG, XRP, and Toncoin—should be on your radar. 1. BlockDAG: 2,380% Gains and It’s Still Early While other projects wait for attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already cashing in. With $213.5 million raised , 19.1 billion coins sold , and a 2,380% price surge since its earliest presale batch, BDAG didn’t wait for validation—it earned it. This isn’t hype—it’s progress. The testnet is live. Over 200+ dApps are in development. And more than 1 million users are already mining BDAG through the X1 app. The roadmap? Not just filled with dreams—but real features like account abstraction , smart contract autonomy , and self-sovereign identity already being rolled out. At $0.0248 in Batch 27 , with forecasts hitting $30 by 2030 , BDAG isn’t a guess. It’s a working system that’s already rewarding early adopters. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now , BlockDAG might be the one you’ll wish you grabbed sooner. 2. BNB: Powerful Utility, But Capped Potential Binance Coin (BNB) still leads the pack when it comes to exchange-backed tokens. It fuels the Binance Smart Chain , runs on one of the most active platforms in crypto, and follows a smart deflationary model that burns tokens every quarter to tighten supply. It’s strong on fundamentals. But don’t expect fireworks. Even Binance’s internal outlook pegs BNB between $605 and $610 by the end of 2025. That’s not liftoff—it’s a steady cruise. For investors looking for solid footing and utility-based tokens, BNB stays on the shortlist of top cryptos to buy now —just don’t count on moonshots. 3. XRP: A Legal Win, But Still Waiting on Liftoff XRP isn’t just a survivor—it’s one of the few coins with a real-world mission: to revolutionize cross-border payments. And with Ripple’s major court win over the SEC, it’s finally breathing easier on the legal front. But price-wise, XRP hasn’t taken off yet. Currently trading at $1.67 after a 25% drop over the past month, it’s feeling the weight of global uncertainty and liquidation pressure. Analysts predict a rally to $3–$27 by 2025 , but warn that dipping below support could send it down to $1 or lower . Still, for anyone banking on utility and regulatory clarity, XRP is one of the best crypto to buy now —especially at these levels. 4. Toncoin: A Speed Demon with Long-Term Firepower Toncoin (TON) came out of Telegram’s blockchain experiment and has turned into a high-speed Layer-1 player. It’s built for scalability, low-cost execution, and performance—a dream for developers. Right now, TON is in the middle of a market correction, but analysts forecast a price between $2.14 and $3.20 by 2025. Long-term, it could hit $10 to $12 by 2030 , assuming traction keeps building. But here’s the catch: you need good timing. Get in during this correction, and TON could be your next big win. If you’re playing for growth, TON could be the best crypto to buy now —but only if you know when to strike. Which is the Best Crypto to Buy Now? These four projects are all making waves—but they’re not all riding the same current. BNB brings stability, but the upside is capped. XRP has legal clarity and global relevance but needs fuel to move. TON is built for speed, but success hinges on catching it at the right moment. BlockDAG , though? It’s already moving. It’s already delivering. With a working network, community adoption, and real ROI already in play, BDAG isn’t speculating on success—it’s stacking it. So if you’re asking what the best crypto to buy now looks like—it’s probably not the coin you keep watching. It’s the one already working while the others wait for a reason to run.

In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a key support zone that continues to hold firm, reinforcing the possibility of a bottom formation. Notably, the analyst said the price action has “respected the long-standing blue support line”, originally established around the “Trump rally breakout.” Current structure suggests a “possible bottom formation near this zone, supported by volume and historical price behavior.” With volume backing the move and historical price behavior aligning, BTCEarth believes the current structure may mark the early signs of a bullish turnaround for Bitcoin. Impending Price Recovery For Bitcoin? BTCEarth pointed out that the blue horizontal support line on his chart aligns closely with Bitcoin’s early breakout in September 2024. This level has since acted as a crucial support zone, having been retested multiple times throughout the past months. Notably, the most recent price touches at $74,434 and $74,588 appear to have formed another significant bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For W-Bottom Reversal, Says Legendary Trader Bollinger According to BTCEarth, the repeated validation of this support suggests that Bitcoin is building a strong foundation. If this structure holds, it could pave the way for a bullish reversal, especially as momentum and historical price behavior support a potential breakout from this area. BTCEarth also emphasized that Bitcoin is currently trading within a falling wedge pattern. In his chart, Line D serves as the support base while Line E marks the descending resistance. The price action has continued to compress within this narrowing structure, signaling a breakout on the horizon. He noted that a confirmed move above Line E, especially one sustained over multiple daily candle closes, would validate the pattern and confirm a bullish reversal. Such a breakout could set the stage for a stronger upward trend as traders recognize the shift in market structure. Key Resistance And Buying Zones BTCEarth highlighted that the accumulation zone between $74,000 and $75,000 remains intact, offering a favorable risk-reward setup for long positions. The immediate resistance lies at $80,000. Further resistance is found between $86,000 and $88,000, an area of historical consolidation and heavy volume. A breakout above this zone would significantly strengthen Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Fate Hinges On These 2 Resistance Zones – Details Beyond that, he pointed out that the major horizontal resistance near $100,000 remains the ultimate target. This level represents a psychological milestone and a crucial technical threshold. If Bitcoin builds enough momentum to clear it, it could pave the way for a fresh leg up in the long-term bullish cycle. In conclusion, BTCEarth highlighted that Bitcoin is stabilizing above a critical support zone, with the price structure suggesting a potential bottom formation. A breakout above Line E could spark a powerful bullish move toward the $88,000–$100,000 range. However, until this breakout occurs, caution remains crucial, and maintaining a hold strategy is advised.

Crypto expert Olivia Vande Woude says Avalanche will change the landscape for traditional finance as we know it. Avalanche Will Modernize Legacy RTGS Systems According to an X post , business development expert Olivia Vande Woude remarks that Avalanche will improve current offerings for mainstream finance. Right out the bat, Woude notes that the lowest hanging fruit for AVAX will be changing outdated rails in legacy finance. Woude argues that rather than a wholesale replacement, an Avalanche integration will improve legacy RTGS systems like SWIFT and Fedwire. Perhaps, the biggest area of improvement will be in conventional post-trade infrastructure bogged down by fragmented reconciliation. Woude notes that the network can introduce real-time finality and liquidity efficiency for post-trade infrastructure. Large exchange infrastructure is tipped to record seismic changes following an Avalanche integration, says Woude. While CBOE and ICE grapple with execution latency, Woud was Avalanche’s decentralization can reduce slippage for legacy exchanges. “Avalanche does for finance what fiber optics did for telecom,” said Woude. “It’s replacing outdated rails with real-time, high-throughput, low-latency execution.” Woude points out in her statement that Avalanche’s tamper-proof infrastructure will improve the batch processing systems employed by traditional custodians. The derivatives markets will receive their fair share of changes, leaning on Avalanche’s collateral optimization and margin logic based on advanced smart contracts. Amid soaring regulatory changes in the US, traditional financial institutions can unlock new revenue streams in tokenization via blockchain-based integrations. Benefits Extend To Funding Markets Amid Soaring AVAX Price Woude highlights the benefits of an integration in short-term funding markets by leaning on its dynamic discounting. Furthermore, the blockchain offers programmable yield analytics designed to revolutionize the operations of repo settlements and liquidity management in funding markets. An EVM compatibility will allow institutions to still deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts, smoothening the curve for tokenized funds. As the US SEC approves options trading for Ethereum spot ETFs, Avalanche can offer financial institutions permission chains for compliance while offering on-chain derivatives mirroring ETF performance. “Avalanche isn’t just modernizing financial infrastructure, it’s reprogramming it,” said Woude. “Institutions adopting Avalanche in turn gain a meaningful edge in speed, efficiency, and transparency.” AVAX price has gained nearly 8% over the last day driven by a broader crypto market rebound and rising institutional adoption for Avalanche. AVAX is trading at $20 while daily trading volumes have spiked by 7% buoyed by bullish chatter around the network.

The parties have asked the judge overseeing the matter to keep the case on hold amid “productive discussions” between their lawyers. The motion seeks to extend Judge Amy Beerman Jackson of the US District Court of Columbia’s stay, which she granted in February following a similar motion. “Continuing The Stay is Appropriate and In the Interest of Judicial Economy” According to a joint filing submitted to the court on April 11, the securities agency asked that the current pause be extended “…In light of these continued discussions and the time required for the staff to seek authorization from the [SEC] as necessary to approve any resolution or changes to the scope of this litigation."" Lawyers for the exchange agreed that ""...continuing the stay is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy."" Judge Jackson granted the parties’ initial request to pause the matter for 60 days in February 2025 after they had filed a similar joint motion. The initial request was based on the SEC’s duties to the new crypto task force established under the Trump Administration. The SEC’s crypto force is tasked with developing a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US. The stay was granted based on the SEC’s responsibilities. The document details: “The work of this task force may impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case…Accordingly, the SEC proposed a brief stay to Defendants, and the Defendants agreed that a stay is appropriate.” The latest joint filing read as such: “Since the Court stayed this case, the Parties have been in productive discussions, including discussions concerning how the efforts of the crypto task force may impact the SEC’s claims. In light of these continued discussions and the time required for the staff to seek authorization from the Commission as necessary to approve any resolution or changes to the scope of this litigation, the SEC requested that the Defendants agree to continue the current stay for an additional 60 days, and the Defendants agreed that continuing the stay is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy. At the end of the 60-day stay period, the Parties propose that they will submit another joint status report. A proposed order is attached hereto. Accordingly, the Parties respectfully request that the Court grant this Joint Motion to Continue the Stay.” The Original June 2023 Complaint The SEC filed its initial complaint against Binance, Binance.US, and Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao , for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies. Binance was not the only exchange to be targeted by the SEC under Chairman Gary Gensler’s rule. The SEC’s infamous 2023 crackdown included similar lawsuits against several other cryptocurrency exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase .

CPW, or cost per wallet, is deemed a higher “quality” metric because it tracks the cost of website visitors with a crypto wallet already installed in their browser. “Higher churn” rate may be to blame Nadler previously told Cointelegraph that their analysis data showed that users with a wallet are more likely to convert to crypto products. CPW across different regions during the bull markets in Q1 an Q4 of 2024. Source: Asaf Nadler Nadler said the high cost-to-return ratio of crypto gaming and gambling might be due to “higher churn, speculative behavior, and intense competition.” He added: “If Web3 gaming is truly “inevitable,” we need to find a more powerful UA engine to make it as sustainable as in Web2.” However, Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin said in an April 11 post on X that periods of high CPW are a good time to experiment. “Create new games/product lines, consolidate our market share, and get ready for the next market expansion,” Zirlin said. “Know when it's a coiling phase. Know when it's time to explode,” he added. Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Centralized Finance (CeFi) campaigns have it a lot easier with attracting new crypto users. “DeFi/CeFi campaigns are the most cost-efficient, with a median CPW of $2.79 and a lower quartile of just $0.10,” Nadler said. The results are based on 200 programmatic campaigns run on Addressable by over 70 advertisers, claiming to target an estimated 9.5 million users globally. CPW results across various sectors of the crypto industry. Source: Asaf Nadler It tracks how CPW varies across market cycles, regions, campaign strategies, and audience segments. Premium markets cost more to reach crypto users during downturns Nadler said that while premium markets experience low-cost conversions for existing crypto wallet holders during bull runs, attracting their attention becomes significantly more expensive during market downturns. Related: Trump kills DeFi broker rule in major crypto win: Finance Redefined He highlighted that in 2024, the US and Western Europe saw CPW increase by four times and 27 times, respectively, between Q1 and Q3, as the markets continued to consolidate and interest from crypto wallet holders waned. “While these markets provide scale and quality during bull runs, they become significantly more expensive when sentiment turns bearish, making them less sustainable during downturns,” Nadler said. Meanwhile, emerging markets like Latin America and Eastern Europe “offer exceptionally low CPW in favorable conditions but can experience extreme cost volatility.” Magazine: Bitcoin eyes $100K by June, Shaq to settle NFT lawsuit, and more: Hodler’s Digest, April 6 – 12",,EN,0,0,AXS|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-13 03:57:58

Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) price prediction is gaining steam after Trump’s trade delay helped lift sentiment and fuel a breakout attempt. But while both networks push for short-term gains, something bigger is playing out behind the scenes. BlockDAG just dropped its Keynote 3—and it’s turning heads across the market. The network has now raised $213.5 million without a single cent from venture capital. Backed entirely by over 170,000 early buyers, this isn’t just momentum—it’s infrastructure in motion. With 10,000 ASIC miners shipping, BlockDAG is building the backbone of a real crypto empire. It might just be the best crypto for 2025 before the crowd catches on. BlockDAG’s $213.5M Power Play: No VCs, Just Pure Momentum BlockDAG isn’t playing by the usual crypto playbook. While other networks lean on venture capital to stay afloat, BlockDAG has crossed $213.5 million in presale funding without a single VC involved. This milestone was confirmed in its Keynote 3 and signals something big—BlockDAG is being built from the ground up by over 170,000 individual buyers who see the potential before listings go live. Currently in batch 27, BDAG coins are selling at $0.0248, up from just $0.001 in batch 1. That’s a 2,380% increase in value so far. Over 19.2 billion coins have already been sold, and momentum hasn’t slowed. With a total supply of 50 billion, and just 10 billion allocated for presale, the window to grab a stake before listing is closing fast. The hype isn’t just about numbers—it’s about real infrastructure. BlockDAG has already started shipping 10,000 ASIC miners, which will power its upcoming decentralized network. Unlike cloud promises, this is hardware hitting the ground, backed by a hybrid DAG+PoW design. It’s not just a pitch—it’s a working plan, with miners, audits, and products already rolling out. For anyone searching for the best crypto for 2025, BlockDAG checks all the boxes: no VCs, real adoption, strong security, and one of the most active communities in crypto right now. The longer it stays under $0.03, the more it feels like a rare shot at pre-launch potential before the listings and hype fully kick in. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Bounce Signals 70% Upside Potential The recent rally in ADA has brought the spotlight back to the Cardano (ADA) price prediction after the coin jumped nearly 19% from $0.51 to $0.61. This move was triggered by a mix of factors—Trump’s 90-day tariff pause, easing inflation data, and a bullish technical setup. ADA is now testing a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, which typically signals a reversal. If it clears resistance around $0.70, the next target could be $0.74 and potentially $1.00. Technical indicators are also lining up. ADA recently hit oversold levels not seen in over a month and formed a bullish RSI divergence—both of which hint at continued upside. The last time it bounced from a similar level, the price surged over 53%. If that pattern repeats, the Cardano (ADA) price prediction could play out with a 70% upside from current levels. Key levels to watch are $0.65 as resistance and $0.46 as critical support. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis: Whale Move Triggers $140 Target Setup A major whale just bought 32,000 SOL worth $3.72 million—fueling a bounce that pushed the price from $95 to over $120. This return comes after a six-month break and has added serious momentum to the current move. The Solana (SOL) technical analysis shows a breakout from a falling wedge pattern that began in November 2024. If the price clears $125, targets at $132 and $140 are now on the radar. On the chart, $112 and $110 are the main support zones, with $105 acting as a line that could shift sentiment if broken. Despite SOL being down 33% since April 2024, buyers are stepping in at key levels. The RSI is still above 50, and a recent false breakdown below $112 has turned into a bullish setup. The Solana (SOL) technical analysis now leans toward a breakout continuation if resistance levels keep falling—and the whale’s conviction only adds to the case. Summing Up Cardano (ADA) price prediction is gaining traction again with a strong bounce and signs of a potential 70% rally if it breaks key resistance. Meanwhile, the Solana (SOL) technical analysis is pointing to a bullish setup backed by a whale’s $3.72M return and a breakout from a long wedge pattern. Both networks are showing strength, but the spotlight is shifting. BlockDAG just delivered one of the biggest updates in the space with its Keynote 3. It confirmed $213.5 million raised in its presale—all without VC funding. With 10,000 miners shipping, real infrastructure is going live, not just talked about. This kind of momentum from over 170,000 holders makes it a serious contender for the best crypto for 2025. For those looking to act before listings on major exchanges and prices move higher, BlockDAG’s current presale window might be the last low entry point for the best crypto for 2025 narrative.

While XRP continues to trade sideways, newer entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing trader attention with explosive growth , strong community traction, and powerful upside potential. This fast-growing altcoin project recently passed a major milestone, gaining over 12,500 early backers just weeks into its presale. With Stage 6 officially SOLD OUT , all eyes are now on Stage 7 , which just went LIVE , opening up a fresh wave of opportunity for investors looking to get in before the listing. EARLY-STAGE OPPORTUNITY VS. ESTABLISHED ALTCOINS That’s the kind of upside that’s increasingly rare in a market flooded with overvalued projects. Analysts have taken note, too. Several popular YouTubers and Twitter traders have called MAGACOIN FINANCE a “top altcoin to watch” , with one post highlighting it as “ one of the strongest early-stage opportunities we’ve seen this year .” WHAT MAKES MAGACOIN FINANCE DIFFERENT? Unlike many presales that fizzle out after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE has maintained a steady climb — both in user growth and hype. The project has passed 12,500 holders in record time, drawing attention for its rapid scaling and community-led approach. More importantly, it’s priced at a level that makes real ROI possible. While many altcoins now debut with inflated valuations, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the classic under-the-radar setup that early XRP and Solana investors once benefited from. With the listing price set at $0.007 , the potential from $0.0002908 represents more than 2,300% upside — a fact not lost on those seeking the next breakout altcoin .

The Wall Street Journal, in a report published on April 11, cited unnamed sources suggesting that Zhao had cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) by offering to provide evidence on Sun. Zhao, now free after serving a four-month sentence for anti-money laundering violations , wasted no time addressing the allegations publicly. “WSJ is really TRYING here,” he wrote on X the next day. “They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t. People who become government witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected.” In the same post , Zhao hinted at foul play behind the scenes, implying the Journal may have been incentivized to publish a “hit piece.” According to him, multiple people had already tipped him off that such a story was in the pipeline. Sun Still Calls CZ a Mentor Justin Sun, who’s been the subject of ongoing scrutiny himself, responded calmly to the uproar. “I am not aware of the circulation rumors,” he said in an April 11 post, referring to the allegations. He went on to describe CZ as both a “mentor and close friend,” suggesting no friction between the two on record. Zhao, for his part, appeared to take the situation in stride but warned that such reports may not be isolated incidents. “I also heard some rumors about some players ‘lobbying’ against us again in the US,” he added , alluding to past efforts by FTX to tighten regulatory pressure on Binance. Back in November 2023, Zhao had claimed that FTX actively lobbied for a regulatory clampdown on Binance to grab market share, referencing a Federal Newswire report as evidence. Crypto Lobbying Fuels Distrust in Washington The controversy also comes on the heels of growing concerns over crypto industry influence in U.S. politics. According to a March report by the Center for Political Accountability, crypto-related entities have poured more than $134 million into the 2024 U.S. elections. While intended to shape a favorable regulatory landscape, these political contributions are now raising alarms over transparency and public trust.

Instead, the expert revealed that the current indicators point to the flagship crypto being in a bear market. Bitcoin/VIX Points To A Bear Market: Analyst In an X post, Severino warned that the Bitcoin/VIX isn’t bullish as some crypto influencers might paint it out to be. He remarked that the technical analysis of it suggests that the current signals are what market participants tend to see during Bitcoin bear markets. However, the expert noted that the month isn’t over yet, which suggests that these indicators could still turn bullish. Severino previously highlighted several reasons why he is no longer bullish on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Back then, he alluded to BTC’s chart, which, based on the Elliott Wave theory and other technical indicators, showed that the flagship crypto has likely topped in this market cycle. Amid Severino’s warning, crypto analysts like Saeed have offered a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Saeed stated that this correction is simply a healthy retracement and that the flagship crypto’s broader trend is still bullish. The analyst highlighted $85,000 as the level Bitcoin needs to break above to reach new highs. The macro side also looks to be bullish for Bitcoin at the moment. The latest CPI and PPI inflation data, which were released, came in lower than expectations, raising hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut soon. According to a recent report, Boston Fed President Susan Collins also assured that the US central bank is ready to help stabilize the market if necessary. With US President Donald Trump’s tariffs persisting, the US Fed might have to step in soon, which is bullish for Bitcoin and other crypto assets, as more liquidity will flow into them. Bullish Technical Analysis For BTC In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto revealed that Bitcoin is forming an inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern, although it still looks like a clean retest for now. He remarked that if this pattern plays out, the flagship crypto could reach $125,000 this year, marking a new all-time high (ATH). Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin is developing another Higher Low on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) while forming Lower Lows on the price. He noted that throughout the cycle, BTC has formed bullish divergences like this on a few occasions. This is a positive for the flagship crypto, as each divergence has always preceded reversals to the upside, indicating that BTC could again rally to the upside soon.

It said: “…on April 10 that according to official news, virtual asset exchange HashKey Exchange announced that it had received approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission on April 10, becoming one of the first exchanges in Hong Kong to be approved to provide pledge services. Previously, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) had officially issued an announcement on April 7, issuing regulatory guidelines on the provision of pledge services to licensed virtual asset trading platforms, and providing guidance on their participation in pledge activities to SFC-approved funds (virtual asset funds) that invest in virtual assets.” The Hong Kong securities regulator said it granted the approval after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) learned of and recognized the potential benefits of staking services. In a statement quoted by PANews, the SFC said: “…the CSRC is aware of the potential benefits of staking in enhancing the security of blockchain networks and allowing investors to earn returns from virtual assets in a regulated market environment.” HashKey May Now Launch Ethereum ETF Staking Service HashKey’s managing director, Terence Pu, explained that the SFC approval means HashKey may now offer staking services for spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “This approval is a milestone practice in Hong Kong's virtual asset regulatory innovation. HashKey Exchange has built a staking service system that meets regulatory requirements, taking the lead in providing ETH staking services for spot ETFs, and is actively promoting the provision of staking services to all customers. This service relies on HashKey Cloud's excellent node operation capabilities to provide users with safe and compliant staking services. In the near future, investors will not only be able to hold Ethereum ETFs to obtain staking income, but also directly hold ETH and obtain additional income through our staking services. In the future, we will continue to rely on Hong Kong's unique policy advantages to expand this service to more types of digital assets and provide the market with more compliant and diversified investment products,"" said Terence Pu.

This breakout attempt comes amid a whirlwind of macro and policy developments pushing capital into BTC. China’s Tariff Hike Pushes BTC to $85K Markets were rattled this week after China retaliated against U.S. tariffs , raising duties on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, with threats to expand coverage to another $144 billion. The escalation sent equities sliding—but Bitcoin surged, hitting $85,000 as investors looked for a safe haven amid growing geopolitical tensions.

Florida is proposing a bill to allow public funds to invest in Bitcoin, and North Carolina is working to recognize it as legal tender. These moves come as Bitcoin’s hashrate surged past 120 TH/s, reflecting rising institutional mining interest. The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart shows BTC is still in the “HODL” to “Still Cheap” zone, reinforcing analyst predictions of a climb toward $91,500 as demand rises. Trump Repeals IRS DeFi Rule, Boosting Crypto Sentiment In a major win for the crypto industry, President Trump signed off on the repeal of the IRS DeFi Broker Rule—a regulation that would’ve required decentralized platforms to report user transactions to the IRS. Initially set for 2027, the rule faced backlash for its privacy risks and technical impracticality.

Mike Carey and supported across party lines—marks the first crypto-specific law ever repealed via Congressional Review. Trump’s pro-crypto stance continues to inject confidence into the market, especially for DeFi and institutional players. Bitcoin Gets an Education Boost in the UK Adding to the bullish sentiment, Lomond School in Scotland has become the first UK school to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments, starting Fall 2025. The initiative is part of a broader plan to educate students about “sound money” principles rooted in Austrian economics.

The move mirrors efforts in the U.S., where universities like Wyoming and Austin are building BTC-focused academic programs and treasuries. This expansion into education strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term adoption story, especially among Gen Z. Bitcoin Technical Analysis – April 13, 2025 BTC/USD is holding strong at $84,700, just below resistance at $86,100—a level that marks the upper trendline of a long-term descending channel and a prior supply zone.

On the flip side, a rejection may lead to a brief pullback, but the broader structure remains bullish. BTC Bull Presale: Earn Real Bitcoin with Every Price Milestone BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is gaining traction as one of the most exciting presales in crypto, combining meme culture with real utility.

It was trading at $0.00001240, a few points above the year-to-date low of $0.00001080. This means that it remains sharply lower than last year’s high of $0.00004560. This article explores the potential scenarios for the coin. Shiba Inu price daily chart analysis The daily chart points to an eventual SHIB price breakout in the coming weeks. That’s because the coin has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.00001090, and whose neckline is at $0.00001565. A double-bottom is one of the most bullsh chart patterns. If this one works out well, there is a likelihood that it will bounce back, eventually to the neckline at $0.00001565, which is up by 25% from the current level. It will then rise to $0.00002030. This target is estimated by first measuring the depth of the double-bottom pattern, and then the same distance from the neckline. Shiba Inu price has also formed a giant falling wedge pattern, which is shown in blue below. This pattern comprises of two descending and converging trendlines. Historically, the pattern usually leads to a strong bullish breakout when the two lines near their convergence. Therefore, this pattern also points to a strong bullish breakout in the next few weeks.

However, the 3D chart points to a strong bearish breakdown in the coming weeks, especially if it loses the key support at $0.000010. The bearish outlook is mostly because the SHIB price has formed a double-top chart pattern at $0.0000333. This is a crucial pattern made up of two peaks and a neckline. In this case, the pattern’s neckline is at $0.000010, where it trades at today. Shiba Inu price has also collapsed below the 50-week day and 200-day moving averages, forming a death cross. Historically, this death cross is one of the most popular bearish signs in technical analysis. The last time that SHIB formed the death cross was in November 2022, and it plunged by almost 40% afterwards. Therefore, the 3D chart points to further downside in the coming days. This view will be confirmed if the coin crashes below the support at $0.0000107. Such a move will point to more downside, potentially to the key support at $0.0000054, its lowest level in May 2023. SHIB chart by TradingView Potential catalysts for Shiba Inu coin The daily and the 3D charts are sending mixed signals on the next Shiba Inu price outlook. Therefore, the next path could mainly be influenced by its fundamentals. There are signs that the crypto market will bounce back as investors embrace the new normal of high tariffs and recession. That’s because, despite all the challenges in the financial market, Bitcoin has remained above $80,000, a sign that bulls are providing it with a backstop. Further, the rising recession odds mean that the Federal Reserve will likely intervene in the market, especially now that inflation is falling. Analysts believe that the Fed may deliver more interest rate cuts than expected in the coming meetings. The crypto market often does well when the Fed has embraced easy money policies. Therefore, fundamentally, there is a likelihood that the first scenario of the daily chart will prevail.

DOGE and SHIBA INU have surged back into the spotlight with a combined weekly trading volume of over $3 billion , sparking renewed excitement across the crypto community. DOGE’s daily volume touched highs not seen since 2021 , while SHIBA is riding a new wave of momentum following ecosystem updates and increased social engagement. But as volume builds, the big question remains — can this momentum last , or are these meme giants peaking before the next wave of tokens takes over? SHIBA’S HISTORIC RUN: 60,000% FROM LOW TO HIGH For context, SHIBA’s rise from obscurity to the top ranks of the crypto market was nothing short of legendary. The token famously delivered a 60,000% ROI from its bottom to its all-time high — creating thousands of new millionaires during its 2021–2022 run. However, with SHIBA already up significantly and now trading billions in weekly volume, the window for massive exponential gains may be narrowing. The same applies to DOGE, whose growth has matured, making it less of a moonshot and more of a cultural mainstay. That’s why savvy investors are looking at the next breakout meme project with early-stage upside — and many believe they’ve found it. ENTER MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE NEW VIRAL MEMECOIN ON THE RISE As DOGE and SHIBA dominate headlines again, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves of its own — positioning itself as the next breakout meme project with real potential to mimic SHIBA’s iconic rise. Backed by a politically charged brand and a buzzing online community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is going viral fast across Telegram, YouTube, and Twitter/X. Unlike late-stage memecoins, this one is still in its early phase, giving investors a rare chance to get in under $0.0003 — a price point reminiscent of SHIBA’s early days. It’s already gaining traction, with crypto KOLs calling it “one of the most explosive early-stage meme tokens of 2025 ,” and its stage-based presale model is pushing engagement to new highs. COULD MAGACOIN FINANCE BE THE NEXT 60,000% WINNER? With SHIBA’s playbook in mind, some analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the one to deliver SHIBA-style returns in this cycle. Early entry, strong branding, and a socially driven ecosystem are all lining up to create a potential moonshot. Of course, nothing is guaranteed — but in a market where the big names are already deep into their cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of asymmetric opportunity that early SHIBA holders once had. FINAL THOUGHTS: TIME TO DIVERSIFY? ⚠️ FINAL HOURS: CLAIM 50% EXTRA BONUS — CODE MAGA50X DOGE and SHIBA are proving that meme season isn’t over — not by a long shot. But with weekly volumes now topping $3B , some traders are looking to reposition before the next meme frenzy begins. For those hunting the next SHIBA-style breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE might just be the alpha play. Early access, viral growth, and under-the-radar entry points under $0.0003 — the ingredients are there.

The asset remains tightly coiled within a narrowing range, holding above the critical $2.00 mark. Traders are closely monitoring Bollinger Band compression, a fresh MACD bullish crossover, and a neutral RSI (an alignment that often precedes a major move). As market momentum builds silently beneath this quiet price action, today’s session could prove pivotal in shaping XRP’s short-term trajectory. Tight Support Structure Reinforces Bullish Potential XRP is hovering slightly above $2.00, with immediate support sitting at $1.98. This zone has served as a key pivot in recent sessions, absorbing selling pressure and keeping the bullish structure intact. Should the price dip further, historical support levels at $1.94 and $1.82 offer additional cushion. These zones have historically attracted buyers during retracements, particularly in pre-breakout phases. Maintaining $1.98 support today will be crucial for sustaining the bullish bias. A breakdown below $1.94 could invalidate near-term upside potential and shift focus toward the $1.70 range. Bollinger Bands and MACD Align for Imminent Breakout One of the most compelling signs of potential movement lies in the Bollinger Bands, which are now at their tightest range in months. This squeeze pattern is a well-known precursor to significant volatility. Paired with a recent MACD bullish crossover—where the MACD line crosses above the signal line—the chart now reflects growing bullish momentum. Historically, similar technical combinations on XRP’s chart have resulted in multi-day rallies of 20–30%. If momentum continues to build today, an upside breakout toward the $2.30–$2.50 zone may unfold within the next 24–72 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 RSI Suggests Room for Expansion XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently parked around the 50 level, a neutral reading that reflects balance in buyer-seller momentum. This positioning gives the asset ample room to run should bullish pressure escalate. If RSI begins moving above 60, it would signal a strengthening uptrend (often a precursor to a confirmed rally). However, confirmation will ultimately hinge on volume. Despite bullish chart signals, trading volume remains modest. A true breakout must be backed by rising participation. Traders should watch for a spike in 4-hour or daily candle volume above $2.20 to confirm a valid move. Prediction for Today All indicators point to XRP being on the verge of a decisive move . If support at $1.98 holds and volume increases throughout today’s session, XRP could break resistance at $2.20 and test the $2.30–$2.50 region-yielding a potential 15% to 25% upside.. However, a failure to hold support and a high-volume breakdown below $1.94 would open the door to bearish targets around $1.82. For now, the technical setup favors bulls, but confirmation through volume and candle structure is critical. As XRP coils at a key inflection point, today’s price action may provide the first clues to its next significant leg.

But while XRP commands attention as a legacy giant navigating regulatory waves, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fast-growing altcoin project — one that analysts are calling an early-stage opportunity with serious upside potential. XRP: STILL A CROWD FAVORITE, BUT GAINS ARE LIMITED XRP continues to draw heavy attention, thanks to its high-profile legal battle with the SEC and the promise of becoming a bridge currency for global payments. Its massive community and institutional exposure ensure it stays in the spotlight — but most analysts agree: the days of 25x or 50x returns are likely behind it. For XRP to deliver that kind of return today, it would need to exceed a multi-trillion-dollar market cap — a stretch even in the most bullish scenarios. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE TOP ALTC0IN TO WATCH IN 2025 While XRP rides on legacy hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as the top altcoin to watch in 2025. With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , the momentum is undeniable. What’s turning heads? A listing target of $0.007 A current presale price (for those tracking) of $0.0002908 That’s a built-in ROI potential of over 25x — or 2,300% gains from early entry to public launch This level of structured growth and anticipation is what’s fueling daily spikes in search interest, especially from retail traders scanning for the next breakout . ANALYST PREDICTIONS: MAGACOIN COULD OUTPERFORM While XRP remains a popular hold, several top analysts have shifted focus to emerging opportunities with higher ceilings. Many now include MAGACOIN FINANCE in their lists of next 30x–35x plays , citing its organic community growth, market timing, and strategic launch phases as key strengths. With Stage 7 moving quickly, and listings expected in the coming weeks, the project continues to climb Google’s trending charts — not just as a curiosity, but as a serious contender in the altcoin arena. FINAL THOUGHTS: MOMENTUM SPEAKS LOUDER THAN HYPE 🔓 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! It’s clear why XRP is still in the conversation. But when it comes to explosive growth , search trends and analyst buzz suggest traders are turning to newer, leaner, and more dynamic tokens. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE — with its presale stages nearly gone, a path from $0.0002908 to $0.007 , and early signals of virality — is taking center stage. If you’re watching Google, the trend is clear: this fast-growing altcoin project is making its mark.

As ETH treads water, a new wave of attention is shifting toward early-stage altcoin projects with stronger short-term upside — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that pack. This top altcoin to watch has just entered a new phase of its presale, with Stage 7 now LIVE following the complete sell-out of Stage 6 — a clear sign of rising demand and investor momentum. WHILE ETH COOLS, ALTCOINS HEAT UP Ethereum’s current sideways action is a stark contrast to the energy surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to attract hundreds of new holders daily. With more than 12,500+ backers onboard already, this fast-growing altcoin project is proving that early-stage opportunity still exists in crypto. And the numbers don’t lie: With a current presale price of $0.0002908 and a confirmed listing target of $0.007 , MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a clear 25x ROI potential — over 2,300% upside. ANALYST PREDICTIONS: MAGACOIN FINANCE COULD OUTPACE TOP 10 COINS Crypto analysts are paying close attention. In recent prediction roundups, several have included MAGACOIN FINANCE in their lists of next breakout altcoins , citing its rapid community growth, aggressive tokenomics, and strategic rollout. One popular YouTube analyst even claimed, “This is the kind of early-stage setup that turns into a 30x mover if momentum continues.” And that momentum is undeniable. Telegram chats are growing rapidly, X (formerly Twitter) threads are filling up with bullish speculation, and the token’s presale stages are selling out faster than expected — a rare signal in today’s cautious altcoin environment. IS THIS THE NEXT 100X ALTCOIN? ⚠️ FINAL HOURS: CLAIM 50% EXTRA BONUS — CODE MAGA50X Ethereum is a giant, but giants don’t move fast. For traders looking to multiply capital in Q2 of 2025 , early-stage picks like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a compelling case. Unlike the blue chips, this is a project still in its growth phase — a time when explosive growth is actually possible. With Stage 7 now LIVE , a listing price set at $0.007 , and fresh investor momentum daily, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a serious contender for those hunting the next big altcoin play .

Here’s How It’s Gaining Ground on Avalanche & Ethena,https://thecoinrise.com/is-blockdag-the-next-ethereum-heres-how-its-gaining-ground-on-avalanche-ethena/,"In crypto, standout performance always raises the bar. Recently, BlockDAG has emerged as the one setting that bar. While Avalanche focuses on speed and scalability, and Ethena experiments with synthetic stablecoins, both are facing mixed results. Avalanche has dealt with a significant price dip, and Ethena’s bold yield promises are drawing skepticism. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is gaining ground steadily, with a 2,380% return since batch 1 and $213.5 million already raised. As the conversation turns to which project could rival Ethereum, BlockDAG’s solid delivery and rising user support make it a name worth watching closely. Avalanche: Speed, Scalability, & Recent Market Movement Avalanche was designed to be a fast, flexible, and scalable blockchain network. It uses a unique consensus model that processes up to 4,500 transactions per second and allows developers to create custom subnets for different use cases. AVAX, the platform’s native token, plays a central role in transaction fees, staking, and governance. In terms of price, AVAX hit a peak of $65 in March 2024 but slipped to around $34.05 by January 28, 2025. That’s a decline of about 47.6%. Still, analysts are hopeful, with some predicting AVAX could rebound and climb to $110 before 2025 ends—an increase of over 220% from where it stands today. Ethena: Taking on DeFi with Synthetic Stability Ethena is making waves in DeFi by offering USDe, a synthetic stablecoin designed to mirror the dollar’s value by hedging Ethereum through perpetual swaps. Investors use ENA tokens for governance and utility on the platform. By late 2024, USDe had grown its supply to $6 billion in just 10 months, making it the third-largest USD-linked asset in crypto. The protocol also reached $1.2 billion in annualized revenue in its first year. In February 2025, Ethena raised $100 million privately to expand its DeFi suite and launch an institutional-grade stablecoin. However, ENA’s price hasn’t kept up with its earlier momentum. After a 63% rally in December 2024, experts noted that its near-300% yield expectations might not hold. Even so, Ethena’s plans show potential in connecting traditional finance and DeFi more effectively. BlockDAG: The Hidden Contender for the Next Big Crypto Title BlockDAG is quickly shaping up to be one of crypto’s most promising projects, thanks to strong numbers and buyer trust. So far, it’s pulled in $213.5 million during its presale, with over 19.2 billion coins sold. Now in batch 27 and priced at $0.0248, the coin has already delivered a 2,380% ROI from its initial batch—a signal that it’s doing more than just generating hype. The recent Keynote 3 pushed things even further, introducing the “Primordial” beta testnet and outlining a clear roadmap to mainnet. The team also launched the X1 Miner app, adding mobile mining to the mix. These updates helped bring in another $5 million in funding just days after the keynote—proof that BlockDAG’s appeal is growing fast. More importantly, BlockDAG is drawing early comparisons to Ethereum’s rise. While Bitcoin brought decentralization and Ethereum introduced smart contracts, BlockDAG is offering something different—scalability without losing speed or security. With this foundation, it’s aiming to power the next generation of dApps, payments, and enterprise-level blockchain solutions. What Sets BlockDAG Apart in This Comparison? Looking at all three projects, a few things become clear. Avalanche has strong tech, but its market movement has been shaky. Ethena grew fast, but its future yield sustainability is in question. BlockDAG, however, is building steadily—with results to show for it. Raising $213.5 million, selling 19.2 billion coins, and delivering a 2,380% ROI—these aren’t projections. They’ve already happened. Add in real updates like a working testnet and a live mobile mining app, and BlockDAG is making a strong case. If the next Ethereum is going to rise based on real-world results, BlockDAG may already be leading the race.

Crypto analysts are now offering their thoughts on what is driving the largest altcoin’s recent woes. Related Reading: From Joke To Juggernaut: Dogecoin Value Revolution Gets Nod From Global Asset Giant Bankless Cofounder Points To Community Attitude Problems David Hoffman, a co-founder of Bankless, has turned to social media site X to opine about Ethereum’s price issues. In Hoffman’s view, the actual problem isn’t what most mainstream critics have their attention on – rather, he thinks that Ethereum’s leadership and community culture are driving users away. Hoffman pointed to two particular instances of this issue: public expulsion of ETH staking platform Lido Finance and the brutal treatment of some traders who were referred to as “degenerate.” He asserts these actions demonstrate a trend of alienating users and builders on the network. ‘Stop Policing Behavior,’ Hoffman Says The cryptocurrency executive contends that Ethereum’s effort to manage user activity on what is supposed to be a permissionless blockchain has emerged as a central reason for its price drop. Everyone is midcurving why ETH’s price performance has sucked Ethereum leadership and culture have alienated users and builders by being hostile to its own app layer. We publicly exorcised @LidoFinance. We’ve shunned traders and degens. On a permissionless chain, we’ve tried… — David Hoffman (@TrustlessState) April 12, 2025 “If we want ETH to grow, the EF and larger community need to begin bringing in users and builders, not driving them away with a holier-than-thou culture,” Hoffman wrote in his post. According to reports, the Lido Finance platform has in the past received strong criticism from the Ethereum community regarding regulatory issues, centralization, and security concerns. On the other hand, some traders were accused of creating high gas prices and failing to back long-term projects. Ethereum Price Indicates Signs Of Recovery In spite of all this, Ethereum’s price has demonstrated a little life in the form of a 3% jump within a 24-hour time frame. This arrives at a vital juncture, as ETH had reportedly reached a five-year low in correlation to Bitcoin. There are some believers among the community. Leo Glisic is one of them who hopes for positive upside on Ethereum given its position as “infrastructure” for the future global financial system. In the opinion of Glisic, “Ethereum will be the settlement and interoperability layer, which is a winner-take-all market.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Takes Aim: Ethereum’s True Value?

BNB was trading at $592 on Sunday, up by about 18% from the lowest level this year. This article explores the potential scenarios for the Binance coin ahead of the Lorentz upgrade. BSC Lorentz hard fork ahead The next important catalyst for the BNB price is the upcoming Lorentz upgrade and hard fork. In an X post, the developers noted that the opBNB hard fork would happen on April 21 this year. It will be followed by the BSC hard fork on April 29. BNB Chain Developers @BNBChainDevs · Follow Lorentz mainnet hardforks are coming:• opBNB → April 21 @ 03:00 AM UTC• BSC → April 29 @ 05:05 AM UTCTestnet is live with faster blocks. Node operators + devs, make sure you’re ready.Full details in the post below 👇 12:00 AM · Apr 13, 2025 12 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies The goal of the Lorentz hard fork is to make the network faster as it seeks to become a better alternative to Ethereum and Solana. The Lorentz hard fork comes a month after the developers implemented the Pascl hard fork. Pascal’s goal was to help it integrate more with Ethereum, the biggest chain in the crypto industry. It improved the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, optimized gas fes abstraction, and added a feature to avoid block calculation errors. The Lorentz upgrade’s goal is to dramatically reduce the block times of the BSC Chain to about 1.5 seconds. It will then be followed by the Maxwell upgrade that will drop the block times further from 1.5 to 0.75. These upgrades will make the BSC Chain one of the fastest chains in the crypto industry. Historically, crypto prices do well ahead of a major network upgrade. Most notably, BSC hopes to be the best alternative to Solana and Ethereum . Solana’s network has become clogged by meme coins, while Ethereum is being destroyed by layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum.

This staking market cap rose by 1.3% in the last 24 hours to over $18 billion. It has brought the staking ratio to 20.8%.Recent data by StakingRewards shows that the inflows have increased gradually. BNB has a staking yield of about 3.5%, making it higher than Ethereum’s 3.14%. At the same time, BNB has become one of the most deflationary tokens in crypto. It achieves this by its real-time burn mechanism that incinerates hundreds of tokens worth over $366k a week. This burn is derived from the gas fees the network handles. The network also has a quarterly burn that incinerates tokens worth over $1 billion a quarter. These token burns will continue in the foreseeable future as the network works to reduce the number of coins from over 144 million to 100 million.

It has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern whose two trendlines are nearing their confluence level. This triangle can break out in either direction. The BNB price has also formed a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have crossed each other. This pattern often leads to a bearish breakdown over time. At the same time, the ongoing consolidation is part of the formation of the handle section of the cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart. Therefore, the outlook for the BNB price is neutral for now. More gains will be confirmed if the BNB price surges above the key resistance level at $720, the highest swing in June.

The Dogecoin ETP will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, trading under the ticker DOGE. A Grand Display of the Growing Support for DOGE Asset manager 21Shares AG (“21Shares”) announced that it formed an “exclusive partnership” with the House of DOGE to create the only Dogecoin ETP endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation. In a press release, 21Shares said the ETP will trade under the ticker ‘DOGE’ and will list on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The partnership underscores the meme coin’s growing support. It marks the first significant milestone “in bringing institutional grade exposure to Dogecoin, one the most community driven and widely recognised digital assets.” The asset manager submitted an S-1 registration statement for its 21Shares Dogecoin ETF to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 9, 2025. If successful, the proposed fund would grant investors direct exposure to DOGE’s price movements without having to own the underlying asset. In its press announcement, 21Shares said, ""21Shares Dogecoin ETP is 100% physically backed, offering a transparent and seamless way for investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through traditional financial channels.” Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged in popularity since its launch in 2013 to become one of the “most widely recognised and accessible cryptocurrencies, known for its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and increasing merchant adoption.” Dogecoin (DOGE) Could Become a Global Currency The House of DOGE, the official corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, is reportedly committed to marketing the ETP when it launches to reinforce DOGE’s role in mainstream media. In the statement announcing the partnership, Jens Wiechers, Co-Executive Director of the Dogecoin Foundation, commented: “For Dogecoin to reach its full potential as a global currency, institutional support and corporate partnerships are essential. This initiative with 21Shares provides a regulated path for institutions to participate in and amplify the ‘Dogecoin is Money’ vision, while still honoring the community’s spirit. Global adoption is critical, and we’re excited to take this next step – ensuring Dogecoin stays fun, but gains the credibility and backing needed to thrive at scale.” Commitment to Expanding Investor Access to Innovative, Community-Driven Assets While DOGE’s technical advantages are commendable, Dogecoin has also successfully built a “highly engaged and socially impactful community” based on a guiding principle of “Do Only Good Everyday.” Duncan Moir, President at 21Shares, said: “Registered investment vehicles are essential for broadening access to digital assets, and Dogecoin’s growing adoption underscores its significance in the crypto ecosystem. By partnering with the House of Doge, we are taking a pivotal step in bringing transparent and institutional-grade investment options to the market. This move reflects our commitment to expanding investor access to innovative and community-driven assets while maintaining the highest regulatory and operational standards.” Sarosh Mistry, President and CEO of Sodexo North America and Director-Elect of House of Doge, also commented on the partnership. “Our partnership with 21Shares demonstrates the evolving maturity and legitimacy of Dogecoin in the financial world. Institutional products will empower new types of investors to participate in the Dogecoin ecosystem, reinforcing its role as a leader in the future of digital assets.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BTC price recovered and gained a hold above $84K following a crash to as low as $74K in the past 7 days. Simultaneously, other tokens like ETH, Solana, and XRP also illustrated a price rebound, keeping investors slightly hopeful about future movements amid macro uncertainty. Following immense macro heat fueled by Donald Trump’s tariffs saga, risk assets have recovered amid a halt on newly imposed tariffs and other developments. Mentioned below are some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Weekly Crypto Highlights: BTC & Altcoins Recover As of press time, BTC price exchanged hands considerably above $84K, up by nearly 1.5% in the past seven days. Further, ETH, SOL, and XRP prices gained roughly 2%-7% over the week. This recovery-like movement comes against the backdrop of a stockpile of optimistic developments. Notably, macro pressure on risk assets like crypto lessened slightly as the U.S. CPI came in cooler than Wall Street expectations this week. US CPI cooled to 2.4% in March, offering the crypto market some relief after turmoil caused by Trump’s Tariff policy. On the other hand, Donald Trump recently announced that tech products will be exempted from China tariffs . While an already ongoing halt on the newly imposed tariffs has offered the market some relief, this news has further garnered investor curiosity, lessening trade war tensions. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink rattled the broader market recently by warning of a looming U.S. recession soon. Given this happens, cryptocurrencies could leverage substantially as the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to inject more liquidity in order to stimulate the economy.

As this deadline fast approaches, crypto traders are looking for the best altcoins to buy to make significant gains once demand for digital assets rises. The recent remarks by Senator Scott coincide with a notable recovery across the crypto market today, April 13. At press time, Bitcoin and all the top ten altcoins were edging higher as the total crypto marketcap reached $2.79 trillion. This rally may extend in the coming months as the US emerges as a leading crypto hub. According to Senator Scott , the pending crypto bills will ensure that the US dominates the digital asset space. The statement also comes after US President Trump signed the first crypto-related bill . The bill, which was signed earlier this week, seeks to remove tax reporting requirements in the DeFi industry. Top Altcoins to Buy Before August With the US emerging as one of the most pro-crypto countries, the top altcoins to buy today for investors to make significant gains are Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Pi Network (PI). Ripple (XRP) XRP is one of the top altcoins to buy today. One of the reasons that makes Ripple a good buy is that it is the largest US-made altcoin by market cap. Therefore, as the US crypto regulatpry framework changes, XRP is well-positioned to benefit. The four-hour XRP price chart suggests the altcoin is in an uptrend. The RSI has risen to 63 showing a prevalence of buying pressure. Meanwhile, the MACD line and green histogram bars support the bullish thesis. If the uptrend continues, XRP price may flip resistance at $2.23. Doing so will trigger a 17% rally to the 161.8% Fibonacci level of $2.61. If Ripple reaches This level, it might pave the way for more gains to new highs above $3. XRP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Solana (SOL) Solana also ranks among the best altcoins to buy today. SOL trades at $132 today. April 13 after a 10% increase in 24 hours. Analyst Momin has shared a bullish Solana price prediction saying the altcoin might rally to $180 in the coming weeks. The analyst also added that Solana is on the verge of making a decisive close above $120 on the weekly chart. If this happens, it will spark a Solana price rally towards $180. Additionally, Solana price has breached the upper trendline of a descending trendline, showing that the bullish momentum is strong, which may spark a surge to $257. Solana Price Chart Pi Network (PI) Pi Network price had posted a 15% gain at press time. Data from CoinMarketCap also shows that trading volumes have increased by 200% to over $663 million as buyers purchased the asset. One of the reasons why Pi Coin is one of the best altcoins to buy ahead of the crypto bills being passed is the asset’s rising presence in the US. The altcoin will be adopted as a means of payment by firms like Zito Realty. At the same time, Chainlink has added Pi Network token to its Data Streams, making it more accessible. Pi Coin is trading within an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour price chart, which shows a positive outlook. At the same time, the AO histogram bars and the RSI are tipping north, which supports a bullish Pi Network price forecast . PI/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Summary of Top Altcoins to Buy The US will pass most of the pending crypto bills before August according to the Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott. Once these bills are passed, the crypto market is poised to make significant gains. The top altcoins to buy today to position yourself for these gains are XRP, SOL and Pi Coin.

The argument moves away from the traditional focus on payments and instead points to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as the primary long-term driver of XRP’s price. According to the post, this transition has the potential to radically alter the token’s supply and demand dynamics by permanently locking up large volumes of XRP. EXPLOSIVE ATTENTION XRP HOLDERS: This post will completely change how you think about XRP and where its true value lies. It’s not just for payments anymore… What comes next is the real catalyst. This is a long post, so let’s get started… What if I told you the… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 12, 2025 Tokenization as the Core Utility Driver At the heart of the post is the process of tokenization, defined as the conversion of tangible assets—such as real estate, bonds, or commodities—into digital tokens issued and managed on XRPL. These tokens are described as programmable, globally tradable, settled within 3–5 seconds, and transferred for an average cost of $0.0002. For example, a $1 million house can be tokenized into 1 million HOUSE tokens. Through XRPL’s decentralized infrastructure, users can purchase fractional shares, earn yield, and trade these tokens using XRP as the underlying asset. All Things XRP emphasized that the real significance lies not in XRP’s movement as a transaction token but in how XRP is locked and removed from circulation in various mechanisms essential to tokenization. This forms the crux of the argument—that XRP is being taken “off the table” permanently and that this structural lock-up is the real catalyst for future price appreciation. Mechanisms of XRP Lock-Up The post describes three key mechanisms through which XRP is locked within the tokenization process. First, Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools hold XRP in smart contracts to enable liquidity for trading between token pairs such as XRP and tokenized real estate assets. This is identified as the most significant contributor to XRP lock-up. Second, XRP can be deposited as collateral in decentralized lending protocols. Although stablecoins like RLUSD may become prominent in these environments, All Things XRP argues that XRP will continue to play a central role, especially as decentralized finance expands on XRPL. Third, XRP is required in small amounts to open accounts and establish trust lines—specifically, 1 XRP per account and 0.2 XRP per trust line. While seemingly minor at the individual level, this demand becomes meaningful at scale. A concrete example is offered involving the tokenization of a $1 million property, with an XRP/HOUSE AMM pool seeded with 24,390 XRP. As users enter the market and swap XRP for HOUSE tokens, more XRP enters the pool and remains locked. If replicated across 1,000 similar properties, this single-use case alone could result in 24.39 million XRP being locked. Quantifying the Long-Term Impact The post cites projections from Ripple that place the total value of tokenized assets at $6 trillion by 2025. If XRPL captures just 10% of that market—$600 billion—then based on current mechanisms, approximately 17.58 billion XRP could be locked: 14.6 billion in AMMs, 2.9 billion in lending, and 20 million in reserves. This would represent over 30% of the current circulating supply of XRP. Looking ahead, the post extrapolates to 2033, when global tokenized assets could reach $18.9 trillion. If XRPL’s market share reaches 15%, approximately 28.37 billion XRP could be locked. That would amount to nearly half of the total circulating supply, fundamentally altering the token’s availability and market dynamics. A Structural Shift in XRP’s Narrative All Things XRP concludes that this phenomenon should not be seen as theoretical or speculative. It is instead presented as an inherent result of XRPL’s design. As more real-world assets are tokenized, more XRP is absorbed into the ecosystem and locked permanently. According to the post, this structural supply reduction constitutes a slow but inevitable supply shock that will support XRP’s price growth over time. The argument places XRP’s evolving utility in the context of broader financial infrastructure, asserting that the token’s long-term appreciation will be driven less by retail speculation or transactional volume and more by its embedded role in a growing global market for tokenized assets. The commentary ends by asserting that the payment narrative surrounding XRP is merely the beginning and that real-world asset tokenization is the true story behind the asset’s future trajectory.

Market experts anticipated a scenario where participants would flock to the leading cryptocurrency as macro conditions affect stocks; however, the opposite has been the case. Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, insisted in an X post that, against popular opinion, bitcoin is not yet digital gold. However, he sees a silver lining in this situation. Not Digital Gold Yet Bitcoin has been named digital gold because of its security, limited supply, and generally believed role as a store of value. These characteristics are similar to gold’s, which has a finite supply that enhances its value as a long-term store of wealth. As global economic tensions, triggered by trade tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, began in February, many market experts believed BTC would record a significant inflow of capital due to investors leaving the stock market for cryptocurrencies. Even Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, thinks the economic chaos stemming from Trump’s tariffs would lead to a monetary easing cycle that will be bullish for BTC. While the market awaits the manifestation of such predictions, cryptocurrencies have been hit just as hard as stocks in the past two months, with BTC recording its deepest correction in this cycle. Ju said tariff experts on X have been “playing 6D chess” since the macro issues began. He explained that uncertainties like this drive demand for safe-haven assets, insinuating that BTC is not seen as such yet. Proof of the CryptoQuant founder’s opinion is that gold has surged by 11% since Trump returned to the White House, while BTC is down more than 25% over the same period. BTC Now in Bear Season Despite bitcoin’s questionable status as digital gold, Ju believes the good news is that BTC will eventually surpass gold’s $20 trillion market cap. The cryptocurrency’s market cap currently sits at $1.6 trillion. Additionally, the CryptoQuant CEO insisted that BTC has entered a bearish phase but is still bullish about the asset’s long-term potential. Ju’s short-term bearish bias for BTC substantiates his claim that the cryptocurrency has wrapped up its bull run for this cycle. Less than a month ago, he said every on-chain metric signals that BTC is in a bear market, so investors should expect 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action, especially with fresh liquidity drying up.

From Dogecoin to SHIB, they’ve taken on many forms but until now, none have entered the space with a sports-first identity. XYZVerse changes that. Billed as the first-ever all-sports meme coin, XYZVerse is attempting something new in a saturated sector. While the meme coin space is often driven by internet culture and hype, this project takes a more structured approach, aiming to merge global sports fandom with community-based token utility. Nothing quite like XYZVerse has been created before. Its goal is to tap into the emotional energy of sports culture — loyalty, rivalry, identity — and channel it through a decentralized meme coin ecosystem. Whether this experiment of blending sports, memes, and crypto catches on at scale remains to be seen — but with the next bull cycle on the horizon, XYZVerse enters the conversation as a unique case to watch. XYZVerse In a Nutshell The project is currently in its presale phase, with $XYZ tokens offered at a discounted rate of $0.003333 ahead of its planned exchange listing. It has also gained early attention for its upcoming large-scale airdrop campaign and strong user sentiment across platforms like CoinMarketCap , where the majority of user votes skew bullish. Community support has been a major driver of its early momentum. With thousands of users actively following the project across social platforms and over $13 million raised in its presale (now in Stage 12 out of 15), XYZVerse has positioned itself as a meme coin with both traction and substance. Learn more about XYZVerse and explore early entry while the presale is live. What sets the project apart further is the early recognition it has received: XYZVerse was awarded Best New Meme Project by crypto.news, a well-known industry media outlet. This distinction adds credibility to its growing reputation as a serious contender in the meme coin space. In terms of security, XYZVerse has taken proactive measures by undergoing comprehensive smart contract audits from both Pessimistic and SolidProof — two respected names in blockchain security. These audits are designed to ensure code safety, transparency, and a lower risk profile for early participants. Security-checked and community-backed—explore $XYZ now How Could XYZ Become the Next SHIB? Of course, any new meme coin inevitably draws comparisons to the giants that came before it — and few names loom larger than Shiba Inu (SHIB). Launched in 2020 with no initial utility and minimal exposure, SHIB became a global phenomenon, rising from obscurity to reach a multi-billion-dollar market cap. It was driven not by advanced tech or partnerships, but by community strength and social virality — the same conditions XYZVerse is hoping to recreate, albeit through a very different thematic lens. While SHIB tapped into meme culture and the legacy of Dogecoin, XYZVerse is leaning into the world of sports fandom , attempting to build a tribe around a different kind of identity: one rooted in team spirit, competition, and global appeal. How does XYZVerse compare to SHIB? Let’s take a look: Feature XYZVerse ($XYZ) Shiba Inu (SHIB) Launch Stage Currently in presale (Stage 12 of 15) Launched in August 2020 Token Price $0.003333 (presale price) ~$0.0000000005 at launch Planned Listing Price $0.10 N/A Token Supply Capped, no future minting planned Quadrillion-level total supply Theme / Branding All-sport meme coin with broad cultural appeal Dog-themed meme coin based on Dogecoin parody Utility Partnership with Bookmaker.XYZ betting platform, and a planned launch of a play-to-earn app Initially none (later added ShibaSwap & NFT use) Airdrop Campaign 10% of total supply reserved for airdrops No structured airdrop at launch Ecosystem Plans Future gamification, platform integration, DAO-based Developed later: DEX, NFT, metaverse initiatives Market Entry Timing Entering ahead of a bull cycle Launched before and surged during 2021 bull run While XYZVerse enters a very different market climate than SHIB did in 2020, there are clear similarities that point to its potential for outsized success — and a few distinct advantages that could help it avoid some of SHIB’s early limitations. Shared Strengths: What They Have in Common Community Focus : Both projects place heavy emphasis on building a strong, active community. SHIB’s rise was fueled almost entirely by retail enthusiasm and online virality — XYZVerse is tapping into similar grassroots momentum, with 95% of CoinMarketCap voters currently expressing a bullish outlook. Meme Appeal : Like SHIB, XYZVerse isn’t pretending to be just another utility token. It embraces the power of internet culture — but instead of dog-themed memes, it leans into global sports fandom to unify a broad audience under one banner. Early Opportunity : Just as SHIB rewarded those who got in before mainstream awareness hit, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase , offering early access pricing that mirrors the kind of positioning early SHIB holders once had. Where XYZVerse Has an Advantage Structured Tokenomics : Unlike SHIB’s quadrillion-level supply and inflationary start, XYZVerse features a capped supply with no future minting planned — a model designed to support price sustainability and limit dilution. Defined Utility from Day One : While SHIB added real utility (like ShibaSwap and NFTs) much later, XYZVerse entered the market with a clear roadmap, staking rewards, and airdrop mechanics already in place. Airdrop-Fueled Growth : 10% of XYZ’s total supply is reserved for airdrops — an incentive strategy that SHIB didn’t have at launch. This not only rewards early community members but helps boost engagement and wallet distribution in a targeted way. Market Timing : XYZVerse is launching ahead of what many analysts believe could be the next bull cycle. If momentum builds as the broader market recovers, XYZ could benefit from strong tailwinds, similar to how SHIB did during its 2021 surge. In short, XYZVerse shares the meme-powered DNA that helped SHIB go viral, but it’s entering the space with more structure, strategic planning, and a broader thematic base. Final Thoughts SHIB’s story proves that small beginnings can lead to explosive outcomes. XYZVerse may not be on every radar yet, but those watching closely see a familiar pattern taking shape. The real question is whether the conditions that led to SHIB’s success can align again in 2025, this time in favor of XYZVerse. Though nothing is guaranteed, the early indicators (including a capped supply, defined roadmap, and strong presale momentum) suggest the project is attempting to position itself on a similar track — but with a clearer structure from the start.

They will use cryptocurrencies.” According to CZ, as AI continues to evolve, it will build on the technological foundations laid by the internet and blockchain. CZ envisions a future where AI agents, or automated digital assistants, perform everyday tasks like booking flights and hotels. These agents will interact and transact with other AI services, relying on blockchain networks for faster, cheaper, and more efficient payments.

This looks pretty conducive, and this type of price action tells me, ‘Okay, we might be front running $72,000.’ Giving me a little bit of a confidence was a shift in equities markets, and the idea that price was at the MA (moving average) 50, and that’s been support.” Cheds also says that Bitcoin will likely see higher prices as long as its immediate support level between $78,500 and $81,000 holds. “Regain $81,000 and we’re back in business… Back above $81,000, we’re back with the idea of regaining that low time frame pivot corresponding with the high time frame support at the MA50, and with the idea that the bulls are going to recapture the trend, which is the rising MA200.” Source: Cheds/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $85,301.

However, history shows that BTC tends to do the opposite of what the crowd expects from it, especially on the derivatives scene. Tech Aspects While the long-standing battle between bulls and bears continues in full force , Martinez noted that bitcoin has managed to ‘slice through’ the first significant resistance in its way toward price redemption – the 50-day SMA, which is around $84,500. Although BTC is yet to fully overcome that level as it sits next to it now, the overall bullish momentum in the past few days suggests more gains are to come. If BTC indeed passes through this line, the next major obstacle will be the 200-day SMA at $87,250. Should that fall, the cryptocurrency could surge toward $94,000, Martinez added. #Bitcoin $BTC is slicing through the 50-day SMA.

Pompliano foresees more will realize data is “inaccurate” “The unspoken secret as to why so many finance folks are wrong in their analysis of the tariffs is because the finance folks believe the government data,” he added. Amid the widespread uncertainty and ongoing fear over US President Donald Trump’s imposed tariffs, Pompliano questioned the accuracy of US inflation figures, job numbers, and GDP statistics. He added that “eventually everyone else will realize the data is inaccurate.” It comes after Pompliano pointed out in a March 20 LinkedIn post, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s appearance on the All-In podcast, where Bessent was asked directly if he trusted the data — and replied, “no.” “Even the Treasury Secretary has now publicly acknowledged he doesn’t believe the data. He says we must listen to the people rather than blindly follow the government data reports.” Concerns about the reliability of US economic data have been brewing for a while. A July 2024 report argued that new approaches are needed to “ensure government statistics remain dependable.” Source: Anthony Pompliano It comes as ongoing concerns over Trump’s imposed tariffs have led some crypto analysts to reinforce the idea that Bitcoin could outlast the US dollar in the long run. Bitwise Invest head of alpha strategies Jeff Parks said on April 9 that there is a “higher chance Bitcoin survives over the dollar in our lifetime after today.” Over the past five days, the US dollar index (DXY) has dropped 3.19%, currently sitting at 99.783 at the time of publication, according to TradingView data. The US dollar index is down 8.06% since the beginning of 2025. Source: TradingView Several Wall Street analysts were under the belief that Trump’s imposed tariffs would bolster the US dollar, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report . Pompliano said, “The mainstream finance conversation has become an intellectual boondoggle where most people regurgitate ill-informed takes based on bad data.” Analysts recently pointed out Bitcoin’s recent breakaway from stocks Meanwhile, analysts recently pointed out that while the stock market was “tanking” on April 4 amid tariff uncertainty, Bitcoin didn’t decline as much as expected .

Analyst Shares Bullish Historical Patterns,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-targeting-19-or-45-analyst-shares-bullish-historical-patterns/,"Egrag Crypro, a prominent crypto analyst, has shared a detailed chart analysis suggesting that XRP could reach $19 or $45.83 based on historical patterns. Using a combination of historical chart data and exponential and simple moving averages, Egrag outlined a case for a dramatic move upward in the coming months. In the post, Egrag emphasized that his forecast was not speculative improvisation but rather an interpretation of technical structures. He stated, “Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t,” emphasizing his reliance on historical price action and recurring technical behavior to justify the projected targets. He added that while the patterns are not guaranteed to repeat exactly, the probabilities become meaningful when the same behaviors and timelines appear more than once in market history. #XRP – Targeting $19 or $45? Charts Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t! I’m not improvising here; I’m relying on historical data to present future predictions. Will it rhyme exactly? No, because if it were that easy, everyone would be a multimillionaire! Human… pic.twitter.com/YasA4k98fd — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 11, 2025 Patterns From 2017 and 2021 Inform Current Outlook The analysis focused on the behavior of the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA) and the 33-period moving average (MA), plotted on a two-week timeframe. Egrag highlighted the significance of a repeated 777-day bottoming structure observed both in the 2017 and 2021 cycles, each followed by substantial upward movements. He labeled this reoccurring duration as a key factor in predicting market timing for potential blow-off tops. In 2017, XRP surged by approximately 2,722% following a bottoming phase and a bullish technical crossover, reaching $3.25. In 2021, the price saw a 1,052% gain, hitting $1.81 after similar technical conditions were met. Egrag pointed out that both events were preceded by bearish crosses on the moving averages and were followed by recoveries that led to massive upside movements. He argues that XRP is now completing a comparable pattern. According to the chart, the most recent bullish crossover has occurred. If XRP follows a similar trajectory as in 2017, it could rise by another 2,722%, placing the target price around $45.84. If the 2021 pattern repeats, a 1,052% gain would lead to a price near $19.07. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Technical Zones and Investor Behavior Egrag’s chart indicates that XRP is trading just below $2.00, with previous support and resistance levels around $0.91 and $1.89. These levels have served as inflection points in prior cycles, reinforcing their relevance in the current analysis. He also addressed market psychology, quoting a line from the financial thriller Margin Call to illustrate the reactive nature of markets: “You cannot control it, stop it, or slow it, or even slightly alter it… you have to just react.” Egrag emphasized that while technical indicators can guide investors, the emotional behavior of participants ultimately drives market cycles. Final Take and Strategy Reminder Although Egrag has consistently maintained a personal target of $27 for XRP , he encouraged followers to manage their expectations and liquidity through a dollar-sell-average strategy. He reminded his audience that while historical patterns can inform strategies, no outcome is guaranteed. “Will it rhyme exactly? No, because if it were that easy, everyone would be a multimillionaire,” he noted. Egrag closed his post with a message to the XRP community: “#XRPFamily STAY STEADY & STRONG! Together, we rise.” His current projection places the hypothetical blow-off top to occur around late September 2025, aligning with the repeated 770-day interval seen in prior cycles.

The altcoins have also posted notable gains once again, with XRP and SOL leading the pack from the larger caps. BTC Touches $86K The rollercoaster of a week for BTC began with a nosedive from $84,000 to a five-month low of under $75,000 on Monday. Although the asset attempted an immediate recovery, it was ultimately stopped and pushed toward the same levels on Wednesday. This came amid the escalating tension between the US, China, and the rest of the world. However, bitcoin started to reclaim ground once US President Trump paused the tariffs on every other nation, aside from China. The cryptocurrency skyrocketed by several grand on Wednesday and tapped $83,300. As China retaliated, BTC retraced slightly to under $79,000, but reversed its trajectory in the following few days. This culminated yesterday at $86,000, which became an 11-day peak. Although it has failed there and now sits below $85,000, BTC’s market cap is up by $1.680 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the alts continues to stand tall above 60%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView PI, XRP, SOL on the Rise The altcoins are also in the green today, with ETH reclaiming $1.6 after a 3% daily surge. XRP and SOL have marked similar increases of around 5% and now trade close to $2.15 and $130, respectively. SUI and BCH have jumped by 6-7% to $2.33 and $340, while PI has stolen the show from the larger-cap alts once again. The altcoin, which was declining severely for over a month, has jumped by another 10% in the past day and trades close to $0.75. BNB, DOGE, ADA, LINK, and XLM also have some gains but in a more modest manner. The total crypto market cap has added more than $40 billion overnight and is up to $2.79 trillion on CG.

In the background of this substantial supply squeeze, however, SHIB price still languishes in a 3.3% loss, in line with wider-market inactivity. In the middle of this storm, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning heads as its fourth presale phase accelerates, having already raised $6.6 million with more than 400 million tokens sold. SHIB’s tenuous resurgence is now compared to MUTM’s organized growth, igniting discussions on which asset has the superior upside into April 2025. Shiba Inu at a Technical Crossroads SHIB trades at $0.00001096, stuck between lower Bollinger Band support ($0.00001066) and 20-day EMA resistance ($0.00001222). A firm break above the EMA might send it towards $0.00001441, corresponding with Marks’ bullish prediction. But, a lack of defense of either will see price action plunge into the $0.000010s, giving back earlier moves. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 35.02, leaning on oversold territory and suggesting a potential bounce if buying pressure returns. At the same time, whale inflows have surged 315% as large investors appear to position themselves strategically ahead of the Shibarium upgrades. As burns are meant to curb supply, SHIB’s trajectory is still tied to the greater market, an unstable fixture for meaningful expansion. Mutuum Finance Increases Presale Success The native token of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is currently in the fourth stage of its presale at $0.025 with a 20% increase to $0.03 in the fifth phase. Even current participants would receive a 140% return when the platform launches, since MUTM would list at just $0.06. More so, $3.50 post-launch target (an increment of around 13,900% from current phase) is being anticipated by analysts. More than 8,200 holders have already taken position, as organic buy pressure from the platform’s profit-driven buyback mechanism (25% of profits go to perpetual token purchases) has propelled demand. Meme coins are driven in the bursts of speculative hype that cannot be sustained over time, while this model ensures consistent demand. The initiative, which recently released a real-time dashboard displaying a leaderboard with the top 50 token holders. These first-class participants will start to receive bonus tokens as rewards, creating an incentive for longer term retention, and alleviating some pressure to sell. Moreover, Mutuum Finance’s smart contract auditing by Certik is underway, and results will be released on official social media channels. When projects publish a transparency report, it boosts their credibility in an unvetted project market. Strategic Divergence In A Chaotic Market And while SHIB struggles with unpredictable whale movements and product updates, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a mathematically workable trajectory. Its presale structure ensures price increases over time, and each phase creates more pressure on investors. With the imminent phase five entry price around 20% higher than the current $0.025, a currently finite window exists to maximize gains. There are only 6 presale stages left, which means the opportunity to get the best available price is closing fast! Unlike SHIB, which is dependent on the rest of the market to recover, MUTM’s tokenomics hard-bake growth into its utility. The lending protocols on the platform bring in recurring revenue, tying the demand for the token directly to user activity. This self-sustaining model makes MUTM a hedge against the infamous volatility of the crypto market. Last Chance for Early Access While Shiba Inu’s destiny teeters on technical breakouts and speculative burns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) serves real world milestones. When phase five opens, the pricing of $0.025 that was available in phase four disappears, thereby securing immediate gains for those already involved. Price targets of $3.50 post-launch validated by the project’s revenue-sharing framework suggest the possibility of stratospheric gains for those getting in late. As the completion of the Certik audit approaches and the leaderboard rewards you for holding, MUTM’s presale is an exceptional mix of clarity and progress. Time is running out for investors seeking April 2025’s top performer. SHIB is in recovery mode, but MUTM lays the groundwork for future dominance. Phase five is just around the corner—grab your tokens now before the next price jump!

The move came shortly after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China, which now faces a 145% tariff. This development injected optimism into global markets, triggering a broad recovery across risk assets — with ETH among the top beneficiaries. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy Over 80 Million DOGE In 24 Hours – Sign Of Recovery​? Despite the relief rally, Ethereum still trades below critical technical levels, and the broader price structure suggests ongoing consolidation rather than a confirmed reversal. Analysts remain cautious, as the asset’s inability to reclaim the $1,800–$2,000 range keeps the long-term trend in question. However, on-chain data from CryptoQuant adds an intriguing layer to the current outlook. Ethereum’s price is still trading below its realized price — the average price at which all ETH in circulation last moved. Historically, this scenario has represented a high-probability accumulation zone, often appearing once per cycle. According to some analysts, this could present a rare buying opportunity for contrarian investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility and macro uncertainty. As Ethereum continues to consolidate, all eyes are on whether bulls can build on this momentum. Ethereum Faces Critical Test Amid Volatility And Trade Tensions Ethereum is at a pivotal point after enduring weeks of relentless selling pressure and extreme volatility. The broader market has been shaken by macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating global trade tensions, with US tariffs under Trump’s administration continuing to rattle investor confidence. The crypto market, particularly altcoins like Ethereum, has taken the brunt of this instability. ETH has lost over 60% of its value since late December, raising fears of a prolonged bear market. However, a shift may be unfolding. Bulls are beginning to reappear, with Ethereum bouncing and setting a strong support above $1,400. This recovery follows aggressive price swings not only in crypto but also in global equities, which have seen significant rebounds following the announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China. Still, Ethereum remains below crucial resistance levels, especially the $2,000 mark — a level that represents more than just a psychological barrier. According to top analyst Quinten Francois, ETH is currently trading under its realized price, which averages the cost basis of all coins in circulation. Historically, such conditions have presented rare buying opportunities. Francois suggests this might be a once-in-a-cycle — or even once-in-a-lifetime — chance for long-term investors to accumulate ETH at undervalued levels. The coming days will determine whether bulls can reclaim key resistance and shift sentiment toward a sustained recovery.

Price Action Details: Key Levels To Reclaim Ethereum is currently trading at $1,650 after failing to break above the $1,700 level, a psychological and technical barrier that continues to cap bullish momentum. Despite a sharp rebound earlier in the week, ETH remains stuck in a consolidation range and is struggling to find direction amid broader market uncertainty. For bulls to regain control and initiate a stronger recovery, Ethereum must push above the $1,850 mark — a level aligned with the 4-hour 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA). These indicators have acted as short-term resistance since ETH fell below the $2,000 mark in February and reclaiming them is critical for confirming a shift in trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Show Conviction: 63% Of Supply Hasn’t Moved In A Year However, if Ethereum fails to break above $1,750 in the coming days, downside risk increases significantly. A rejection at current levels could trigger another wave of selling, potentially sending the price below the $1,500 support zone. This would put further pressure on bulls and undermine recent gains.

43280907,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709479,1744530226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43280907.jpeg,UK Finance Minister calls for ‘ambitious new relationship’ with EU while navigating US tariffs impact,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-calls-for-ambitious-new-relationship/,"The UK finance minister, Rachel Reeves, has called for an “ambitious new relationship” with the European Union, signaling a renewed push for deeper economic cooperation with Britain’s largest trading partner, even as tensions rise due to newly imposed US tariffs. According to Reuters, Reeves expressed her desire to forge a bold reset in relations with the European Union. She emphasized the need for the United Kingdom to rebuild trust with European partners after the Chanartic uncertainty of Brexit. Reeves to champion global trade reform and stronger EU ties at upcoming IMF summit In a separate piece published by The Observer on Saturday, Reeves also warned that tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump will likely have a “profound” impact on both the UK and the global economy. Reeves acknowledges the challenges ahead and is “under no illusion about the difficulties that lie ahead.” She emphasizes Labour’s global outlook: “The Labour Party is an internationalist party. We understand the benefits of free and fair trade and collaboration. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world.” Reeve’s message marks a departure from past Conservative policies that shied away from EU ties. Trade barriers that have harmed British exporters and created logistical difficulties to trade would be removed under Reeves’ plan. She also wants smoother arrangements for services and professional standards across borders. At the International Monetary Fund meeting later this month, Reeves hopes to advocate a “more balanced global economic and trading system.” This is on the heels of an uptick in the UK economy, which, amid the uncertainty, saw its strongest growth in 11 months in February — beating economists’ estimates and giving a small buffer ahead of the anticipated effects of U.S. tariffs. Reeves rallies support for UK exporters as Trump tariffs threaten global trade stability The UK government has published new financial support for exporters in response to new US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. There will also be a £20 billion windfall in export financing to support businesses dealing with rising costs and supply chain issues created by the tariffs. That raises the lending capacity of the UK Export Finance Agency to £80 billion. Reeves warns the tariffs could have a “devastating” effect across the UK economy and beyond. She said Britain needed to stand alongside its businesses as the changing global landscape confronted them. Experts have also warned that these tariffs could hit developing countries the hardest. Pamela Coke-Hamilton, the director of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said such moves could be “catastrophic” — worse than recent cuts in foreign aid. Reeves pushes for balanced global trade Reeves remains engaged despite the trade tensions, reaffirming that the UK is still actively negotiating a trade deal with the United States. Reeves thinks the two countries can still come to a common understanding of fair trade rules, particularly in green energy and digital services. But she insisted that any deal must work for British workers and protect public services. With Britain’s economy showing stronger-than-expected growth in February — its best in nearly a year — Reeves has gained some breathing room. Still, uncertainty looms. The Labour government appears focused on rebuilding alliances, supporting domestic industries, and keeping Britain engaged worldwide. As the IMF meeting draws near, much attention will be paid to Reeves at home and abroad, especially how she steers the UK’s position in a storm-tossed global industry.

Ripple litigation. The conversation began when user JD asked Rispoli, “@freddyriz so since the SEC hasn’t filed anything with the appellate court yet, what happens on 4/16?” Rispoli responded by pointing to April 16 as the due date for Ripple’s appellate brief. He shared two potential outcomes based on current circumstances. According to Rispoli, something is expected to occur on or before April 16. He noted that Ripple could not request an extension for this filing. In his view, there are two possible outcomes: either Ripple files the appellate brief, which he estimated has a ten percent likelihood, or there will be a notice of settlement or withdrawal of the appeal, which he assessed as having a ninety percent likelihood. His prediction indicates that a resolution would be reached without further appellate litigation, although no official action has yet been confirmed. On SEC v. Ripple, expect to see something happen on or before next Wednesday, 4/16, the due date for @ripple 's appellate brief. Ripple cannot get an extension and either has to file it (10%) or there will be a notice of settlement/withdrawal (90%). https://t.co/j9z0CpTBQo — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) April 9, 2025 Rispoli Clarifies the Nature of the “Agreement” Following Rispoli’s reply, another user identified as Scott commented , “Thought they agreed to withdraw appeals.” Rispoli clarified this point in a follow-up response. He explained that there had been an agreement “in the sense that” Ripple executives made a public statement about it , but emphasized that this was not accompanied by any official public communication from the SEC. Rispoli added that the agreement had likely involved “non-public, written assurances from the SEC,” but clarified that no official legal filing had yet been made to give effect to the public announcement. He stated that the SEC, in keeping with its protocol, had made no public declaration of the withdrawal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SEC Has Not Issued Public Confirmation Rispoli emphasized that, despite Ripple executives indicating a resolution had been reached, the SEC has not formally confirmed this through the appropriate legal channels. According to him, this is consistent with the SEC’s standard practice of remaining silent until official filings are made. As of now, no such filing exists in the appellate docket. Until a notice of settlement or withdrawal is publicly recorded by the court, the appellate process technically remains active. Speculation Over Political Timing Another user then speculated that the delay may be strategic, suggesting that “Instinct tells me that they are waiting for Paul Atkins to be confirmed, why let a great day 1 PR opportunity go to waste.” While Rispoli did not reply directly to that particular comment, the implication is that some observers believe political or public relations timing could be a factor in the official announcement or legal filings associated with the withdrawal of the appeal. The dialogue between users and Rispoli reflects a high level of attention paid to the procedural details of the SEC v. Ripple case, particularly the timeline of events surrounding the appellate process. Rispoli’s assessment, which strongly favors a conclusion to the appeal process in either a settlement or withdrawal, rests in part on the absence of SEC filings and the impending filing deadline for Ripple. At the time of the tweet, no formal withdrawal or settlement filing had been submitted to the court. All attention is now focused on April 16, the date by which Ripple is either required to submit its appellate brief or otherwise make public through legal channels that the matter has been resolved outside of court.

Trump’s administration announced a sweeping exemption for smartphones, chips, storage devices, modems, semiconductors, and other critical tech components from the reciprocal tariffs that had previously shaken markets. Crypto Markets Cheer Policy Reversal The 90-day pause, confirmed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, also reduces the tariff rate to 10% for countries that haven’t retaliated against U.S. goods, signaling a softening of the administration’s stance amid ongoing trade tensions. This shift has sent ripples through financial markets, particularly benefiting large-cap tech companies and triggering renewed interest in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. “The tech industry just got a shot in the arm,” noted The Kobeissi Letter in an April 12 post on X. “Large-cap technology companies will ultimately come out ahead when this is all said and done.” Bitcoin broke past the $85,000 mark on the same day—rising 9% in response to the tariff pause. Tech Stocks and Crypto Rebound Together Historically, crypto markets have followed the lead of high-growth tech equities. With the tariff freeze alleviating pressure on tech stocks, the crypto rally may be more than just a knee-jerk reaction. Some market analysts suggest this could be the beginning of a broader bullish trend for both sectors, as investor appetite for risk rebounds. Raoul Pal, a prominent macro trader, interpreted the move as part of Trump’s broader negotiation playbook. “This is classic posturing,” he remarked, viewing the tariff measures not as long-term economic policy, but as leverage in a bid to secure a favorable trade deal with China. Still, not everyone sees the glass as half full. Bitcoin evangelist Max Keiser cautioned that the tariff rollback does little to stem broader economic concerns , particularly around U.S. debt. “This doesn’t reverse the direction of rising bond yields,” Keiser warned, citing continued erosion of confidence in U.S. bonds and the dollar. Indeed, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Bonds spiked to around 4.5% on April 11—an indicator that investors remain wary of deeper systemic risks.

According to his statement , there is a growing risk to those who continue to leave their tokens on trading platforms, as exchange reserves of XRP are depleting despite the absence of either retail or institutional FOMO activity. Remi emphasized that the current low supply of XRP across major exchanges is not a sign of increased trading demand but rather a structural vulnerability that could have serious consequences in a market rally. He claims that the lack of XRP availability presents a significant issue for holders whose assets remain on exchanges. However, he views the situation as a major opportunity for those who have already moved their XRP into personal wallets, especially cold storage, due to the likely price increase that results from heightened demand against shrinking available supply. Referencing a past quote from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Remi pointed to the economic principle of high demand and low supply driving up prices. Concerns Over Lending Practices and Exchange Liquidity The crypto commentator also raised specific concerns about lending practices carried out by centralized platforms. He asserted that many exchanges lend a single unit of XRP to multiple users simultaneously—estimating that one token might be loaned to four or five different account holders at the same time. While not citing an exact figure, he warned that such over-leveraging creates a potential collapse scenario, especially if multiple users attempt to withdraw their XRP during a market spike. In such an event, Remi believes the exchanges will be unable to fulfill all withdrawal requests. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He explained that when platforms face these kinds of liquidity crises, their common response is to freeze accounts and delay access under various pretexts. According to Remi, exchanges may cite issues with Know Your Customer (KYC) documentation, bank delays, or other identity verification problems, requiring users to submit personal information that could take weeks—or even months—to process. During that time, the market may experience rapid upward movement, leaving affected users unable to participate in the bull run. Risks of Platform Insolvency and the Need for Self-Custody He warned that in worst-case scenarios, if an exchange is insolvent or collapses entirely, users could lose their funds. To avoid these risks, Remi reiterated his recommendation to keep assets on exchanges intended for short-term selling. All long-term holdings, he argued, should be moved to private wallets. Recommended Wallets and Additional Guidance Responding to questions from his followers about safe storage solutions, Remi named three cold wallet options he uses: Ledger, Trezor, and Tangem. Of the three, he identified Tangem as the most user-friendly, citing its ability to support assets like XDC and HBAR without requiring third-party applications. He also recommended two YouTubers, Crypto Scrilla and Crypto Dad, as reliable sources for wallet tutorials and setup instructions. X Remi Relief X’s warning adds to a broader conversation around self-custody and crypto exchange reliability. His post underscores the ongoing tension between convenience and control in the digital asset market and reflects mounting concern over potential liquidity challenges in the next phase of crypto price acceleration.

Bitcoiners Saw the Writing on the Wall In an April 12 post on X, Pompliano remarked that Bitcoin investors were the first significant group to notice discrepancies in U.S. economic indicators. “Bitcoiners were the first large-scale group to recognize the economic data was wrong, and they figured out a way to financially capture upside if they were right,” he wrote. Pompliano’s skepticism centers around key indicators such as inflation rates, employment figures, and GDP growth. He suggests these metrics are unreliable, especially in the context of economic measures like tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump’s administration. A Growing Doubt Among Officials and Experts Pompliano highlighted a March 20 interview with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the All-In podcast. When asked if he trusted the current economic data, Bessent plainly replied, “no.” This, Pompliano said, is a pivotal moment: “Even the Treasury Secretary has now publicly acknowledged he doesn’t believe the data. He says we must listen to the people rather than blindly follow the government data reports.” Concerns over the reliability of official data are not new. A report from July 2024 raised questions about whether traditional statistical methods can still deliver trustworthy information, pushing for new methodologies. Tariffs, Uncertainty, and Bitcoin’s Resilience The economic climate has been especially turbulent amid the ongoing tariff policies initiated by Trump. While some Wall Street analysts predicted the tariffs would strengthen the U.S. dollar, recent performance suggests otherwise. The dollar index has fallen 3.19% over the past five days, currently standing at 99.783. Since the start of 2025, it’s down 8.06%. Jeff Parks, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, offered a bold prediction on April 9: “There is a higher chance Bitcoin survives over the dollar in our lifetime after today.” Pompliano doubled down on the sentiment, saying, “The mainstream finance conversation has become an intellectual boondoggle where most people regurgitate ill-informed takes based on bad data.” Bitcoin Diverges From Traditional Markets Interestingly, while U.S. equity markets slumped on April 4 amid escalating tariff tensions, Bitcoin performed with unexpected strength. It held firm above $82,000 and even climbed to $84,720 while stocks were crashing—defying the typical correlation. Analysts have long observed that cryptocurrencies tend to be more volatile during macroeconomic stress. Yet in this case, Bitcoin’s stability while traditional assets faltered has reinforced the narrative of it being a hedge against systemic risk. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes described this current phase as potentially “up only mode,” attributing it to worsening conditions in the U.S. bond market.

This comes as a result of a sudden shift following Trump’s recently implemented 90-day tariff pause. The tweet showed that more new BTC wallets have been created in the past couple of days than at any point since February 20th. Many are taking this as a sign of the crypto market staging a comeback—making the search to find the best crypto to buy now more important than ever. What Does the Resurgence of Whales and Sharks Mean for the Cryptocurrency Market? The indicator that Santiment has leveraged is known as Supply Distribution, which provides insight into the group a particular number of wallets belongs to. There are 10 groups in total, including investors holding anywhere between 1 to 10 tokens. Investors exceeding this limit are considered whales—especially since the cutoff range, based on the current exchange rate, is approximately $821,000. Only whales and sharks would qualify at that level. In the above graph, it's clearly shown that there has been a rebound in Bitcoin’s Supply Distribution for the 10+ coins range. The purple line shows an effective bounce, indicating that whales and sharks have made a comeback. A small reaction to this can already be seen in the price charts. The BTC price recently climbed above $83K, and it appears poised to flip its $84K resistance. Beyond that, the world’s largest crypto could push higher to breach the next critical resistance at $96K. As market confidence in Bitcoin builds, altcoins could start gaining traction. However, since volatility continues to persist, the best crypto to buy now would likely be found among the crypto ICOs. Best Crypto to Buy Now Among Crypto ICOs Santiment's report of sharks and whales returning may have given bulls a confidence boost, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Bitcoin has reached its bottom. Donald Trump’s words have proven to have a deep impact on the market, and since the socio-political ecosystem is currently in turmoil—considering the Israel-Palestine conflict and the recent tariff wars—crypto ICOs are emerging as better options to invest in. Best Wallet Token Powering a decentralized cryptocurrency wallet of the same name, Best Wallet Token is a utility crypto that enhances the wallet’s overall functionality. These functionalities include storing, swapping, buying, and selling crypto—as well as advanced features typically found only on centralized exchanges, such as token launchpads and staking. The token launchpad perk of Best Wallet is especially noteworthy, as it allows BEST token holders to invest in crypto ICOs before they go public. In the current economy, this kind of zero-stage investing is highly advantageous. Smart investors may also view Best Wallet Token as a strong pick, as it powers a decentralized ecosystem that evolves based on community voting. Upcoming features like portfolio management and market insights are already in the pipeline, giving Best Wallet Token massive long-term upside potential. YouTubers like 99Bitcoins have stated that because the token is part of an already-running project, it could have an “insane launch.” SUBBD SUBBD is another strong pick for those looking for long-term utility tokens, as this project addresses the shortcomings of the standard, centralized content creation economy. It has been included in this list since the arrival of sharks and bulls could bolster renewed interest in cryptocurrencies that offer more than just speculative value. Aiming to penetrate an $85 billion industry, SUBBD is a Web3 content creation platform equipped with AI-driven tools that not only help creators earn more but also enable fans to engage with the creator economy in more meaningful ways. Creators will be able to leverage AI-driven administrative tools to handle everything—from fulfilling custom requests to generating AI-powered content. Being paid in crypto gives them instantaneous access to revenue. Fans of the platform will gain exclusive perks by holding SUBBD tokens. The ecosystem also includes several gamified elements, such as XP multipliers and credits. Staking rewards are available too, offering exclusive access to certain features. SUBBD has also been designed with security in mind, with a strong emphasis on content shareability without risking leaks. With such key shortfalls being addressed, it's no surprise SUBBD has already raised close to $200K. And since it’s targeting a thriving, well-established industry, it could become one of the leading crypto assets to invest in for 2025. BTC Bull The arrival of more Bitcoin accumulators means bulls are gaining ground. But being bullish in the cryptocurrency community isn’t limited to those who’ve bought Bitcoin—it also includes those who still believe in it and rally for its success. These low-cap investors may not have the power to invest in Bitcoin just yet, but they believe in the decentralized financial future it could create. BTC Bull is a project designed to reward these bulls. It is both a meme coin initiative and a social movement that tracks Bitcoin’s growth to unlock token burns and Bitcoin airdrops. The campaign will begin when Bitcoin hits $125K and continue until it reaches $250K. Since many analysts—such as Arthur Hayes and Charles Hoskinson—have predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250K by the end of this year or the beginning of next, BTC Bull could activate its perks within that timeframe. While nothing is certain, this gives BTC Bull a speculative power-up, which could be leveraged for short-term gains. And if the community around the project continues to grow, long-term potential is also on the table. And the community is getting stronger already—BTC Bull’s X account has gained over 8K followers, and the project’s presale has raised upwards of $4.5 million to date. Solaxy Solana has experienced significant growth following the market's recovery. Now trading above the $120 level, it could push further upward if it manages to build on the current bullish divergence. Price action aside, Solana's technological development also plays a crucial role in its growth. However, as the ecosystem expands, scalability issues have begun to emerge. Network congestion has become increasingly common, affecting transaction speeds—and these challenges may persist in the coming days. Thankfully, L2 solution providers like Solaxy have stepped in. Embracing ZK rollups for off-chain transactions and integrating Hyperlane to enable a cross-chain bridge, Solaxy is a utility-focused project with a meme-esque appeal that has already raised over $30 million on the market. What makes this project stand out is its transparency—users receive regular updates about the tech developments happening behind the scenes, which is rarely the case with most meme coins. Furthermore, the project’s memetic flair is unique. It features intelligent, stylized mascots to highlight the perks users can enjoy by investing in the Solaxy ecosystem. Bulls and Sharks May Have Returned to Bitcoin, But Gains May Still Come From ICOs With Santiment’s latest report, all eyes are back on Bitcoin, and optimism is rising following Donald Trump’s 90-day tariff pause. However, recent market movements have highlighted just how dependent the cryptocurrency space is on community reaction—suggesting that investors may be better off focusing on crypto ICOs until Bitcoin finds stable ground. This article has highlighted some of the best cryptos to buy now. Each offers its own distinct advantage: SUBBD and Best Wallet Token focus on utility, Solaxy blends meme culture with utility, and BTC Bull is a meme coin riding the wave of current market speculation. A mix of these assets—and possibly a few more—could serve as a smart hedge against ongoing market uncertainty, while also helping to diversify a cryptocurrency portfolio.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-u-s-treasuries-to-control-liquidity-within-xrp-ecosystem-heres-how/,"Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has published a statement asserting that the U.S. Treasury is actively collaborating with Ripple to utilize the RLUSD stablecoin as part of a broader strategy to enhance the global footprint of the digital dollar. According to Aljarrah, this initiative also supports new demand for U.S. Treasuries. It’s a method to manage liquidity within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Turns out the U.S. Treasury has been working directly with @Ripple to use the #RLUSD stablecoin as a vehicle to expand the digital dollar’s global reach—while creating new demand for U.S. Treasuries to control liquidity within the #XRP ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/j1ZXGEKath — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) April 11, 2025 Aljarrah emphasized that this information is not derived from speculation but from his research and analytical interpretation. He clarified that the perspective is the result of years of observation, study, and critical thinking regarding the digital asset industry and the U.S. financial system’s evolving infrastructure. He further explained that since 2019, he has closely monitored developments involving both Ripple and Stellar and that his long-term research has consistently pointed toward an emerging alliance between Ripple and key U.S. government institutions. Aljarrah claimed that this analysis led him to conclude that the introduction of RLUSD is more than a technical innovation—it is a coordinated step toward digital dollar expansion through blockchain-based systems. Federal Support for Digitization Focusing on the U.S. Treasury Department’s role, Aljarrah noted that the department has openly shown interest in exploring the utility of digital assets, with stablecoins being central to their objectives. According to his interpretation, the primary goal remains to preserve and extend the global dominance of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. He asserted that stablecoins represent the most viable route for digitizing dollar-denominated liquidity in a way that maintains compliance and global scalability. In addition to the Treasury, Aljarrah brought attention to the Federal Reserve’s involvement, referencing the FedNow service and Ripple’s alleged partnership in developing this instant payment infrastructure. He claimed this relationship is verifiable for those willing to investigate publicly available information. The connection demonstrates a coordinated effort between federal institutions and Ripple to fast-track the digital transformation of monetary systems. RLUSD, Liquidity, and the Role of XRP Aljarrah identified RLUSD, a stablecoin issued on the XRP Ledger, as a critical instrument in resolving long-standing inefficiencies in global payments. He suggested that RLUSD functions as a digital dollar that integrates seamlessly with the liquidity mechanisms of the XRP Ledger, thereby enhancing cross-border value movement. In this framework, RLUSD enables broader access to U.S. dollar liquidity across global markets, which, in Aljarrah’s view, positions XRP as a central component in the financial system’s structural evolution. He concluded by stating that once an individual understands the mechanisms and incentives driving these developments, the role of XRP becomes self-evident. Aljarrah insisted that his insights are not based on unsupported assumptions but on coherent analysis rooted in public data and his investigative approach. He reaffirmed his commitment to independent thinking and said his role is to offer informed perspectives that others can consider in forming their conclusions.

The motion, filed on April 11 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, highlights ongoing discussions between both parties that could lead to changes in the scope or resolution of the case. “Since the Court stayed this case, the Parties have been in productive discussions, including discussions concerning how the efforts of the crypto task force may impact the SEC’s claims,” the filing stated. SEC Seeks More Time to Finalize Binance Case Resolution The SEC requested the extension to continue seeking internal approval for a possible resolution, and Binance agreed, citing the benefit to judicial efficiency. This marks the second time this year that both sides have jointly asked for a two-month extension. The prior pause was granted in February, shortly after SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his tough stance on crypto, resigned. Commissioner Mark Uyeda, considered more crypto-friendly, has since stepped in as acting chair. The formation of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force followed Gensler’s departure, with the group aiming to clarify regulatory guidance and better allocate enforcement resources. The SEC’s case against Binance began in June 2023 and includes 13 charges. These involve alleged unregistered sales of its BNB and BUSD tokens, the operation of investment products like Simple Earn and BNB Vault, and its staking program. Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, have denied the allegations. The latest filing comes as the SEC has recently withdrawn several high-profile enforcement actions, including cases against Coinbase , Kraken , Gemini , Robinhood , and ConsenSys, signaling a shift in regulatory tone under the new leadership. CZ Linked to DOJ Case Against Justin Sun in New WSJ Report Meanwhile, a separate controversy involving CZ has also resurfaced. On April 11, The Wall Street Journal reported that Zhao had allegedly agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of his plea deal with the Department of Justice. CZ dismissed the claim, posting on X: “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t. People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison.” WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn't. People who become gov witnesses don't go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me. https://t.co/xqpnBwvlmi — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) April 12, 2025 Zhao was sentenced in April 2024 to four months in prison for Anti-Money Laundering violations. He was released in September, maintaining his position as the wealthiest individual to ever serve a U.S. prison sentence, with a net worth of $60 billion at the time. Last week, a Nigerian court postponed a high-profile tax evasion case against Binance to April 30 after the crypto exchange challenged the legality behind how it was served court documents. Binance’s legal counsel, Chukwuka Ikwuazom, said the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) did not get court approval to serve documents outside Nigeria. He argued that the Feb. 11 order allowing substituted service was invalid. Binance is registered in the Cayman Islands and does not have a physical office in Nigeria.

In its analysis of Bitcoin's supply-demand balance, the company noted that the Long Term Realized Cap Impulse indicator has reached a historical support level. This indicator plays a critical role in understanding the behavior of long-term investors and their relationship with prices. According to Alphractal, when the indicator reaches this level, two possible scenarios can arise: Positive Reaction and Renewed Demand Growth: This could indicate that long-term investors continue to hold their positions and the market is on solid footing. Support Break and Sharp Declines: A break below the support level may mean that even the most resilient players in the market are selling and may increase selling pressure. The chart shared by Alphractal, monitoring the support levels in the Long Term Realized Cap Impulse metric. Related News: Prominent Analyst Makes Unbelievable Prediction For Bitcoin (BTC) Price In 2035 On Live Broadcast - ""It May Even Exceed This"" Alphractal stressed that the loss of this support could signal a significant change in market sentiment, but at the same time, maintaining this level could signal the beginning of a structured recovery process. In addition, the analysis noted that Bitcoin has been liquidating short positions over the last 3 to 7 days. This development could trigger a new wave of volatility in the market, as it could lead market makers to begin closing some of their positions. Alphractal's warning is clear: The behavior of long-term investors during this period could determine the direction of the Bitcoin market. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has moved from $75,000 to $86,000 over the past three days indicating a rising level of market demand. Despite this positive development, Cryptododo7 warns that the potential for a significant downside still exists. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Returning To $74,000? Analyst Identifies Pattern That Suggests So Bitcoin Completes Bearish Pennant Formation – Price Fall To Follow? In a recent post on X, Cryptododo7 shares a technical analysis of the BTC market showing the formation of a bearish pennant. Notably, this development follows a double top formation, a classic reversal signal that aligns with the downward price action observed over the past three months. While recent market gains point to a rising bullish momentum, Cryptododo7 states that the bearish pennant formation signals much potential for a deeper price correction. The bearish pennant forms after a strong downward price move i.e. flagpole as seen when Bitcoin dropped from $96,000 to $76,000 in late February. The pennant follows this price decline, which is just a short period of consolidation where price action forms a small symmetrical triangle. This pattern is usually marked by lower highs and higher lows bringing about two converging trendlines as seen over the last six weeks. Following this consolidation, the market price is expected to break below the lower trendline confirming the intention of a price fall. According to Cryptododo7’s post, the lower boundary of the bearish pennant is positioned around $74,000. A decisive close below this level would validate the bearish pattern and signal a likely continuation of the downtrend, with a projected price target of $51,400. Cryptododo7 explains that $51,400 represents Bitcoin’s strongest support level as it aligns with the 200-week moving average. Amidst the current price rally, the analyst states that a retest to this support level is largely reasonable, especially considering ongoing macroeconomic developments.

This development aligns with Cryptododo7’s bearish warning as a large volume of traders still hold a negative market outlook amidst recent gains. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $85,416 following a 2.50% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 40.07% and valued at $25.10 billion.

For years, Donald Trump and his family have leveraged their name for business ventures that cross industries, from hotels to golf courses to licensing deals with everything from apparel to bottled water. The Trump family has entered the digital currencies and blockchain world U.S. President Donald Trump, his wife, Melania, and their children are now deeply involved in almost every aspect of the crypto world. They are interested in NFTs, meme coins, Bitcoin mining, stablecoins, and decentralized finance platforms. But what does this Trump family expansion portend for the future of crypto, the Trump legacy, and the fine balance between government and the fast-moving digital economy? The Trump family crypto portfolio is already worth an estimated $1 billion, according to a Bloomberg analysis based on data from public records. Such gains come despite recent volatility driven by global market strains and U.S. trade tensions. Remember, Donald Trump once called Bitcoin a threat to the U.S. dollar. In 2021, he argued digital assets should be “heavily regulated.” Fast-forward to his 2024 campaign trail, and suddenly, he’s accepting crypto donations, praising blockchain innovation, and laying the groundwork for pro-crypto executive orders. Is this a genuine change of heart? Or is it a calculated play to align with an industry pouring billions into campaign coffers and political influence? Let’s say, either way, it’s a pivot that speaks volumes about the current administration’s attitude toward regulation — or rather, its lack of a clear regulatory approach. Trump and his family appeared determined to establish a large footprint in the crypto sector ahead of new regulations hitting the market, said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University who has studied the digital economy. The Trump crypto boom is powered by NFTs, DeFi, and meme coins Trump’s digital narrative began with non-fungible tokens. In December 2022, he announced a series of NFT trading cards depicting digitally illustrated images of him — as an astronaut, cowboy, superhero, and more. The NFTs were minted with the help of his longtime associate Bill Zanker, founder of The Learning Annex. These collectible tokens skyrocketed in popularity, seeing numerous collections sell out. Trump even held private dinners for elite buyers. According to federal financial disclosures, the NFT sales brought in millions in revenue. Capitalizing on that success, the Trump family founded World Liberty Financial in September 2024. Some of its services include token swaps, peer-to-peer lending, asset staking, etc. It has since raised more than $550 million through two token sales. According to offering documents , a company affiliated with Trump receives 75% of net revenue as a fee, including token sales proceeds. The Trump family business, DT Marks DeFi LLC, owns a 60% equity interest in World Liberty. His sons, Donald Jr., Eric, and Barron, also appear as “Web3 Advisors” on the project’s website, and their involvement is frequently highlighted on social media. Source: Bloomberg Then came the meme coins. The day before Trump’s inauguration, he and his wife, Melania, launched their own crypto assets. These highly speculative cryptocurrencies soared in value initially, garnering over $11.4 million in transaction fees in the first month alone. But the hype quickly faded. Prices plummeted, and some within the crypto community accused the Trump team of draining legitimacy from blockchain innovation by embracing meme culture and pump-and-dump strategies. The two firms affiliated with the president — CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC — continue to hold 80% of the token supply. That will be gradually released over three years. Stablecoin, Bitcoin mining, and ETFs signal long-term play Just as NFTs and meme coins cleared headlines, the Trump family is switching gears to focus on the more essential underpinnings of the crypto economy. On March 25, World Liberty Financial revealed that it will launch its stablecoin — USD1 . The token will be pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar and backed one-to-one with short-term U.S. Treasury bills, bank deposits, and cash equivalents. The Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks, among the world’s most widely used blockchains, will issue USD1. The Trump family believes stablecoins will help fuel faster, cheaper global payments. The launch comes at a significant time. It was unclear whether the Trump administration wanted to adopt such legislation. Still, it was not attached to the bill that passed the U.S. House Financial Services Committee last week with bipartisan support and was publicly supported by the Trump administration. This alignment, analysts say, reflects the family’s strategic management of the timing of business moves with the evolution of regulators. On March 31, the family also announced a Bitcoin mining venture with Hut 8 Corp., a publicly traded mining company. The move follows a wider campaign to have the U.S. assume global leadership in producing Bitcoin — a priority that Trump showed keen interest in during meetings with mining executives when campaigning in 2024. Bitcoin miners were early supporters of Trump’s reelection campaign. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, said his recent effort in the mining sector was the president’s means of rewarding their loyalty and cashing in on a multibillion-dollar business. Finally, in February of 2025, Trump Media & Technology Group filed new trademarks suggesting he planned to enter the exchange-traded fund (ETF) space. A proposed ETF, “Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus,” would follow assets linked with Bitcoin that match Trump’s economic and political beliefs. Stablecoins, Bitcoin mining, and ETF filings suggest the Trump family isn’t longer chasing headlines. They’re laying the foundation for a long-term crypto empire that aligns with Trump’s economic ideology and his vision of American dominance in digital infrastructure. Whether you believe the Trump family are crypto pioneers or opportunistic capitalists, one thing is clear: their grip on the narrative — and potentially the future of U.S. crypto policy — is only tightening.",OP-ED|BTC|USD|usd1|WLFI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-13 09:01:15

The dramatic pivot comes as part of a sweeping efficiency mandate from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the controversial new initiative spearheaded by none other than Elon Musk, the platform’s owner. Social Security to Ditch Letters, Embrace X as Primary Outlet WIRED first reported the transition, citing anonymous sources who revealed that traditional methods of communication—like mailed letters and official press releases—will be phased out entirely. Instead, Americans will need to follow Social Security updates via social media. This decision accompanies a sizable workforce reduction at the agency, shrinking its personnel from 57,000 to just 50,000 in an effort to reduce redundancy and modernize operations. In a February 2025 statement , the Social Security confirmed that it would collapse its outdated 10-region model down to just four, calling the former structure “no longer sustainable.” The changes are part of a wider governmental shake-up championed by DOGE, an unofficial but increasingly powerful entity in Washington’s fiscal playbook. While not an officially sanctioned federal agency, DOGE has been given extraordinary leeway to investigate wasteful spending across multiple branches of government. Musk’s Efficiency Drive Targets SSA, IRS, and SEC Elon Musk hasn’t held back in his criticism of the Social Security system, accusing it of doling out billions in erroneous payments—a claim backed by the White House. That rhetoric, paired with drastic staffing and communication reforms, has many questioning the future of America’s most relied-upon retirement safety net. DOGE’s influence is rapidly expanding. In March, the agency reportedly gained access to internal systems within the SEC , including confidential data repositories. SEC leadership confirmed their cooperation and pledged transparency. Not stopping there, DOGE is now proposing a 20% reduction in the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) workforce—roughly 6,800 jobs—set to take effect just a month after Tax Day, on May 15. Critics warn that such cuts could jeopardize tax enforcement and public trust. But perhaps the most disruptive idea floated by Musk’s DOGE unit is the integration of blockchain technology into federal budgeting .

Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool’s price reach $50?

Rocket Pool price analysis 1-day chart RPL/USD 1-Day price chart , Source: TradingView Based on the 1-day chart on April 13, Rocket Pool (RPL) remains under firm bearish pressure. The price has declined sharply to $3.77, nearing the lower Bollinger Band support at $2.99, a signal of possible oversold conditions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32.06, hovering just above the oversold zone, indicating sellers have dominated but momentum may be slowing. Despite brief recoveries, RPL has consistently failed to reclaim the mid-Bollinger Band level around $4.24. A further drop below $3.50 could open the door to new lows, while recovery efforts must overcome $4.24 to signal any reversal or short-term bullish momentum. RPL/USD 4-hour price chart analysis RPL/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Rocket Pool (RPL) remains in a prolonged downtrend, with current price action at $3.77 facing strong resistance near the middle Bollinger Band ($3.80) and upper range ($4.00). The MACD histogram is flat with marginal positive divergence, indicating weak bullish momentum, while the Balance of Power sits near equilibrium, showing no clear dominance by bulls or bears. Volatility is compressed, suggesting a breakout may be imminent. Short-term upside is possible if the price breaks above $4.00 with volume. However, failure to do so may confirm continued weakness and expose RPL to a decline toward $3.50.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, RPL navigates a critical juncture after a prolonged downtrend. On the 1-day chart, the asset is trading below the middle Bollinger Band, with the RSI at 32.06, reflecting weak momentum and proximity to oversold territory. The 4-hour chart echoes a similar trend, with prices attempting to consolidate near the lower Bollinger Band, and the MACD hovering at a neutral line with no strong crossover. Balance of Power is mildly negative, suggesting sellers retain control. Unless RPL reclaims the $4.00 level, the downside remains open, possibly extending toward $3.50 in the short term. Is Rocket Pool a good investment? Rocket Pool (RPL) presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its innovative decentralized Ethereum staking model, offering potentially high returns through staking rewards. However, investors should consider market volatility and competition within the DeFi space. Conduct thorough research and assess personal risk tolerance before investing in RPL. Will Rocket Pool reach $50? Rocket Pool (RPL) reaching $50 appears possible but is uncertain. Predictions suggest a range of $52.90 to $73.78 for 2031—- if market conditions are favorable and investor sentiment improves. However, significant upward momentum is required to achieve this target soon Will Rocket Pool reach $150? Reaching $150 for Rocket Pool (RPL) seems highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Our Rocket pool forecast suggests that RPL may peak at around $42 by 2031. Is Rocket Pool a safe investment? Rocket Pool is generally considered a secure investment due to its decentralized structure, robust security audits, and significant total value locked (over $4.4 billion), reflecting user confidence. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries inherent risks due to market volatility and potential technical vulnerabilities Does RPL have a good long-term future? RPL’s chart shows an immediate outlook that appears bearish. However, assessing its long-term future requires considering broader market trends.

In a new discussion on CNBC, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that the big trends like artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and other cutting edge technology plays are still valid. However, Fink says that some of those plays may be delayed or changed slightly due to President Trump’s tariffs and the likelihood of a recession. “I do believe that the mega trends are still with us, whether it’s AI, data centers, infrastructure, the whole reorientation of our economy. So I think the mega force trends are not going to change by what has happened. But maybe the execution of some of these trends may be delayed or may be pushed out longer, but I still remain to be optimistic over the long run. Yes, we have to recalibrate, [and] I do believe we’re probably starting, or if not, in a recession. Yes, I think the market is still underestimating how high inflation can get, as you factor in all the tariffs, you factor in all these other issues, it’s going to be quite additive. I read in a report that if you just take the tariffs in the cost of home building, the average new home could be up as much as 26%. We already have a housing affordability problem… This is not a pandemic, this is not a financial crisis, this is something that we’ve created… The United States in post-World War II was a global stabilizer.

Among potential gainers, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are getting noticed. DOGE and SHIB may have their highs and lows, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in a league of its own with its presale which has already raised $6.6 million and gained 8,200+ holders. MUTM is still in Phase 4 of its presale, priced at just $0.025, but will jump 20% in price to $0.03 for Phase 5 and analysts are expecting a huge pump post launch beyond $3.50. The Asent Path of Dogecoin Dogecoin, for its part, has jumped 10% in the last 24 hours following speculation of a potential exchange-traded product (ETP) from 21Shares. Master Kenobi and other analysts believe DOGE may challenge its 2021 high around $0.73, potentially aiming for $1. Yet hurdles persist. The number of transactions has dropped 94% per month, indicative of declining activity on the network. This showed that whales wallets deposited as much as 1.3 billion DOGE in sell pressure recently. Further complicating its trajectory is instability in the broader market, driven by macroeconomic tensions. And while short-term gains could be made, Dogecoin’s lack of utility at all compared with its utility makes its long term potential questionable. The Shiba Inu’s Recovery While Shiba Inu is also stuck on bullish signals and bearish realities. Analyst Javon Marks discovered a hidden divergence pattern that suggest a 550% rally toward $0.000155, reminiscent of its breakout in 2021. On the fourth-hour time frame, SHIB is setting up for higher lows against $0.0000124 resistance, which indicates upward momentum if price-activity breaks the ceiling into an upperbound zone. This view is supported by technical indicators like the MACD flipping green. The wider meme coin sector has lost $8 billion in market cap over 30 days, suggesting waning speculative interest. Without continued demand, Shiba Inu’s rise could falter, potentially leaving investors vulnerable to abrupt reversals. Mutuum Finance’s Rise As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu face turbulence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charting its own course. The presale’s Phase 4, which is priced at $0.025, raised $6.6 million with 400 million tokens sold. Then the upcoming Phase 5 will raise prices to $0.03 — a 20% gain for current buyers. Fundamentals remain strong post-launch, with the exchange debut of MUTM sitting at $0.06 for a 140% return, but the projections are even higher: a push to $3.50 would see investors sitting on a 13,900% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enhances real-world DeFi utility with decentralized lending, enabling users to either borrow against overcollateralized assets or earn through liquidity pools. A buy and distribute mechanism takes revenue off the platform and uses it for token buy backs to be sent to stakers, maintaining demand. Recently, the team released a dashboard that tracks top 50 holders and rewards them with bonus tokens for maintaining their position — a method that fosters long-term holding. Security continues to be a priority as well, with a Certik audit of Mutuum Finance’s smart contracts in the final stages of completion. Official channels will publicly share results to ensure transparency. Seizing the Moment While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu react pandemonically to market sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives a logical entry at the start of 2025. Its turbocharged presale, bringing immediate returns at each stage, is a world away from meme coins’ volatility. The project’s scalable utility focus, alongside a $3.50 post-launch target, makes it the potential heir to XRP’s throne—all for less than $1. Phase 4 of the sale is proceeding fast, with slots disappearing as investors take up the price of $0.025 before the 20% bump. If you are looking for assets based on functionality rather than hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the way to go. Time is running out; get the tokens at this level while you can.

And it looks like the regulator has backed that position. The story began when the National Center for Public Policy, a McDonald's think tank and shareholder, sent a letter to the famous fast food chain's management urging them to invest in its first cryptocurrency. ”McDonald's is widely regarded - including by former CFO and President Harry Sonneborn - as a real estate company that happens to sell burgers,” said the National Center's proposal. ”Real estate has been a much more reliable store of value than cash and bonds, but it won't grow over time as much as bitcoin and doesn't have as much liquidity. As more companies add bitcoin to their balance sheets, if McDonald's doesn't follow suit, it will fall behind where it once led.” Bitcoin and corporations This isn't the first time shareholders have asked corporations to start acquiring bitcoin. Michael Saylor's technology company Strategy has made bitcoin hoarding a trend thanks to its constant purchase of the digital asset. The rising value of the cryptocurrency has significantly boosted the company's coffers. Recently, video game retailer GameStop said it raised $1.5 billion to buy bitcoin. In contrast, Microsoft shareholders voted against such a move last December. Companies' interest in acquiring bitcoin intensified after Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election last November, which helped push the price of BTC to an all-time high. SEC Takes Sides After receiving a proposal to acquire bitcoin, McDonald's legal representatives sent a letter to the SEC under Paul Atkins' administration seeking confirmation that the regulator would not ”recommend any enforcement action” if the fast-food chain declined to publicly discuss the idea at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting in May. The SEC seemed to agree that McDonald's has the right to refuse to discuss the proposal at the annual meeting. ”There is some basis for your view that the company may exclude the proposal,” the agency responded in a March 28 letter. ”In our view, the proposal relates to the company's ordinary business operations. Accordingly, we will not recommend enforcement action to the commission if the company removes the proposal from its voting materials.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-13 09:30:17
33767162,[object Object],1744536620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Scottish School Lomond Pioneers Bitcoin Tuition Payment In The UK – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/scottish-school-lomond-pioneers-bitcoin-tuition-uk/,"The Lomond School in Scotland has become the first academic institution in the United Kingdom to accept tuition payments in Bitcoin (BTC) representing a major step in crypto mainstream adoption. Bitcoin Represents Independence And Innovation, Lomond Says In a recent blog post , Lomond School announced the inclusion of BTC as a payment option for tuition fees. The management of the British school explains that this decision was driven by multiple factors including Bitcoin’s alignment with independent thinking and innovation which are part of the school’s core ethos. Lomond describes Bitcoin as a decentralized asset with no central authority and is easily accessible and transferable, thus reflecting important principles such as democracy and inclusion. A statement by the school reads: … Bitcoin is available to anyone willing to learn—making it more democratic and inclusive, particularly for people in developing nations who lack access to traditional banking. Lomond sees Bitcoin as a perfect real-world case study in economics, computing, ethics, and innovation. The Scottish school further states that the adoption of BTC as a payment alternative is also driven by significant demand from local parents and international agents, showcasing the rising global acceptance of cryptocurrencies as viable financial assets. However, Lomond has stated the school will only deal with Bitcoin at the moment which has distinguished itself from other cryptocurrencies in terms of “security, scarcity, transparency and resilience.” Lomond: Bitcoin Treasury Is Feasible To assuage customer fears about blockchain security, Lomond has stated that these BTC payments will be received by regulated and KYC-compliant partners — Musket and CoinCorner, on behalf of the school. However, despite this crypto-friendly approach, Lomond has stated that all Bitcoin received will be immediately converted to the Great Britain Pounds (GBP) to avoid dealing with the crypto market volatility. Nevertheless, there is the possibility of establishing a BTC Treasury in the advent of significant support from the school community. Lomond says: The (Bitcoin) treasury is a phased goal, not an immediate change, and it depends entirely on community support and the school’s ability to responsibly “stack sats” over time. While Lomond may be the first British school to dabble into Bitcoin payments, academic institutions in other countries have long explored the use of the premier cryptocurrency. Some of these schools include Wharton College in the University of Pennsylvania , King’s College in New York, and major universities in El Salvador among others. Meanwhile, other academic institutions such as the University of Wyoming have developed ample resources to conduct peer-reviewed research on the “digital gold.” At the time of writing, BTC continues to trade at $83,230 after a 3.65% price gain in the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Education|Bitcoin payment|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Education|Lomond,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-13 09:30:20

Ethereum , XRP , and Bitcoin (BTC) remain widely regarded as the safest long-term options for 2025, holding steady through market cycles and offering proven adoption. But while they anchor most portfolios, a growing number of traders and analysts are watching a rapidly accelerating altcoin— MAGACOINFINANCE —that’s making waves for entirely different reasons. Alongside the large-cap focus, attention is growing around tokens like TON , Avalanche (AVAX) , and SUI , which are expanding across developer ecosystems and gaining institutional interest at scale. 2025’s BIGGEST PRESALE — JOIN BEFORE LISTING MAGACOINFINANCE – Analysts Say “This One’s Picking Up Fast” Momentum doesn’t lie, and MAGACOINFINANCE is proving it. After selling out Stage 6 , the project has now entered Stage 7 with a current price of $0.0002908 and a confirmed listing target of $0.007 —a clean 25x ROI for early movers. And it’s not just being discussed—it’s being tracked, charted, and bought. Crypto analysts and early-stage observers are noting the uptick in social traction, wallet activity, and market interest. Telegram groups are growing fast, presale dashboards show traffic surging, and token demand is increasing by the hour. The sentiment? It may not stay in presale territory much longer. 50% Token Bonus Still Available — MAGA50X The MAGA50X promotion is still live for Stage 7 participants. This limited-time offer delivers a 50% token bonus , but as demand rises, so does the urgency. This round is already nearing capacity. TON, AVAX, and SUI Expand Functional Use Cases TON is embedding crypto features into mainstream messaging platforms Avalanche (AVAX) continues to grow its multichain development ecosystem SUI delivers advanced performance tools for builders across sectors 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X Conclusion While Ethereum , XRP , and BTC remain foundational for any long-term crypto strategy, evolving players like TON , AVAX , and SUI provide the flexibility and innovation many investors seek. For those watching early-stage activity, MAGACOINFINANCE stands apart with its fast-moving momentum, growing community, and positioning as one of the strongest presale plays of the year.

According to recent data, these methods are especially expensive when reaching existing crypto wallets, ranking higher compared to other sectors in the crypto industry. According to the data, decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) advertisements are better and more cost-effective in terms of reaching existing users in the crypto sector compared to gaming and gambling campaigns. In a recent post on X, Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin replied to an article posted by the co-founder of Web3 marketing firm Addressable Asaf Nadler, who highlighted the figures behind such campaigns. “Gaming and gambling campaigns are the most expensive, with a median CPW of $8.74 and a lower quartile of $3.40,” Nadler said. CPW, or cost per wallet is a perfect metric for measurement because it tracks the cost of website visitors who already have a crypto wallet installed in their browser. Axie Infinity co-founder gives insight into the discussion According to Nadler’s post, he mentioned that the high cost-to-return ratio of crypto gaming and gambling might be down to the higher churn, speculative behavior, and intense competition. “If Web3 gaming is truly ‘inevitable,’ we need to find a more powerful UA engine to make it as sustainable as in Web2,” Nadler said. However, the Axie Infinity executive mentioned that the best periods to carry out experiments are the ones with a high CPW. Comparing the amount of money it takes to onboard users, he said, “Basically, the amount of money it costs to onboard someone into web3 increases during bear markets and decreases during bulls. This was the case for every single region tested, except for Southeast Asia. This is likely why we have a stable and consistent user base but our growth outside of our initial markets is pretty cyclical.” This is some interesting research.

This is likely why we have a stable… — Jihoz.ron 🍚 (@Jihoz_Axie) April 12, 2025 The Axie Infinity co-founder also revealed the best time to make an experiment in the market, noting that it is during a period of high CPW. “During times when cost per wallet acquisition is high, it’s a good time to experiment, create new games/product lines, consolidate our market share, and get ready for the next market expansion,” he added. Nadler highlights the difference between bull and bear markets Meanwhile, according to Nadler’s report, it is easier for campaigns in the CeFi and DeFi sectors to onboard new crypto users. “DeFi/CeFi campaigns are the most cost-efficient, with a median CPW of $2.79 and a lower quartile of just $0.10,” he said. The results are based on about 200 programmatic campaigns carried out on Addressable by more than 70 advertisers, who claimed to target about 9.5 million users globally. It tracks how CPW varies across different market cycles, campaign strategies, audience segments, and regions. According to Nadler, while premium markets experience low-cost conversions for existing crypto wallet holders during bull runs, it has always been increasingly difficult to attract their attention during bear markets. He mentioned that in 2024, the United States and Western Europe saw CPW rise by four times and 27 times, respectively, between the first quarter and third quarter. This happened as the market consolidated and interest from crypto holders started to drop. “While these markets provide scale and quality during bull runs, they become significantly more expensive when sentiment turns bearish, making them less sustainable during downturns,” he said. Meanwhile, markets classed under “emerging” countries like Latin America and Eastern Europe offer very low CPW in good conditions but can also experience extreme cost volatility.

Recently, Pi Network (PI) saw a significant dip in its price, falling 16.1% in the past week. As of April 10, 2025, Pi Network (PI) is valued at $0.5938, with fluctuations in its price continuing to intrigue investors and the community. However, despite these drops, a new player, Coldware (COLD) , is drawing attention for its innovative approach to crypto mining and decentralized finance, providing a glimmer of hope to mining enthusiasts and crypto investors alike. Coldware Brings Hope to Mining Enthusiasts While Pi Network (PI) faces these hurdles, Coldware (COLD) has recently emerged as a potential game-changer for mining enthusiasts. Unlike Pi Network (PI), Coldware combines its innovative mining features with a decentralized finance (DeFi) approach that is designed to be fully transparent, scalable, and sustainable. Coldware (COLD) has a fresh approach that promises to address some of the key pain points of traditional mining projects. It utilizes a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism that requires significantly less energy than traditional mining methods. Coldware (COLD) also emphasizes its mobile-first design, which allows users to easily engage with mining and DeFi activities through their smartphones. With the increasing interest in Coldware (COLD), particularly among mining enthusiasts, the project is seen as a viable alternative to other mining projects like Pi Network (PI). The Current State of Pi Network (PI) Since its inception, Pi Network (PI) has been one of the more unique projects in the cryptocurrency world. With the ability to mine coins directly from mobile devices, Pi Network (PI) attracted millions of users. This revolutionary approach to mining gave Pi Network an impressive user base, known as Pioneers, and sparked hopes of making crypto mining accessible to everyone. However, Pi Network (PI) has faced several challenges, most notably its price performance. Pi Network (PI) has remained relatively stagnant, hovering around $0.58, as market dynamics and regulatory concerns around the project have created uncertainty. Despite the optimism surrounding Pi Network (PI)'s large community and potential, it is still struggling to gain the kind of momentum that other cryptocurrencies have experienced. Challenges Facing Pi Network (PI) The most significant challenge for Pi Network (PI) remains its lack of transparency and the unclear status of its token issuance. Major exchanges, such as Binance, have hesitated to list Pi Network (PI) due to concerns about the network's non-BNB Smart Chain status and doubts regarding the token's regulatory compliance. This lack of clarity has left Pi Network (PI) struggling to gain widespread recognition and adoption, which is key to its long-term success. Additionally, Pi Network (PI)’s inability to list on major exchanges and the lack of free coin exchange and spending options could risk losing its early supporter base. If Pi Network (PI) continues to face these hurdles, it could struggle to hit its ambitious $1 target in the near future. The Future of Pi Network (PI) and Coldware (COLD) While Pi Network (PI) is still trying to find its footing in the market, Coldware (COLD) is gaining momentum with its innovative approach and unique value proposition. Coldware’s focus on mobile-first mining and DeFi integration sets it apart from Pi Network (PI), which has struggled to deliver tangible utility despite its large community. As Coldware (COLD) continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of crypto mining could evolve beyond the traditional methods, thanks to Coldware’s innovative approach. Whether Pi Network (PI) can overcome its challenges and rise to prominence remains to be seen, but the arrival of Coldware provides hope for the crypto mining space, offering a glimpse of what could be the future of decentralized finance and mobile mining. Conclusion Pi Network (PI) may have experienced a dip in its price recently, but the underlying potential of its vast community and the network’s eventual mainnet launch gives some hope for recovery. However, Coldware (COLD) appears to be the new beacon of hope for mining enthusiasts and those looking for a more transparent and scalable solution in the mining sector. With Coldware’s unique features and approach, it may well capture the attention of the crypto community and establish itself as a strong contender in the crypto space.
