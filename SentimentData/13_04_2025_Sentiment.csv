Despite its loyal community and previous hype, the momentum appears to be shifting. Ethereum (ETH), trading at $1,476, is gaining fresh institutional interest ahead of the ETF momentum, while emerging DeFi performing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is capturing attention with its next-generation lending protocol. The presale is now in phase 4 after selling out the third one faster than expected. Over $6.5 million has been raised, attracting more than 8100 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.025 before the price jumps 20% to $0.03 in phase 5. Those buying today are set for a 140% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. ADA could be left behind as ETH and MUTM move into the spotlight, with analysts forecasting a reshuffling of the altcoin leaderboard. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending with its cutting-edge dual-lending model, which has driven rapid adoption. With over 8100 investors contributing $6.5 million during the presale, confidence in the project continues to grow. Currently trading at $0.025 in Phase 4, the price is set for a 20% jump in Phase 5, giving investors an opportunity for significant gains. Combining high market demand with unique lending mechanics, analysts see MUTM as one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi projects, with the potential to surpass $2 post-launch. In a recent update that’s generating serious buzz, Mutuum Finance launched an interactive dashboard with a real-time leaderboard, showcasing its top 50 token holders. These elite investors aren’t just getting recognition, they’ll also be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their position. Transforming DeFi with a Hybrid Lending Approach Mutuum Finance makes its lending platform stand out because it unites both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Users participating in P2C model liquidity pools can obtain passive income through smart contract-based automated USDT lending operations. Users who select P2P transactions handle their money directly through peer-to-peer deals which bypass financial institutions. Mutuum Finance combines P2C and P2P models to create features which improve protection along with efficiency and decentralization and thus aligns well with DeFi investors who want yield-bearing alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem As proof of its commitment to stability, Mutuum Finance is issuing a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins, which have been criticized for potentially leading to insolvency, this token will be over-collateralized to minimize risk and make it trustworthy in the long term. Combined with open financial architectures and audited smart contracts, this architecture increases investor trust while filling the biggest gaps seen in past DeFi projects. The company makes continuous community expansion possible through generous rewards programs. The giveaway provides 10 lucky winners with MUTM tokens worth $10,000 from a $100,000 fund and the referral program compensates users for referring new investors. Platform users who join at an early stage get premium staking pools alongside governance power along with exclusive updates while continuing their relationship with the platform. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Tokenomics mechanisms of the project create controlled distribution and maintain lasting value growth. The presale token distribution limitation together with deflationary mechanisms enables Mutuum Finance to maintain token scarcity that might fuel price elevation. Through its staking system the project offers valuable benefits which motivate constant user engagement while supporting the token’s continuous development throughout the system. Mutuum Finance is making waves with its next-gen lending platform. With over $6.5 million raised from more than 8,100 holders, and a presale price currently at $0.025 set to jump 20% in the next phase, MUTM offers early investors a potential 140% ROI at launch. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in decentralized finance.

While Cardano is a well known brand in blockchain, Ruvi AI’s presale model, VIP bonuses and leaderboard rewards are attracting early investors looking to get in and maximize their gains in the short term. Cardano’s Slow and Steady Growth Cardano has always been known for its academic rigor and scalability features. Currently trading at $0.63, ADA is expected to go to $0.84 by year end. That’s 33% ROI. Not bad but not life changing for early crypto investors. Even with Cardano’s progress in building dApps and improving smart contracts, its growth is minimal for risk takers looking for big gains. That’s where Ruvi AI comes in. Ruvi AI’s $0.01 Presale and the VIP 5 Advantage The presale got investors attention fast and reached its first milestone in just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. Ruvi AI is breaking the mold with a $0.01 presale that offers unmatched ROI. The platform combines AI and blockchain to provide practical solutions for dApps, content creation and analytics. But that’s not all. Ruvi AI’s VIP bonus tiers offer an opportunity to maximize returns like never before. Take the VIP 5 tier for example. With a $5,000 investment, you get 500,000 $RUVI tokens at $0.01 each. But here’s the game changing part: VIP 5 members get a 100% matching bonus, doubling their tokens to 1,000,000. At the public listing price of $0.07, those 1,000,000 tokens will be worth $70,000, that’s 1,300% initial ROI. Analysts predict Ruvi AI could go even higher, to $1 per token. That would make those 1,000,000 tokens worth $1,000,000, making Ruvi AI a wealth building opportunity like no other. Leaderboard Rewards Make Ruvi AI Irresistible Ruvi AI’s leaderboard rewards takes investment incentives to the next level. Designed to reward its most loyal community members, the program distributes fixed token rewards to the top holders based on their total holdings. This encourages investors to grow their $RUVI portfolio and gives tangible benefits to those who participate actively. Rewards are given to the top 1,000 holders, with the biggest bonuses for the top ranks. From generous rewards for the top 10 holders to incentives for the top 1,000, the program makes sure every achieved rank gets meaningful rewards. And these rewards are on top of the VIP bonuses, giving more token allocation to investors portfolios. For the top of the leaderboard, this is a golden opportunity to accumulate more wealth while solidifying their support for Ruvi AI’s long term goals. How Ruvi AI Will Outperform Cardano The main difference between Ruvi AI and Cardano is the scope of their ROI. Cardano’s stability and slow growth is good for long term but not enough for the exponential gains Ruvi AI offers. With the opportunity to get in at $0.01 per token and robust reward systems like VIP bonuses and leaderboard prizes, Ruvi AI gives investors a real shot at big returns. What sets Ruvi apart is its ability to tap into the growing demand for AI driven blockchain applications. This real world utility adds credibility to its growth projections, making it more than just a speculative play. Time to Act Ruvi AI’s presale is a rare chance to get in at $0.01 before the listing and the price surge. While Cardano will deliver stable gains in the coming months, Ruvi AI’s innovative approach and multi layered incentives makes it a once in a lifetime investment opportunity. With only 3 months until Ruvi AI’s full potential kicks in, the clock is ticking for investors to get in the presale. By October, Ruvi AI might not only outperform Cardano but redefine what’s possible in the crypto space. Get in now and be part of the story everyone will be talking about.

43265605,https://thecoinrise.com/blockchain-developer-activity-decline-by-40-sparks-concern/,1744495201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/43265605.jpeg,Blockchain Developer Activity Decline By 40% Sparks Concern,https://thecoinrise.com/blockchain-developer-activity-decline-by-40-sparks-concern/,"The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is experiencing a sharp drop in developer activity. Developers are important in building and maintaining the decentralized applications (Dapps), platforms, and networks that run the crypto space. This decline in developer participation has raised concerns in the crypto community. Many are worried about whether the industry can keep growing and come up with new innovative ideas in the future. Blockchain Developer Activity Has Dropped Sharply Data from Artemis Terminal shows that the number of weekly active crypto developers has dropped to 40% in just one year. In April 2024, about 12,000 developers were working in the crypto space. However, by March 2025, developer activity had fallen to just 7,290. The situation became more concerning in December 2024, when the number dropped below 5,300 before experiencing a slight recovery in January. This decline suggests that fewer people are working on new ideas and updates. If this continues, it could lead to slower growth and more issues across the industry. What’s Causing the Drop? Binji Pande, who works on the Ethereum-based Optimism network, thinks the drop in developer activity shows that the crypto industry is changing its focus. He says developers are getting less support and fewer rewards. More people now care about making quick money instead of building useful tools that last. In a recent X post , Pande said that crypto projects are now based on popular trends rather than real needs. This approach leads to weak results and fails to support long-term growth. Pande also addressed the challenges faced by developers working on innovative applications. He noted that many developers working on real and useful applications are not getting enough attention or funding. On the flip side, capital flows into projects designed for quick gains. He argued that this imbalance has created an unhealthy system where short-term excitement is more valued than long-term development. This has made on-chain experiences less engaging. It has also reduced how much people use decentralized apps. Top Ethereum developer Eric Conner reportedly left the community in January to explore the AI sector. Conner said he lost interest in Ethereum because leaders and the community no longer share the same values. A Call for Renewed Focus and Support In Crypto Industry Pande believes that the industry needs to support and fund developers so that they can focus on building complete, end-to-end products. He believes real adoption comes from building products people need and use, not just new tech or market trends. The Optimism contributor warned that the next big growth in crypto will not come from market hype or another bull market. Instead, it will come from real and useful blockchain activity that keeps people involved.

Cardano is pushing toward the $1 mark but remains weighed down by resistance and investor caution. Solana, backed by ETF optimism and a tightening supply, is showing strength with eyes on $1,000. But then there’s BlockDAG , quietly shifting the narrative with its early airdrop, 600% bonus, and a presale ROI already hitting 2,380%. While ADA and SOL work to maintain their positions, BlockDAG is rewarding early adopters and offering what many investors are hunting for: access, timing, and a spot among the top crypto gainers. Cardano’s $1 Challenge Amid Lightchain AI’s Rise Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at approximately $0.63, maintaining a strong position with its scalable infrastructure and loyal community. However, it faces resistance at the $1 mark, with analysts viewing the $0.66 support line as critical; failure to maintain this level could lead to further declines. Furthermore, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties have also contributed to investor caution, inhibiting ADA’s upward momentum. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI, an AI-powered blockchain project, has raised $18.3 million during its presale, reflecting growing belief in its approach to decentralization. With that in mind, features designed to tackle transparency, governance, and scalability are helping Lightchain AI quickly become a serious player in the altcoin space. As a result, while ADA pushes upward, Lightchain AI is building momentum that could outpace expectations. Solana Targets $1,000 as ETF Optimism and Tariff Policy Shift Boost Momentum Solana (SOL) experienced a 15% rebound to $116 following former President Donald Trump’s announcement to roll back global tariffs, signaling potential economic shifts. Additionally, this policy change, coupled with the appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to the SEC, increased the likelihood of a Solana ETF approval to 81%, enhancing institutional interest. Moreover, on-chain data revealed that over 64% of SOL is staked, reducing circulating supply and alleviating sell pressure. At the same time, the slowdown in token unlocks further tightens supply dynamics. According to analysts, technical analysis by CryptoCurb suggests a parabolic trajectory for Solana, with historical patterns indicating a possible surge to $1,000, supported by strong accumulation zones between $100 and $115. Therefore, the combination of favorable regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and constrained supply positions Solana for a significant upward movement. Altogether, this confluence of factors contributes to the current Solana (SOL) price surge. BlockDAG’s Early Airdrop Gives Golden Ticket Holders a Head Start BlockDAG is giving new users a serious advantage with its “Golden Ticket” promo, offering a 600% bonus and early airdrop access for those who use the code BDAG1200. In practical terms, this means first-time buyers get six times the tokens during presale and receive them before the general public, even before the presale ends. This is especially beneficial if the token hits exchanges shortly after mainnet launch. Not surprisingly, this first-mover advantage is already gaining attention. With $213.5 million raised, 19.2 billion tokens sold, and a 2,380% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG’s presale ranks among the most successful in the space. Currently, Batch 27 is live at $0.0248, making timing critical for anyone eyeing potential gains. Looking ahead, an upcoming AMA on April 17 could bring key updates—mainnet launch details, testnet results, or international expansion news. In parallel, the project is kicking off its first global convention tour, bringing the community closer to the team and building long-term confidence. Ultimately, for those scanning the space for the top crypto opportunities, BlockDAG’s early airdrop isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a tactical edge. Getting tokens ahead of public distribution lets holders ride the momentum and potentially capitalize on post-listing demand, making it a smart play for those who act fast. BlockDAG’s Early Access Model Sets It Apart from ADA and SOL While Cardano wrestles with key resistance and Solana rides regulatory optimism, BlockDAG is offering something different—early access and real traction. Its 600% bonus and pre-distribution airdrop aren’t just promotions; they represent a head start that other projects aren’t offering right now. With over $213 million raised and a 2,380% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG is making timing matter. For those comparing top crypto plays, the edge goes to the one that rewards first movers. BlockDAG isn’t waiting for market approval—it’s already giving its community a reason to stay ahead of the curve.

The community-first approach, along with smart tech additions, gives Dogs a hybrid appeal that combines meme-driven hype with real-world utility. Analysts predict that projects like Dogs, which straddle culture and tech, could dominate the next wave of meme coin adoption. Why Dogs Made It to This List: Its combination of meme culture and real blockchain utility positions it as a future heavyweight. 7. Pudgy Penguins: Cool, Collectible, and Climbing While technically starting as an NFT project, Pudgy Penguins has evolved into a full-on meme ecosystem. With their adorable designs and viral marketing efforts, Pudgy Penguins have captured mainstream attention far beyond typical crypto circles. They’re branching into toys, media, and branding deals, showing how meme-driven projects can create real-world value. This pivot toward brand building rather than just relying on crypto hype is what sets Pudgy Penguins apart and keeps them relevant as both collectibles and tokens. Why Pudgy Penguins Made It to This List: Its successful transition from NFTs to broader cultural icons gives it an edge most meme coins envy. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Top Meme Coin Launches Set to explode in 2025 are Troller Cat, Book of Meme, Turbo, Memecoin, Baby Doge Coin, Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins.

Kang opened a 40x long position in Bitcoin worth $100 million on April 9, following US President Donald Trump’s statement that it was “a good time to buy.” Bitcoin has since risen and is trading above $85,000 at the time of writing. In today’s move, the trader doubled his position and now holds a $200 million BTC long position with 40x leverage. Kang’s current position has an average entry level of $82,076 and an unrealized gain of $7.7 million. Kang has paid $115,000 in funding fees to date. Kang will be liquidated if the Bitcoin price drops to $83,410. Kang's position at 0xBb876071A63Bc4D9bfCf46B012b4437Ea7Ff4281 can be tracked via this link. Related News: Prominent Analyst Makes Unbelievable Prediction For Bitcoin (BTC) Price In 2035 On Live Broadcast - ""It May Even Exceed This"" On the other hand, when Kang’s other positions on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Hyperliquid are examined, it is seen that he has a short position in Ethereum worth $6.7 million at 25x. Kang has lost $370,000 from this position so far and paid a funding fee of $24. The trader also has another position in Ethena (ENA). Kang has a $5.5 million long position in ENA at 10x and has made $118k in profits to date, paying $399 in funding fees. However, it is necessary to remember that leveraged trading is very risky, and when combined with the high risk of cryptocurrencies, losses, including the entire principal, are inevitable. *This is not investment advice.

Amidst a major downtrend, Martinez’s latest forecast reveals the altcoin could soon see a significant market rebound. Related Reading: Is It Time For Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance Rises To Major Rejection Zone Inverse Head-And-Shoulders Pattern Forms As NEAR Prepares For Rally In an X post on April 11, Ali Martinez shows a technical analysis of the NEAR 3-day chart revealing the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern which signals a potential price upswing. In financial markets, the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is a bullish formation that often acts as a reliable indicator of a trend reversal. As the name implies, it consists of three troughs in the form of the left shoulder, the deeper “head”, and the right shoulder as evidenced by the price action between April 7 and April 11 on the NEAR chart. Notably, a descending neckline connects the highs between these troughs and serves as a key resistance level. According to Ali Martinez, NEAR is gradually approaching this neckline, a decisive breakout above which would confirm the bullish reversal and initiate a price rally toward 2.40. Interestingly, NEAR’s relative strength index on its daily chart has recently left the oversold zone backing Martinez’s prediction of an impending price reversal. However, market bulls should still expect to face some resistance at the 1.000 and 1.272 Fibonacci extension levels at $2.10 and $2.34. On the other hand, if the NEAR bulls fail to break above the descending neckline, it could invalidate the current bullish setup and potentially force a price fall to support levels around the $1.96 and $1.82 price zones. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Symmetrical Triangle From 2017, A Repeat Could Send It as Flying To $30 NEAR Price Outlook At the time of writing, NEAR is trading at $2.09 following a price gain of 4.34% in the past day. On larger time frames, the altcoin is down by 16.12% on the weekly chart and 17.58% on the monthly chart showing short-term investors are holding significant losses. According to data from CoinCodex, the general sentiment in the NEAR market remains highly bearish. Meanwhile, the Fear & Greed Index stands at 25 reflecting an Extreme Fear among investors. Contrary to Martinez’s positive predictions, these analysts predict NEAR to maintain its current downtrend in the short term with predictions of $2.07 in five days and $1.90 in a month. In the long term, Coincodex still maintains a bearish outlook on the NEAR market projecting a market price of $1.58 in three months i.e. a potential 24% decline from current market prices.

Citing “people with knowledge on the matter” who asked not to be identified, Bloomberg reports that BlueCrest is up 20% on the year already, while taking into account fees and expenses. Platt reportedly used aggressive amounts of leverage to exploit the extreme volatility triggered by President Trump’s trade war, with BlueCrest now on track to complete a decade of consecutive returns. BlueCrest returned capital to outside investors, turning the firm into a privately owned and managed family office, so its exact assets under management (AUM) is unclear – though court documents show that BlueCrest held $3.9 billion in 2022. According to Forbes , Michael Platt is Britain’s richest hedge fund manager, worth about $18.8 billion as of December 2024, and currently stands with only a select few who have managed to profit in 2025 despite the global market sell-off induced by President Trump. Billionaire Warren Buffett also recorded billions of dollars in gains this year, upping his net worth over $11.5 billion this year alone, and his gains come despite this month’s sell off, which reduced Buffett’s 2025 winnings by $14.5 billion. Buffett, who is now ranked fourth among global billionaires, is one of only two in the top 20 that grew richer this year. He’s alongside L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has added $1.8 billion.

He cites growing institutional interest and a friendlier US regulatory landscape as key drivers for long-term growth. A Bold but Grounded Prediction Speaking on Fox Business Network’s The Claman Countdown , Garlinghouse remarked, “I think $200,000 is not unreasonable.” He clarified that he wouldn’t predict XRP’s price, adding, “It’s too close to home.” Bitcoin is currently trading around $83,500, a 3% daily increase, though still 23% below its January 20 peak. Despite short-term fluctuations, Garlinghouse believes long-term macroeconomic trends are far more important than day-to-day movements. Regulatory Shift Could Unlock Crypto Growth Garlinghouse emphasized the dramatic change in the US regulatory environment, noting the transition from “headwinds, hostility” to “tailwinds.” He believes this positive shift hasn’t yet been fully appreciated by the market. “The largest asset managers in the world go from relatively frozen out or hostile to now a friendly market. This has sensible regulation that is thinking about pro-innovation here at home,” he said. He also underscored crypto’s role as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. “The long-term value here is going to be very clear. It (crypto) is a hedge against inflation. It is a dynamic where the more utility we drive in the crypto markets, the more we’re going to see value accrete to that market,” Garlinghouse added. XRP ETF Momentum Grows New developments on the ETF front are also supporting the broader market. Teucrium recently launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the US—the 2x Long Daily XRP ETF—which saw strong debut volume of $5 million. Garlinghouse remains optimistic about XRP ETF approvals, predicting launches in the second half of the year. Analysts from JPMorgan and Standard Chartered estimate up to $8 billion in inflows during the first year if ETFs gain approval. Ripple’s Strategic Moves and Expansion Garlinghouse discussed Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road, which he said would not have occurred under the previous regulatory environment. The acquisition aims to help institutions like BlackRock enter the crypto market with the infrastructure they trust. “This allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that. It’s good for the whole industry,” he noted. Ripple’s headcount has also grown to around 1,100 employees, further signaling confidence in the company’s trajectory. Stablecoins and Legislation on the Horizon Garlinghouse highlighted growing momentum behind crypto regulation on Capitol Hill. Market structure bills and stablecoin legislation are gaining traction, with expectations that both could soon pass. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, launched under a New York trust license, has already surpassed $250 million in market cap and is nearing the $300 million mark. Garlinghouse believes these developments point to a maturing and increasingly integrated crypto ecosystem.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-12 22:46:39

With countless tokens launching and vanishing each year, knowing which ones truly offer long-term value can be tough. The real winners usually have strong use cases, engaged communities, and a development roadmap that extends well into the future. In this guide, we’ve gathered the top-performing cryptos of 2025. These aren’t just trending names—they’ve earned their place through resilience, innovation, and real network progress. Whether you’re building for the long run or rethinking your current portfolio, these projects stand out for a reason. 1. BlockDAG: Speed, Simplicity, & Real-World Scale BlockDAG is quickly gaining attention as one of the top-performing cryptos of the year, and its architecture is a big reason why. Instead of confirming one block at a time, its hybrid DAG and PoW structure processes multiple blocks simultaneously. The result? Faster speeds, lower costs, and serious scalability. Its beta testnet recently went live and already outpaces the alpha version, offering double the performance. Features like DeFi integration, NFT tools, and a token builder are built into its enhanced explorer. With mainnet set to launch later in 2025, BlockDAG is aiming for 15,000 TPS and will include core tools like swaps, staking, governance, and bridging. The numbers are impressive. Over $213.5 million raised, 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold, and a user base that includes 1 million X1 Miner app downloads. Global partnerships with Inter Milan and HackerEarth, plus dev-focused incentives like grants and bug bounties, show BlockDAG is serious about long-term growth. For those tracking top-performing cryptos in terms of innovation and adoption, BlockDAG leads the pack. 2. Solana: Fast, Efficient, and Backed by Institutions Solana keeps proving its place among the top-performing cryptos through speed, growth, and institutional interest. Currently priced at around $110, SOL recently unlocked over $213.5 million in tokens—but its price stayed strong, and some forecasts suggest a peak near $300 this year. Big players are noticing. Franklin Templeton just filed for a Solana ETF, showing growing interest beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin. After past struggles with downtime, Solana has rolled out updates to boost reliability. Its ecosystem—rich with NFTs, DeFi apps, and blockchain gaming—is thriving thanks to ultra-low fees and fast confirmations. Solana remains a key player for those seeking both performance and adoption. 3. Ethereum: The Core Network Still Building the Future Ethereum remains a go-to choice for investors focused on long-term fundamentals. Despite dropping below $1,500—levels not seen since 2013—Ethereum still powers most DeFi apps, NFTs, and smart contracts. A short-term dip doesn’t change the fact that it remains the backbone of Web3. CoinDCX projects ETH could reach over $5,500 by the end of 2025. This outlook is backed by ongoing upgrades, broad developer activity, and reliable integration across platforms. Even after a $105 million whale liquidation, Ethereum’s roadmap stays on course. Its efforts toward lower gas fees and improved scalability continue to support its standing among the top-performing cryptos heading into the next phase of the market cycle. 4. Cardano: Building Slowly, But With Long-Term Focus Cardano continues to attract attention from investors focused on steady growth. ADA is currently trading at $0.59, bouncing back with an 8% rise after nearly dropping below $0.50. While technicals showed a potential “Death Cross,” analysts at Benzinga still predict it could hit $0.94 or higher this year. What keeps Cardano among the top-performing cryptos is its methodical, research-driven approach. It skips hype and leans into academic peer review and slow-but-consistent updates. Its ecosystem is growing steadily, especially across Africa, with expanding DeFi support and real-world use cases. Cardano may not rise fast, but it also tends to hold up during downturns—making it a reliable option for patient investors. 5. TRON: Quiet Growth Backed by Real Usage TRON might not dominate headlines, but its consistent metrics show why it belongs on this list of top-performing cryptos. TRX trades near $0.23 and may climb to $0.26 in the near term—and as high as $0.73 by the end of 2025. TRON may not spike aggressively, but it also doesn’t crash—it moves steadily upward. TRON’s strength lies in utility. With high daily user counts and transaction volumes—driven by stablecoins like USDT—it continues to rank near the top for network activity. Its low fees and fast speeds make it especially attractive in cost-sensitive markets. While not flashy, TRON delivers consistent results, making it a solid pick for accumulation-focused strategies. Looking For the Top-Performing Crypto? If you’re thinking beyond the next trend, these top-performing cryptos deserve serious attention. Each one brings something distinct—whether it’s BlockDAG’s scalable tech and presale success, Ethereum’s smart contract dominance, Solana’s real-world usage, Cardano’s disciplined development, or TRON’s steady expansion. Together, they offer a mix of innovation, reliability, and community power. For anyone building a portfolio with lasting potential, these networks provide solid foundations. With strong fundamentals, active ecosystems, and big plans ahead, these top-performing cryptos are shaping up to be some of the smartest bets as the next crypto cycle unfolds.

Gilbertie stated there was “overwhelming excitement” surrounding the ETF, noting that the firm had initially been overlooked despite being the only one to file with a ticker. “It kind of took people by surprise,” he said, pointing out that their filing was made immediately after changes at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). TEUCRIUM CEO: “THE XRP ETF WAS OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH DAY TO DATE FOR FUND WE’VE EVER DONE” “Terrific response” “Overwhelming excitement” Institutional investors are eager to acquire XRP through their preferred investment vehicles. Listen closely. https://t.co/W2n4f2OyjR pic.twitter.com/ypi5GQVAhr — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 11, 2025 In late 2024, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced he would on January 20, giving way to a crypto-friendly administration under Donald Trump and his new SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Teucrium filed for the ETF around this time, and according to Gilbertie, the effectiveness period concluded over the weekend, leading to seeding on Monday and the official launch on Tuesday, April 8. Details of the ETF Listing and Performance The new Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca). The fund is designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP, offering a leveraged investment vehicle aimed at institutional investors and experienced traders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Gilbertie indicated that nearly two hundred thousand shares traded on day one, calling it a “terrific” result and confirming it was their most successful ETF launch to date. Regulatory Position and Market Implications The ETF’s structure makes it operate without requiring direct approval from the SEC due to its leveraged commodity-style format. This structure enabled the product to come to market quicker than other applications awaiting ETF approval and potentially set a model for similar offerings tied to other digital assets. Teucrium has historically focused on commodity-based ETFs but is now expanding into cryptocurrency, signaling the maturing relationship between institutional finance and digital assets. The recent conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has also boosted the XRP’s legal clarity and removed the uncertainty that plagued the market for years. This legal clarity likely supported the product’s approval path and market appeal. SMQKE, who shared the interview excerpt, emphasized Gilbertie’s remarks about the fund’s performance, including his description of a “terrific response” and strong interest from institutions. While the ETF’s leveraged nature may not suit all investors, it represents a new avenue for those seeking amplified XRP exposure through regulated investment platforms.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs finally lit the fuse Wall Street had been tiptoeing around, and with TradFi scrambling to adapt, crypto’s grassroots are thriving once again. Meanwhile, with inflationary pressure squeezing emerging economies, particularly in South America, folks are looking to digital assets not just as a hedge, but as a legit alternative to traditional savings and business tools. Amid all this momentum, Qubetics has caught the crypto community’s eye. It’s not some recycled DeFi clone or anonymous chain. It’s the world’s first web3 aggregator, and it’s making serious waves in cross-border utility. The upside potential is drawing massive attention from folks looking for the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Qubetics: Cross-Border Simplicity with Big ROI Ambitions Qubetics isn’t just riding hype—it’s solving real-world problems. Right now, businesses across Latin America wrestle with slow, costly cross-border payments. Ever tried wiring cash from Colombia to Chile for a freelance gig? Banks choke it with delays and fees. Qubetics fixes that. By acting as the world’s first web3 aggregator, it’s streamlining cross-border crypto transactions for freelancers, merchants, even expats sending cash home. Imagine a tech startup in Buenos Aires paying a contractor in Mexico City. With Qubetics, they bypass bank queues and FX gouges. A Brazilian digital artist selling NFTs to clients in Canada? Instant settlement with transparent fees. It’s what the crypto scene’s been missing: something that makes Web3 work like Web2—but cheaper, faster, smarter. Sitting comfortably in its 29th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already raked in over $16 million, moved more than 507 million $TICS, and attracted over 24,600 token holders. Priced at just $0.1573, the presale stats aren’t just a flex—they signal strong community traction. That’s why crypto analysts are quietly naming Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025—it’s early-stage, utility-packed, and backed by a hungry, growing community. What Happens If You Drop $500 on Qubetics Right Now? Let’s break it down. At the current presale price of $0.1573, a $500 investment would score you approximately 3,178 $TICS tokens. If the token hits $1, that’s $3,178—easy math. But let’s say $TICS climbs to $10 like some analysts are predicting. That same $500 would be worth $31,780. If it stretches to $15, you’re sitting on $47,670. That’s rent for a year, a motorcycle upgrade, or the seed cash to start a business. And the presale stats aren’t just a flex—they signal strong community traction. With $0.1573 per token and bullish predictions of $TICS hitting $1 to $15, we’re talking potential ROIs from 536% to a whopping 9,435%. That’s why crypto analysts are quietly naming Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025—it’s early-stage, utility-packed, and backed by a hungry, growing community. Injective: Built for Builders, Backed by Giants Injective has carved out its niche among decentralized finance platforms by being fully interoperable and optimized for speed and low fees. Its native token, $INJ, is well-known for its lightning-fast throughput and custom-built layer-1 infrastructure designed specifically for DeFi apps. Binance, Pantera Capital, and Mark Cuban are just some of the high-profile names backing Injective, and that’s no coincidence. Whether you’re into derivatives, prediction markets, or launching your own dApp, Injective makes it seamless. It’s also taken smart strides in real-world asset tokenization, something that more buyers in South America are looking into as inflation dents fiat trust. With a limited supply of just 100 million $INJ, scarcity meets utility, and the community knows it. This is why it’s still one of the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Over the years, Injective has proven it’s not just another DeFi playground—it’s the go-to for builders who want scalability without giving up decentralization. If you’re looking for an altcoin, solid tech, and a growing list of use cases, $INJ still deserves a hard look. Bittensor (TAO): The AI-Powered OG Crypto Brains Trust Bittensor, or $TAO, has been riding a very different kind of wave: the AI and machine learning gold rush. But instead of just riding the hype, Bittensor built a decentralized neural network that rewards folks who contribute data, computation, or modeling power. Picture a system where anyone can plug in and train models, and get rewarded in $TAO tokens for it. This has led to a community that’s part-developer, part-AI researcher, and all in. It’s not for the faint of heart, but if you’ve ever looked at the future and seen AI stitched into everything—from logistics to entertainment—then Bittensor becomes more than just another coin. It’s infrastructure for a decentralized AI economy. Adopters love it because it pays out for effort and transparency. The tokenomics are tight, the use case is niche but powerful, and TAO’s been making consistent moves upward. It’s not your average buy-and-hold play—it’s more like betting on the future of how AI should work. And that’s why Bittensor is repeatedly ranked among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Why These Altcoins Matter Right Now Crypto’s no longer just a moonshot playground—it’s become a toolkit. And for South Americans dealing with inflation, weak currencies, and tight capital controls, the demand for these tools is climbing fast. Whether it’s Qubetics helping remote teams get paid across borders, Injective powering new DeFi ventures, or Bittensor enabling a fairer AI race—these aren’t just tokens, they’re working systems with real-world traction. For those scouring the scene for the best altcoins to buy in April 2025 , you’re not just looking for hype—you’re hunting for fundamentals, early access, and long-haul value. Qubetics is still in presale. Injective’s already proven. Bittensor is carving the next big trend. They serve different needs, but they’ve each earned their spot at the table. The presale window for Qubetics won’t stay open forever, and the numbers already point to rising momentum. Don’t wait until $TICS hits a centralized exchange to try and jump in—by then, the easy wins may be long gone. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics ideal for cross-border transactions?

Is Injective a good option for DeFi builders? Absolutely. Injective provides a scalable, low-fee environment for building decentralized apps, prediction markets, and financial tools without compromising on decentralization.

Key Insights into Their Price Movements,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/are-sui-and-sei-poised-for-another-breakout-rally-key-insights-into-their-price-movements,"Cryptocurrency markets are always buzzing with potential. Sui and Sei have recently drawn significant attention due to their price dynamics. Curious about which coins might see a surge next? This article dives into the latest trends and key insights, hinting at possible breakout rallies for these digital assets. Stay tuned for an in-depth look. SUI Coin Insights: Price Trends and Key Levels for Trading SUI price changes over recent timeframes show a steady decline with a one-week drop of 2.31%, a one-month loss of 3.63%, and a half-year fall of 5.95%. The downward movement reflects persistent selling pressure with gradual erosion in value. This trend indicates a bearish sentiment over the longer term without any sudden spikes, marking a period of consolidation and cautious market behavior. The coin currently trades between $1.74 and $3.03, with key support near $1.21 and first resistance around $3.78. Technical indicators show a slight bearish tilt, providing mixed signals from momentum measures. Trading opportunities may arise near the support level, while short sellers could consider the resistance area as a potential exit point. Sei Price Dynamics: Past Declines and Key Levels in Focus SEI recent performance shows a one-week gain of 2.8%, a one-month drop of 9.82%, and a six-month decline of 65.39% The price has faced strong downward pressure over the longer term, reflecting a challenging environment in the past half-year, while the last week has brought some slight easing. Current trading sees prices ranging from $0.135 to $0.242, with nearest support at $0.10 and resistance at $0.31. Bears appear to have the upper hand with a mixed trend. The setup invites trades within these levels, with caution needed near the second resistance at $0.42. Conclusion Both SUI and SEI show potential for another rally. Their price actions indicate possible upward movements. Strong support levels have been observed for both coins. Technical indicators also suggest positive momentum. Market conditions and investor interest will play a crucial role. Keeping an eye on trading volumes can provide further insights. Buyers might consider favourable entry points for both SUI and SEI. However, it's essential to monitor any market shifts closely. Future developments and news can impact their trajectories significantly.

43267982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709416,1744501291,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43267982.jpeg,Trump administration exempts smartphones and computers from 125% China tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/smartphones-computers-exempted-from-tariffs/,"The Trump administration has eased its trade stance by exempting smartphones, laptops, and other key consumer electronics from a proposed 125% tariff on Chinese imports. These products are also spared from a separate 10% global tariff, offering major relief to the tech industry and signaling a potential shift in the ongoing US-China trade war. The move represents a major softening of President Trump’s trade policies, which have subjected Beijing to escalating economic pressure. US Customs and Border Protection , the agency that issued the announcement, said the tariff exclusions would take effect retroactively from April 5. The exemption applies to most technology products, including consumer and enterprise-level technology, such as smartphones, laptop computers, memory chips, CPUs, GPUs, hard drives, and solid-state drives. Most of these items are at the heart of consumer markets and cutting-edge computing systems. Most of these devices are produced domestically. Instead, they are pieced together in Asia from key components made in tech powerhouses such as Taiwan, South Korea, China, and Mexico. As a result, the tariffs threatened global supply chains and higher consumer prices in the US — worries registered across the tech world and among analysts. And while the announcement does not resolve the trade dispute, it serves as a clear signal that the administration could be recalibrating its approach — at least concerning The tech industry scores a big win The exemption is a significant victory for the global technology industry, particularly American companies that depend on complicated global supply chains. Apple Inc. is one of the biggest winners. The company’s marquee products, like iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Airtags, are now protected from large tariff increases. One notable exception is AirPods, which are still subject to levies. Apple previously warned that such tariffs would not just hurt profits but also result in price increases for US consumers. After the tariff was first announced in March, Apple’s shares fell as investors worried. Nvidia Corp., whose chips dominate AI and graphics processing, also stands to gain. Most of Nvidia’s chips are made in Taiwan and Mexico and are essential for operating AI data centers and cloud infrastructure. The announcement also includes servers and AI chips, which are core to the growth of both artificial intelligence and cloud computing capabilities in the US. These products had been missing from initial exemption lists, raising alarm from tech industry executives. The exemptions also cover the equipment used to manufacture semiconductors — a key development for ASML Holding NV (Netherlands) and Tokyo Electron Ltd. (Japan). These companies make the specialized tools required to construct advanced chip factories. This action aligns with the wider US aim to increase US semiconductor output under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are investing majorly in building or expanding chip facilities in the United States. The tariff standstill will relieve near-term pressures on the companies as they ramp up their US operations — and may even hasten the pace of your innovation and infrastructure. Exemption raises hopes, but uncertainty remains The Trump administration’s latest move is a temporary win, and industry leaders caution that the situation is fluid. Those exceptions are attached to an older presidential order built to prevent the imposition of cumulative tariffs on a single product. That doesn’t mean existing levies have been removed; new tariffs could be imposed in another form. Some analysts forecast that the administration might also renounce the tariffs enframed into more specific duties collecting to critical sectors such as semiconductors and AI components. These are expected to be less severe than the initial 125% but could still impact pricing & production. Crucially, the exemptions do not apply to a different 20% tariff explicitly targeting China over the fentanyl crisis. That tariff and others that predate Trump’s current term are still in effect. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research report that was key to the decision. He opened with the comment that there was resistance in the White House to driving exemptions at first, but once the reality of the situation hit home within the Beltway, it was a different story. He also cautioned that China could take future steps that would change the dynamics again, mentioning that these negotiations still featured bald uncertainty and volatility. Some of the exempted products are critical to consumers, national security, and innovation. Exempting those from tariffs signals that the United States could move in a more strategic, selective direction on trade rather than across-the-board levies hitting broad portions of the economy. For now, consumers, manufacturers, and tech giants can relax. Devices will remain affordable, AI infrastructure can continue to grow, and the trade war might find a new phase involving targeted diplomacy instead of broad sanctions.

SHIBA turned a modest $100 into over $1.96 million , and DOGE ran from fractions of a cent to over $0.70 , printing millionaires seemingly overnight. Now, in Q2 of 2025 , traders are on the hunt for the next memecoin miracle — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a serious contender. Early investors are now able to scoop up 3.3 million MAGACOIN FINANCE tokens for just $1,000 — a volume that echoes the earliest stages of coins like PEPE and FLOKI, long before their mainstream breakouts. For those looking to maximize exposure at ground-floor prices, this kind of token-to-dollar ratio is a rarity in today’s maturing market. WHY EARLY DOGE AND SHIBA BUYERS ARE WATCHING MAGACOIN FINANCE PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW When DOGE first gained traction, it was trading at around $0.0002 — the kind of entry that turned everyday retail traders into whales once it reached $0.70 . That’s a staggering 35,000x ROI. Analysts are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE with similar excitement, pointing to the massive supply access early buyers receive with its current price of $0.0002908 . Buying 3.3 million tokens for $1,000 offers upside potential that’s increasingly hard to find, especially as many top coins have already run their course. The last time this kind of entry was possible, SHIBA INU jumped 2,900% in just under 60 days. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE be gearing up for a similar trajectory? ANALYSTS SAY “ROTATION SEASON” FAVORS NEW MEME PROJECTS JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW The sentiment around MAGACOIN FINANCE is heating up fast on YouTube and X (formerly Twitter). Someone who influences social media has called it, “major coins are keeping still, we have to turn to something new like MAGACOIN FINANCE — it’s too good an opportunity to pass up.” Despite the current turbulence in the market, the project is developing rapidly. There is even talk in communities that it may turn out to be a standout launch for 2025. Some forecasts call for a move of 30x to 70x once it hits centralized exchanges. Telegram communities are buzzing, Twitter threads are collapsing unintentionally and early whales from previous cycles are sipping their champagne. FINAL WORD: TOO EARLY TO IGNORE? GET 50% EXTRA TOKENS INSTANTLY — USE PROMO CODE: MAGA50X BEFORE IT EXPIRES In a market where even stable coins are facing volatility, the idea of securing 3.3 million tokens for $1,000 feels like a throwback to crypto’s golden age. It’s this kind of positioning that can multiply portfolios if the project reaches even a fraction of DOGE or SHIBA’s highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be more than a meme — it’s a movement, with real potential to ride the next major crypto wave. If you’re looking to front-run the crowd, this might be one of the last major presale entries before 2025 delivers its first big breakout.

Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction again thanks to its Pectra upgrade, which improves scalability and slashes gas fees. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also heating up, sitting just under a critical level at $0.0000134 — and a potential 20% rally could be in sight. But while these names are making headlines, one project is quietly pulling ahead: BlockDAG . The launch of Keynote 3 revealed that BlockDAG raised $200 million in just 10 months — all without VC support. Now in Batch 27, the presale has surged past $213.5 million. With bold projections placing its price at $1 in 2025, BlockDAG is becoming hard to ignore. Keynote 3 not only celebrated the team’s progress — it also gave the market a clear signal that BlockDAG isn’t just growing, it’s aiming to lead. Ethereum (ETH) Price Outlook: On the Rise After Pectra Launch The Ethereum (ETH) price outlook has improved following the successful deployment of the Pectra upgrade on the Hoodi testnet. The upgrade brings a major improvement — it lets users pay gas fees with tokens other than ETH, making Ethereum easier to use and more inclusive. As ETH moves closer to $2,500, strong fundamentals are backing the trend. Lower gas fees, growing institutional interest, and capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs all support the case for a longer-term climb. With the Pectra mainnet rollout set for April 25, and market sentiment gradually shifting, Ethereum’s trajectory looks more promising — assuming the upgrades deliver as planned. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Forecast: Can It Rally 20%? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is in a critical spot. It’s hovering just below key resistance at $0.0000134, and if it breaks past, analysts suggest a 20% rally could follow — that’s the current Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast. Momentum is building. The RSI recently rose to 54.10, showing increasing strength. At the same time, the MACD crossed above the signal line, which often suggests further upside. Still, the move won’t be confirmed until SHIB clearly clears and holds above that resistance level. If it does, the market could see SHIB take a meaningful leg higher. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Celebrates a Record-Breaking Presale BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 was more than an update — it was a showcase of progress. CEO Antony Turner highlighted that the team raised $200 million in under 10 months — all without any backing from venture capital. That number has since grown to $213.5 million in Batch 27 of the presale. “ This isn’t just capital — it’s fuel for innovation, expansion, and the next evolution of blockchain technology ,” Turner stated. The money raised is being used to push the core protocol forward, enhance the mainnet infrastructure, and scale global operations. It’s also helping fund outreach efforts, bolstered by high-profile partnerships with brands like UFC and Inter Milan — helping BlockDAG become a globally recognized name. The BDAG token has jumped from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in Batch 27, giving early supporters a 2,380% return. The forecasts are just as impressive — with a target of $1 by 2025, $20 by 2027, and even $30 by 2030. That vision is backed by a community of over 170,000 holders, all helping BlockDAG emerge as a major player among the top crypto coins 2025 . Summing Up! The Ethereum (ETH) price outlook remains strong as it heads toward a key upgrade, while the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast hints at a possible 20% rally. But the real story might be unfolding elsewhere. With over $213.5 million raised — and no VC funding — BlockDAG is already breaking norms. Keynote 3 has only added fuel to the fire, reinforcing confidence in the project’s future and positioning it among the top crypto coins 2025. With a presale price of $0.0248 now and projections calling for $1 next year, BlockDAG’s path forward looks ambitious — but achievable. For those looking ahead to the next big breakout, the choice may no longer be just between ETH or SHIB. BlockDAG is emerging as a serious contender with real momentum — and that makes it a project worth watching very closely.

Analyst Identifies Pattern That Suggests So",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-return-to-74000-pattern-suggests-so/,"The Bitcoin price had a rollercoaster journey over the past week, falling to its lowest level in six months on Wednesday, April 9. The flagship cryptocurrency showed some resilience, recovering above the $80,000 level after United States President Donald Trump paused trade tariffs on all countries except China. BTC seems to be starting the weekend on a strong foot, returning to above $83,000 in the late hours of Friday. However, the price of BTC appears to be enjoying only a temporary relief, as a prominent crypto analyst has identified a pattern that could decide the coin’s trajectory over the next few weeks. BTC At Risk Of Another Correction Due To Double Top Pattern In an April 11 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting outlook on the price of Bitcoin following its recent recovery rally. According to the online pundit, this latest surge could be a precursor to another Bitcoin price correction to around the $74,000 level. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Symmetrical Triangle From 2017, A Repeat Could Send It as Flying To $30 This bearish prediction is based on the potential formation of the “double top” pattern on the BTC hourly chart. The Double Top pattern is a technical analysis formation that looks like the letter “M”, consisting of two consecutive price tops. The double top pattern is typically a rare appearance on most charts, indicating that investors are looking to book their profits from an extended bullish trend. Hence, the “M” pattern can be a strong signal of trader exhaustion and bearish reversal. Interestingly, the above chart shows that the Bitcoin price just completed a “double bottom” pattern — the opposite iteration of the Double Top — on the hourly timeframe. The double top saw the premier cryptocurrency fall from above $83,000 to around $74,000 in the space of two days. With the price of BTC seemingly topping out around the $84,000 mark, a potential “M’ pattern appears to be forming on the hourly chart. If the Bitcoin price fails to break the resistance around the $84,000, the market leader could be gearing for another price breakdown. It is worth watching out for the support cushion around the $78,000 level, where the BTC price last bounced back to above $83,000. However, a confirmed close below this support region could imply a deeper correction toward $74,000 — a nearly 15% drop from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $83,800, reflecting an over 5% price jump in the past 24 hours.

The memecoin has reset its bearish outlook and will break crucial price milestones in the coming days. For Shiba Inu, the death cross formation was confirmed on April 6 when the price dropped from $0.00001232 to a low of $0.00001030. Shiba Inu Price Golden Cross Confirmed Market data shows that the SHIB price is gradually disappearing from its earlier consolidation trend. At the time of writing, the coin’s price was changing hands for $0.00001249, up by 2.14% in 24 hours. SHIB recovered after trading at a low price of $0.00001205 to a daily high of $0.00001265 before settling at the current level. This price boost comes as the SHIB burn rate jumped 1000% in early trading, setting the memecoin on a possible revival path. SHIB/USDT 4H Chart. Source: TradingView The SHIB/USDT 4h chart confirms a golden cross pattern for the memecoin. This pattern is formed when the short-term Moving Average switches above the longer-term moving average. Although this pattern is fully formed on the 4-hour chart, it is yet to form on the daily chart. However, with the current momentum, a confirmed breakout is possible. Already, the token has displaced Hedera and now ranks as the 17th largest cryptocurrency. Shibarium Catalyst for Price Rebound Different ecosystem factors can boost the price of Shiba Inu in the long term. One of these factors is closely tied to the outlook of Shibarium and its associated Layer-2 scaling solution. As reported earlier by CoinGape, the Shibarium 200 million addresses milestone is near. If the network attains this landmark, it will show a clear sign of growing adoption, a move that might boost its token valuation. Already, Shibarium has broken the 1 billion total transaction milestone. Should the Shiba Inu network continue to record organic growth, its chances of outranking Dogecoin is higher. Amid the ongoing boost, the question remains how high the memecoin could soar. Drawing on this, a potential SHIB retest of its ATH of $0.00008844 is possible moving forward. While it will require as much as a 710% growth from current levels, SHIB can print this uptick, drawing on its historical trend.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the development team behind Helium ( HNT ) says that the regulatory agency has dropped its lawsuit against the crypto platform, which alleged that they violated securities laws. According to a press release, Helium developer Nova Labs agreed to pay the SEC $200,000 to settle the accusation without admitting to any wrongdoing. News of the dismissal caused HNT to rally as it went from a low of $2.62 on April 10th to a peak of $3.03 just a day later. It has since retraced and is trading for $2.96, a 9.9% increase during the last 24 hours. The SEC, which originally filed the lawsuit in January, had accused Nova Labs of distributing unregistered securities. “The SEC has agreed to dismiss its unregistered securities claims with prejudice. Helium Hotspots and the distribution of HNT, MOBILE, and IOT through the Helium Network are not securities. It also means that the SEC cannot bring these charges against Helium again.” In a recent blog post , Helium says the dismissal of the case is a “landmark outcome” for the digital assets industry and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) technology, which tokenizes real-world infrastructure. “This landmark outcome is a pivotal turning point for the Helium community and the entire crypto industry, removing legal uncertainty for DePIN projects that use crypto incentives to build real-world infrastructure. With the dismissal of the SEC’s unregistered securities claims with prejudice, the outcome establishes that selling hardware and distributing tokens for network growth does not automatically make them securities in the eyes of the SEC.” This marks another lawsuit dropped by the SEC against crypto giants this year after President Donald Trump took office. Other dissolved cases include ones against the crypto exchanges Kraken and Coinbase , retail trading giant Robinhood , non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea , and crypto wallet developer MetaMask .

According to Xaif, it marked the first time the two Ripple leaders shared the stage to speak on these topics directly. Have you ever seen Chris Larsen and David Schwartz share the stage? For the first time in history, they discuss $XRP and the Internet of Value — this is BIG! pic.twitter.com/ZsJkYCG1p5 — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 11, 2025 Incomplete Globalization and the Role of Interoperability Larsen opened by stating that globalization is not failing but remains incomplete. He argued that true globalization requires full interoperability in three key areas: data, goods, and money. While data and goods have achieved this through the internet and containerized shipping, respectively, money still lacks the infrastructure to move seamlessly across systems and borders. “Money networks don’t interoperate,” Larsen said. He described the lack of financial interoperability as a fundamental bottleneck in global economic integration. Traditional systems like SWIFT take days and charge high fees. Larsen asserted that addressing this issue would enable billions of people to participate in a fully functioning global economy through XRP’s advantages . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Foundational Ideas Behind the Internet of Value Schwartz pointed to Ripple’s early work on pathfinding and value exchange as part of what informed the concept of the Internet of Value. The premise, as explained by Larsen, is that “anything of value can be traded.” This concept, combined with protocols like the Interledger Protocol (ILP) and digital assets such as XRP, enables a low-cost, high-speed infrastructure for transferring value globally. Schwartz added that this system would allow international payments to become as seamless as loading a website—performed instantly, with no need to think about cost or intermediaries. He emphasized that such a capability would fundamentally transform how money is used globally. A Multi-Faceted Solution Larsen pointed to ongoing challenges in developing countries where, as he noted, sending even fifty cents is currently unfeasible due to high fees. He described sending $50 from the U.S. to Europe as impossible because of the high fees. The Internet of Value could eliminate those obstacles, making micro-payments accessible to everyone. Larsen was clear in stating that blockchains alone are not the full answer. The broader solution requires the combination of interoperable protocols, fast digital assets, and mechanisms to direct how value moves programmatically. He described the current system as an internet-driven world working with a pre-internet world of money, a mismatch that must be corrected to realize the vision fully. With experts already predicting that XRP will replace SWIFT , it can comfortably serve in this role. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With their institutional appeal and long-term track records, these names continue to dominate headlines. But in April 2025 , the most explosive ROI potential isn’t coming from the old favorites—it’s coming from MAGACOINFINANCE , a fast-growing altcoin project that’s stealing the spotlight with unmatched upside . PRESALE SELLING OUT — TAP TO SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW! ROI Comparison: The Big Players vs. MAGACOINFINANCE Bitcoin (BTC) – $81,812 (ROI potential: 2x–3x ) Ethereum (ETH) – $1,590 (ROI potential: 3x–4x ) XRP – $1.99 (ROI potential: 4x ) MAGACOINFINANCE – $0.0002908 (ROI potential: 25x to $0.007 , or 3,745% with MAGA50X ) The difference is clear.

A Breakdown of Their Journey to a New Bull Circle,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/can-xrp-ada-rebound-explosively-a-breakdown-of-their-journey-to-a-new-bull-circle,"XRP and ADA are at a crossroads, teetering between stagnation and explosive growth. This article delves into their tumultuous paths, examining whether these digital currencies are on the verge of a significant resurgence. The potential for a new bull market looms, sparking curiosity about their future performance. Find out which of these coins might be poised for a breakout. XRP's 6-Month Rally and Recent Pullback Past month performance shows a notable pullback with an 8.29% decline, but over the last six months, XRP surged by an impressive 286.22%, marking a significant gain in long-term momentum. The market has witnessed extreme fluctuations during this period, reflecting the coin's volatile trading behavior, with bullish forces having powered the recent rally before encountering short-term corrections. Currently, XRP trades within a $1.66 to $2.77 range, testing immediate resistance near $3.45 and finding support around $1.23. The indicators such as an RSI of 46.17 and a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator at -0.24 point to a neutral stance with a hint of bearish pressure. With little evidence of a clear trend, traders might explore positions between these key support and resistance areas, monitoring for signs of renewed bullish activity. Cardano's Volatile Climb: Robust 6-Month Gains Amid Short-Term Setbacks Cardano experienced a notable decline of 13.86% over the past month, contrasting with a remarkable 82.18% increase over the last six months. The recent drop of 3.94% this week indicates short-term bearish pressure following a prolonged upward trend. Overall, the coin has displayed significant volatility, with strong long-term performance somewhat offset by recent price declines. The coin currently trades within a $0.47 to $1.02 range with primary resistance at $1.37 and support at $0.27. Oscillators and momentum indicators show a neutral position, hinting at a lack of clear direction. Traders might see purchasing opportunities around the $0.27 support level, while potential exits could be considered as prices approach the $1.37 resistance. A breakout past $1.92 may indicate renewed bullish momentum. Conclusion XRP and ADA have shown promising signs of potential growth. Both coins have strong backing from their communities and ongoing development projects. Their recent activities suggest that they are positioned for significant gains. However, predicting exact outcomes remains complex. Yet, their paths forward are imbued with opportunities that could lead to explosive rebounds. Keeping an eye on market movements and updates is essential for a clearer picture of their trajectories. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ripple (XRP), currently trading around $0.61, is gaining momentum amid renewed optimism surrounding its ongoing legal clarity. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi gem still in presale, is attracting serious attention from early movers looking for asymmetric upside. MUTM is currently available at an attractive presale. The project has managed to secure over $6.5 million from investors. Over 8100 holders have entered the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale during phase 4 due to the system plans to double its price from $0.025 to $0.03. Those starting to invest now during this phase will earn 140% return at the launch price of $0.06. For investors wondering how to deploy $3,000 in this market cycle, experts say these two could be the smartest bets this month. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized lending market through its revolutionary dual-lending technology which drives its exponential growth. Approximately 8100 investors partook in support of the project by investing $6.5 million after recognizing its value potential during its presale period. The current price of Mutuum Finance Token stands at $0.025 in Phase 4 but investors will experience additional value from the upcoming Phase 5 price increase of 20%. The team behind Mutuum Finance has rolled out a new dashboard equipped with a leaderboard that recognizes the top 50 token holders. Staying in these top ranks will grant participants additional bonus tokens as a reward. Reshaping DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance brings out the revolutionary change to DeFi by incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P provides passive income opportunities to customers by placing them in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract managed automatic lending capabilities. The P2P method enables direct lending relations that allow customers to operate deals without intermediaries while keeping their capital intact. The linkage of P2C and P2P models at Mutuum Finance creates an investment opportunity with enhanced safety alongside improved efficiency and decentralized features as a DeFi investment solution for maximum-yield seekers. Investor Incentives and Community Expansion The company builds its community base through rewarding investors with attractive benefits. The fund will send 10 fortunate participants $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens through its $100,000 token distribution campaign combined with its award-winning referral system that rewards users for acquiring new participants. The platform offers exclusive staking pools and governance rights and VIP update access to its early adopting community members as they develop long-term loyalty with Mutuum Finance. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term. Scarcity of tokens and deflationary mechanisms applied during presales lead Mutuum Finance (Mutuum Finance) to establish price appreciation potential in the long term. High incentive rewards and active token participation are possible through its staking feature which builds long-term functionality and maintains a healthy ecosystem. Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as top investment picks, with the crypto market poised for an April rebound. Ripple is gaining momentum with legal clarity, while Mutuum Finance, having raised $6.5 million from 8,100 investors, offers a strong presale opportunity at $0.025, with a potential 140% ROI at $0.06. With its innovative dual-lending model and strong tokenomics, MUTM is set for significant growth. For a smart $3,000 investment, these two are your best bets.

Reports reveal that ETH has suffered a staggering 77% price crash against BTC — a decline likely fueled by a mix of technical, macro, and sentiment-driven factors. Notably, On-chain analytics platform, Santiment has now pinpointed and broken down the key reasons behind these price struggles. Ethereum Price Nosedives Against Bitcoin On April 11, Santiment released a detailed report on Ethereum, highlighting its almost four-year underperformance and the reasons behind it. Ethereum, once revered as the cryptocurrency most likely to dethrone Bitcoin, has recently suffered a brutal price decline when measured directly against BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Pain Is Far From Over: Why A Massive Drop To $1,400 Could Rock The Underperformer According to Santiment’s on-chain data, Ethereum has crashed by approximately 77% against Bitcoin since December 2021. While the dollar value of ETH hasn’t completely collapsed, especially compared to other altcoins, the long-term BTC/ETH ratio still paints a gruesome picture for Ethereum holders. Notably, Ethereum has also failed to recover anywhere near its November 2021 all-time high of $4,760. In contrast, Bitcoin has surged ahead, reclaiming much of its market dominance and outpacing ETH across almost every timeframe. This disparity has led many traders and former maximalists to compare ETH to a “shitcoin.” Even worse, various mid to low-cap altcoins have already outperformed Ethereum over the short, mid, and long-term timeframes, causing further embarrassment for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Based on Santiment’s report, the ETH/BTC price ratio chart alone is enough to trigger doubt and uncertainty among long-term holders. Behind The Scenes Of Ethereum Price Struggles Beyond price action and market volatility, Santiment reveals that there are fundamental reasons for Ethereum’s sluggish performance over the years. Some of the major criticisms that analysts and traders have pinpointed include technical, sentimental, and regulatory issues. Related Reading: Ethereum Goes Head To Head With XRP: Analyst Says ETH Will Outperform For This Reason Ironically, Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions are one of the key drivers of its underperformance. L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync are reportedly cannibalizing activity on the mainnet, taking investments from ETH while spreading investor attention thin. Secondly, Ethereum seems to struggle with complex roadmaps and communication, which has led to investor confusion. Major updates like The Merge and Shanghai have been difficult for investors to comprehend, making ETH feel less accessible than BTC. Thirdly, users remain frustrated by Ethereum’s relatively high gas fees and the slow rollout of key upgrades. This has pushed them toward more affordable and faster alternatives, significantly reducing adoption. Another primary reason for Ethereum’s crash against Bitcoin is ongoing regulatory concerns. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a more established legal precedent, Ethereum faces constant uncertainty about whether it could be labeled a security. Other points include ETH’s lack of investment appeal. While Bitcoin maintains the title as a stable digital gold, Ethereum appears to be caught in between, having no clear or attractive investment narrative. Moreover, newer blockchains like Solana and Cardano are also attracting a significant number of users with cheaper and faster solutions, ultimately pulling investments away from ETH. The final reason Santiment has identified for Ethereum’s long-term price descent is rising selling pressure. Post-upgrade withdrawals of stakes ETHs have created steady sell-side pressure, limiting growth and momentum compared to Bitcoin.

Hidden Altcoin Aims for a 458% Run in 13 Days,https://thecoinrise.com/why-is-crypto-down-today-hidden-altcoin-aims-for-a-458-run-in-13-days/,"Amid a sharp decline in the crypto market, driven by massive liquidations, traders are turning their attention to a promising altcoin.

Bitcoin led the decline, dropping sharply and causing about $361 million in losses, which triggered panic and rapid margin calls on major exchanges. The largest liquidation was a $7.08 million Bitcoin swap on OKX, impacting over 452,000 traders. Ethereum saw $320 million liquidated, while Solana lost $58 million. The total market cap dropped over 10% to $2.51 trillion due to significant declines in other crypto tokens. Volatility surged as traders adjusted positions, with a 24-hour trading volume of $181.97 billion. Analysts linked the crash to overheated sentiment, high leverage, and global economic issues. While some view the correction as stabilizing, sentiment remains fragile as Bitcoin lingers below $70,000. RCOF Presale Stuns The Crypto Market As investors seek high-growth opportunities amid crypto market struggles, attention is shifting to emerging low-cap altcoins like RCO Finance. Currently in its fifth presale stage, RCOF is priced at just $0.10 , making it an attractive entry point for early adopters. Here’s the exciting part: by using the promo code RCOF40, you can enjoy a 40% discount off the current price! Experts believe that once RCOF is listed on exchanges, the token price could surge to $0.60. This presents early investors with the potential for returns of up to 300%. Some experts even think RCOF could mirror the remarkable Bitcoin price rally in 2021. Even better, as the presale comes to an end, RCO Finance is preparing to launch a debit card for investors, marking an important step in its growing adoption. Don’t wait too long!

BlockDAG, XRP, Dogecoin & SHIB Are Breaking Out",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/best-crypto-coins-to-buy-in-2025-blockdag-xrp-dogecoin-shib-are-breaking-out/,"Q2 of 2025 is turning up the heat, and crypto traders are zoning in on a handful of breakout coins. Among them, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu , and BlockDAG are pulling ahead as the best crypto coins to buy this year. Each brings something unique—XRP’s institutional appeal, Dogecoin’s viral backing, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem growth, and BlockDAG’s massive presale. As digital assets evolve at breakneck speed, the traders keeping a close watch on these four may have front-row seats to the next wave of gains. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Surging Ahead With Speed, Tools, & Real Users BlockDAG has become a headline name in 2025—and it’s not by accident. The project raised a massive $213.5 million in presale across 27 batches, starting at $0.001 and climbing to $0.0248 , delivering a jaw-dropping 2,380% return for early participants. After Keynote 3, BlockDAG rolled out Beta Testnet V1, which doubles the speed of its alpha version. New tools like a no-code NFT and coin builder are already live, signaling that this isn’t a whitepaper project—it’s real, usable tech. With over 1 million users mining on its X1 App , adoption is off the charts. And with a mainnet launch locked in for 2025, BlockDAG’s focus on scalability, access, and speed puts it in a league of its own. It’s not just one of the best crypto coins to buy—it’s one of the most promising projects in motion right now. 2. XRP: Legal Wins & Institutional Focus Ignite Optimism XRP is riding high in 2025, trading at $2.06 as of April. Its rebound is backed by a crucial court victory against the SEC, which has revived confidence among institutional investors and fueled talks of an XRP ETF. The probability of ETF approval is sitting at 82%, which could skyrocket demand. With price forecasts between $1.82 and $4.48 this year, XRP is in a strong position. On-chain activity is healthy, and large holders continue to accumulate. With its real-time payments utility and expanding financial relevance, XRP is still one of the best crypto coins to buy for those betting on mass adoption. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Holding Its Ground With Social Power Dogecoin isn’t just surviving—it’s staying relevant. Now trading at $0.164, DOGE recently dropped 8.63%, but major holders are still loading up—220 million DOGE were scooped up in March alone. Support around $0.16 remains solid, and analysts eye $0.1945 and eventually $0.57 as next potential levels—a possible 250%+ upside. With daily mentions across social platforms and continued payment utility, DOGE may be volatile, but it still earns its spot among the best crypto coins to buy—especially for risk-tolerant traders watching social trends. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Scaling Fast With Real Transactions & Burn Rates Shiba Inu isn’t just a meme—it’s showing serious traction. Trading at $0.00001222 with a $7.18 billion market cap, SHIB is sitting comfortably in the top 15. Its ShibaSwap platform posted a 228% surge in 30-day trading volume, now reaching $17.18 billion in total activity. The Shibarium blockchain has processed over 1 billion transactions, and SHIB’s burn rate recently spiked 104,201%, with 115.89 million tokens burned in a single day. With that level of usage and deflationary pressure, Shiba Inu is shifting from meme to meaningful—and securing its place as a top performing crypto in 2025. Choosing the Best Crypto Coins to Buy in 2025 If you’re scouting for the best crypto coins to buy , these four should be on your radar. XRP has momentum from legal clarity and institutional interest. Dogecoin keeps trending thanks to community power and whale support. Shiba Inu is proving its value with major transaction volume and burn mechanics. But BlockDAG stands out the most. It’s already raised over $213.5 million, has a user base of over 1 million mobile miners, and has delivered a 2,380% presale ROI—with more upside ahead. With a mainnet launch, toolset, and exchange listings all ahead in 2025, BlockDAG is leading the pack—and could be the next big thing before the presale window closes.

It looks past the noise and zeroes in on what’s quietly growing beneath the surface. Most people chase pumps. But the biggest gains come from spotting the ones that are already proving their worth. This isn’t about guesswork—it’s about recognizing momentum before it explodes. If you’re serious about finding the best crypto to buy now , these four—BNB, BlockDAG, XRP, and Toncoin—should be on your radar. 1. BlockDAG: 2,380% Gains and It’s Still Early While other projects wait for attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already cashing in. With $213.5 million raised , 19.1 billion coins sold , and a 2,380% price surge since its earliest presale batch, BDAG didn’t wait for validation—it earned it. This isn’t hype—it’s progress. The testnet is live. Over 200+ dApps are in development. And more than 1 million users are already mining BDAG through the X1 app. The roadmap? Not just filled with dreams—but real features like account abstraction , smart contract autonomy , and self-sovereign identity already being rolled out. At $0.0248 in Batch 27 , with forecasts hitting $30 by 2030 , BDAG isn’t a guess. It’s a working system that’s already rewarding early adopters. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now , BlockDAG might be the one you’ll wish you grabbed sooner. 2. BNB: Powerful Utility, But Capped Potential Binance Coin (BNB) still leads the pack when it comes to exchange-backed tokens. It fuels the Binance Smart Chain , runs on one of the most active platforms in crypto, and follows a smart deflationary model that burns tokens every quarter to tighten supply. It’s strong on fundamentals. But don’t expect fireworks. Even Binance’s internal outlook pegs BNB between $605 and $610 by the end of 2025. That’s not liftoff—it’s a steady cruise. For investors looking for solid footing and utility-based tokens, BNB stays on the shortlist of top cryptos to buy now —just don’t count on moonshots. 3. XRP: A Legal Win, But Still Waiting on Liftoff XRP isn’t just a survivor—it’s one of the few coins with a real-world mission: to revolutionize cross-border payments. And with Ripple’s major court win over the SEC, it’s finally breathing easier on the legal front. But price-wise, XRP hasn’t taken off yet. Currently trading at $1.67 after a 25% drop over the past month, it’s feeling the weight of global uncertainty and liquidation pressure. Analysts predict a rally to $3–$27 by 2025 , but warn that dipping below support could send it down to $1 or lower . Still, for anyone banking on utility and regulatory clarity, XRP is one of the best crypto to buy now —especially at these levels. 4. Toncoin: A Speed Demon with Long-Term Firepower Toncoin (TON) came out of Telegram’s blockchain experiment and has turned into a high-speed Layer-1 player. It’s built for scalability, low-cost execution, and performance—a dream for developers. Right now, TON is in the middle of a market correction, but analysts forecast a price between $2.14 and $3.20 by 2025. Long-term, it could hit $10 to $12 by 2030 , assuming traction keeps building. But here’s the catch: you need good timing. Get in during this correction, and TON could be your next big win. If you’re playing for growth, TON could be the best crypto to buy now —but only if you know when to strike. Which is the Best Crypto to Buy Now? These four projects are all making waves—but they’re not all riding the same current. BNB brings stability, but the upside is capped. XRP has legal clarity and global relevance but needs fuel to move. TON is built for speed, but success hinges on catching it at the right moment. BlockDAG , though? It’s already moving. It’s already delivering. With a working network, community adoption, and real ROI already in play, BDAG isn’t speculating on success—it’s stacking it. So if you’re asking what the best crypto to buy now looks like—it’s probably not the coin you keep watching. It’s the one already working while the others wait for a reason to run.

In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a key support zone that continues to hold firm, reinforcing the possibility of a bottom formation. Notably, the analyst said the price action has “respected the long-standing blue support line”, originally established around the “Trump rally breakout.” Current structure suggests a “possible bottom formation near this zone, supported by volume and historical price behavior.” With volume backing the move and historical price behavior aligning, BTCEarth believes the current structure may mark the early signs of a bullish turnaround for Bitcoin. Impending Price Recovery For Bitcoin? BTCEarth pointed out that the blue horizontal support line on his chart aligns closely with Bitcoin’s early breakout in September 2024. This level has since acted as a crucial support zone, having been retested multiple times throughout the past months. Notably, the most recent price touches at $74,434 and $74,588 appear to have formed another significant bottom.

If this structure holds, it could pave the way for a bullish reversal, especially as momentum and historical price behavior support a potential breakout from this area. BTCEarth also emphasized that Bitcoin is currently trading within a falling wedge pattern. In his chart, Line D serves as the support base while Line E marks the descending resistance. The price action has continued to compress within this narrowing structure, signaling a breakout on the horizon. He noted that a confirmed move above Line E, especially one sustained over multiple daily candle closes, would validate the pattern and confirm a bullish reversal. Such a breakout could set the stage for a stronger upward trend as traders recognize the shift in market structure. Key Resistance And Buying Zones BTCEarth highlighted that the accumulation zone between $74,000 and $75,000 remains intact, offering a favorable risk-reward setup for long positions. The immediate resistance lies at $80,000. Further resistance is found between $86,000 and $88,000, an area of historical consolidation and heavy volume. A breakout above this zone would significantly strengthen Bitcoin.

This level represents a psychological milestone and a crucial technical threshold. If Bitcoin builds enough momentum to clear it, it could pave the way for a fresh leg up in the long-term bullish cycle. In conclusion, BTCEarth highlighted that Bitcoin is stabilizing above a critical support zone, with the price structure suggesting a potential bottom formation. A breakout above Line E could spark a powerful bullish move toward the $88,000–$100,000 range. However, until this breakout occurs, caution remains crucial, and maintaining a hold strategy is advised.

Crypto expert Olivia Vande Woude says Avalanche will change the landscape for traditional finance as we know it. Avalanche Will Modernize Legacy RTGS Systems According to an X post , business development expert Olivia Vande Woude remarks that Avalanche will improve current offerings for mainstream finance. Right out the bat, Woude notes that the lowest hanging fruit for AVAX will be changing outdated rails in legacy finance. Woude argues that rather than a wholesale replacement, an Avalanche integration will improve legacy RTGS systems like SWIFT and Fedwire. Perhaps, the biggest area of improvement will be in conventional post-trade infrastructure bogged down by fragmented reconciliation. Woude notes that the network can introduce real-time finality and liquidity efficiency for post-trade infrastructure. Large exchange infrastructure is tipped to record seismic changes following an Avalanche integration, says Woude. While CBOE and ICE grapple with execution latency, Woud was Avalanche’s decentralization can reduce slippage for legacy exchanges. “Avalanche does for finance what fiber optics did for telecom,” said Woude. “It’s replacing outdated rails with real-time, high-throughput, low-latency execution.” Woude points out in her statement that Avalanche’s tamper-proof infrastructure will improve the batch processing systems employed by traditional custodians. The derivatives markets will receive their fair share of changes, leaning on Avalanche’s collateral optimization and margin logic based on advanced smart contracts. Amid soaring regulatory changes in the US, traditional financial institutions can unlock new revenue streams in tokenization via blockchain-based integrations. Benefits Extend To Funding Markets Amid Soaring AVAX Price Woude highlights the benefits of an integration in short-term funding markets by leaning on its dynamic discounting. Furthermore, the blockchain offers programmable yield analytics designed to revolutionize the operations of repo settlements and liquidity management in funding markets. An EVM compatibility will allow institutions to still deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts, smoothening the curve for tokenized funds. As the US SEC approves options trading for Ethereum spot ETFs, Avalanche can offer financial institutions permission chains for compliance while offering on-chain derivatives mirroring ETF performance. “Avalanche isn’t just modernizing financial infrastructure, it’s reprogramming it,” said Woude. “Institutions adopting Avalanche in turn gain a meaningful edge in speed, efficiency, and transparency.” AVAX price has gained nearly 8% over the last day driven by a broader crypto market rebound and rising institutional adoption for Avalanche. AVAX is trading at $20 while daily trading volumes have spiked by 7% buoyed by bullish chatter around the network.

The parties have asked the judge overseeing the matter to keep the case on hold amid “productive discussions” between their lawyers. The motion seeks to extend Judge Amy Beerman Jackson of the US District Court of Columbia’s stay, which she granted in February following a similar motion. “Continuing The Stay is Appropriate and In the Interest of Judicial Economy” According to a joint filing submitted to the court on April 11, the securities agency asked that the current pause be extended “…In light of these continued discussions and the time required for the staff to seek authorization from the [SEC] as necessary to approve any resolution or changes to the scope of this litigation."" Lawyers for the exchange agreed that ""...continuing the stay is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy."" Judge Jackson granted the parties’ initial request to pause the matter for 60 days in February 2025 after they had filed a similar joint motion. The initial request was based on the SEC’s duties to the new crypto task force established under the Trump Administration. The SEC’s crypto force is tasked with developing a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US. The stay was granted based on the SEC’s responsibilities. The document details: “The work of this task force may impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case…Accordingly, the SEC proposed a brief stay to Defendants, and the Defendants agreed that a stay is appropriate.” The latest joint filing read as such: “Since the Court stayed this case, the Parties have been in productive discussions, including discussions concerning how the efforts of the crypto task force may impact the SEC’s claims. In light of these continued discussions and the time required for the staff to seek authorization from the Commission as necessary to approve any resolution or changes to the scope of this litigation, the SEC requested that the Defendants agree to continue the current stay for an additional 60 days, and the Defendants agreed that continuing the stay is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy. At the end of the 60-day stay period, the Parties propose that they will submit another joint status report. A proposed order is attached hereto. Accordingly, the Parties respectfully request that the Court grant this Joint Motion to Continue the Stay.” The Original June 2023 Complaint The SEC filed its initial complaint against Binance, Binance.US, and Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao , for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies. Binance was not the only exchange to be targeted by the SEC under Chairman Gary Gensler’s rule. The SEC’s infamous 2023 crackdown included similar lawsuits against several other cryptocurrency exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase .

CPW, or cost per wallet, is deemed a higher “quality” metric because it tracks the cost of website visitors with a crypto wallet already installed in their browser. “Higher churn” rate may be to blame Nadler previously told Cointelegraph that their analysis data showed that users with a wallet are more likely to convert to crypto products. CPW across different regions during the bull markets in Q1 an Q4 of 2024. Source: Asaf Nadler Nadler said the high cost-to-return ratio of crypto gaming and gambling might be due to “higher churn, speculative behavior, and intense competition.” He added: “If Web3 gaming is truly “inevitable,” we need to find a more powerful UA engine to make it as sustainable as in Web2.” However, Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin said in an April 11 post on X that periods of high CPW are a good time to experiment. “Create new games/product lines, consolidate our market share, and get ready for the next market expansion,” Zirlin said. “Know when it's a coiling phase. Know when it's time to explode,” he added. Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Centralized Finance (CeFi) campaigns have it a lot easier with attracting new crypto users. “DeFi/CeFi campaigns are the most cost-efficient, with a median CPW of $2.79 and a lower quartile of just $0.10,” Nadler said. The results are based on 200 programmatic campaigns run on Addressable by over 70 advertisers, claiming to target an estimated 9.5 million users globally. CPW results across various sectors of the crypto industry. Source: Asaf Nadler It tracks how CPW varies across market cycles, regions, campaign strategies, and audience segments. Premium markets cost more to reach crypto users during downturns Nadler said that while premium markets experience low-cost conversions for existing crypto wallet holders during bull runs, attracting their attention becomes significantly more expensive during market downturns. Related: Trump kills DeFi broker rule in major crypto win: Finance Redefined He highlighted that in 2024, the US and Western Europe saw CPW increase by four times and 27 times, respectively, between Q1 and Q3, as the markets continued to consolidate and interest from crypto wallet holders waned. “While these markets provide scale and quality during bull runs, they become significantly more expensive when sentiment turns bearish, making them less sustainable during downturns,” Nadler said. Meanwhile, emerging markets like Latin America and Eastern Europe “offer exceptionally low CPW in favorable conditions but can experience extreme cost volatility.” Magazine: Bitcoin eyes $100K by June, Shaq to settle NFT lawsuit, and more: Hodler’s Digest, April 6 – 12",,EN,0,0,AXS|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-13 03:57:58

Traders take notice. The buzz around the Solana (SOL) technical analysis is heating up, especially with targets now locked in at $140. Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) price prediction is gaining steam after Trump’s trade delay helped lift sentiment and fuel a breakout attempt. But while both networks push for short-term gains, something bigger is playing out behind the scenes. BlockDAG just dropped its Keynote 3—and it’s turning heads across the market. The network has now raised $213.5 million without a single cent from venture capital. Backed entirely by over 170,000 early buyers, this isn’t just momentum—it’s infrastructure in motion. With 10,000 ASIC miners shipping, BlockDAG is building the backbone of a real crypto empire. It might just be the best crypto for 2025 before the crowd catches on. BlockDAG’s $213.5M Power Play: No VCs, Just Pure Momentum BlockDAG isn’t playing by the usual crypto playbook. While other networks lean on venture capital to stay afloat, BlockDAG has crossed $213.5 million in presale funding without a single VC involved. This milestone was confirmed in its Keynote 3 and signals something big—BlockDAG is being built from the ground up by over 170,000 individual buyers who see the potential before listings go live. Currently in batch 27, BDAG coins are selling at $0.0248, up from just $0.001 in batch 1. That’s a 2,380% increase in value so far. Over 19.2 billion coins have already been sold, and momentum hasn’t slowed. With a total supply of 50 billion, and just 10 billion allocated for presale, the window to grab a stake before listing is closing fast. The hype isn’t just about numbers—it’s about real infrastructure. BlockDAG has already started shipping 10,000 ASIC miners, which will power its upcoming decentralized network. Unlike cloud promises, this is hardware hitting the ground, backed by a hybrid DAG+PoW design. It’s not just a pitch—it’s a working plan, with miners, audits, and products already rolling out. For anyone searching for the best crypto for 2025, BlockDAG checks all the boxes: no VCs, real adoption, strong security, and one of the most active communities in crypto right now. The longer it stays under $0.03, the more it feels like a rare shot at pre-launch potential before the listings and hype fully kick in. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Bounce Signals 70% Upside Potential The recent rally in ADA has brought the spotlight back to the Cardano (ADA) price prediction after the coin jumped nearly 19% from $0.51 to $0.61. This move was triggered by a mix of factors—Trump’s 90-day tariff pause, easing inflation data, and a bullish technical setup. ADA is now testing a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, which typically signals a reversal. If it clears resistance around $0.70, the next target could be $0.74 and potentially $1.00. Technical indicators are also lining up. ADA recently hit oversold levels not seen in over a month and formed a bullish RSI divergence—both of which hint at continued upside. The last time it bounced from a similar level, the price surged over 53%. If that pattern repeats, the Cardano (ADA) price prediction could play out with a 70% upside from current levels. Key levels to watch are $0.65 as resistance and $0.46 as critical support. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis: Whale Move Triggers $140 Target Setup A major whale just bought 32,000 SOL worth $3.72 million—fueling a bounce that pushed the price from $95 to over $120. This return comes after a six-month break and has added serious momentum to the current move. The Solana (SOL) technical analysis shows a breakout from a falling wedge pattern that began in November 2024. If the price clears $125, targets at $132 and $140 are now on the radar. On the chart, $112 and $110 are the main support zones, with $105 acting as a line that could shift sentiment if broken. Despite SOL being down 33% since April 2024, buyers are stepping in at key levels. The RSI is still above 50, and a recent false breakdown below $112 has turned into a bullish setup. The Solana (SOL) technical analysis now leans toward a breakout continuation if resistance levels keep falling—and the whale’s conviction only adds to the case. Summing Up Cardano (ADA) price prediction is gaining traction again with a strong bounce and signs of a potential 70% rally if it breaks key resistance. Meanwhile, the Solana (SOL) technical analysis is pointing to a bullish setup backed by a whale’s $3.72M return and a breakout from a long wedge pattern. Both networks are showing strength, but the spotlight is shifting. BlockDAG just delivered one of the biggest updates in the space with its Keynote 3. It confirmed $213.5 million raised in its presale—all without VC funding. With 10,000 miners shipping, real infrastructure is going live, not just talked about. This kind of momentum from over 170,000 holders makes it a serious contender for the best crypto for 2025. For those looking to act before listings on major exchanges and prices move higher, BlockDAG’s current presale window might be the last low entry point for the best crypto for 2025 narrative.

While XRP continues to trade sideways, newer entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing trader attention with explosive growth , strong community traction, and powerful upside potential. This fast-growing altcoin project recently passed a major milestone, gaining over 12,500 early backers just weeks into its presale. With Stage 6 officially SOLD OUT , all eyes are now on Stage 7 , which just went LIVE , opening up a fresh wave of opportunity for investors looking to get in before the listing. EARLY-STAGE OPPORTUNITY VS. ESTABLISHED ALTCOINS That’s the kind of upside that’s increasingly rare in a market flooded with overvalued projects. Analysts have taken note, too. Several popular YouTubers and Twitter traders have called MAGACOIN FINANCE a “top altcoin to watch” , with one post highlighting it as “ one of the strongest early-stage opportunities we’ve seen this year .” WHAT MAKES MAGACOIN FINANCE DIFFERENT? Unlike many presales that fizzle out after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE has maintained a steady climb — both in user growth and hype. The project has passed 12,500 holders in record time, drawing attention for its rapid scaling and community-led approach. More importantly, it’s priced at a level that makes real ROI possible. While many altcoins now debut with inflated valuations, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the classic under-the-radar setup that early XRP and Solana investors once benefited from. With the listing price set at $0.007 , the potential from $0.0002908 represents more than 2,300% upside — a fact not lost on those seeking the next breakout altcoin . FINAL THOUGHTS: A MOMENT TO CONSIDER ROTATION? 🔓 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! As the broader market stabilizes, seasoned investors are starting to rotate into high-upside, low-entry presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks all the boxes: early-stage positioning, strong momentum, and an ecosystem being built for longevity. With Stage 7 now LIVE and the listing price locked in, it’s one of the few opportunities left where a 25x ROI isn’t just hype — it’s mathematically possible.

The Wall Street Journal, in a report published on April 11, cited unnamed sources suggesting that Zhao had cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) by offering to provide evidence on Sun. Zhao, now free after serving a four-month sentence for anti-money laundering violations , wasted no time addressing the allegations publicly. “WSJ is really TRYING here,” he wrote on X the next day. “They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t. People who become government witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected.” In the same post , Zhao hinted at foul play behind the scenes, implying the Journal may have been incentivized to publish a “hit piece.” According to him, multiple people had already tipped him off that such a story was in the pipeline. Sun Still Calls CZ a Mentor Justin Sun, who’s been the subject of ongoing scrutiny himself, responded calmly to the uproar. “I am not aware of the circulation rumors,” he said in an April 11 post, referring to the allegations. He went on to describe CZ as both a “mentor and close friend,” suggesting no friction between the two on record. Zhao, for his part, appeared to take the situation in stride but warned that such reports may not be isolated incidents. “I also heard some rumors about some players ‘lobbying’ against us again in the US,” he added , alluding to past efforts by FTX to tighten regulatory pressure on Binance. Back in November 2023, Zhao had claimed that FTX actively lobbied for a regulatory clampdown on Binance to grab market share, referencing a Federal Newswire report as evidence. Crypto Lobbying Fuels Distrust in Washington The controversy also comes on the heels of growing concerns over crypto industry influence in U.S. politics. According to a March report by the Center for Political Accountability, crypto-related entities have poured more than $134 million into the 2024 U.S. elections. While intended to shape a favorable regulatory landscape, these political contributions are now raising alarms over transparency and public trust.

Instead, the expert revealed that the current indicators point to the flagship crypto being in a bear market. Bitcoin/VIX Points To A Bear Market: Analyst In an X post, Severino warned that the Bitcoin/VIX isn’t bullish as some crypto influencers might paint it out to be. He remarked that the technical analysis of it suggests that the current signals are what market participants tend to see during Bitcoin bear markets. However, the expert noted that the month isn’t over yet, which suggests that these indicators could still turn bullish. Severino previously highlighted several reasons why he is no longer bullish on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Back then, he alluded to BTC’s chart, which, based on the Elliott Wave theory and other technical indicators, showed that the flagship crypto has likely topped in this market cycle. Amid Severino’s warning, crypto analysts like Saeed have offered a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Saeed stated that this correction is simply a healthy retracement and that the flagship crypto’s broader trend is still bullish. The analyst highlighted $85,000 as the level Bitcoin needs to break above to reach new highs. The macro side also looks to be bullish for Bitcoin at the moment. The latest CPI and PPI inflation data, which were released, came in lower than expectations, raising hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut soon. According to a recent report, Boston Fed President Susan Collins also assured that the US central bank is ready to help stabilize the market if necessary. With US President Donald Trump’s tariffs persisting, the US Fed might have to step in soon, which is bullish for Bitcoin and other crypto assets, as more liquidity will flow into them. Bullish Technical Analysis For BTC In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto revealed that Bitcoin is forming an inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern, although it still looks like a clean retest for now. He remarked that if this pattern plays out, the flagship crypto could reach $125,000 this year, marking a new all-time high (ATH). Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin is developing another Higher Low on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) while forming Lower Lows on the price. He noted that throughout the cycle, BTC has formed bullish divergences like this on a few occasions. This is a positive for the flagship crypto, as each divergence has always preceded reversals to the upside, indicating that BTC could again rally to the upside soon.

In a statement quoted by PANews, the SFC said: “…the CSRC is aware of the potential benefits of staking in enhancing the security of blockchain networks and allowing investors to earn returns from virtual assets in a regulated market environment.” HashKey May Now Launch Ethereum ETF Staking Service HashKey’s managing director, Terence Pu, explained that the SFC approval means HashKey may now offer staking services for spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “This approval is a milestone practice in Hong Kong's virtual asset regulatory innovation. HashKey Exchange has built a staking service system that meets regulatory requirements, taking the lead in providing ETH staking services for spot ETFs, and is actively promoting the provision of staking services to all customers. This service relies on HashKey Cloud's excellent node operation capabilities to provide users with safe and compliant staking services. In the near future, investors will not only be able to hold Ethereum ETFs to obtain staking income, but also directly hold ETH and obtain additional income through our staking services. In the future, we will continue to rely on Hong Kong's unique policy advantages to expand this service to more types of digital assets and provide the market with more compliant and diversified investment products,"" said Terence Pu.

This breakout attempt comes amid a whirlwind of macro and policy developments pushing capital into BTC. China’s Tariff Hike Pushes BTC to $85K Markets were rattled this week after China retaliated against U.S. tariffs , raising duties on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, with threats to expand coverage to another $144 billion. The escalation sent equities sliding—but Bitcoin surged, hitting $85,000 as investors looked for a safe haven amid growing geopolitical tensions.

Florida is proposing a bill to allow public funds to invest in Bitcoin, and North Carolina is working to recognize it as legal tender. These moves come as Bitcoin’s hashrate surged past 120 TH/s, reflecting rising institutional mining interest. The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart shows BTC is still in the “HODL” to “Still Cheap” zone, reinforcing analyst predictions of a climb toward $91,500 as demand rises. Trump Repeals IRS DeFi Rule, Boosting Crypto Sentiment In a major win for the crypto industry, President Trump signed off on the repeal of the IRS DeFi Broker Rule—a regulation that would’ve required decentralized platforms to report user transactions to the IRS. Initially set for 2027, the rule faced backlash for its privacy risks and technical impracticality. JUST IN: Trump signs a bill overturning an IRS rule that expanded the definition of a broker to include decentralized crypto exchanges.

Mike Carey and supported across party lines—marks the first crypto-specific law ever repealed via Congressional Review. Trump’s pro-crypto stance continues to inject confidence into the market, especially for DeFi and institutional players. Bitcoin Gets an Education Boost in the UK Adding to the bullish sentiment, Lomond School in Scotland has become the first UK school to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments, starting Fall 2025. The initiative is part of a broader plan to educate students about “sound money” principles rooted in Austrian economics.

The move mirrors efforts in the U.S., where universities like Wyoming and Austin are building BTC-focused academic programs and treasuries. This expansion into education strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term adoption story, especially among Gen Z. Bitcoin Technical Analysis – April 13, 2025 BTC/USD is holding strong at $84,700, just below resistance at $86,100—a level that marks the upper trendline of a long-term descending channel and a prior supply zone. Support: $82,900 and $80,700 Resistance: $86,100, followed by $88,600 and $90,900 50 EMA: Acting as dynamic support around $81,970 RSI: 61 — signaling strong momentum but nearing overbought levels If bulls can secure a daily close above $86,100 with convincing volume, Bitcoin could quickly target $92,800. On the flip side, a rejection may lead to a brief pullback, but the broader structure remains bullish. BTC Bull Presale: Earn Real Bitcoin with Every Price Milestone BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is gaining traction as one of the most exciting presales in crypto, combining meme culture with real utility. Designed for long-term holders, the token automatically rewards investors with real Bitcoin as BTC reaches major price thresholds—aligning community incentives with Bitcoin’s growth.

It was trading at $0.00001240, a few points above the year-to-date low of $0.00001080. This means that it remains sharply lower than last year’s high of $0.00004560. This article explores the potential scenarios for the coin. Shiba Inu price daily chart analysis The daily chart points to an eventual SHIB price breakout in the coming weeks. That’s because the coin has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.00001090, and whose neckline is at $0.00001565. A double-bottom is one of the most bullsh chart patterns. If this one works out well, there is a likelihood that it will bounce back, eventually to the neckline at $0.00001565, which is up by 25% from the current level. It will then rise to $0.00002030. This target is estimated by first measuring the depth of the double-bottom pattern, and then the same distance from the neckline. Shiba Inu price has also formed a giant falling wedge pattern, which is shown in blue below. This pattern comprises of two descending and converging trendlines. Historically, the pattern usually leads to a strong bullish breakout when the two lines near their convergence. Therefore, this pattern also points to a strong bullish breakout in the next few weeks.

However, the 3D chart points to a strong bearish breakdown in the coming weeks, especially if it loses the key support at $0.000010. The bearish outlook is mostly because the SHIB price has formed a double-top chart pattern at $0.0000333. This is a crucial pattern made up of two peaks and a neckline. In this case, the pattern’s neckline is at $0.000010, where it trades at today. Shiba Inu price has also collapsed below the 50-week day and 200-day moving averages, forming a death cross. Historically, this death cross is one of the most popular bearish signs in technical analysis. The last time that SHIB formed the death cross was in November 2022, and it plunged by almost 40% afterwards. Therefore, the 3D chart points to further downside in the coming days. This view will be confirmed if the coin crashes below the support at $0.0000107. Such a move will point to more downside, potentially to the key support at $0.0000054, its lowest level in May 2023. SHIB chart by TradingView Potential catalysts for Shiba Inu coin The daily and the 3D charts are sending mixed signals on the next Shiba Inu price outlook. Therefore, the next path could mainly be influenced by its fundamentals. There are signs that the crypto market will bounce back as investors embrace the new normal of high tariffs and recession. That’s because, despite all the challenges in the financial market, Bitcoin has remained above $80,000, a sign that bulls are providing it with a backstop. Further, the rising recession odds mean that the Federal Reserve will likely intervene in the market, especially now that inflation is falling. Analysts believe that the Fed may deliver more interest rate cuts than expected in the coming meetings. The crypto market often does well when the Fed has embraced easy money policies. Therefore, fundamentally, there is a likelihood that the first scenario of the daily chart will prevail.

These top-tier cryptos continue to lead in adoption and price action—but the most exciting opportunity in the market right now isn’t one of the giants. It’s MAGACOINFINANCE —a fast-growing altcoin project with a uniquely strong early-stage setup and powerful 25x ROI potential standing better than any of ETH, XRP or BTC.

DOGE and SHIBA INU have surged back into the spotlight with a combined weekly trading volume of over $3 billion , sparking renewed excitement across the crypto community. DOGE’s daily volume touched highs not seen since 2021 , while SHIBA is riding a new wave of momentum following ecosystem updates and increased social engagement. But as volume builds, the big question remains — can this momentum last , or are these meme giants peaking before the next wave of tokens takes over? SHIBA’S HISTORIC RUN: 60,000% FROM LOW TO HIGH For context, SHIBA’s rise from obscurity to the top ranks of the crypto market was nothing short of legendary. The token famously delivered a 60,000% ROI from its bottom to its all-time high — creating thousands of new millionaires during its 2021–2022 run. However, with SHIBA already up significantly and now trading billions in weekly volume, the window for massive exponential gains may be narrowing. The same applies to DOGE, whose growth has matured, making it less of a moonshot and more of a cultural mainstay. That’s why savvy investors are looking at the next breakout meme project with early-stage upside — and many believe they’ve found it. ENTER MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE NEW VIRAL MEMECOIN ON THE RISE As DOGE and SHIBA dominate headlines again, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves of its own — positioning itself as the next breakout meme project with real potential to mimic SHIBA’s iconic rise. Backed by a politically charged brand and a buzzing online community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is going viral fast across Telegram, YouTube, and Twitter/X. Unlike late-stage memecoins, this one is still in its early phase, giving investors a rare chance to get in under $0.0003 — a price point reminiscent of SHIBA’s early days. It’s already gaining traction, with crypto KOLs calling it “one of the most explosive early-stage meme tokens of 2025 ,” and its stage-based presale model is pushing engagement to new highs. COULD MAGACOIN FINANCE BE THE NEXT 60,000% WINNER? With SHIBA’s playbook in mind, some analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the one to deliver SHIBA-style returns in this cycle. Early entry, strong branding, and a socially driven ecosystem are all lining up to create a potential moonshot. Of course, nothing is guaranteed — but in a market where the big names are already deep into their cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of asymmetric opportunity that early SHIBA holders once had. FINAL THOUGHTS: TIME TO DIVERSIFY? ⚠️ FINAL HOURS: CLAIM 50% EXTRA BONUS — CODE MAGA50X DOGE and SHIBA are proving that meme season isn’t over — not by a long shot. But with weekly volumes now topping $3B , some traders are looking to reposition before the next meme frenzy begins. For those hunting the next SHIBA-style breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE might just be the alpha play. Early access, viral growth, and under-the-radar entry points under $0.0003 — the ingredients are there.

The asset remains tightly coiled within a narrowing range, holding above the critical $2.00 mark. Traders are closely monitoring Bollinger Band compression, a fresh MACD bullish crossover, and a neutral RSI (an alignment that often precedes a major move). As market momentum builds silently beneath this quiet price action, today’s session could prove pivotal in shaping XRP’s short-term trajectory. Tight Support Structure Reinforces Bullish Potential XRP is hovering slightly above $2.00, with immediate support sitting at $1.98. This zone has served as a key pivot in recent sessions, absorbing selling pressure and keeping the bullish structure intact. Should the price dip further, historical support levels at $1.94 and $1.82 offer additional cushion. These zones have historically attracted buyers during retracements, particularly in pre-breakout phases. Maintaining $1.98 support today will be crucial for sustaining the bullish bias. A breakdown below $1.94 could invalidate near-term upside potential and shift focus toward the $1.70 range. Bollinger Bands and MACD Align for Imminent Breakout One of the most compelling signs of potential movement lies in the Bollinger Bands, which are now at their tightest range in months. This squeeze pattern is a well-known precursor to significant volatility. Paired with a recent MACD bullish crossover—where the MACD line crosses above the signal line—the chart now reflects growing bullish momentum. Historically, similar technical combinations on XRP’s chart have resulted in multi-day rallies of 20–30%. If momentum continues to build today, an upside breakout toward the $2.30–$2.50 zone may unfold within the next 24–72 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 RSI Suggests Room for Expansion XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently parked around the 50 level, a neutral reading that reflects balance in buyer-seller momentum. This positioning gives the asset ample room to run should bullish pressure escalate. If RSI begins moving above 60, it would signal a strengthening uptrend (often a precursor to a confirmed rally). However, confirmation will ultimately hinge on volume. Despite bullish chart signals, trading volume remains modest. A true breakout must be backed by rising participation. Traders should watch for a spike in 4-hour or daily candle volume above $2.20 to confirm a valid move. Prediction for Today All indicators point to XRP being on the verge of a decisive move . If support at $1.98 holds and volume increases throughout today’s session, XRP could break resistance at $2.20 and test the $2.30–$2.50 region-yielding a potential 15% to 25% upside.. However, a failure to hold support and a high-volume breakdown below $1.94 would open the door to bearish targets around $1.82. For now, the technical setup favors bulls, but confirmation through volume and candle structure is critical. As XRP coils at a key inflection point, today’s price action may provide the first clues to its next significant leg.

But while XRP commands attention as a legacy giant navigating regulatory waves, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fast-growing altcoin project — one that analysts are calling an early-stage opportunity with serious upside potential. XRP: STILL A CROWD FAVORITE, BUT GAINS ARE LIMITED XRP continues to draw heavy attention, thanks to its high-profile legal battle with the SEC and the promise of becoming a bridge currency for global payments. Its massive community and institutional exposure ensure it stays in the spotlight — but most analysts agree: the days of 25x or 50x returns are likely behind it. For XRP to deliver that kind of return today, it would need to exceed a multi-trillion-dollar market cap — a stretch even in the most bullish scenarios. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE TOP ALTC0IN TO WATCH IN 2025 While XRP rides on legacy hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as the top altcoin to watch in 2025. With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , the momentum is undeniable. What’s turning heads? A listing target of $0.007 A current presale price (for those tracking) of $0.0002908 That’s a built-in ROI potential of over 25x — or 2,300% gains from early entry to public launch This level of structured growth and anticipation is what’s fueling daily spikes in search interest, especially from retail traders scanning for the next breakout . ANALYST PREDICTIONS: MAGACOIN COULD OUTPERFORM While XRP remains a popular hold, several top analysts have shifted focus to emerging opportunities with higher ceilings. Many now include MAGACOIN FINANCE in their lists of next 30x–35x plays , citing its organic community growth, market timing, and strategic launch phases as key strengths. With Stage 7 moving quickly, and listings expected in the coming weeks, the project continues to climb Google’s trending charts — not just as a curiosity, but as a serious contender in the altcoin arena. FINAL THOUGHTS: MOMENTUM SPEAKS LOUDER THAN HYPE 🔓 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! It’s clear why XRP is still in the conversation. But when it comes to explosive growth , search trends and analyst buzz suggest traders are turning to newer, leaner, and more dynamic tokens. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE — with its presale stages nearly gone, a path from $0.0002908 to $0.007 , and early signals of virality — is taking center stage.

As ETH treads water, a new wave of attention is shifting toward early-stage altcoin projects with stronger short-term upside — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that pack. This top altcoin to watch has just entered a new phase of its presale, with Stage 7 now LIVE following the complete sell-out of Stage 6 — a clear sign of rising demand and investor momentum. WHILE ETH COOLS, ALTCOINS HEAT UP Ethereum’s current sideways action is a stark contrast to the energy surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to attract hundreds of new holders daily. With more than 12,500+ backers onboard already, this fast-growing altcoin project is proving that early-stage opportunity still exists in crypto. And the numbers don’t lie: With a current presale price of $0.0002908 and a confirmed listing target of $0.007 , MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a clear 25x ROI potential — over 2,300% upside. ANALYST PREDICTIONS: MAGACOIN FINANCE COULD OUTPACE TOP 10 COINS Crypto analysts are paying close attention. In recent prediction roundups, several have included MAGACOIN FINANCE in their lists of next breakout altcoins , citing its rapid community growth, aggressive tokenomics, and strategic rollout. One popular YouTube analyst even claimed, “This is the kind of early-stage setup that turns into a 30x mover if momentum continues.” And that momentum is undeniable. Telegram chats are growing rapidly, X (formerly Twitter) threads are filling up with bullish speculation, and the token’s presale stages are selling out faster than expected — a rare signal in today’s cautious altcoin environment. IS THIS THE NEXT 100X ALTCOIN? ⚠️ FINAL HOURS: CLAIM 50% EXTRA BONUS — CODE MAGA50X Ethereum is a giant, but giants don’t move fast. For traders looking to multiply capital in Q2 of 2025 , early-stage picks like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a compelling case. Unlike the blue chips, this is a project still in its growth phase — a time when explosive growth is actually possible. With Stage 7 now LIVE , a listing price set at $0.007 , and fresh investor momentum daily, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a serious contender for those hunting the next big altcoin play .

Here’s How It’s Gaining Ground on Avalanche & Ethena,https://thecoinrise.com/is-blockdag-the-next-ethereum-heres-how-its-gaining-ground-on-avalanche-ethena/,"In crypto, standout performance always raises the bar. Recently, BlockDAG has emerged as the one setting that bar. While Avalanche focuses on speed and scalability, and Ethena experiments with synthetic stablecoins, both are facing mixed results. Avalanche has dealt with a significant price dip, and Ethena’s bold yield promises are drawing skepticism. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is gaining ground steadily, with a 2,380% return since batch 1 and $213.5 million already raised. As the conversation turns to which project could rival Ethereum, BlockDAG’s solid delivery and rising user support make it a name worth watching closely. Avalanche: Speed, Scalability, & Recent Market Movement Avalanche was designed to be a fast, flexible, and scalable blockchain network. It uses a unique consensus model that processes up to 4,500 transactions per second and allows developers to create custom subnets for different use cases. AVAX, the platform’s native token, plays a central role in transaction fees, staking, and governance. In terms of price, AVAX hit a peak of $65 in March 2024 but slipped to around $34.05 by January 28, 2025. That’s a decline of about 47.6%. Still, analysts are hopeful, with some predicting AVAX could rebound and climb to $110 before 2025 ends—an increase of over 220% from where it stands today. Ethena: Taking on DeFi with Synthetic Stability Ethena is making waves in DeFi by offering USDe, a synthetic stablecoin designed to mirror the dollar’s value by hedging Ethereum through perpetual swaps. Investors use ENA tokens for governance and utility on the platform. By late 2024, USDe had grown its supply to $6 billion in just 10 months, making it the third-largest USD-linked asset in crypto. The protocol also reached $1.2 billion in annualized revenue in its first year. In February 2025, Ethena raised $100 million privately to expand its DeFi suite and launch an institutional-grade stablecoin. However, ENA’s price hasn’t kept up with its earlier momentum. After a 63% rally in December 2024, experts noted that its near-300% yield expectations might not hold. Even so, Ethena’s plans show potential in connecting traditional finance and DeFi more effectively. BlockDAG: The Hidden Contender for the Next Big Crypto Title BlockDAG is quickly shaping up to be one of crypto’s most promising projects, thanks to strong numbers and buyer trust. So far, it’s pulled in $213.5 million during its presale, with over 19.2 billion coins sold. Now in batch 27 and priced at $0.0248, the coin has already delivered a 2,380% ROI from its initial batch—a signal that it’s doing more than just generating hype. The recent Keynote 3 pushed things even further, introducing the “Primordial” beta testnet and outlining a clear roadmap to mainnet. The team also launched the X1 Miner app, adding mobile mining to the mix. These updates helped bring in another $5 million in funding just days after the keynote—proof that BlockDAG’s appeal is growing fast. More importantly, BlockDAG is drawing early comparisons to Ethereum’s rise. While Bitcoin brought decentralization and Ethereum introduced smart contracts, BlockDAG is offering something different—scalability without losing speed or security. With this foundation, it’s aiming to power the next generation of dApps, payments, and enterprise-level blockchain solutions. What Sets BlockDAG Apart in This Comparison? Looking at all three projects, a few things become clear. Avalanche has strong tech, but its market movement has been shaky. Ethena grew fast, but its future yield sustainability is in question. BlockDAG, however, is building steadily—with results to show for it. Raising $213.5 million, selling 19.2 billion coins, and delivering a 2,380% ROI—these aren’t projections. They’ve already happened. Add in real updates like a working testnet and a live mobile mining app, and BlockDAG is making a strong case. If the next Ethereum is going to rise based on real-world results, BlockDAG may already be leading the race.

Crypto analysts are now offering their thoughts on what is driving the largest altcoin’s recent woes. Related Reading: From Joke To Juggernaut: Dogecoin Value Revolution Gets Nod From Global Asset Giant Bankless Cofounder Points To Community Attitude Problems David Hoffman, a co-founder of Bankless, has turned to social media site X to opine about Ethereum’s price issues. In Hoffman’s view, the actual problem isn’t what most mainstream critics have their attention on – rather, he thinks that Ethereum’s leadership and community culture are driving users away. Hoffman pointed to two particular instances of this issue: public expulsion of ETH staking platform Lido Finance and the brutal treatment of some traders who were referred to as “degenerate.” He asserts these actions demonstrate a trend of alienating users and builders on the network. ‘Stop Policing Behavior,’ Hoffman Says The cryptocurrency executive contends that Ethereum’s effort to manage user activity on what is supposed to be a permissionless blockchain has emerged as a central reason for its price drop. Everyone is midcurving why ETH’s price performance has sucked Ethereum leadership and culture have alienated users and builders by being hostile to its own app layer. We publicly exorcised @LidoFinance. We’ve shunned traders and degens. On a permissionless chain, we’ve tried… — David Hoffman (@TrustlessState) April 12, 2025 “If we want ETH to grow, the EF and larger community need to begin bringing in users and builders, not driving them away with a holier-than-thou culture,” Hoffman wrote in his post. According to reports, the Lido Finance platform has in the past received strong criticism from the Ethereum community regarding regulatory issues, centralization, and security concerns. On the other hand, some traders were accused of creating high gas prices and failing to back long-term projects. Ethereum Price Indicates Signs Of Recovery In spite of all this, Ethereum’s price has demonstrated a little life in the form of a 3% jump within a 24-hour time frame. This arrives at a vital juncture, as ETH had reportedly reached a five-year low in correlation to Bitcoin. There are some believers among the community. Leo Glisic is one of them who hopes for positive upside on Ethereum given its position as “infrastructure” for the future global financial system. In the opinion of Glisic, “Ethereum will be the settlement and interoperability layer, which is a winner-take-all market.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Takes Aim: Ethereum’s True Value?

BNB was trading at $592 on Sunday, up by about 18% from the lowest level this year. This article explores the potential scenarios for the Binance coin ahead of the Lorentz upgrade. BSC Lorentz hard fork ahead The next important catalyst for the BNB price is the upcoming Lorentz upgrade and hard fork. In an X post, the developers noted that the opBNB hard fork would happen on April 21 this year. It will be followed by the BSC hard fork on April 29. BNB Chain Developers @BNBChainDevs · Follow Lorentz mainnet hardforks are coming:• opBNB → April 21 @ 03:00 AM UTC• BSC → April 29 @ 05:05 AM UTCTestnet is live with faster blocks. Node operators + devs, make sure you’re ready.Full details in the post below 👇 12:00 AM · Apr 13, 2025 12 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies The goal of the Lorentz hard fork is to make the network faster as it seeks to become a better alternative to Ethereum and Solana. The Lorentz hard fork comes a month after the developers implemented the Pascl hard fork. Pascal’s goal was to help it integrate more with Ethereum, the biggest chain in the crypto industry. It improved the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, optimized gas fes abstraction, and added a feature to avoid block calculation errors. The Lorentz upgrade’s goal is to dramatically reduce the block times of the BSC Chain to about 1.5 seconds. It will then be followed by the Maxwell upgrade that will drop the block times further from 1.5 to 0.75. These upgrades will make the BSC Chain one of the fastest chains in the crypto industry. Historically, crypto prices do well ahead of a major network upgrade. Most notably, BSC hopes to be the best alternative to Solana and Ethereum . Solana’s network has become clogged by meme coins, while Ethereum is being destroyed by layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum.

This staking market cap rose by 1.3% in the last 24 hours to over $18 billion. It has brought the staking ratio to 20.8%.Recent data by StakingRewards shows that the inflows have increased gradually. BNB has a staking yield of about 3.5%, making it higher than Ethereum’s 3.14%. At the same time, BNB has become one of the most deflationary tokens in crypto. It achieves this by its real-time burn mechanism that incinerates hundreds of tokens worth over $366k a week. This burn is derived from the gas fees the network handles. The network also has a quarterly burn that incinerates tokens worth over $1 billion a quarter. These token burns will continue in the foreseeable future as the network works to reduce the number of coins from over 144 million to 100 million.

It has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern whose two trendlines are nearing their confluence level. This triangle can break out in either direction. The BNB price has also formed a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have crossed each other. This pattern often leads to a bearish breakdown over time. At the same time, the ongoing consolidation is part of the formation of the handle section of the cup and handle pattern on the weekly chart. Therefore, the outlook for the BNB price is neutral for now. More gains will be confirmed if the BNB price surges above the key resistance level at $720, the highest swing in June.

The Dogecoin ETP will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, trading under the ticker DOGE. A Grand Display of the Growing Support for DOGE Asset manager 21Shares AG (“21Shares”) announced that it formed an “exclusive partnership” with the House of DOGE to create the only Dogecoin ETP endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation. In a press release, 21Shares said the ETP will trade under the ticker ‘DOGE’ and will list on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The partnership underscores the meme coin’s growing support. It marks the first significant milestone “in bringing institutional grade exposure to Dogecoin, one the most community driven and widely recognised digital assets.” The asset manager submitted an S-1 registration statement for its 21Shares Dogecoin ETF to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 9, 2025. If successful, the proposed fund would grant investors direct exposure to DOGE’s price movements without having to own the underlying asset. In its press announcement, 21Shares said, ""21Shares Dogecoin ETP is 100% physically backed, offering a transparent and seamless way for investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through traditional financial channels.” Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged in popularity since its launch in 2013 to become one of the “most widely recognised and accessible cryptocurrencies, known for its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and increasing merchant adoption.” Dogecoin (DOGE) Could Become a Global Currency The House of DOGE, the official corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, is reportedly committed to marketing the ETP when it launches to reinforce DOGE’s role in mainstream media. In the statement announcing the partnership, Jens Wiechers, Co-Executive Director of the Dogecoin Foundation, commented: “For Dogecoin to reach its full potential as a global currency, institutional support and corporate partnerships are essential. This initiative with 21Shares provides a regulated path for institutions to participate in and amplify the ‘Dogecoin is Money’ vision, while still honoring the community’s spirit. Global adoption is critical, and we’re excited to take this next step – ensuring Dogecoin stays fun, but gains the credibility and backing needed to thrive at scale.” Commitment to Expanding Investor Access to Innovative, Community-Driven Assets While DOGE’s technical advantages are commendable, Dogecoin has also successfully built a “highly engaged and socially impactful community” based on a guiding principle of “Do Only Good Everyday.” Duncan Moir, President at 21Shares, said: “Registered investment vehicles are essential for broadening access to digital assets, and Dogecoin’s growing adoption underscores its significance in the crypto ecosystem. By partnering with the House of Doge, we are taking a pivotal step in bringing transparent and institutional-grade investment options to the market. This move reflects our commitment to expanding investor access to innovative and community-driven assets while maintaining the highest regulatory and operational standards.” Sarosh Mistry, President and CEO of Sodexo North America and Director-Elect of House of Doge, also commented on the partnership. “Our partnership with 21Shares demonstrates the evolving maturity and legitimacy of Dogecoin in the financial world. Institutional products will empower new types of investors to participate in the Dogecoin ecosystem, reinforcing its role as a leader in the future of digital assets.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BTC price recovered and gained a hold above $84K following a crash to as low as $74K in the past 7 days. Simultaneously, other tokens like ETH, Solana, and XRP also illustrated a price rebound, keeping investors slightly hopeful about future movements amid macro uncertainty. Following immense macro heat fueled by Donald Trump’s tariffs saga, risk assets have recovered amid a halt on newly imposed tariffs and other developments. Mentioned below are some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Weekly Crypto Highlights: BTC & Altcoins Recover As of press time, BTC price exchanged hands considerably above $84K, up by nearly 1.5% in the past seven days. Further, ETH, SOL, and XRP prices gained roughly 2%-7% over the week. This recovery-like movement comes against the backdrop of a stockpile of optimistic developments. Notably, macro pressure on risk assets like crypto lessened slightly as the U.S. CPI came in cooler than Wall Street expectations this week. US CPI cooled to 2.4% in March, offering the crypto market some relief after turmoil caused by Trump’s Tariff policy. On the other hand, Donald Trump recently announced that tech products will be exempted from China tariffs . While an already ongoing halt on the newly imposed tariffs has offered the market some relief, this news has further garnered investor curiosity, lessening trade war tensions. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink rattled the broader market recently by warning of a looming U.S. recession soon. Given this happens, cryptocurrencies could leverage substantially as the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to inject more liquidity in order to stimulate the economy. Other Major Highlights This Week Additionally, whale activity across the broader crypto market soared remarkably in the past seven days, signaling renewed market interest amid price recovery. CoinGape reported that Ripple whales moved a staggering $414 million worth of XRP over the past week, sparking investor speculations. Simultaneously, Dogecoin whales were also recorded to have accumulated 1.83 billion DOGE coins over the past week. The massive buying by Dogecoin whales falls in line with 21Shares’ recent filing for a Dogecoin ETF, echoing market optimism. Another buzz-worthy update over the week includes Japan introducing new crypto regulations , underscoring support for the sector. Mentioned above were the top crypto highlights for this week, which appeared to have considerably impacted investor sentiment globally.

As this deadline fast approaches, crypto traders are looking for the best altcoins to buy to make significant gains once demand for digital assets rises. The recent remarks by Senator Scott coincide with a notable recovery across the crypto market today, April 13. At press time, Bitcoin and all the top ten altcoins were edging higher as the total crypto marketcap reached $2.79 trillion. This rally may extend in the coming months as the US emerges as a leading crypto hub. According to Senator Scott , the pending crypto bills will ensure that the US dominates the digital asset space. The statement also comes after US President Trump signed the first crypto-related bill . The bill, which was signed earlier this week, seeks to remove tax reporting requirements in the DeFi industry. Top Altcoins to Buy Before August With the US emerging as one of the most pro-crypto countries, the top altcoins to buy today for investors to make significant gains are Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Pi Network (PI). Ripple (XRP) XRP is one of the top altcoins to buy today. One of the reasons that makes Ripple a good buy is that it is the largest US-made altcoin by market cap. Therefore, as the US crypto regulatpry framework changes, XRP is well-positioned to benefit. The four-hour XRP price chart suggests the altcoin is in an uptrend. The RSI has risen to 63 showing a prevalence of buying pressure. Meanwhile, the MACD line and green histogram bars support the bullish thesis. If the uptrend continues, XRP price may flip resistance at $2.23. Doing so will trigger a 17% rally to the 161.8% Fibonacci level of $2.61. If Ripple reaches This level, it might pave the way for more gains to new highs above $3. XRP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Solana (SOL) Solana also ranks among the best altcoins to buy today. SOL trades at $132 today. April 13 after a 10% increase in 24 hours. Analyst Momin has shared a bullish Solana price prediction saying the altcoin might rally to $180 in the coming weeks. The analyst also added that Solana is on the verge of making a decisive close above $120 on the weekly chart. If this happens, it will spark a Solana price rally towards $180. Additionally, Solana price has breached the upper trendline of a descending trendline, showing that the bullish momentum is strong, which may spark a surge to $257. Solana Price Chart Pi Network (PI) Pi Network price had posted a 15% gain at press time. Data from CoinMarketCap also shows that trading volumes have increased by 200% to over $663 million as buyers purchased the asset. One of the reasons why Pi Coin is one of the best altcoins to buy ahead of the crypto bills being passed is the asset’s rising presence in the US. The altcoin will be adopted as a means of payment by firms like Zito Realty. At the same time, Chainlink has added Pi Network token to its Data Streams, making it more accessible. Pi Coin is trading within an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour price chart, which shows a positive outlook. At the same time, the AO histogram bars and the RSI are tipping north, which supports a bullish Pi Network price forecast . PI/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Summary of Top Altcoins to Buy The US will pass most of the pending crypto bills before August according to the Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott. Once these bills are passed, the crypto market is poised to make significant gains. The top altcoins to buy today to position yourself for these gains are XRP, SOL and Pi Coin.

The argument moves away from the traditional focus on payments and instead points to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as the primary long-term driver of XRP’s price. According to the post, this transition has the potential to radically alter the token’s supply and demand dynamics by permanently locking up large volumes of XRP. EXPLOSIVE ATTENTION XRP HOLDERS: This post will completely change how you think about XRP and where its true value lies. It’s not just for payments anymore… What comes next is the real catalyst. This is a long post, so let’s get started… What if I told you the… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 12, 2025 Tokenization as the Core Utility Driver At the heart of the post is the process of tokenization, defined as the conversion of tangible assets—such as real estate, bonds, or commodities—into digital tokens issued and managed on XRPL. These tokens are described as programmable, globally tradable, settled within 3–5 seconds, and transferred for an average cost of $0.0002. For example, a $1 million house can be tokenized into 1 million HOUSE tokens. Through XRPL’s decentralized infrastructure, users can purchase fractional shares, earn yield, and trade these tokens using XRP as the underlying asset. All Things XRP emphasized that the real significance lies not in XRP’s movement as a transaction token but in how XRP is locked and removed from circulation in various mechanisms essential to tokenization. This forms the crux of the argument—that XRP is being taken “off the table” permanently and that this structural lock-up is the real catalyst for future price appreciation. Mechanisms of XRP Lock-Up The post describes three key mechanisms through which XRP is locked within the tokenization process. First, Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools hold XRP in smart contracts to enable liquidity for trading between token pairs such as XRP and tokenized real estate assets. This is identified as the most significant contributor to XRP lock-up. Second, XRP can be deposited as collateral in decentralized lending protocols. Although stablecoins like RLUSD may become prominent in these environments, All Things XRP argues that XRP will continue to play a central role, especially as decentralized finance expands on XRPL. Third, XRP is required in small amounts to open accounts and establish trust lines—specifically, 1 XRP per account and 0.2 XRP per trust line. While seemingly minor at the individual level, this demand becomes meaningful at scale. A concrete example is offered involving the tokenization of a $1 million property, with an XRP/HOUSE AMM pool seeded with 24,390 XRP. As users enter the market and swap XRP for HOUSE tokens, more XRP enters the pool and remains locked. If replicated across 1,000 similar properties, this single-use case alone could result in 24.39 million XRP being locked. Quantifying the Long-Term Impact The post cites projections from Ripple that place the total value of tokenized assets at $6 trillion by 2025. If XRPL captures just 10% of that market—$600 billion—then based on current mechanisms, approximately 17.58 billion XRP could be locked: 14.6 billion in AMMs, 2.9 billion in lending, and 20 million in reserves. This would represent over 30% of the current circulating supply of XRP. Looking ahead, the post extrapolates to 2033, when global tokenized assets could reach $18.9 trillion. If XRPL’s market share reaches 15%, approximately 28.37 billion XRP could be locked. That would amount to nearly half of the total circulating supply, fundamentally altering the token’s availability and market dynamics. A Structural Shift in XRP’s Narrative All Things XRP concludes that this phenomenon should not be seen as theoretical or speculative. It is instead presented as an inherent result of XRPL’s design. As more real-world assets are tokenized, more XRP is absorbed into the ecosystem and locked permanently. According to the post, this structural supply reduction constitutes a slow but inevitable supply shock that will support XRP’s price growth over time. The argument places XRP’s evolving utility in the context of broader financial infrastructure, asserting that the token’s long-term appreciation will be driven less by retail speculation or transactional volume and more by its embedded role in a growing global market for tokenized assets. The commentary ends by asserting that the payment narrative surrounding XRP is merely the beginning and that real-world asset tokenization is the true story behind the asset’s future trajectory.

Market experts anticipated a scenario where participants would flock to the leading cryptocurrency as macro conditions affect stocks; however, the opposite has been the case. Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, insisted in an X post that, against popular opinion, bitcoin is not yet digital gold. However, he sees a silver lining in this situation. Not Digital Gold Yet Bitcoin has been named digital gold because of its security, limited supply, and generally believed role as a store of value. These characteristics are similar to gold’s, which has a finite supply that enhances its value as a long-term store of wealth. As global economic tensions, triggered by trade tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, began in February, many market experts believed BTC would record a significant inflow of capital due to investors leaving the stock market for cryptocurrencies. Even Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, thinks the economic chaos stemming from Trump’s tariffs would lead to a monetary easing cycle that will be bullish for BTC. While the market awaits the manifestation of such predictions, cryptocurrencies have been hit just as hard as stocks in the past two months, with BTC recording its deepest correction in this cycle. Ju said tariff experts on X have been “playing 6D chess” since the macro issues began. He explained that uncertainties like this drive demand for safe-haven assets, insinuating that BTC is not seen as such yet. Proof of the CryptoQuant founder’s opinion is that gold has surged by 11% since Trump returned to the White House, while BTC is down more than 25% over the same period. BTC Now in Bear Season Despite bitcoin’s questionable status as digital gold, Ju believes the good news is that BTC will eventually surpass gold’s $20 trillion market cap. The cryptocurrency’s market cap currently sits at $1.6 trillion. Additionally, the CryptoQuant CEO insisted that BTC has entered a bearish phase but is still bullish about the asset’s long-term potential. Ju’s short-term bearish bias for BTC substantiates his claim that the cryptocurrency has wrapped up its bull run for this cycle. Less than a month ago, he said every on-chain metric signals that BTC is in a bear market, so investors should expect 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action, especially with fresh liquidity drying up.

From Dogecoin to SHIB, they’ve taken on many forms but until now, none have entered the space with a sports-first identity. XYZVerse changes that. Billed as the first-ever all-sports meme coin, XYZVerse is attempting something new in a saturated sector. While the meme coin space is often driven by internet culture and hype, this project takes a more structured approach, aiming to merge global sports fandom with community-based token utility. Nothing quite like XYZVerse has been created before. Its goal is to tap into the emotional energy of sports culture — loyalty, rivalry, identity — and channel it through a decentralized meme coin ecosystem. Whether this experiment of blending sports, memes, and crypto catches on at scale remains to be seen — but with the next bull cycle on the horizon, XYZVerse enters the conversation as a unique case to watch. XYZVerse In a Nutshell The project is currently in its presale phase, with $XYZ tokens offered at a discounted rate of $0.003333 ahead of its planned exchange listing. It has also gained early attention for its upcoming large-scale airdrop campaign and strong user sentiment across platforms like CoinMarketCap , where the majority of user votes skew bullish. Community support has been a major driver of its early momentum. With thousands of users actively following the project across social platforms and over $13 million raised in its presale (now in Stage 12 out of 15), XYZVerse has positioned itself as a meme coin with both traction and substance. Learn more about XYZVerse and explore early entry while the presale is live. What sets the project apart further is the early recognition it has received: XYZVerse was awarded Best New Meme Project by crypto.news, a well-known industry media outlet. This distinction adds credibility to its growing reputation as a serious contender in the meme coin space. In terms of security, XYZVerse has taken proactive measures by undergoing comprehensive smart contract audits from both Pessimistic and SolidProof — two respected names in blockchain security. These audits are designed to ensure code safety, transparency, and a lower risk profile for early participants. Security-checked and community-backed—explore $XYZ now How Could XYZ Become the Next SHIB? Of course, any new meme coin inevitably draws comparisons to the giants that came before it — and few names loom larger than Shiba Inu (SHIB). Launched in 2020 with no initial utility and minimal exposure, SHIB became a global phenomenon, rising from obscurity to reach a multi-billion-dollar market cap. It was driven not by advanced tech or partnerships, but by community strength and social virality — the same conditions XYZVerse is hoping to recreate, albeit through a very different thematic lens. While SHIB tapped into meme culture and the legacy of Dogecoin, XYZVerse is leaning into the world of sports fandom , attempting to build a tribe around a different kind of identity: one rooted in team spirit, competition, and global appeal. How does XYZVerse compare to SHIB? Let’s take a look: Feature XYZVerse ($XYZ) Shiba Inu (SHIB) Launch Stage Currently in presale (Stage 12 of 15) Launched in August 2020 Token Price $0.003333 (presale price) ~$0.0000000005 at launch Planned Listing Price $0.10 N/A Token Supply Capped, no future minting planned Quadrillion-level total supply Theme / Branding All-sport meme coin with broad cultural appeal Dog-themed meme coin based on Dogecoin parody Utility Partnership with Bookmaker.XYZ betting platform, and a planned launch of a play-to-earn app Initially none (later added ShibaSwap & NFT use) Airdrop Campaign 10% of total supply reserved for airdrops No structured airdrop at launch Ecosystem Plans Future gamification, platform integration, DAO-based Developed later: DEX, NFT, metaverse initiatives Market Entry Timing Entering ahead of a bull cycle Launched before and surged during 2021 bull run While XYZVerse enters a very different market climate than SHIB did in 2020, there are clear similarities that point to its potential for outsized success — and a few distinct advantages that could help it avoid some of SHIB’s early limitations. Shared Strengths: What They Have in Common Community Focus : Both projects place heavy emphasis on building a strong, active community. SHIB’s rise was fueled almost entirely by retail enthusiasm and online virality — XYZVerse is tapping into similar grassroots momentum, with 95% of CoinMarketCap voters currently expressing a bullish outlook. Meme Appeal : Like SHIB, XYZVerse isn’t pretending to be just another utility token. It embraces the power of internet culture — but instead of dog-themed memes, it leans into global sports fandom to unify a broad audience under one banner. Early Opportunity : Just as SHIB rewarded those who got in before mainstream awareness hit, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase , offering early access pricing that mirrors the kind of positioning early SHIB holders once had. Where XYZVerse Has an Advantage Structured Tokenomics : Unlike SHIB’s quadrillion-level supply and inflationary start, XYZVerse features a capped supply with no future minting planned — a model designed to support price sustainability and limit dilution. Defined Utility from Day One : While SHIB added real utility (like ShibaSwap and NFTs) much later, XYZVerse entered the market with a clear roadmap, staking rewards, and airdrop mechanics already in place. Airdrop-Fueled Growth : 10% of XYZ’s total supply is reserved for airdrops — an incentive strategy that SHIB didn’t have at launch. This not only rewards early community members but helps boost engagement and wallet distribution in a targeted way. Market Timing : XYZVerse is launching ahead of what many analysts believe could be the next bull cycle. If momentum builds as the broader market recovers, XYZ could benefit from strong tailwinds, similar to how SHIB did during its 2021 surge. In short, XYZVerse shares the meme-powered DNA that helped SHIB go viral, but it’s entering the space with more structure, strategic planning, and a broader thematic base. Final Thoughts SHIB’s story proves that small beginnings can lead to explosive outcomes. XYZVerse may not be on every radar yet, but those watching closely see a familiar pattern taking shape. The real question is whether the conditions that led to SHIB’s success can align again in 2025, this time in favor of XYZVerse. Though nothing is guaranteed, the early indicators (including a capped supply, defined roadmap, and strong presale momentum) suggest the project is attempting to position itself on a similar track — but with a clearer structure from the start.

They will use cryptocurrencies.” According to CZ, as AI continues to evolve, it will build on the technological foundations laid by the internet and blockchain. CZ envisions a future where AI agents, or automated digital assistants, perform everyday tasks like booking flights and hotels. These agents will interact and transact with other AI services, relying on blockchain networks for faster, cheaper, and more efficient payments.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 49,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin appears to have broken out of a W pattern on the four-hour chart. A W pattern is typically seen as a bullish reversal structure, as it suggests that an asset has printed a price floor after bouncing from a key support level twice. “We had a break of the W and then a throwback, a throwback being a bullish retest from above. This looks pretty conducive, and this type of price action tells me, ‘Okay, we might be front running $72,000.’ Giving me a little bit of a confidence was a shift in equities markets, and the idea that price was at the MA (moving average) 50, and that’s been support.” Cheds also says that Bitcoin will likely see higher prices as long as its immediate support level between $78,500 and $81,000 holds. “Regain $81,000 and we’re back in business… Back above $81,000, we’re back with the idea of regaining that low time frame pivot corresponding with the high time frame support at the MA50, and with the idea that the bulls are going to recapture the trend, which is the rising MA200.” Source: Cheds/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $85,301.

Bulls might be stepping in pic.twitter.com/dGTbaCMUoa — Ali (@ali_charts) April 12, 2025 Futures traders on the world’s largest exchange, on the other hand, have opened mostly short positions, with over 56% of all trades hoping for a price decline. However, history shows that BTC tends to do the opposite of what the crowd expects from it, especially on the derivatives scene. Tech Aspects While the long-standing battle between bulls and bears continues in full force , Martinez noted that bitcoin has managed to ‘slice through’ the first significant resistance in its way toward price redemption – the 50-day SMA, which is around $84,500. Although BTC is yet to fully overcome that level as it sits next to it now, the overall bullish momentum in the past few days suggests more gains are to come. If BTC indeed passes through this line, the next major obstacle will be the 200-day SMA at $87,250. Should that fall, the cryptocurrency could surge toward $94,000, Martinez added. #Bitcoin $BTC is slicing through the 50-day SMA. The next key hurdle is the 200-day SMA at $87,250, and a breakout there could pave the way to $94,100. pic.twitter.com/uO9d9Bhbdq — Ali (@ali_charts) April 12, 2025 The post 3 Bullish Signs for Bitcoin as BTC Hits $85K, Says Analyst appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Bull Run,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-13 07:11:28

Pompliano foresees more will realize data is “inaccurate” “The unspoken secret as to why so many finance folks are wrong in their analysis of the tariffs is because the finance folks believe the government data,” he added. Amid the widespread uncertainty and ongoing fear over US President Donald Trump’s imposed tariffs, Pompliano questioned the accuracy of US inflation figures, job numbers, and GDP statistics. He added that “eventually everyone else will realize the data is inaccurate.” It comes after Pompliano pointed out in a March 20 LinkedIn post, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s appearance on the All-In podcast, where Bessent was asked directly if he trusted the data — and replied, “no.” “Even the Treasury Secretary has now publicly acknowledged he doesn’t believe the data. He says we must listen to the people rather than blindly follow the government data reports.” Concerns about the reliability of US economic data have been brewing for a while. A July 2024 report argued that new approaches are needed to “ensure government statistics remain dependable.” Source: Anthony Pompliano It comes as ongoing concerns over Trump’s imposed tariffs have led some crypto analysts to reinforce the idea that Bitcoin could outlast the US dollar in the long run. Bitwise Invest head of alpha strategies Jeff Parks said on April 9 that there is a “higher chance Bitcoin survives over the dollar in our lifetime after today.” Over the past five days, the US dollar index (DXY) has dropped 3.19%, currently sitting at 99.783 at the time of publication, according to TradingView data. The US dollar index is down 8.06% since the beginning of 2025. Source: TradingView Several Wall Street analysts were under the belief that Trump’s imposed tariffs would bolster the US dollar, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report . Pompliano said, “The mainstream finance conversation has become an intellectual boondoggle where most people regurgitate ill-informed takes based on bad data.” Analysts recently pointed out Bitcoin’s recent breakaway from stocks Meanwhile, analysts recently pointed out that while the stock market was “tanking” on April 4 amid tariff uncertainty, Bitcoin didn’t decline as much as expected .

Analyst Shares Bullish Historical Patterns,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-targeting-19-or-45-analyst-shares-bullish-historical-patterns/,"Egrag Crypro, a prominent crypto analyst, has shared a detailed chart analysis suggesting that XRP could reach $19 or $45.83 based on historical patterns. Using a combination of historical chart data and exponential and simple moving averages, Egrag outlined a case for a dramatic move upward in the coming months. In the post, Egrag emphasized that his forecast was not speculative improvisation but rather an interpretation of technical structures. He stated, “Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t,” emphasizing his reliance on historical price action and recurring technical behavior to justify the projected targets. He added that while the patterns are not guaranteed to repeat exactly, the probabilities become meaningful when the same behaviors and timelines appear more than once in market history. #XRP – Targeting $19 or $45? Charts Men lie, women lie, but charts don’t! I’m not improvising here; I’m relying on historical data to present future predictions. Will it rhyme exactly? No, because if it were that easy, everyone would be a multimillionaire! Human… pic.twitter.com/YasA4k98fd — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 11, 2025 Patterns From 2017 and 2021 Inform Current Outlook The analysis focused on the behavior of the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA) and the 33-period moving average (MA), plotted on a two-week timeframe. Egrag highlighted the significance of a repeated 777-day bottoming structure observed both in the 2017 and 2021 cycles, each followed by substantial upward movements. He labeled this reoccurring duration as a key factor in predicting market timing for potential blow-off tops. In 2017, XRP surged by approximately 2,722% following a bottoming phase and a bullish technical crossover, reaching $3.25. In 2021, the price saw a 1,052% gain, hitting $1.81 after similar technical conditions were met. Egrag pointed out that both events were preceded by bearish crosses on the moving averages and were followed by recoveries that led to massive upside movements. He argues that XRP is now completing a comparable pattern. According to the chart, the most recent bullish crossover has occurred. If XRP follows a similar trajectory as in 2017, it could rise by another 2,722%, placing the target price around $45.84. If the 2021 pattern repeats, a 1,052% gain would lead to a price near $19.07. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Technical Zones and Investor Behavior Egrag’s chart indicates that XRP is trading just below $2.00, with previous support and resistance levels around $0.91 and $1.89. These levels have served as inflection points in prior cycles, reinforcing their relevance in the current analysis. He also addressed market psychology, quoting a line from the financial thriller Margin Call to illustrate the reactive nature of markets: “You cannot control it, stop it, or slow it, or even slightly alter it… you have to just react.” Egrag emphasized that while technical indicators can guide investors, the emotional behavior of participants ultimately drives market cycles. Final Take and Strategy Reminder Although Egrag has consistently maintained a personal target of $27 for XRP , he encouraged followers to manage their expectations and liquidity through a dollar-sell-average strategy. He reminded his audience that while historical patterns can inform strategies, no outcome is guaranteed. “Will it rhyme exactly? No, because if it were that easy, everyone would be a multimillionaire,” he noted. Egrag closed his post with a message to the XRP community: “#XRPFamily STAY STEADY & STRONG! Together, we rise.” His current projection places the hypothetical blow-off top to occur around late September 2025, aligning with the repeated 770-day interval seen in prior cycles.

The altcoins have also posted notable gains once again, with XRP and SOL leading the pack from the larger caps. BTC Touches $86K The rollercoaster of a week for BTC began with a nosedive from $84,000 to a five-month low of under $75,000 on Monday. Although the asset attempted an immediate recovery, it was ultimately stopped and pushed toward the same levels on Wednesday. This came amid the escalating tension between the US, China, and the rest of the world. However, bitcoin started to reclaim ground once US President Trump paused the tariffs on every other nation, aside from China. The cryptocurrency skyrocketed by several grand on Wednesday and tapped $83,300. As China retaliated, BTC retraced slightly to under $79,000, but reversed its trajectory in the following few days. This culminated yesterday at $86,000, which became an 11-day peak. Although it has failed there and now sits below $85,000, BTC’s market cap is up by $1.680 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the alts continues to stand tall above 60%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView PI, XRP, SOL on the Rise The altcoins are also in the green today, with ETH reclaiming $1.6 after a 3% daily surge. XRP and SOL have marked similar increases of around 5% and now trade close to $2.15 and $130, respectively. SUI and BCH have jumped by 6-7% to $2.33 and $340, while PI has stolen the show from the larger-cap alts once again. The altcoin, which was declining severely for over a month, has jumped by another 10% in the past day and trades close to $0.75. BNB, DOGE, ADA, LINK, and XLM also have some gains but in a more modest manner. The total crypto market cap has added more than $40 billion overnight and is up to $2.79 trillion on CG.

In the background of this substantial supply squeeze, however, SHIB price still languishes in a 3.3% loss, in line with wider-market inactivity. In the middle of this storm, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning heads as its fourth presale phase accelerates, having already raised $6.6 million with more than 400 million tokens sold. SHIB’s tenuous resurgence is now compared to MUTM’s organized growth, igniting discussions on which asset has the superior upside into April 2025. Shiba Inu at a Technical Crossroads SHIB trades at $0.00001096, stuck between lower Bollinger Band support ($0.00001066) and 20-day EMA resistance ($0.00001222). A firm break above the EMA might send it towards $0.00001441, corresponding with Marks’ bullish prediction. But, a lack of defense of either will see price action plunge into the $0.000010s, giving back earlier moves. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 35.02, leaning on oversold territory and suggesting a potential bounce if buying pressure returns. At the same time, whale inflows have surged 315% as large investors appear to position themselves strategically ahead of the Shibarium upgrades. As burns are meant to curb supply, SHIB’s trajectory is still tied to the greater market, an unstable fixture for meaningful expansion. Mutuum Finance Increases Presale Success The native token of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is currently in the fourth stage of its presale at $0.025 with a 20% increase to $0.03 in the fifth phase. Even current participants would receive a 140% return when the platform launches, since MUTM would list at just $0.06. More so, $3.50 post-launch target (an increment of around 13,900% from current phase) is being anticipated by analysts. More than 8,200 holders have already taken position, as organic buy pressure from the platform’s profit-driven buyback mechanism (25% of profits go to perpetual token purchases) has propelled demand. Meme coins are driven in the bursts of speculative hype that cannot be sustained over time, while this model ensures consistent demand. The initiative, which recently released a real-time dashboard displaying a leaderboard with the top 50 token holders. These first-class participants will start to receive bonus tokens as rewards, creating an incentive for longer term retention, and alleviating some pressure to sell. Moreover, Mutuum Finance’s smart contract auditing by Certik is underway, and results will be released on official social media channels. When projects publish a transparency report, it boosts their credibility in an unvetted project market. Strategic Divergence In A Chaotic Market And while SHIB struggles with unpredictable whale movements and product updates, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a mathematically workable trajectory. Its presale structure ensures price increases over time, and each phase creates more pressure on investors. With the imminent phase five entry price around 20% higher than the current $0.025, a currently finite window exists to maximize gains. There are only 6 presale stages left, which means the opportunity to get the best available price is closing fast! Unlike SHIB, which is dependent on the rest of the market to recover, MUTM’s tokenomics hard-bake growth into its utility. The lending protocols on the platform bring in recurring revenue, tying the demand for the token directly to user activity. This self-sustaining model makes MUTM a hedge against the infamous volatility of the crypto market. Last Chance for Early Access While Shiba Inu’s destiny teeters on technical breakouts and speculative burns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) serves real world milestones. When phase five opens, the pricing of $0.025 that was available in phase four disappears, thereby securing immediate gains for those already involved. Price targets of $3.50 post-launch validated by the project’s revenue-sharing framework suggest the possibility of stratospheric gains for those getting in late. As the completion of the Certik audit approaches and the leaderboard rewards you for holding, MUTM’s presale is an exceptional mix of clarity and progress. Time is running out for investors seeking April 2025’s top performer. SHIB is in recovery mode, but MUTM lays the groundwork for future dominance. Phase five is just around the corner—grab your tokens now before the next price jump!

The move came shortly after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China, which now faces a 145% tariff. This development injected optimism into global markets, triggering a broad recovery across risk assets — with ETH among the top beneficiaries. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy Over 80 Million DOGE In 24 Hours – Sign Of Recovery​? Despite the relief rally, Ethereum still trades below critical technical levels, and the broader price structure suggests ongoing consolidation rather than a confirmed reversal. Analysts remain cautious, as the asset’s inability to reclaim the $1,800–$2,000 range keeps the long-term trend in question. However, on-chain data from CryptoQuant adds an intriguing layer to the current outlook. Ethereum’s price is still trading below its realized price — the average price at which all ETH in circulation last moved. Historically, this scenario has represented a high-probability accumulation zone, often appearing once per cycle. According to some analysts, this could present a rare buying opportunity for contrarian investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility and macro uncertainty. As Ethereum continues to consolidate, all eyes are on whether bulls can build on this momentum. Ethereum Faces Critical Test Amid Volatility And Trade Tensions Ethereum is at a pivotal point after enduring weeks of relentless selling pressure and extreme volatility. The broader market has been shaken by macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating global trade tensions, with US tariffs under Trump’s administration continuing to rattle investor confidence. The crypto market, particularly altcoins like Ethereum, has taken the brunt of this instability. ETH has lost over 60% of its value since late December, raising fears of a prolonged bear market. However, a shift may be unfolding. Bulls are beginning to reappear, with Ethereum bouncing and setting a strong support above $1,400. This recovery follows aggressive price swings not only in crypto but also in global equities, which have seen significant rebounds following the announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China. Still, Ethereum remains below crucial resistance levels, especially the $2,000 mark — a level that represents more than just a psychological barrier. According to top analyst Quinten Francois, ETH is currently trading under its realized price, which averages the cost basis of all coins in circulation. Historically, such conditions have presented rare buying opportunities. Francois suggests this might be a once-in-a-cycle — or even once-in-a-lifetime — chance for long-term investors to accumulate ETH at undervalued levels. The coming days will determine whether bulls can reclaim key resistance and shift sentiment toward a sustained recovery.

Price Action Details: Key Levels To Reclaim Ethereum is currently trading at $1,650 after failing to break above the $1,700 level, a psychological and technical barrier that continues to cap bullish momentum. Despite a sharp rebound earlier in the week, ETH remains stuck in a consolidation range and is struggling to find direction amid broader market uncertainty. For bulls to regain control and initiate a stronger recovery, Ethereum must push above the $1,850 mark — a level aligned with the 4-hour 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA). These indicators have acted as short-term resistance since ETH fell below the $2,000 mark in February and reclaiming them is critical for confirming a shift in trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Show Conviction: 63% Of Supply Hasn’t Moved In A Year However, if Ethereum fails to break above $1,750 in the coming days, downside risk increases significantly. A rejection at current levels could trigger another wave of selling, potentially sending the price below the $1,500 support zone. This would put further pressure on bulls and undermine recent gains. With market sentiment still fragile and macroeconomic uncertainty weighing on investor confidence, Ethereum remains at a crucial juncture where a decisive move above resistance is needed to shift the outlook from bearish to neutral.

43280907,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709479,1744530226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43280907.jpeg,UK Finance Minister calls for ‘ambitious new relationship’ with EU while navigating US tariffs impact,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-calls-for-ambitious-new-relationship/,"The UK finance minister, Rachel Reeves, has called for an “ambitious new relationship” with the European Union, signaling a renewed push for deeper economic cooperation with Britain’s largest trading partner, even as tensions rise due to newly imposed US tariffs. According to Reuters, Reeves expressed her desire to forge a bold reset in relations with the European Union. She emphasized the need for the United Kingdom to rebuild trust with European partners after the Chanartic uncertainty of Brexit. Reeves to champion global trade reform and stronger EU ties at upcoming IMF summit In a separate piece published by The Observer on Saturday, Reeves also warned that tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump will likely have a “profound” impact on both the UK and the global economy. Reeves acknowledges the challenges ahead and is “under no illusion about the difficulties that lie ahead.” She emphasizes Labour’s global outlook: “The Labour Party is an internationalist party. We understand the benefits of free and fair trade and collaboration. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world.” Reeve’s message marks a departure from past Conservative policies that shied away from EU ties. Trade barriers that have harmed British exporters and created logistical difficulties to trade would be removed under Reeves’ plan. She also wants smoother arrangements for services and professional standards across borders. At the International Monetary Fund meeting later this month, Reeves hopes to advocate a “more balanced global economic and trading system.” This is on the heels of an uptick in the UK economy, which, amid the uncertainty, saw its strongest growth in 11 months in February — beating economists’ estimates and giving a small buffer ahead of the anticipated effects of U.S. tariffs. Reeves rallies support for UK exporters as Trump tariffs threaten global trade stability The UK government has published new financial support for exporters in response to new US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. There will also be a £20 billion windfall in export financing to support businesses dealing with rising costs and supply chain issues created by the tariffs. That raises the lending capacity of the UK Export Finance Agency to £80 billion. Reeves warns the tariffs could have a “devastating” effect across the UK economy and beyond. She said Britain needed to stand alongside its businesses as the changing global landscape confronted them. Experts have also warned that these tariffs could hit developing countries the hardest. Pamela Coke-Hamilton, the director of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said such moves could be “catastrophic” — worse than recent cuts in foreign aid. Reeves pushes for balanced global trade Reeves remains engaged despite the trade tensions, reaffirming that the UK is still actively negotiating a trade deal with the United States. Reeves thinks the two countries can still come to a common understanding of fair trade rules, particularly in green energy and digital services. But she insisted that any deal must work for British workers and protect public services. With Britain’s economy showing stronger-than-expected growth in February — its best in nearly a year — Reeves has gained some breathing room. Still, uncertainty looms. The Labour government appears focused on rebuilding alliances, supporting domestic industries, and keeping Britain engaged worldwide. As the IMF meeting draws near, much attention will be paid to Reeves at home and abroad, especially how she steers the UK’s position in a storm-tossed global industry.

Ripple litigation. The conversation began when user JD asked Rispoli, “@freddyriz so since the SEC hasn’t filed anything with the appellate court yet, what happens on 4/16?” Rispoli responded by pointing to April 16 as the due date for Ripple’s appellate brief. He shared two potential outcomes based on current circumstances. According to Rispoli, something is expected to occur on or before April 16. He noted that Ripple could not request an extension for this filing. In his view, there are two possible outcomes: either Ripple files the appellate brief, which he estimated has a ten percent likelihood, or there will be a notice of settlement or withdrawal of the appeal, which he assessed as having a ninety percent likelihood. His prediction indicates that a resolution would be reached without further appellate litigation, although no official action has yet been confirmed. On SEC v. Ripple, expect to see something happen on or before next Wednesday, 4/16, the due date for @ripple 's appellate brief. Ripple cannot get an extension and either has to file it (10%) or there will be a notice of settlement/withdrawal (90%). https://t.co/j9z0CpTBQo — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) April 9, 2025 Rispoli Clarifies the Nature of the “Agreement” Following Rispoli’s reply, another user identified as Scott commented , “Thought they agreed to withdraw appeals.” Rispoli clarified this point in a follow-up response. He explained that there had been an agreement “in the sense that” Ripple executives made a public statement about it , but emphasized that this was not accompanied by any official public communication from the SEC. Rispoli added that the agreement had likely involved “non-public, written assurances from the SEC,” but clarified that no official legal filing had yet been made to give effect to the public announcement. He stated that the SEC, in keeping with its protocol, had made no public declaration of the withdrawal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SEC Has Not Issued Public Confirmation Rispoli emphasized that, despite Ripple executives indicating a resolution had been reached, the SEC has not formally confirmed this through the appropriate legal channels. According to him, this is consistent with the SEC’s standard practice of remaining silent until official filings are made. As of now, no such filing exists in the appellate docket. Until a notice of settlement or withdrawal is publicly recorded by the court, the appellate process technically remains active. Speculation Over Political Timing Another user then speculated that the delay may be strategic, suggesting that “Instinct tells me that they are waiting for Paul Atkins to be confirmed, why let a great day 1 PR opportunity go to waste.” While Rispoli did not reply directly to that particular comment, the implication is that some observers believe political or public relations timing could be a factor in the official announcement or legal filings associated with the withdrawal of the appeal. The dialogue between users and Rispoli reflects a high level of attention paid to the procedural details of the SEC v. Ripple case, particularly the timeline of events surrounding the appellate process. Rispoli’s assessment, which strongly favors a conclusion to the appeal process in either a settlement or withdrawal, rests in part on the absence of SEC filings and the impending filing deadline for Ripple. At the time of the tweet, no formal withdrawal or settlement filing had been submitted to the court. All attention is now focused on April 16, the date by which Ripple is either required to submit its appellate brief or otherwise make public through legal channels that the matter has been resolved outside of court.

Trump’s administration announced a sweeping exemption for smartphones, chips, storage devices, modems, semiconductors, and other critical tech components from the reciprocal tariffs that had previously shaken markets. Crypto Markets Cheer Policy Reversal The 90-day pause, confirmed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, also reduces the tariff rate to 10% for countries that haven’t retaliated against U.S. goods, signaling a softening of the administration’s stance amid ongoing trade tensions. This shift has sent ripples through financial markets, particularly benefiting large-cap tech companies and triggering renewed interest in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. “The tech industry just got a shot in the arm,” noted The Kobeissi Letter in an April 12 post on X. “Large-cap technology companies will ultimately come out ahead when this is all said and done.” Bitcoin broke past the $85,000 mark on the same day—rising 9% in response to the tariff pause. Tech Stocks and Crypto Rebound Together Historically, crypto markets have followed the lead of high-growth tech equities. With the tariff freeze alleviating pressure on tech stocks, the crypto rally may be more than just a knee-jerk reaction. Some market analysts suggest this could be the beginning of a broader bullish trend for both sectors, as investor appetite for risk rebounds. Raoul Pal, a prominent macro trader, interpreted the move as part of Trump’s broader negotiation playbook. “This is classic posturing,” he remarked, viewing the tariff measures not as long-term economic policy, but as leverage in a bid to secure a favorable trade deal with China. Still, not everyone sees the glass as half full. Bitcoin evangelist Max Keiser cautioned that the tariff rollback does little to stem broader economic concerns , particularly around U.S. debt. “This doesn’t reverse the direction of rising bond yields,” Keiser warned, citing continued erosion of confidence in U.S. bonds and the dollar. Indeed, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Bonds spiked to around 4.5% on April 11—an indicator that investors remain wary of deeper systemic risks.

According to his statement , there is a growing risk to those who continue to leave their tokens on trading platforms, as exchange reserves of XRP are depleting despite the absence of either retail or institutional FOMO activity. Remi emphasized that the current low supply of XRP across major exchanges is not a sign of increased trading demand but rather a structural vulnerability that could have serious consequences in a market rally. He claims that the lack of XRP availability presents a significant issue for holders whose assets remain on exchanges. However, he views the situation as a major opportunity for those who have already moved their XRP into personal wallets, especially cold storage, due to the likely price increase that results from heightened demand against shrinking available supply. Referencing a past quote from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Remi pointed to the economic principle of high demand and low supply driving up prices. Concerns Over Lending Practices and Exchange Liquidity The crypto commentator also raised specific concerns about lending practices carried out by centralized platforms. He asserted that many exchanges lend a single unit of XRP to multiple users simultaneously—estimating that one token might be loaned to four or five different account holders at the same time. While not citing an exact figure, he warned that such over-leveraging creates a potential collapse scenario, especially if multiple users attempt to withdraw their XRP during a market spike. In such an event, Remi believes the exchanges will be unable to fulfill all withdrawal requests. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He explained that when platforms face these kinds of liquidity crises, their common response is to freeze accounts and delay access under various pretexts. According to Remi, exchanges may cite issues with Know Your Customer (KYC) documentation, bank delays, or other identity verification problems, requiring users to submit personal information that could take weeks—or even months—to process. During that time, the market may experience rapid upward movement, leaving affected users unable to participate in the bull run. Risks of Platform Insolvency and the Need for Self-Custody He warned that in worst-case scenarios, if an exchange is insolvent or collapses entirely, users could lose their funds. To avoid these risks, Remi reiterated his recommendation to keep assets on exchanges intended for short-term selling. All long-term holdings, he argued, should be moved to private wallets. Recommended Wallets and Additional Guidance Responding to questions from his followers about safe storage solutions, Remi named three cold wallet options he uses: Ledger, Trezor, and Tangem. Of the three, he identified Tangem as the most user-friendly, citing its ability to support assets like XDC and HBAR without requiring third-party applications. He also recommended two YouTubers, Crypto Scrilla and Crypto Dad, as reliable sources for wallet tutorials and setup instructions. X Remi Relief X’s warning adds to a broader conversation around self-custody and crypto exchange reliability. His post underscores the ongoing tension between convenience and control in the digital asset market and reflects mounting concern over potential liquidity challenges in the next phase of crypto price acceleration.

Bitcoiners Saw the Writing on the Wall In an April 12 post on X, Pompliano remarked that Bitcoin investors were the first significant group to notice discrepancies in U.S. economic indicators. “Bitcoiners were the first large-scale group to recognize the economic data was wrong, and they figured out a way to financially capture upside if they were right,” he wrote. Pompliano’s skepticism centers around key indicators such as inflation rates, employment figures, and GDP growth. He suggests these metrics are unreliable, especially in the context of economic measures like tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump’s administration. A Growing Doubt Among Officials and Experts Pompliano highlighted a March 20 interview with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the All-In podcast. When asked if he trusted the current economic data, Bessent plainly replied, “no.” This, Pompliano said, is a pivotal moment: “Even the Treasury Secretary has now publicly acknowledged he doesn’t believe the data. He says we must listen to the people rather than blindly follow the government data reports.” Concerns over the reliability of official data are not new. A report from July 2024 raised questions about whether traditional statistical methods can still deliver trustworthy information, pushing for new methodologies. Tariffs, Uncertainty, and Bitcoin’s Resilience The economic climate has been especially turbulent amid the ongoing tariff policies initiated by Trump. While some Wall Street analysts predicted the tariffs would strengthen the U.S. dollar, recent performance suggests otherwise. The dollar index has fallen 3.19% over the past five days, currently standing at 99.783. Since the start of 2025, it’s down 8.06%. Jeff Parks, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Invest, offered a bold prediction on April 9: “There is a higher chance Bitcoin survives over the dollar in our lifetime after today.” Pompliano doubled down on the sentiment, saying, “The mainstream finance conversation has become an intellectual boondoggle where most people regurgitate ill-informed takes based on bad data.” Bitcoin Diverges From Traditional Markets Interestingly, while U.S. equity markets slumped on April 4 amid escalating tariff tensions, Bitcoin performed with unexpected strength. It held firm above $82,000 and even climbed to $84,720 while stocks were crashing—defying the typical correlation. Analysts have long observed that cryptocurrencies tend to be more volatile during macroeconomic stress. Yet in this case, Bitcoin’s stability while traditional assets faltered has reinforced the narrative of it being a hedge against systemic risk. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes described this current phase as potentially “up only mode,” attributing it to worsening conditions in the U.S. bond market.

This comes as a result of a sudden shift following Trump’s recently implemented 90-day tariff pause. The tweet showed that more new BTC wallets have been created in the past couple of days than at any point since February 20th. Many are taking this as a sign of the crypto market staging a comeback—making the search to find the best crypto to buy now more important than ever. What Does the Resurgence of Whales and Sharks Mean for the Cryptocurrency Market? The indicator that Santiment has leveraged is known as Supply Distribution, which provides insight into the group a particular number of wallets belongs to. There are 10 groups in total, including investors holding anywhere between 1 to 10 tokens. Investors exceeding this limit are considered whales—especially since the cutoff range, based on the current exchange rate, is approximately $821,000. Only whales and sharks would qualify at that level. In the above graph, it's clearly shown that there has been a rebound in Bitcoin’s Supply Distribution for the 10+ coins range. The purple line shows an effective bounce, indicating that whales and sharks have made a comeback. A small reaction to this can already be seen in the price charts. The BTC price recently climbed above $83K, and it appears poised to flip its $84K resistance. Beyond that, the world’s largest crypto could push higher to breach the next critical resistance at $96K. As market confidence in Bitcoin builds, altcoins could start gaining traction. However, since volatility continues to persist, the best crypto to buy now would likely be found among the crypto ICOs. Best Crypto to Buy Now Among Crypto ICOs Santiment's report of sharks and whales returning may have given bulls a confidence boost, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Bitcoin has reached its bottom. Donald Trump’s words have proven to have a deep impact on the market, and since the socio-political ecosystem is currently in turmoil—considering the Israel-Palestine conflict and the recent tariff wars—crypto ICOs are emerging as better options to invest in. Best Wallet Token Powering a decentralized cryptocurrency wallet of the same name, Best Wallet Token is a utility crypto that enhances the wallet’s overall functionality. These functionalities include storing, swapping, buying, and selling crypto—as well as advanced features typically found only on centralized exchanges, such as token launchpads and staking. The token launchpad perk of Best Wallet is especially noteworthy, as it allows BEST token holders to invest in crypto ICOs before they go public. In the current economy, this kind of zero-stage investing is highly advantageous. Smart investors may also view Best Wallet Token as a strong pick, as it powers a decentralized ecosystem that evolves based on community voting. Upcoming features like portfolio management and market insights are already in the pipeline, giving Best Wallet Token massive long-term upside potential. YouTubers like 99Bitcoins have stated that because the token is part of an already-running project, it could have an “insane launch.” SUBBD SUBBD is another strong pick for those looking for long-term utility tokens, as this project addresses the shortcomings of the standard, centralized content creation economy. It has been included in this list since the arrival of sharks and bulls could bolster renewed interest in cryptocurrencies that offer more than just speculative value. Aiming to penetrate an $85 billion industry, SUBBD is a Web3 content creation platform equipped with AI-driven tools that not only help creators earn more but also enable fans to engage with the creator economy in more meaningful ways. Creators will be able to leverage AI-driven administrative tools to handle everything—from fulfilling custom requests to generating AI-powered content. Being paid in crypto gives them instantaneous access to revenue. Fans of the platform will gain exclusive perks by holding SUBBD tokens. The ecosystem also includes several gamified elements, such as XP multipliers and credits. Staking rewards are available too, offering exclusive access to certain features. SUBBD has also been designed with security in mind, with a strong emphasis on content shareability without risking leaks. With such key shortfalls being addressed, it's no surprise SUBBD has already raised close to $200K. And since it’s targeting a thriving, well-established industry, it could become one of the leading crypto assets to invest in for 2025. BTC Bull The arrival of more Bitcoin accumulators means bulls are gaining ground. But being bullish in the cryptocurrency community isn’t limited to those who’ve bought Bitcoin—it also includes those who still believe in it and rally for its success. These low-cap investors may not have the power to invest in Bitcoin just yet, but they believe in the decentralized financial future it could create. BTC Bull is a project designed to reward these bulls. It is both a meme coin initiative and a social movement that tracks Bitcoin’s growth to unlock token burns and Bitcoin airdrops. The campaign will begin when Bitcoin hits $125K and continue until it reaches $250K. Since many analysts—such as Arthur Hayes and Charles Hoskinson—have predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250K by the end of this year or the beginning of next, BTC Bull could activate its perks within that timeframe. While nothing is certain, this gives BTC Bull a speculative power-up, which could be leveraged for short-term gains. And if the community around the project continues to grow, long-term potential is also on the table. And the community is getting stronger already—BTC Bull’s X account has gained over 8K followers, and the project’s presale has raised upwards of $4.5 million to date. Solaxy Solana has experienced significant growth following the market's recovery. Now trading above the $120 level, it could push further upward if it manages to build on the current bullish divergence. Price action aside, Solana's technological development also plays a crucial role in its growth. However, as the ecosystem expands, scalability issues have begun to emerge. Network congestion has become increasingly common, affecting transaction speeds—and these challenges may persist in the coming days. Thankfully, L2 solution providers like Solaxy have stepped in. Embracing ZK rollups for off-chain transactions and integrating Hyperlane to enable a cross-chain bridge, Solaxy is a utility-focused project with a meme-esque appeal that has already raised over $30 million on the market. What makes this project stand out is its transparency—users receive regular updates about the tech developments happening behind the scenes, which is rarely the case with most meme coins. Furthermore, the project’s memetic flair is unique. It features intelligent, stylized mascots to highlight the perks users can enjoy by investing in the Solaxy ecosystem. Bulls and Sharks May Have Returned to Bitcoin, But Gains May Still Come From ICOs With Santiment’s latest report, all eyes are back on Bitcoin, and optimism is rising following Donald Trump’s 90-day tariff pause. However, recent market movements have highlighted just how dependent the cryptocurrency space is on community reaction—suggesting that investors may be better off focusing on crypto ICOs until Bitcoin finds stable ground. This article has highlighted some of the best cryptos to buy now. Each offers its own distinct advantage: SUBBD and Best Wallet Token focus on utility, Solaxy blends meme culture with utility, and BTC Bull is a meme coin riding the wave of current market speculation. A mix of these assets—and possibly a few more—could serve as a smart hedge against ongoing market uncertainty, while also helping to diversify a cryptocurrency portfolio.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-u-s-treasuries-to-control-liquidity-within-xrp-ecosystem-heres-how/,"Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, has published a statement asserting that the U.S. Treasury is actively collaborating with Ripple to utilize the RLUSD stablecoin as part of a broader strategy to enhance the global footprint of the digital dollar. According to Aljarrah, this initiative also supports new demand for U.S. Treasuries. It’s a method to manage liquidity within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Turns out the U.S. Treasury has been working directly with @Ripple to use the #RLUSD stablecoin as a vehicle to expand the digital dollar’s global reach—while creating new demand for U.S. Treasuries to control liquidity within the #XRP ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/j1ZXGEKath — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) April 11, 2025 Aljarrah emphasized that this information is not derived from speculation but from his research and analytical interpretation. He clarified that the perspective is the result of years of observation, study, and critical thinking regarding the digital asset industry and the U.S. financial system’s evolving infrastructure. He further explained that since 2019, he has closely monitored developments involving both Ripple and Stellar and that his long-term research has consistently pointed toward an emerging alliance between Ripple and key U.S. government institutions. Aljarrah claimed that this analysis led him to conclude that the introduction of RLUSD is more than a technical innovation—it is a coordinated step toward digital dollar expansion through blockchain-based systems. Federal Support for Digitization Focusing on the U.S. Treasury Department’s role, Aljarrah noted that the department has openly shown interest in exploring the utility of digital assets, with stablecoins being central to their objectives. According to his interpretation, the primary goal remains to preserve and extend the global dominance of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. He asserted that stablecoins represent the most viable route for digitizing dollar-denominated liquidity in a way that maintains compliance and global scalability. In addition to the Treasury, Aljarrah brought attention to the Federal Reserve’s involvement, referencing the FedNow service and Ripple’s alleged partnership in developing this instant payment infrastructure. He claimed this relationship is verifiable for those willing to investigate publicly available information. The connection demonstrates a coordinated effort between federal institutions and Ripple to fast-track the digital transformation of monetary systems. RLUSD, Liquidity, and the Role of XRP Aljarrah identified RLUSD, a stablecoin issued on the XRP Ledger, as a critical instrument in resolving long-standing inefficiencies in global payments. He suggested that RLUSD functions as a digital dollar that integrates seamlessly with the liquidity mechanisms of the XRP Ledger, thereby enhancing cross-border value movement. In this framework, RLUSD enables broader access to U.S. dollar liquidity across global markets, which, in Aljarrah’s view, positions XRP as a central component in the financial system’s structural evolution. He concluded by stating that once an individual understands the mechanisms and incentives driving these developments, the role of XRP becomes self-evident. Aljarrah insisted that his insights are not based on unsupported assumptions but on coherent analysis rooted in public data and his investigative approach. He reaffirmed his commitment to independent thinking and said his role is to offer informed perspectives that others can consider in forming their conclusions.

The motion, filed on April 11 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, highlights ongoing discussions between both parties that could lead to changes in the scope or resolution of the case. “Since the Court stayed this case, the Parties have been in productive discussions, including discussions concerning how the efforts of the crypto task force may impact the SEC’s claims,” the filing stated. SEC Seeks More Time to Finalize Binance Case Resolution The SEC requested the extension to continue seeking internal approval for a possible resolution, and Binance agreed, citing the benefit to judicial efficiency. This marks the second time this year that both sides have jointly asked for a two-month extension. The prior pause was granted in February, shortly after SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his tough stance on crypto, resigned. Commissioner Mark Uyeda, considered more crypto-friendly, has since stepped in as acting chair. The formation of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force followed Gensler’s departure, with the group aiming to clarify regulatory guidance and better allocate enforcement resources. The SEC’s case against Binance began in June 2023 and includes 13 charges. These involve alleged unregistered sales of its BNB and BUSD tokens, the operation of investment products like Simple Earn and BNB Vault, and its staking program. Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, have denied the allegations. The latest filing comes as the SEC has recently withdrawn several high-profile enforcement actions, including cases against Coinbase , Kraken , Gemini , Robinhood , and ConsenSys, signaling a shift in regulatory tone under the new leadership. CZ Linked to DOJ Case Against Justin Sun in New WSJ Report Meanwhile, a separate controversy involving CZ has also resurfaced. On April 11, The Wall Street Journal reported that Zhao had allegedly agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of his plea deal with the Department of Justice. CZ dismissed the claim, posting on X: “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t. People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison.” WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn't. People who become gov witnesses don't go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me. https://t.co/xqpnBwvlmi — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) April 12, 2025 Zhao was sentenced in April 2024 to four months in prison for Anti-Money Laundering violations. He was released in September, maintaining his position as the wealthiest individual to ever serve a U.S. prison sentence, with a net worth of $60 billion at the time. Last week, a Nigerian court postponed a high-profile tax evasion case against Binance to April 30 after the crypto exchange challenged the legality behind how it was served court documents. Binance’s legal counsel, Chukwuka Ikwuazom, said the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) did not get court approval to serve documents outside Nigeria. He argued that the Feb. 11 order allowing substituted service was invalid. Binance is registered in the Cayman Islands and does not have a physical office in Nigeria.

In its analysis of Bitcoin's supply-demand balance, the company noted that the Long Term Realized Cap Impulse indicator has reached a historical support level. This indicator plays a critical role in understanding the behavior of long-term investors and their relationship with prices. According to Alphractal, when the indicator reaches this level, two possible scenarios can arise: Positive Reaction and Renewed Demand Growth: This could indicate that long-term investors continue to hold their positions and the market is on solid footing. Support Break and Sharp Declines: A break below the support level may mean that even the most resilient players in the market are selling and may increase selling pressure. The chart shared by Alphractal, monitoring the support levels in the Long Term Realized Cap Impulse metric. Related News: Prominent Analyst Makes Unbelievable Prediction For Bitcoin (BTC) Price In 2035 On Live Broadcast - ""It May Even Exceed This"" Alphractal stressed that the loss of this support could signal a significant change in market sentiment, but at the same time, maintaining this level could signal the beginning of a structured recovery process. In addition, the analysis noted that Bitcoin has been liquidating short positions over the last 3 to 7 days. This development could trigger a new wave of volatility in the market, as it could lead market makers to begin closing some of their positions. Alphractal's warning is clear: The behavior of long-term investors during this period could determine the direction of the Bitcoin market. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has moved from $75,000 to $86,000 over the past three days indicating a rising level of market demand. Despite this positive development, Cryptododo7 warns that the potential for a significant downside still exists. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Returning To $74,000? Analyst Identifies Pattern That Suggests So Bitcoin Completes Bearish Pennant Formation – Price Fall To Follow? In a recent post on X, Cryptododo7 shares a technical analysis of the BTC market showing the formation of a bearish pennant. Notably, this development follows a double top formation, a classic reversal signal that aligns with the downward price action observed over the past three months. While recent market gains point to a rising bullish momentum, Cryptododo7 states that the bearish pennant formation signals much potential for a deeper price correction. The bearish pennant forms after a strong downward price move i.e. flagpole as seen when Bitcoin dropped from $96,000 to $76,000 in late February. The pennant follows this price decline, which is just a short period of consolidation where price action forms a small symmetrical triangle. This pattern is usually marked by lower highs and higher lows bringing about two converging trendlines as seen over the last six weeks. Following this consolidation, the market price is expected to break below the lower trendline confirming the intention of a price fall. According to Cryptododo7’s post, the lower boundary of the bearish pennant is positioned around $74,000. A decisive close below this level would validate the bearish pattern and signal a likely continuation of the downtrend, with a projected price target of $51,400. Cryptododo7 explains that $51,400 represents Bitcoin’s strongest support level as it aligns with the 200-week moving average. Amidst the current price rally, the analyst states that a retest to this support level is largely reasonable, especially considering ongoing macroeconomic developments.

This development aligns with Cryptododo7’s bearish warning as a large volume of traders still hold a negative market outlook amidst recent gains. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $85,416 following a 2.50% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 40.07% and valued at $25.10 billion.

For years, Donald Trump and his family have leveraged their name for business ventures that cross industries, from hotels to golf courses to licensing deals with everything from apparel to bottled water. The Trump family has entered the digital currencies and blockchain world U.S. President Donald Trump, his wife, Melania, and their children are now deeply involved in almost every aspect of the crypto world. They are interested in NFTs, meme coins, Bitcoin mining, stablecoins, and decentralized finance platforms. But what does this Trump family expansion portend for the future of crypto, the Trump legacy, and the fine balance between government and the fast-moving digital economy? The Trump family crypto portfolio is already worth an estimated $1 billion, according to a Bloomberg analysis based on data from public records. Such gains come despite recent volatility driven by global market strains and U.S. trade tensions. Remember, Donald Trump once called Bitcoin a threat to the U.S. dollar. In 2021, he argued digital assets should be “heavily regulated.” Fast-forward to his 2024 campaign trail, and suddenly, he’s accepting crypto donations, praising blockchain innovation, and laying the groundwork for pro-crypto executive orders. Is this a genuine change of heart? Or is it a calculated play to align with an industry pouring billions into campaign coffers and political influence? Let’s say, either way, it’s a pivot that speaks volumes about the current administration’s attitude toward regulation — or rather, its lack of a clear regulatory approach. Trump and his family appeared determined to establish a large footprint in the crypto sector ahead of new regulations hitting the market, said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University who has studied the digital economy. The Trump crypto boom is powered by NFTs, DeFi, and meme coins Trump’s digital narrative began with non-fungible tokens. In December 2022, he announced a series of NFT trading cards depicting digitally illustrated images of him — as an astronaut, cowboy, superhero, and more. The NFTs were minted with the help of his longtime associate Bill Zanker, founder of The Learning Annex. These collectible tokens skyrocketed in popularity, seeing numerous collections sell out. Trump even held private dinners for elite buyers. According to federal financial disclosures, the NFT sales brought in millions in revenue. Capitalizing on that success, the Trump family founded World Liberty Financial in September 2024. Some of its services include token swaps, peer-to-peer lending, asset staking, etc. It has since raised more than $550 million through two token sales. According to offering documents , a company affiliated with Trump receives 75% of net revenue as a fee, including token sales proceeds. The Trump family business, DT Marks DeFi LLC, owns a 60% equity interest in World Liberty. His sons, Donald Jr., Eric, and Barron, also appear as “Web3 Advisors” on the project’s website, and their involvement is frequently highlighted on social media. Source: Bloomberg Then came the meme coins. The day before Trump’s inauguration, he and his wife, Melania, launched their own crypto assets. These highly speculative cryptocurrencies soared in value initially, garnering over $11.4 million in transaction fees in the first month alone. But the hype quickly faded. Prices plummeted, and some within the crypto community accused the Trump team of draining legitimacy from blockchain innovation by embracing meme culture and pump-and-dump strategies. The two firms affiliated with the president — CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC — continue to hold 80% of the token supply. That will be gradually released over three years. Stablecoin, Bitcoin mining, and ETFs signal long-term play Just as NFTs and meme coins cleared headlines, the Trump family is switching gears to focus on the more essential underpinnings of the crypto economy. On March 25, World Liberty Financial revealed that it will launch its stablecoin — USD1 . The token will be pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar and backed one-to-one with short-term U.S. Treasury bills, bank deposits, and cash equivalents. The Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks, among the world’s most widely used blockchains, will issue USD1. The Trump family believes stablecoins will help fuel faster, cheaper global payments. The launch comes at a significant time. It was unclear whether the Trump administration wanted to adopt such legislation. Still, it was not attached to the bill that passed the U.S. House Financial Services Committee last week with bipartisan support and was publicly supported by the Trump administration. This alignment, analysts say, reflects the family’s strategic management of the timing of business moves with the evolution of regulators. On March 31, the family also announced a Bitcoin mining venture with Hut 8 Corp., a publicly traded mining company. The move follows a wider campaign to have the U.S. assume global leadership in producing Bitcoin — a priority that Trump showed keen interest in during meetings with mining executives when campaigning in 2024. Bitcoin miners were early supporters of Trump’s reelection campaign. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, said his recent effort in the mining sector was the president’s means of rewarding their loyalty and cashing in on a multibillion-dollar business. Finally, in February of 2025, Trump Media & Technology Group filed new trademarks suggesting he planned to enter the exchange-traded fund (ETF) space. A proposed ETF, “Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus,” would follow assets linked with Bitcoin that match Trump’s economic and political beliefs. Stablecoins, Bitcoin mining, and ETF filings suggest the Trump family isn’t longer chasing headlines. They’re laying the foundation for a long-term crypto empire that aligns with Trump’s economic ideology and his vision of American dominance in digital infrastructure. Whether you believe the Trump family are crypto pioneers or opportunistic capitalists, one thing is clear: their grip on the narrative — and potentially the future of U.S. crypto policy — is only tightening.",OP-ED|BTC|USD|usd1|WLFI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-13 09:01:15

The dramatic pivot comes as part of a sweeping efficiency mandate from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the controversial new initiative spearheaded by none other than Elon Musk, the platform’s owner. Social Security to Ditch Letters, Embrace X as Primary Outlet WIRED first reported the transition, citing anonymous sources who revealed that traditional methods of communication—like mailed letters and official press releases—will be phased out entirely. Instead, Americans will need to follow Social Security updates via social media. This decision accompanies a sizable workforce reduction at the agency, shrinking its personnel from 57,000 to just 50,000 in an effort to reduce redundancy and modernize operations. In a February 2025 statement , the Social Security confirmed that it would collapse its outdated 10-region model down to just four, calling the former structure “no longer sustainable.” The changes are part of a wider governmental shake-up championed by DOGE, an unofficial but increasingly powerful entity in Washington’s fiscal playbook. While not an officially sanctioned federal agency, DOGE has been given extraordinary leeway to investigate wasteful spending across multiple branches of government. Musk’s Efficiency Drive Targets SSA, IRS, and SEC Elon Musk hasn’t held back in his criticism of the Social Security system, accusing it of doling out billions in erroneous payments—a claim backed by the White House. That rhetoric, paired with drastic staffing and communication reforms, has many questioning the future of America’s most relied-upon retirement safety net. DOGE’s influence is rapidly expanding. In March, the agency reportedly gained access to internal systems within the SEC , including confidential data repositories. SEC leadership confirmed their cooperation and pledged transparency. Not stopping there, DOGE is now proposing a 20% reduction in the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) workforce—roughly 6,800 jobs—set to take effect just a month after Tax Day, on May 15. Critics warn that such cuts could jeopardize tax enforcement and public trust. But perhaps the most disruptive idea floated by Musk’s DOGE unit is the integration of blockchain technology into federal budgeting .

Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool’s price reach $50?

Rocket Pool price analysis 1-day chart RPL/USD 1-Day price chart , Source: TradingView Based on the 1-day chart on April 13, Rocket Pool (RPL) remains under firm bearish pressure. The price has declined sharply to $3.77, nearing the lower Bollinger Band support at $2.99, a signal of possible oversold conditions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32.06, hovering just above the oversold zone, indicating sellers have dominated but momentum may be slowing. Despite brief recoveries, RPL has consistently failed to reclaim the mid-Bollinger Band level around $4.24. A further drop below $3.50 could open the door to new lows, while recovery efforts must overcome $4.24 to signal any reversal or short-term bullish momentum. RPL/USD 4-hour price chart analysis RPL/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Rocket Pool (RPL) remains in a prolonged downtrend, with current price action at $3.77 facing strong resistance near the middle Bollinger Band ($3.80) and upper range ($4.00). The MACD histogram is flat with marginal positive divergence, indicating weak bullish momentum, while the Balance of Power sits near equilibrium, showing no clear dominance by bulls or bears. Volatility is compressed, suggesting a breakout may be imminent. Short-term upside is possible if the price breaks above $4.00 with volume. However, failure to do so may confirm continued weakness and expose RPL to a decline toward $3.50.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, RPL navigates a critical juncture after a prolonged downtrend. On the 1-day chart, the asset is trading below the middle Bollinger Band, with the RSI at 32.06, reflecting weak momentum and proximity to oversold territory. The 4-hour chart echoes a similar trend, with prices attempting to consolidate near the lower Bollinger Band, and the MACD hovering at a neutral line with no strong crossover. Balance of Power is mildly negative, suggesting sellers retain control. Unless RPL reclaims the $4.00 level, the downside remains open, possibly extending toward $3.50 in the short term. Is Rocket Pool a good investment? Rocket Pool (RPL) presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its innovative decentralized Ethereum staking model, offering potentially high returns through staking rewards. However, investors should consider market volatility and competition within the DeFi space. Conduct thorough research and assess personal risk tolerance before investing in RPL.

However, significant upward momentum is required to achieve this target soon Will Rocket Pool reach $150? Reaching $150 for Rocket Pool (RPL) seems highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Our Rocket pool forecast suggests that RPL may peak at around $42 by 2031. Is Rocket Pool a safe investment? Rocket Pool is generally considered a secure investment due to its decentralized structure, robust security audits, and significant total value locked (over $4.4 billion), reflecting user confidence. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries inherent risks due to market volatility and potential technical vulnerabilities Does RPL have a good long-term future? RPL’s chart shows an immediate outlook that appears bearish. However, assessing its long-term future requires considering broader market trends.

In a new discussion on CNBC, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that the big trends like artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and other cutting edge technology plays are still valid. However, Fink says that some of those plays may be delayed or changed slightly due to President Trump’s tariffs and the likelihood of a recession. “I do believe that the mega trends are still with us, whether it’s AI, data centers, infrastructure, the whole reorientation of our economy. So I think the mega force trends are not going to change by what has happened. But maybe the execution of some of these trends may be delayed or may be pushed out longer, but I still remain to be optimistic over the long run. Yes, we have to recalibrate, [and] I do believe we’re probably starting, or if not, in a recession. Yes, I think the market is still underestimating how high inflation can get, as you factor in all the tariffs, you factor in all these other issues, it’s going to be quite additive. I read in a report that if you just take the tariffs in the cost of home building, the average new home could be up as much as 26%. We already have a housing affordability problem… This is not a pandemic, this is not a financial crisis, this is something that we’ve created… The United States in post-World War II was a global stabilizer.

Among potential gainers, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are getting noticed. DOGE and SHIB may have their highs and lows, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in a league of its own with its presale which has already raised $6.6 million and gained 8,200+ holders. MUTM is still in Phase 4 of its presale, priced at just $0.025, but will jump 20% in price to $0.03 for Phase 5 and analysts are expecting a huge pump post launch beyond $3.50. The Asent Path of Dogecoin Dogecoin, for its part, has jumped 10% in the last 24 hours following speculation of a potential exchange-traded product (ETP) from 21Shares. Master Kenobi and other analysts believe DOGE may challenge its 2021 high around $0.73, potentially aiming for $1. Yet hurdles persist. The number of transactions has dropped 94% per month, indicative of declining activity on the network. This showed that whales wallets deposited as much as 1.3 billion DOGE in sell pressure recently. Further complicating its trajectory is instability in the broader market, driven by macroeconomic tensions. And while short-term gains could be made, Dogecoin’s lack of utility at all compared with its utility makes its long term potential questionable. The Shiba Inu’s Recovery While Shiba Inu is also stuck on bullish signals and bearish realities. Analyst Javon Marks discovered a hidden divergence pattern that suggest a 550% rally toward $0.000155, reminiscent of its breakout in 2021. On the fourth-hour time frame, SHIB is setting up for higher lows against $0.0000124 resistance, which indicates upward momentum if price-activity breaks the ceiling into an upperbound zone. This view is supported by technical indicators like the MACD flipping green. The wider meme coin sector has lost $8 billion in market cap over 30 days, suggesting waning speculative interest. Without continued demand, Shiba Inu’s rise could falter, potentially leaving investors vulnerable to abrupt reversals. Mutuum Finance’s Rise As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu face turbulence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charting its own course. The presale’s Phase 4, which is priced at $0.025, raised $6.6 million with 400 million tokens sold. Then the upcoming Phase 5 will raise prices to $0.03 — a 20% gain for current buyers. Fundamentals remain strong post-launch, with the exchange debut of MUTM sitting at $0.06 for a 140% return, but the projections are even higher: a push to $3.50 would see investors sitting on a 13,900% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enhances real-world DeFi utility with decentralized lending, enabling users to either borrow against overcollateralized assets or earn through liquidity pools. A buy and distribute mechanism takes revenue off the platform and uses it for token buy backs to be sent to stakers, maintaining demand. Recently, the team released a dashboard that tracks top 50 holders and rewards them with bonus tokens for maintaining their position — a method that fosters long-term holding. Security continues to be a priority as well, with a Certik audit of Mutuum Finance’s smart contracts in the final stages of completion. Official channels will publicly share results to ensure transparency. Seizing the Moment While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu react pandemonically to market sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives a logical entry at the start of 2025. Its turbocharged presale, bringing immediate returns at each stage, is a world away from meme coins’ volatility. The project’s scalable utility focus, alongside a $3.50 post-launch target, makes it the potential heir to XRP’s throne—all for less than $1.

And it looks like the regulator has backed that position. The story began when the National Center for Public Policy, a McDonald's think tank and shareholder, sent a letter to the famous fast food chain's management urging them to invest in its first cryptocurrency. ”McDonald's is widely regarded - including by former CFO and President Harry Sonneborn - as a real estate company that happens to sell burgers,” said the National Center's proposal. ”Real estate has been a much more reliable store of value than cash and bonds, but it won't grow over time as much as bitcoin and doesn't have as much liquidity. As more companies add bitcoin to their balance sheets, if McDonald's doesn't follow suit, it will fall behind where it once led.” Bitcoin and corporations This isn't the first time shareholders have asked corporations to start acquiring bitcoin. Michael Saylor's technology company Strategy has made bitcoin hoarding a trend thanks to its constant purchase of the digital asset. The rising value of the cryptocurrency has significantly boosted the company's coffers. Recently, video game retailer GameStop said it raised $1.5 billion to buy bitcoin. In contrast, Microsoft shareholders voted against such a move last December. Companies' interest in acquiring bitcoin intensified after Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election last November, which helped push the price of BTC to an all-time high. SEC Takes Sides After receiving a proposal to acquire bitcoin, McDonald's legal representatives sent a letter to the SEC under Paul Atkins' administration seeking confirmation that the regulator would not ”recommend any enforcement action” if the fast-food chain declined to publicly discuss the idea at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting in May. The SEC seemed to agree that McDonald's has the right to refuse to discuss the proposal at the annual meeting. ”There is some basis for your view that the company may exclude the proposal,” the agency responded in a March 28 letter. ”In our view, the proposal relates to the company's ordinary business operations. Accordingly, we will not recommend enforcement action to the commission if the company removes the proposal from its voting materials.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-13 09:30:17

Ethereum , XRP , and Bitcoin (BTC) remain widely regarded as the safest long-term options for 2025, holding steady through market cycles and offering proven adoption. But while they anchor most portfolios, a growing number of traders and analysts are watching a rapidly accelerating altcoin— MAGACOINFINANCE —that’s making waves for entirely different reasons. Alongside the large-cap focus, attention is growing around tokens like TON , Avalanche (AVAX) , and SUI , which are expanding across developer ecosystems and gaining institutional interest at scale. 2025’s BIGGEST PRESALE — JOIN BEFORE LISTING MAGACOINFINANCE – Analysts Say “This One’s Picking Up Fast” Momentum doesn’t lie, and MAGACOINFINANCE is proving it. After selling out Stage 6 , the project has now entered Stage 7 with a current price of $0.0002908 and a confirmed listing target of $0.007 —a clean 25x ROI for early movers. And it’s not just being discussed—it’s being tracked, charted, and bought. Crypto analysts and early-stage observers are noting the uptick in social traction, wallet activity, and market interest. Telegram groups are growing fast, presale dashboards show traffic surging, and token demand is increasing by the hour. The sentiment? It may not stay in presale territory much longer. 50% Token Bonus Still Available — MAGA50X The MAGA50X promotion is still live for Stage 7 participants.

According to recent data, these methods are especially expensive when reaching existing crypto wallets, ranking higher compared to other sectors in the crypto industry. According to the data, decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) advertisements are better and more cost-effective in terms of reaching existing users in the crypto sector compared to gaming and gambling campaigns. In a recent post on X, Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin replied to an article posted by the co-founder of Web3 marketing firm Addressable Asaf Nadler, who highlighted the figures behind such campaigns. “Gaming and gambling campaigns are the most expensive, with a median CPW of $8.74 and a lower quartile of $3.40,” Nadler said. CPW, or cost per wallet is a perfect metric for measurement because it tracks the cost of website visitors who already have a crypto wallet installed in their browser. Axie Infinity co-founder gives insight into the discussion According to Nadler’s post, he mentioned that the high cost-to-return ratio of crypto gaming and gambling might be down to the higher churn, speculative behavior, and intense competition. “If Web3 gaming is truly ‘inevitable,’ we need to find a more powerful UA engine to make it as sustainable as in Web2,” Nadler said. However, the Axie Infinity executive mentioned that the best periods to carry out experiments are the ones with a high CPW. Comparing the amount of money it takes to onboard users, he said, “Basically, the amount of money it costs to onboard someone into web3 increases during bear markets and decreases during bulls. This was the case for every single region tested, except for Southeast Asia. This is likely why we have a stable and consistent user base but our growth outside of our initial markets is pretty cyclical.” This is some interesting research.

This was the case for every single region tested, except for Southeast Asia. This is likely why we have a stable… — Jihoz.ron 🍚 (@Jihoz_Axie) April 12, 2025 The Axie Infinity co-founder also revealed the best time to make an experiment in the market, noting that it is during a period of high CPW. “During times when cost per wallet acquisition is high, it’s a good time to experiment, create new games/product lines, consolidate our market share, and get ready for the next market expansion,” he added. Nadler highlights the difference between bull and bear markets Meanwhile, according to Nadler’s report, it is easier for campaigns in the CeFi and DeFi sectors to onboard new crypto users. “DeFi/CeFi campaigns are the most cost-efficient, with a median CPW of $2.79 and a lower quartile of just $0.10,” he said. The results are based on about 200 programmatic campaigns carried out on Addressable by more than 70 advertisers, who claimed to target about 9.5 million users globally. It tracks how CPW varies across different market cycles, campaign strategies, audience segments, and regions. According to Nadler, while premium markets experience low-cost conversions for existing crypto wallet holders during bull runs, it has always been increasingly difficult to attract their attention during bear markets. He mentioned that in 2024, the United States and Western Europe saw CPW rise by four times and 27 times, respectively, between the first quarter and third quarter. This happened as the market consolidated and interest from crypto holders started to drop. “While these markets provide scale and quality during bull runs, they become significantly more expensive when sentiment turns bearish, making them less sustainable during downturns,” he said. Meanwhile, markets classed under “emerging” countries like Latin America and Eastern Europe offer very low CPW in good conditions but can also experience extreme cost volatility.

Recently, Pi Network (PI) saw a significant dip in its price, falling 16.1% in the past week. As of April 10, 2025, Pi Network (PI) is valued at $0.5938, with fluctuations in its price continuing to intrigue investors and the community. However, despite these drops, a new player, Coldware (COLD) , is drawing attention for its innovative approach to crypto mining and decentralized finance, providing a glimmer of hope to mining enthusiasts and crypto investors alike. Coldware Brings Hope to Mining Enthusiasts While Pi Network (PI) faces these hurdles, Coldware (COLD) has recently emerged as a potential game-changer for mining enthusiasts. Unlike Pi Network (PI), Coldware combines its innovative mining features with a decentralized finance (DeFi) approach that is designed to be fully transparent, scalable, and sustainable. Coldware (COLD) has a fresh approach that promises to address some of the key pain points of traditional mining projects. It utilizes a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism that requires significantly less energy than traditional mining methods. Coldware (COLD) also emphasizes its mobile-first design, which allows users to easily engage with mining and DeFi activities through their smartphones. With the increasing interest in Coldware (COLD), particularly among mining enthusiasts, the project is seen as a viable alternative to other mining projects like Pi Network (PI). The Current State of Pi Network (PI) Since its inception, Pi Network (PI) has been one of the more unique projects in the cryptocurrency world. With the ability to mine coins directly from mobile devices, Pi Network (PI) attracted millions of users. This revolutionary approach to mining gave Pi Network an impressive user base, known as Pioneers, and sparked hopes of making crypto mining accessible to everyone. However, Pi Network (PI) has faced several challenges, most notably its price performance. Pi Network (PI) has remained relatively stagnant, hovering around $0.58, as market dynamics and regulatory concerns around the project have created uncertainty. Despite the optimism surrounding Pi Network (PI)'s large community and potential, it is still struggling to gain the kind of momentum that other cryptocurrencies have experienced. Challenges Facing Pi Network (PI) The most significant challenge for Pi Network (PI) remains its lack of transparency and the unclear status of its token issuance. Major exchanges, such as Binance, have hesitated to list Pi Network (PI) due to concerns about the network's non-BNB Smart Chain status and doubts regarding the token's regulatory compliance. This lack of clarity has left Pi Network (PI) struggling to gain widespread recognition and adoption, which is key to its long-term success. Additionally, Pi Network (PI)’s inability to list on major exchanges and the lack of free coin exchange and spending options could risk losing its early supporter base. If Pi Network (PI) continues to face these hurdles, it could struggle to hit its ambitious $1 target in the near future. The Future of Pi Network (PI) and Coldware (COLD) While Pi Network (PI) is still trying to find its footing in the market, Coldware (COLD) is gaining momentum with its innovative approach and unique value proposition. Coldware’s focus on mobile-first mining and DeFi integration sets it apart from Pi Network (PI), which has struggled to deliver tangible utility despite its large community. As Coldware (COLD) continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of crypto mining could evolve beyond the traditional methods, thanks to Coldware’s innovative approach. Whether Pi Network (PI) can overcome its challenges and rise to prominence remains to be seen, but the arrival of Coldware provides hope for the crypto mining space, offering a glimpse of what could be the future of decentralized finance and mobile mining. Conclusion Pi Network (PI) may have experienced a dip in its price recently, but the underlying potential of its vast community and the network’s eventual mainnet launch gives some hope for recovery. However, Coldware (COLD) appears to be the new beacon of hope for mining enthusiasts and those looking for a more transparent and scalable solution in the mining sector. With Coldware’s unique features and approach, it may well capture the attention of the crypto community and establish itself as a strong contender in the crypto space.

One such pattern is being observed in the comparison between Bitget (BGB) and Coldware (COLD) . As Coldware gains traction, analysts have noticed striking similarities between its current trajectory and the meteoric rise of Bitget in December 2024. In this article, we’ll examine how Coldware (COLD)'s growing momentum is showing signs that it could soon follow a path similar to Bitget’s December 2024 surge. Bitget's 2024 Surge: A Quick Recap In December 2024, Bitget (BGB) saw an explosive increase in its price and trading volume, primarily driven by the massive burn of 800 million tokens. This move created a sense of scarcity and increased demand, boosting Bitget (BGB)'s value. However, despite the surge, the token’s price struggled to maintain its gains, and Bitget's market share was still relatively limited compared to giants like Binance. Yet, the surge demonstrated the effectiveness of deflationary tactics in tokenomics, a lesson Coldware (COLD) is now applying in its growth strategy. Coldware (COLD): A New Contender with Similar Signals Coldware (COLD) has been gaining significant attention in the crypto space due to its innovative approach to decentralized finance and mobile-first mining solutions. The platform’s growing adoption and integration of sustainable mining solutions are drawing parallels to Bitget’s (BGB) rise in late 2024. Like Bitget, Coldware (COLD) has a strong tokenomics model, with plans for strategic burns and an emphasis on scalability and user engagement. Analysts have pointed out that Coldware (COLD) is showing the same signs of a potential breakout that Bitgetdemonstrated in late 2024. The combination of a deflationary model, increasing utility through decentralized finance features, and a growing user base is positioning Coldware to see a surge in its token value. With its hardware solutions gaining traction and the upcoming release of its Web3 mobile platform, Coldware (COLD) could soon be on the same growth trajectory as Bitget (BGB). Why Coldware (COLD) Could Outpace Bitget (BGB) While Bitget (BGB) achieved impressive gains through its deflationary strategy, it is still a centralized exchange token with limited utility outside of the Bitget ecosystem. In contrast, Coldware (COLD) operates as a decentralized platform with a focus on sustainability, scalability, and real-world utility. The integration of Coldware's hardware into personal mining setups and the mobile-first design of its ecosystem are set to drive adoption far beyond Bitget’s reach. If Coldware (COLD) follows the same path as Bitget (BGB)'s December 2024 surge, it could see massive growth in the coming months. The token’s innovative approach to DeFi and mining positions it as a leader in the space, and its scalability could be the key to a potential 12,000% price surge. Conclusion: Coldware (COLD) Shows Strong Signs for 2025 The similarities between Bitget (BGB)'s 2024 surge and Coldware (COLD) 's current trajectoryy are undeniable. With a focus on innovative mining hardware, a mobile-first DeFi ecosystem, and a deflationary tokenomics model, Coldware (COLD) is well-positioned to see exponential growth in 2025. As Coldware continues to expand and innovate, it could replicate Bitget (BGB)'s success and possibly even surpass it, making Coldware (COLD) one of the most exciting tokens to watch in the coming months.

With new innovations, fresh developments, and some unexpected comebacks, the crypto space is brimming with opportunities. Whether you’re new to the scene or you’ve been riding the crypto wave for a while, it’s clear that now’s the time to take a closer look at what’s coming next. Avalanche (AVAX) is already making some serious waves, and a fresh face, Qubetics ($TICS), is quickly gaining traction with major hype around its presale. But here’s the thing: The hype isn’t just about any crypto—it’s about the ones that are solving real-world problems, addressing gaps left by their predecessors, and changing the game in ways no one saw coming. And that’s exactly where Qubetics comes in. While Avalanche has been a solid performer, Qubetics is ready to revolutionize the space with its seamless interoperability solution. This could be the solution to the issues that have plagued blockchain projects for years, and as it inches closer to its mainnet launch, all eyes are on it. Avalanche (AVAX): A Powerhouse on the Rise If you’ve been in crypto for any amount of time, you’ve probably heard of Avalanche (AVAX). It’s been making a serious splash, offering scalability, speed, and lower costs than some of its more established competitors. Simply put, Avalanche has become a go-to for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, smart contracts, and other blockchain-based solutions. Its consensus protocol is one of the most advanced in the industry, and that’s allowed it to avoid the slow transaction times and high fees that can plague networks like Ethereum. Avalanche has earned its place in the “Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025” list thanks to its growing ecosystem, rapid adoption, and strong fundamentals. The Avalanche blockchain can process thousands of transactions per second—something Ethereum and Bitcoin can only dream about. With that kind of speed and efficiency, Avalanche is drawing more and more attention from developers who want to build faster, cheaper, and scalable decentralized apps (dApps). Right now, AVAX’s price sits at a reasonable point considering its recent gains and growing adoption. Analysts are bullish about its future, with some predicting that AVAX could potentially reach $150 or higher by the end of 2025. With its solid tech and continuous improvements, AVAX seems like a no-brainer for anyone looking to make a move in the crypto market next year. If you’re eyeing solid long-term gains, this might be the pick for you. Qubetics ($TICS): Okay, let’s talk about something new: Qubetics. This up-and-coming project has been shaking things up, offering something that’s been missing in the crypto space for a long time: true interoperability. In simple terms, Qubetics allows different blockchain networks to communicate and exchange information seamlessly, bridging the gap between disparate systems. But why does that matter? Well, right now, most blockchains operate in silos. For example, Ethereum doesn’t really talk to Binance Smart Chain or Solana. But with Qubetics, developers can create applications that work across multiple blockchains without dealing with the headache of compatibility issues. Imagine using DeFi apps or other blockchain-based services that can seamlessly switch from one blockchain to another—just like how your phone automatically connects to Wi-Fi networks or Bluetooth devices. That’s the kind of freedom Qubetics is bringing to the table. For everyday folks, this could revolutionize how business gets done. Take a small business owner using a blockchain-based payment system. They might be stuck using one network because that’s what their customers are on. But with Qubetics, that business could accept payments from Ethereum users, Solana users, and others, without worrying about network compatibility. It opens up so many possibilities for entrepreneurs, creators, and even regular people who want to take advantage of the decentralized economy without being locked into one ecosystem. Qubetics isn’t just talk, either. The presale is already in its 29th stage and has sold over 507 million tokens to more than 24,600 holders, raising more than $16million. Right now, you can still grab $TICS at $0.1573. If analysts are right, this token could skyrocket in value—some say it could reach $1, $5, or even $15 after the presale and mainnet launch. With these kinds of potential returns, it’s hard not to get excited. The question is: Will you jump in before it’s too late? Qubetics: The Presale Opportunity You Can’t Miss If you’re not paying attention to Qubetics right now, you might want to rethink that. As the crypto presale continues to build momentum, this is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects of 2025. The $TICS token has huge potential, with analysts predicting a possible ROI of 535% if it reaches $1, or even more if it hits $5 or $15 after the mainnet launch. You don’t have to be a crypto expert to see that the growth potential is massive. The presale is still ongoing, and early adopters have already made a significant impact. The presale stages have been selling out quickly, and the clock is ticking as more and more people get in on the action. If you’re serious about jumping into one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025, Qubetics is looking like a golden ticket. Here’s a quick snapshot of the Qubetics presale: Presale Stage: 29th stage Tokens Sold: 507 million tokens Total Raised: $16 million Current Token Price: $0.1573 Some analysts are predicting that $TICS could hit as much as $15 after the mainnet launch, offering a jaw-dropping ROI of 9434%. Imagine turning $100 into thousands if things go as analysts expect. But don’t wait around too long—opportunities like this don’t last forever. Conclusion: Time to Make a Move Looking ahead to 2025, it’s clear that there are some real gems in the crypto space. Avalanche is solid, reliable, and poised for growth, but Qubetics could be the real star of the show. Its innovative approach to multi chain wallet and growing community makes it a strong contender for anyone looking to get in on the next big thing. If you’re wondering which top cryptos to buy for 2025 , Qubetics should definitely be on your radar. Don’t miss out—this is one of those opportunities you’ll regret not taking advantage of.

Among the key players that have played a bullish role is Ozak AI , which has seen its $OZ token attain the expected 1 million raise level. Crypto Market Under Pressure as $OZ Records New Levels Tracking the market performance of other digital assets in the market, CoinMarketCap data indicates that Bitcoin (BTC), the first cryptocurrency exchanged at a price value of $79,797.31, showed a 4.95% drop in seven days.

New Level Unlocked: Ozak AI Hits $1 Million in Presale Funding As the crypto market turmoils, Ozak AI, a promising blockchain project focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized infrastructure, has reached a significant level of $1 million in presale funding.

These technologies allow Ozak AI to ensure data security, redundancy, and resilience by distributing data across multiple nodes, thus eliminating single points of failure. Smart contracts manage data access while an immutable ledger records transactions, providing users with secure, real-time data availability.

The $OZ token started at a price of $0.001 in its initial phase, rising to $0.002 in the second phase. Currently, during the third presale phase , the token is priced at $0.003, with the next stage expected to be priced at $0.005. This gradual increase in token prices highlights the significant potential for early investors. Ozak AI Live Presale!

In a recent statement to Fox News, Scott underlined that the U.S. must allow digital asset innovation to flourish at home before rushing to regulate — a stance that’s gaining traction across party lines. The senator pointed to the committee’s recent progress with the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill approved in March, as proof that Congress is serious about shaping crypto policy. The act proposes a standardized framework for dollar-backed stablecoins and is widely seen as the first concrete step toward broader regulation. Scott’s timeline aligns with remarks from Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association , who has echoed similar expectations for legislation covering both crypto market structure and stablecoins by late summer. The coordinated push from both lawmakers and industry advocates suggests a rare moment of unity on Capitol Hill. Growing Political Will for Regulation Crypto’s evolution from a niche sector to a key player in the global financial system has brought increased scrutiny — and opportunity. As U.S. officials eye competition from jurisdictions like the EU and UAE, calls for a clear legal framework have grown louder. At the Digital Assets Summit held in New York City this March, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna expressed confidence that the necessary bills will pass before year’s end. According to Khanna, more than 70 fellow Democrats now recognize the strategic importance of dollar-pegged digital assets. He also emphasized that stablecoins, when issued responsibly, could boost demand for the U.S. dollar globally — particularly in emerging markets where traditional banking is limited. Stablecoins Take Center Stage Bo Hines, who leads the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, offered an even more optimistic timeline. Speaking at the same summit, Hines suggested stablecoin legislation could clear Congress within the next 60 days. He also stressed that establishing U.S. leadership in crypto isn’t just an economic priority — it’s a national interest that transcends partisan divides. With both houses of Congress inching toward consensus and the White House backing innovation-led regulation, 2025 could be the year crypto finally gets a legal framework to grow — on U.S. soil and U.S. terms.

While established projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu fail to spark investor interest, CartelFi appears ready to lead the pack in the upcoming bull run. CartelFi is a new cryptocurrency project that claims to bridge meme tokens and decentralized finance (DeFi). Numbers indicate robust investor cravings, with over $835K raised in its live presale. Turning idle memes into income generators The cryptocurrency market remains flooded with meme assets with empty promises and unclear real-world use cases. CartelFi looks to shit this trend with massive utility: turning meme token liquidity via automatic token burns and deflationary yields. The revolutionary project leverages meme liquidity and staking pools to turn themed digital coins from speculative assets into money-making machines. Moreover, CartelFi’s deflationary mechanisms promise daily returns. Their official website states: Our meme-centric liquidity and staking pools turn memes into money printers, unlocking tens of billions of meme coin capital and unleashing it into the world of DeFi. Protocol fees are used to burn CARTFI tokens, meaning your bags are always bigger than they were yesterday. You earn, we burn, 24/7. CartelFi combines meme culture’s virility with DeFi’s core mechanisms—staking rewards, yield farming, and continuous token burns. This approach boosts the demand for assets through scarcity and fixed returns. CARTFI holders will enjoy lucrative rewards, with each token increasing in value over time. The Cartel movement CartelFi isn’t just a blockchain platform but a movement. It looks to democratize meme coins with phrases such as No more waiting. No more hoping. You’re either in, or you’re out. CartelFi targets investors tired of stagnant meme assets in their wallets while “praying for a 1000x.” Source – X Rather than speculating on the next viral project, CartelFi presented a robust DeFi ecosystem where meme tokens are never idle. Its deflationary mechanisms ensure that all fees and transactions contribute to token burns to enrich scarcity. Should you invest in CartelFi? CartelFi could be a lucrative opportunity for individuals interested in utility-based meme tokens offering passive income. The accelerating presale indicates unwavering investor trust. The current price of $0.0305 could be a perfect entry as CARTFI targets 1,000x growth upon its official debut. Moreover, early adopters will enjoy more returns as the token’s value increases in each ICO stage. CartelFI’s sharp messaging and aggressive branding.

Bitcoin’s surge to above $84k sees a notable vibe engulf the Bitcoin Cash community. This bullish outlook aligns with potential for BTC to retest $100 in the short term. If this traction holds, BCH could test the $400 mark and potentially extend gains to a new supply wall.. Solana: What next as SOL moves back above $130?

While Solana’s price hovered near $130, the altcoin boasts an all-time high of $293 on January 19, 2025. SOL’s ride above $130 will open up bulls to highs of $150 and potentially $200.

Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), a meme coin layered on Bitcoin’s blockchain as a Layer 2 solution, is getting notable interest . The project aims to blend BTC’s security and Solana’s network speed.

As traders monitor upcoming resistance and key indicators, the next few days will be crucial in determining whether Solana’s rally has legs—or if it’s just another short-lived bounce in a volatile macro environment. Solana Surges 40% As Long Thesis Takes Shape Solana has gained over 40% since last Monday, sparking renewed bullish sentiment and opening a debate among analysts and traders: is this the start of a sustained move higher, or will SOL consolidate around current prices? After weeks of persistent selling pressure, Solana has finally seen a wave of buying interest, bouncing strongly from a $95 low. This bounce marks one of the most aggressive reversals among major altcoins during the recent market correction. The surge came shortly after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China, which now faces a 145% tariff. The announcement sparked relief rallies across risk assets, with Solana among the top beneficiaries. Big Ched’s analysis reveals that Solana triggered a long thesis after successfully reclaiming the $125 resistance level. This move is seen as a breakout confirmation, suggesting that a bullish structure may now be forming. However, global tensions and trade war fears continue to inject uncertainty into financial markets. For Solana, holding above the $120–$125 support zone will be key in determining whether the recent bounce has staying power—or if further consolidation is in store.

This move signals a potential short-term trend shift in favor of the bulls, who are now holding some advantage after reclaiming these critical technical levels. The breakout came on strong volume, reinforcing the bullish momentum that emerged from last week’s bounce off the $95 low. However, for the rally to continue and higher highs to form, SOL must maintain its position above the $125 level and push toward the next major resistance around $146. Reclaiming this level would strengthen bullish conviction and confirm a recovery rally in the broader trend. Related Reading: Solana Approaches $125 – Will 2-Level Filter Trigger A Long Signal? Despite the recent strength, risks remain. If Solana fails to hold above $125, the bullish setup could unravel quickly, and the price may revisit the $100 demand zone. With global market volatility still elevated due to ongoing macroeconomic tensions, traders are watching this support-resistance range closely to determine whether SOL can sustain upward momentum or return to consolidation.

43287148,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63911,1744541053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Why Scott Bessent Role As Treasury Secretary Could Take XRP Mainstream,https://timestabloid.com/why-scott-bessent-role-as-treasury-secretary-could-take-xrp-mainstream/,"A recent post by crypto commentator All Things XRP has drawn attention to a significant development in U.S. economic leadership. The appointment of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary under President Donald Trump may signal a new era for digital assets, particularly XRP, as institutional barriers continue to fall. The tweet outlines Bessent’s credentials, his philosophy on crypto, and his early actions in office, asserting that his role could move XRP from the periphery to the center of U.S. financial strategy. According to the tweet, Scott Bessent is not a traditional political figure but a seasoned macro investor with over four decades of experience in global markets. His reputation was solidified in 1992, when he helped George Soros generate over $1 billion in profits during the infamous shorting of the British pound. With Bessent overseeing U.S. economic and crypto policy, his influence may extend well beyond traditional finance. Bessent’s Stance: “Crypto Is About Freedom” The post highlights Bessent’s direct quote from a July 2024 interview with Fox Business where he said, “Crypto is about freedom — and the U.S. shouldn’t fall behind.” The commentator emphasizes that this view is not merely symbolic, suggesting Bessent sees digital assets as integral to the United States’ strategic positioning in a rapidly evolving financial world. Under his leadership, digital assets are reportedly being treated not as speculative tools but as instruments of monetary sovereignty and international competitiveness. The tweet further notes that XRP is no longer absent from high-level government dialogue. In a policy session on digital assets, President Trump explicitly referenced XRP, including Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano. The post interprets this as a signal that XRP has entered official policy discussions and is now seen as a digital asset with national importance. Legal Clarity Removes Institutional Barriers Legal clarity surrounding XRP also plays a central role in the tweet. It asserts that the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded, with the results favorable to Ripple. According to the tweet, XRP is “not a security,” Ripple has prevailed, and “legal clarity is here.” This development, coupled with Bessent’s new role, removes previous uncertainties that had inhibited institutional investment and integration. The commentary speculates on the possibility that Ripple anticipated these shifts in government. It refers to unnamed sources in Washington who claim Ripple was in quiet contact with Treasury staff during Bessent’s confirmation process. If accurate, this would suggest that Ripple strategically timed its legal and regulatory actions in alignment with expected political changes. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Now a Consideration in U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve Discussions All Things XRP also points out that Bessent has been involved in internal discussions related to the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. During these meetings, XRP was reportedly named directly by President Trump. This inclusion is interpreted as evidence that XRP is being considered at the highest levels of U.S. government policy, not just as a financial asset but as part of a broader geopolitical framework. Bessent’s background, according to the tweet, includes longstanding ties to central banks and a deep understanding of global liquidity and capital flows. This makes him uniquely positioned to bring a macroeconomic lens to crypto policy, unlike previous Treasury officials who approached digital assets with regulatory caution or skepticism. A Structural Transformation in U.S. Crypto Policy The tweet concludes with a broader implication: the current moment may not represent a typical market cycle but the beginning of a structural transformation in global finance. With the lawsuit over, XRP legally defined, and a crypto-forward Treasury Secretary now shaping national policy, the tweet suggests that this is more than a shift in sentiment—it is a recalibration of the U.S. government’s approach to financial technology. Whether this period marks the dawn of a new monetary era remains to be seen. However, under Scott Bessent’s leadership, the role of digital assets—particularly XRP—in U.S. economic strategy appears to have significantly expanded.

Against wider trends, however, MUTM’s presale has now exceeded $6.65 million, with 405 million tokens bought by 8,200 holders. Now in Phase 4, tokens go for $0.025 — a number that will jump 20% to $0.03 as soon as Phase 5 opens. At its exchange debut at $0.06, early birds can ride 140% returns, with post-launch forecasts leaning towards over $1.50. As battered traders deal with the trauma of recent volatility, MUTM’s structured tokenomics and real-world utility is fast emerging as a freak of optimism. MUTM’s Presale Momentum As the presale proceeds, it’s gathering attention. Its model, focusing on real-world financial applications over speculation, sets it apart from competitors like Cardano (ADA). Phase 4 is advancing fast with a lending ecosystem, which enables users to borrow funds, lend funds, and earn returns with mtTokens, interest—accruing assets used to represent deposits like ETH and DAI. While ADA focuses on decentralised applications and smart contracts, MUTM is designed with an internal buy-and-distribute mechanic that drives platform revenue into token buybacks to reward long-term stakers. This feedback loop is part of what has already driven the presale through its first three phases, and analysts believe that it has the potential to counteract the stagnation of the market from the Trump trade tariffs. New investors get tokens at $0.025 step up from here before the next hike, potentially netting a 2.4x run at launch. Built-In Demand Mechanisms At the core of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its engineered scarcity. By distributing a percentage of platform fees to buy back MUTM tokens, the protocol incentivizes buy pressure while redistributing rewards to mtToken holders. This approach sharply contrasts ADA’s dependence on network updates to create value. At the same time, MUTM’s overcollateralized lending approach helps mitigate default risk, appealing to risk-averse investors looking for stability in the volatile crypto market. To take out loans, borrowers have to lock up assets greater than the value of their loans—a $7,000 ETH collateral for a $5,000 USDT loan, for example—creating a buffer that protects lenders and stabilizes the ecosystem. The combination of features has led to expectations of a 2,400% return on investment following launch, while some estimates are targeting $1.50 as adoption grows. Strategic Growth and Security Mutuum Finance Deepens Trust With Transparency Initiatives A dashboard debuted that tracks the top 50 token holders, with bonus rewards activated for those who stay within the leaderboard. This move intensifies FOMO as Phase 4 continues to unfold. At the same time, the team is finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a move that will add an indisputable layer of credibility once complete. These moves are part of a plan to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, which would increase utility in its lending ecosystem. If ADA is still battling to carve a niche within a competitive space, MUTM’s roadmap is keeping a clear focus on real life DeFi applications — from loans, to market driven rates. Mutuum Finance is more than just a recovery play for investors sitting on the sidelines in the wake of the recent crash. It’s a bridge to millionaire status in 2027. Phase 4 has special bonuses such as access to presale prices and automatic entry to a $100,000 giveaway for early token buyers, creating incentives to act quickly. Pending Certik verification and poised for exchange listings, MUTM’s cocktail of innovation and practices renders it the most promising upstart challenger to Cardano. As ChatGPT’s analysis indicates, the opportunity for ground-floor access is closing. Build Your Team Before Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale investors better hurry up. The clock is ticking. Phase 4’s $0.025 price level is one of the last opportunities to strike before the next phase, with tokens likely to go off while majors like ADA cool. Stay up to date on the Certik audit, and stake your claim in a project that is redefining DeFi’s future by checking out Mutuum Finance’s official channels.

Among memecoins, can Dogecoin (DOGE) lead or will Shiba Inu (SHIB) price take the initiative? Bitcoin’s $80K Move Improves Odds for DOGE & Shiba Inu Price Rally With Bitcoin finally showing bullish signs, the outlook remains optimistic. In such a case, Shiba Inu price has the upper hand, as seen in the past few days. Comparing returns shows that in 2025 on TradingView , SHIB price is down -42% while DOGE price is down -48%, showing that the selling pressure from Shiba Inu holders is not much. If Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish and holds its ground above $80K, BTC could easily revisit $100K before April ends. In such a case, Shiba Inu looks more primed to rally and lead. Shiba Inu Price vs. Dogecoin Price Performance Between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, investors are much more interested and committed to SHIB compared to DOGE. Moreover, Elon Musk’s involvement with the former hampered the popularity and the first meme coin has not been the same since. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, was designed and marketed as a Dogecoin-killer, which is what caused exorbitant rallies in the initial days. Hence, chances of SHIB outperforming the original dog-based meme coin are higher. Dogecoin & Shiba Inu Price Analysis Dogecoin price shows that it is currently bouncing off the $0.139 to $0.150 support levels. These barriers were critical resistance levels in mid-2024, but a breakout above this led to a 250% rally in the next 50 days. Hence, holding these levels is key for DOGE bulls for bullish reversals and restarting the uptrend. A breakout above $0.196 will signal a flip of the market structure, favoring bulls. In such a case, Dogecoin price prediction hints at a 60% rally to $0.313. However, if the buying pressure is strong, DOGE could revisit $0.484 after a 110% climb. DOGE/USDT 1-Day Chart A quick look at the Shiba Inu price action shows that it has breached the declining trendlines that serve as resistance. Now, SHIB needs to overcome the $0.00001364 hurdle and flip it into a support floor to confirm the start of a bull run. In such a case, this Shiba Inu price forecast suggests that the meme coin could explode 108% to $0.00002868. SHIB/USDT 1-Day Chart Considering that Shiba Inu is a Dogecoin-killer, it is more likely that the new meme coin will skyrocket and lead the meme coin pack. DOGE will have to follow SHIB’s footsteps.

From Dogecoin to SHIB, they’ve taken on many forms but until now, none have entered the space with a sports-first identity. XYZVerse changes that. Billed as the first-ever all-sports meme coin, XYZVerse is attempting something new in a saturated sector. While the meme coin space is often driven by internet culture and hype, this project takes a more structured approach, aiming to merge global sports fandom with community-based token utility. Nothing quite like XYZVerse has been created before. Its goal is to tap into the emotional energy of sports culture — loyalty, rivalry, identity — and channel it through a decentralized meme coin ecosystem. Whether this experiment of blending sports, memes, and crypto catches on at scale remains to be seen — but with the next bull cycle on the horizon, XYZVerse enters the conversation as a unique case to watch. XYZVerse In a Nutshell The project is currently in its presale phase, with $XYZ tokens offered at a discounted rate of $0.003333 ahead of its planned exchange listing. It has also gained early attention for its upcoming large-scale airdrop campaign and strong user sentiment across platforms like CoinMarketCap , where the majority of user votes skew bullish. Community support has been a major driver of its early momentum. With thousands of users actively following the project across social platforms and over $13 million raised in its presale (now in Stage 12 out of 15), XYZVerse has positioned itself as a meme coin with both traction and substance. Learn more about XYZVerse and explore early entry while the presale is live. What sets the project apart further is the early recognition it has received: XYZVerse was awarded Best New Meme Project by crypto.news, a well-known industry media outlet. This distinction adds credibility to its growing reputation as a serious contender in the meme coin space. In terms of security, XYZVerse has taken proactive measures by undergoing comprehensive smart contract audits from both Pessimistic and SolidProof — two respected names in blockchain security. These audits are designed to ensure code safety, transparency, and a lower risk profile for early participants. Security-checked and community-backed—explore $XYZ now How Could XYZ Become the Next SHIB? Of course, any new meme coin inevitably draws comparisons to the giants that came before it — and few names loom larger than Shiba Inu (SHIB). Launched in 2020 with no initial utility and minimal exposure, SHIB became a global phenomenon, rising from obscurity to reach a multi-billion-dollar market cap. It was driven not by advanced tech or partnerships, but by community strength and social virality — the same conditions XYZVerse is hoping to recreate, albeit through a very different thematic lens. While SHIB tapped into meme culture and the legacy of Dogecoin, XYZVerse is leaning into the world of sports fandom , attempting to build a tribe around a different kind of identity: one rooted in team spirit, competition, and global appeal. How does XYZVerse compare to SHIB? Let’s take a look: Feature XYZVerse ($XYZ) Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) Launch Stage Currently in presale (Stage 12 of 15) Launched in August 2020 Token Price $0.003333 (presale price) ~$0.0000000005 at launch Planned Listing Price $0.10 N/A Token Supply Capped, no future minting planned Quadrillion-level total supply Theme / Branding All-sport meme coin with broad cultural appeal Dog-themed meme coin based on Dogecoin parody Utility Partnership with Bookmaker.XYZ betting platform, and a planned launch of a play-to-earn app Initially none (later added ShibaSwap & NFT use) Airdrop Campaign 10% of total supply reserved for airdrops No structured airdrop at launch Ecosystem Plans Future gamification, platform integration, DAO-based Developed later: DEX, NFT, metaverse initiatives Market Entry Timing Entering ahead of a bull cycle Launched before and surged during 2021 bull run While XYZVerse enters a very different market climate than SHIB did in 2020, there are clear similarities that point to its potential for outsized success — and a few distinct advantages that could help it avoid some of SHIB’s early limitations. Shared Strengths: What They Have in Common Community Focus : Both projects place heavy emphasis on building a strong, active community. SHIB’s rise was fueled almost entirely by retail enthusiasm and online virality — XYZVerse is tapping into similar grassroots momentum, with 95% of CoinMarketCap voters currently expressing a bullish outlook. Meme Appeal : Like SHIB, XYZVerse isn’t pretending to be just another utility token. It embraces the power of internet culture — but instead of dog-themed memes, it leans into global sports fandom to unify a broad audience under one banner. Early Opportunity : Just as SHIB rewarded those who got in before mainstream awareness hit, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase , offering early access pricing that mirrors the kind of positioning early SHIB holders once had. Where XYZVerse Has an Advantage Structured Tokenomics : Unlike SHIB’s quadrillion-level supply and inflationary start, XYZVerse features a capped supply with no future minting planned — a model designed to support price sustainability and limit dilution. Defined Utility from Day One : While SHIB added real utility (like ShibaSwap and NFTs) much later, XYZVerse entered the market with a clear roadmap, staking rewards, and airdrop mechanics already in place. Airdrop-Fueled Growth : 10% of XYZ’s total supply is reserved for airdrops — an incentive strategy that SHIB didn’t have at launch. This not only rewards early community members but helps boost engagement and wallet distribution in a targeted way. Market Timing : XYZVerse is launching ahead of what many analysts believe could be the next bull cycle. If momentum builds as the broader market recovers, XYZ could benefit from strong tailwinds, similar to how SHIB did during its 2021 surge. In short, XYZVerse shares the meme-powered DNA that helped SHIB go viral, but it’s entering the space with more structure, strategic planning, and a broader thematic base. Final Thoughts SHIB’s story proves that small beginnings can lead to explosive outcomes. XYZVerse may not be on every radar yet, but those watching closely see a familiar pattern taking shape. The real question is whether the conditions that led to SHIB’s success can align again in 2025, this time in favor of XYZVerse. Though nothing is guaranteed, the early indicators (including a capped supply, defined roadmap, and strong presale momentum) suggest the project is attempting to position itself on a similar track — but with a clearer structure from the start.

The daily chart presents a compelling setup, with price action nudging above the midline of the Bollinger Bands—a classic sign of growing upward momentum. After a prolonged consolidation phase, this movement hints at a shift in sentiment as bulls attempt to reclaim dominance. The tightening of the Bollinger Bands in recent weeks, followed by their gradual expansion, suggests that BTC could soon see a decisive breakout . Bollinger Bands Indicate Imminent Price Expansion Currently, the Bollinger Bands (20, SMA) display early signs of volatility resurgence. The upper band now stands at $88,723.44, acting as immediate resistance, while the lower band supports at $77,392.08. Bitcoin’s flirtation with the upper region of this envelope is a bullish signal, particularly if the price closes convincingly above the upper band. Such a move could validate a rally towards the critical $90,000–$95,000 range. However, if sellers regain control, a fallback to the $80,000–$83,000 consolidation zone remains likely. MACD Suggests a Brewing Bullish Reversal Reinforcing this outlook is the MACD (12, 26, close), which shows a narrowing gap between the MACD line (-803.81) and the signal line (-1,273.06), hinting at an impending bullish crossover. The histogram flipping green with a current value of 469.25 reflects growing bullish momentum. Historically, this technical setup often precedes short-term price surges. The momentum, while early, shows a favorable shift in sentiment that could translate into a stronger move if supported by volume. Market Sentiment Turns Positive, But Resistance Looms Despite these bullish indicators, caution remains warranted. Bitcoin is still below its 20-day SMA, meaning a trend reversal is not yet confirmed. The upper Bollinger Band poses a formidable barrier. Traders should look for confirmation via a strong daily close above $88,700 and increasing trading volume. A failure to sustain current levels may result in another phase of sideways movement or a minor retracement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prediction For Today Given the technical landscape, Bitcoin is likely to challenge the $86,000–$88,000 resistance zone in today’s session. A break and hold above $88,723 could accelerate bullish momentum, targeting the psychological $90,000 level. Conversely, rejection of this barrier may trigger a pullback to $82,000 or below. Momentum indicators favor the bulls, but conviction from buyers is crucial to sustain the trend. BTC on the Verge of a Breakout as Momentum Builds Bitcoin is entering a critical phase where momentum indicators and price structure hint at a bullish breakout. The widening Bollinger Bands, combined with a near MACD crossover, paint a promising technical picture. However, a clear break above key resistance levels is essential for further upside. Traders should stay alert today as BTC tests the upper bounds of its recent range—success here could mark the beginning of a broader upward move toward $90,000 and beyond.

The analysis states that XRP has entered a technical stabilization process, while the general downtrend is still ongoing. According to MakroVision, the XRP price is at a critical stage. The failure of the price to permanently break through the resistance zone in the $2.20-$2.30 range limits bullish scenarios at this stage. According to the analytics company: For XRP, the $2.19–$2.23 range is forming a strong resistance cluster along with the 0.382 Fibonacci level ($2.30). A break above this level could allow the price to gain new bullish momentum towards the $2.50 level. The $1.90-$2.00 range stands out as the support zone for XRP in the short term. A sustained drop below this level could drag the price back to the recent lows. Related News: Bitcoin Hit Support in Special Metric, Analytics Company Says: Here Are the Scenarios That Could Happen If It Falls or Bounces MakroVision states that XRP is currently in a critical decision phase. It is stated that a breakout above $2.30 could trigger a trend change, but a possible pullback below $1.90 would reinforce the downtrend. *This is not investment advice.

43286334,https://nulltx.com/?p=147943,1744542269,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"After Turning $27 into $52M with PEPE, Will Traders Spot Codename:Pepe Next?",https://nulltx.com/after-turning-27-into-52m-with-pepe-will-traders-spot-codenamepepe-next/,"In the world of meme coins, some stories are almost too unbelievable—yet entirely real. One crypto investor famously turned a $27 investment in $PEPE into $52 million . The savvy trader eventually got a 1.9 million-fold return after holding 2.1 trillion tokens for nearly two years. Earlier, another PEPE trader turned $3,000 into $46 million , reinforcing one of crypto’s golden rules: in this high-risk, high-reward arena, timing and early entry can make all the difference. PEPE’s success sparked a wave of new meme coins aiming to follow a similar path. Among the most talked-about is Codename:Pepe, a new contender that offers both meme-driven energy and real utility through AI integration and strategic presale design. Codename:Pepe Turns Memes into Market Intelligence Inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) sets out to bring strategic intelligence to the often chaotic world of meme coin investing. It combines viral meme appeal with AI-powered tools, aiming to create a more informed, data-driven crypto ecosystem. At its core is the $AGNT token, which gives holders access to AI-generated market insights, automated trading signals, exclusive research reports, and a private DAO for collaborative investment decision-making. The team also plans to launch an AI-powered meme coin launchpad, helping users identify the next breakout token before the crowd catches on. $AGNT: What Could Early Investment Look Like Let’s imagine an early supporter invests $1,000 into $AGNT during its presale phase, where the current token price is $0.013888 at stage 15. Here’s how it breaks down: At $0.013888 per token, a $1,000 investment gives the holder ~72,000 $AGNT tokens . According to the project roadmap, the planned listing price is $1.00 per token. If the token launches successfully at $1, that original $1,000 investment would be worth $72,000. That’s a +7,100% return , or 72X growth from the original entry point, assuming the token hits its target price at launch and maintains that level. The earlier you enter, the stronger your position — join the $AGNT presale today The Vision: Building an AI-Driven Trading Ecosystem Codename:Pepe is setting out to build a fully automated trading environment , where AI tools assist users in navigating the volatile meme coin space with greater accuracy and control. Among its planned features: An AI-powered auto-trading bot for market engagement Customizable trading strategies tailored to individual risk profiles Staking rewards that encourage long-term holding and ecosystem loyalty But Codename:Pepe isn’t just about smarter trading—it’s also about decentralized collaboration. Through its DAO, $AGNT holders will participate in investment decisions, gain access to premium analytics, and vote on upcoming project launches via the AI-integrated launchpad. Additionally, a mutual DAO fund is being developed to share profits among active stakers, reinforcing ongoing community participation. Could Codename:Pepe Rival PEPE? Where PEPE rose to fame on viral momentum and community-driven hype, Codename:Pepe takes a more strategic path—merging meme culture with AI-powered infrastructure. This technological foundation gives Codename:Pepe a potential edge, especially for investors seeking early-stage projects with high upside potential and real utility. Another point of differentiation lies in tokenomics: Codename:Pepe features a capped token supply, with no future minting planned—an intentional step toward price stability and long-term sustainability, in contrast to PEPE’s large and inflationary token model. Final Thoughts Codename:Pepe is bridging two of crypto’s strongest trends—AI integration and meme coin culture—into a single forward-looking project. Though still in its early development phase, the combination of presale traction, community incentives, and a clearly defined AI-powered roadmap sets it apart from the crowd. For investors inspired by legendary PEPE stories—like turning $27 into $52 million – Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) may offer a fresh, structured opportunity with significant growth potential. And with its presale still open, early movers still have time to get involved.

The new United States stablecoin bill , known as the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act,” is a big move for safeguarding blockchain innovation in the US . Sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), it marks a rare moment of bipartisan support for establishing a clear regulatory framework for one particular facet of the digital assets industry: namely, an area that has potential to establish meaningful guidelines around licensing and oversight, transparency and reserve standards, and consumer protection and AML/KYC. You might also like: US leadership in crypto: The focus is on stablecoins | Opinion While it’s already passed the Senate Banking Committee in an 18-6 vote, the GENIUS Act has yet to become law. But, if the bill goes through, it could propel the US past other jurisdictions—particularly Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation in Europe—that have traditionally outpaced the US when it comes to enacting clear regulatory frameworks for crypto. However, it’s far too easy to think that on day one after this bill passes, crypto exchanges, financial firms, and even companies like Amazon, X, and Meta will be immediately encouraged to increase their participation in the stablecoin landscape. The reality is that the success of these institutions hinges on access to instant price feeds—something that is not universally accessible today. What no one is talking about when it comes to the GENIUS Act Real-time, accurate market data is what powers the world’s most renowned exchanges and financial institutions. Think about it: speed was everything when high frequency trading first came onto the scene in the early aughts, and the most competitive traders from those days still remember losing big time on an arbitrage opportunity all because someone else was just a few milliseconds faster. However, experts estimate that today, regulatory fragmentation leads to huge losses for financial institutions, which can be as high as 5-10% of their annual turnover. On top of that, while overall market data spend increased by 8.1% in 2024 alone, research also shows that the rising cost of market data is rapidly outpacing consumer budgets in a way that is wholly unsustainable. Last year, we saw record-breaking spending allocated towards market data as a result of a significant increase in the use of trading terminals. What’s clear is that, as time goes on, access to accurate, real-time market data will become increasingly reserved for the elite few who can afford it. That doesn’t stop with simply barring individual traders from getting access—some firms pay up to 12 times more than their peers for the same data. And affordable options like Yahoo! Finance and Google Finance aren’t going to cut it: here, you can only get stale data, which is relatively useless to traders who need to capitalize on market movements happening faster than the blink of an eye. If the GENIUS Act passes, the US will have the necessary regulatory clarity on stablecoins to see increasing participation from firms and companies, but the key piece missing for these firms and companies to successfully implement stablecoin payments and investments is universal access to real-time price feeds. How DeFi is rewriting the market data economy DeFi has the potential to solve the problem of accessible, affordable real-time price data through unique offerings like decentralized price layers. Nothing in TradFi exists quite like these price layers today, which aggregate real-time, high-fidelity information directly from first-party providers, offering over one thousand symbols to anyone at any time. This eliminates the monopolistic control of pricing data and ensures open, transparent access for all participants. Through next-gen infrastructure, decentralized price layers are working hand-in-hand with traditional institutions to aggregate the freshest, purest data straight from the source. And since the data is published on chain, it’s available without the exorbitant cost associated with a Bloomberg Terminal subscription. Additionally, DeFi protocols process execution through the use of smart contracts. This seamlessly automates liquidity provision, trade matching, and order fulfillment, minimizing costs and errors while simultaneously enabling an unmatched level of speed and efficiency. TradFi is often heavily associated with middlemen, but DeFi democratizes access, meaning anyone with an internet connection can use decentralized tools at their disposal. At the same time, settlement in DeFi is near-instantaneous because it leverages on-chain offerings to transfer assets and funds in seconds. This reduces counterparty risk and ensures capital is available for continuous use—something that you rarely find in the realm of TradFi where delays are the norm. Why the future of finance is more than just DeFi vs. TradFi In light of coming regulatory clarity on stablecoin payments, universal access to real-time prices will spur companies and firms to adopt stablecoin payments and participate in investments—in fact, this is a critical ingredient to their viability and growth. Democratizing access is the next frontier of financial efficiency. When pricing data is freely available, market participants can compete on execution and liquidity as opposed to privileged access alone. Additionally, when execution venues are decentralized, liquidity deepens, reducing spreads and improving capital efficiency; and when settlement is transparent and near-instant, counterparty risks disappear, unlocking greater market participation. But this goes beyond simply pushing DeFi’s offerings to an ever-increasing number of users. Democratizing access to real-time, accurate market data will improve the finance industry as a whole, opening up a new era where institutions and individuals alike can compete equitably. While the GENIUS Act is an important piece of legislation that is helping to put decentralized assets like stablecoins on the map, we can’t forget that essential infrastructure—like affordable, accessible price feeds—need to be in place to usher in a new era of finance: one where the best of DeFi and TradFi can come together to create an open, transparent, and lightning-fast system for all.

But for the 7-day window ending Apr. 10, XRP was the least worst off for the wear, down by 2.05% for the week, with BTC down 2.16%, ETH down 13.34%, and BNB down 2.23%. Big Bank’s Killer XRP Price Forecast Meanwhile, UK mega bank Standard Chartered said in a Q2 note to investors that XRP prices are about to rally to as high as 275% from April by the end of the year. “We think XRP price gains can keep pace with Bitcoin in real terms,” wrote StanChart’s digital assets researcher Geoff Kendrick. He added that Ripple’s global payments token is “uniquely positioned at the heart of one of the fastest-growing uses for digital assets—facilitation of cross-border and cross-currency payments.” Kendricks targeted $5.50 for XRP’s price by year’s end. Moreover, he mentioned that he could see the token trading for $12.50 before Trump leaves office in 2029. That would represent a gain of 525% over the XRP price of $2.00 on Apr. 10 and an average annualized ROI of 131%. Here are five metas driving XRP’s price higher on token exchanges in Q2 2025. 1. USA Today: XRP ‘Most Resistant’ to Tariffs Cryptocurrencies and stocks were highly sensitive to Trump’s tariffs in his first term and have proven so again this year. So a recent report in the USA Today is very bullish for XRP. The newspaper’s investing section reported on Apr. 4, “Of the three biggest cryptocurrencies, XRP has been the most resistant to the impact of tariffs. Since Feb. 1, it is actually up a modest 2%.” Furthermore, the paper added that bullish investors think “XRP’s role in powering cross-border payments using the XRP blockchain is tariff-proof.” In this outlook, regardless of how global trading partners shift, they’ll still use Ripple to settle high-volume transactions. #Ripple $XRP Recently the secretary of the treasury Scott Bessent, stated that we would have a new Bretton Woods moment.

Bullish XRP Price Falling Flag Continuation Pattern #XRP IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE!!! pic.twitter.com/NxRT2upDli — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) April 10, 2025 In addition to macro tailwinds blowing Ripple’s way, there’s a bullish technical indicator showing up on XRP’s price chart. The same pattern preceded the payment token’s explosive 90-day 600% Q4 rally from $0.50 to $3.50 from November to January. The falling flag pattern frequently indicates a continuation of a bullish trend, especially if it occurs with declining daily trade volume, as it does in the case of XRP since January. Popular X analyst Steph Is Crypto exclaimed upon presenting the bullish chart pattern to thousands of viewers, “XRP IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE!!!” Especially after showing strength with a 10% surge upon Donald Trump’s tariff juke, XRP appears poised to fly high again on the next altcoin season tidal swell. 3. Big Ripple: 60% Surge in XRP Network Usage But, for the value investor who eschews technical analysis in favor of fundamental analysis of crypto assets like Ripple’s token, a 60% April surge in XRP payment volume may be worth investigating. With such a massive increase in network usage for its payments use case, the concurrent slump in April prices for XRP may represent a window to make an entry in the asset at value. Meanwhile, Ripple saw a surge in new addresses holding at least one XRP. The massive increase in network payments volume may imply greater demand for XRP tokens and a tailwind for Ripple valuations. 80% of this network’s currency was held at profit in April. 4. Ripple Acquires $1.25 Billion Tradfi and DeFi Brokerage In an impressive show of financial strength and strategic acme, Ripple Labs inked a deal in April to acquire Hidden Road, a $1.25 billion brokerage and financial clearinghouse for traditional and blockchain assets. As a result of the merger, Hidden Road’s financial brokerage platform will use Ripple’s new stablecoin RLUSD as collateral for its prime brokerage services. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse said: “With these tailwinds, we are continuing to pursue opportunities to massively transform the space, leveraging our unique position and strengths of XRP to accelerate our business and enhance our current solutions and technology.” Family office investment advisor Jake Claver wrote on X: “Hidden Road serves 300+ institutional clients who process $10 billion in trades DAILY. And now they’ll be settling those trades on the XRP Ledger. Think about that: massive financial institutions using XRPL for what it was built to do.” Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is a defining moment for the XRP Ledger and XRP. The prime broker clears upwards of $10B and processes over 50M transactions a day on various traditional rails, waiting up to 24 hours for those transactions to settle. Now imagine even a portion… https://t.co/xiHdyy30Sm — David “JoelKatz” Schwartz (@JoelKatz) April 8, 2025 5. Bitcoin Cyclical Support for XRP Price Growth In addition to its own fundamentals and strategic competitive advantages, the XRP economy sits directly adjacent to Bitcoin’s massive liquidity pool on several cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchains. It benefits from upward forces on daily market prices exerted by its prolific exchange economy with Bitcoin and the original cryptocurrency’s titanic gravity well for capital inflows. One popular Crypto X analyst, CRYPTOWZRD, recently wrote : “Whatever Bitcoin does, XRP will follow that. No altcoins can escape while Bitcoin is crashing.” Several major fintechs forecast Bitcoin prices to continue to melt up over the remainder of President Donald Trump’s second term.

On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has massive presale momentum, having just launched, but has already completed a $6.6 million raise and has over 8,200 holders. Now in Phase 4 of its 11-phase presale, MUTM tokens are at $0.025 (this is set to rise by 20% to $0.03 when Phase 5 launches). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors with a potential safe harbor in a broader Solana market trend. As other tokens such as Solana drift in turbulent waters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM ) is a unique blend of DeFi utility, with a roadmap designed for aggressive growth. Solana’s Downward Spiral Solana (SOL) now at $106.25 is down 22% monthly, with analysts warning of more downside to as low as $50 if their bearish trend continues. U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have spurned market instability that has seen SOL trading volume soar 300% amid panic sales by investors. Bearish control is further supported by technical indicators such as the RSI (37.55) and MACD, with the critical support levels having fallen. With regard to SOL holders, this new mutation of crypto offers a way out of uncertainty and one — posted a structured return through a presale model and real-world financial application — which Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is cashing in on. Presale Spark of Mutuum Finance Despite the not-so-smooth market environment, Mutuum Finance – a leading crypto lending ecosystem – is proceeding with its Phase 4 presale, now exceeding 400 million tokens sold. Current investors will have secured a whopping 140% gain before peer-to-peer trading begins at $0.06. Further, the price is set to rise 20% to $0.03 in the next Stage (Phase 5) of the ongoing presale. Instead of chasing volatility like Solana, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finds its fundamental value in decentralized lending mechanics, where users can borrow, lend and accrue interest on mtTokens that can be transferred across DeFi platforms. A buy and distribute model drives demand for the project, as platform revenue is used to buy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens, which are then distributed as rewards to stakers. Leading Factors for Adoption Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently launched a dashboard that tracks the top 50 token holders, who will receive bonus rewards for retaining their placement — a strategy that engenders allegiance among early supporters. Coupled with an overcollateralized lending system and dynamic interest rates, the protocol minimizes the risks that have plagued projects like Solana. Phase 4 investors can expect an ROI of between 2,400% and 19,900% based on post-launch price predictions of between $1 and $5, a return dwarfing any from stagnant large-cap tokens. Mutuum Finance smart contracts are currently undergoing an audit by auditing firm Certik, and results are due shortly. This initiative for transparency enhances your credibility, as security concerns are at the head of many discussions in today’s crypto society. As Solana battles back at $110, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a haven for yield investors. It is now or never for Solana holders to make a pivot before the end of phase 4. As each presale phase has sold out more quickly than the last, any delay risks missing the lowest entry price level before Mutuum Finance’s exchange launch. Grab your Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens now at $0.025 — or miss the next price rally pass you by.

43287151,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63917,1744543851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Golden Cross Pattern Hints at Explosive XRP Rally,https://timestabloid.com/golden-cross-pattern-hints-at-explosive-xrp-rally/,"XRP’s current 2025 price structure is strikingly similar to the conditions that triggered its explosive 2024 rally. In the comparison chart, the left panel shows XRP consolidating between $0.47 and $0.55 before surging to $1.58—a 236% breakout within weeks. On the right, the current chart reveals an almost identical setup unfolding at a higher range, between $1.70 and $2.70, hinting at another major move. This fractal symmetry is more than a coincidence. The same market psychology is at play: former resistance has flipped to support, and the price is compressing within a tight range—often a precursor to volatility expansion. When patterns repeat at higher levels alongside stronger indicators, the likelihood of a more aggressive continuation rally increases significantly. Accumulation Zone Both periods feature a classic horizontal accumulation pattern. In 2024, XRP consolidated for months beneath $0.55 before bulls took control, triggering a vertical rally. In 2025, the price is coiling again—this time between $1.70 and $2.10—following a strong impulsive move. This consolidation phase suggests a bullish continuation , building pressure for a breakout. The longer the base, the stronger the breakout. With a higher foundation and repeating structure, XRP appears primed for a move that could exceed its 2024 gains. Golden Cross and MACD: Momentum Signals Align Adding to the bullish case is a newly confirmed MACD golden cross on the 2-day chart. This same signal preceded the 2024 breakout. Once again, the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, with a rising histogram and growing momentum. Notably, a bullish divergence is forming beneath the price—MACD is printing higher lows while the price remains flat or slightly lower. This divergence often signals hidden strength and precedes sharp upward moves. If history is any guide, XRP may be gearing up for a significant rally in the near term. Targets at $6, $14, and Beyond Projecting the 2024 breakout onto the current base around $1.80, a 236% move would place XRP near $6.05. However, if XRP is entering a Wave 5 Elliott impulse, as the pattern suggests, the upside could be far greater. A 700% to 900% rally would project targets between $14 and $18. These figures align with Fibonacci extensions and the parabolic arrow on the current chart. A breakout above $2.80 on strong volume could unlock this vertical trajectory, triggering cascading buy orders as resistance levels fall. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Watching the Fuse In 2024, volume spiked just before the breakout, confirming institutional interest. In 2025, participation is beginning to build. If XRP closes above $2.80 with elevated volume, it would likely spark widespread FOMO, propelling the price toward key psychological levels: $5.00, $8.00, and $10.00. The sentiment is also shifting. Social media buzz is picking up, and traders are spotlighting the familiar setup. All attention now turns to the $2.80–$3.00 resistance zone. A clean break could clear the runway for a vertical ascent. History May Repeat with Even Greater Force XRP is coiled at a critical juncture. With a near-identical structure to the 2024 breakout—now at a higher level—and confirmation from a golden cross, bullish MACD divergence, and textbook accumulation, the case for a powerful move is strong. If volume confirms the breakout, XRP could surge 700% to 900%, targeting the $14 to $18 range in the coming weeks or months. For traders and investors, this may be the moment to watch closely because sometimes, history doesn’t just rhyme… it repeats.

With tools like OpenAI’s Custom GPTs, it is now possible for beginners and enthusiasts to create intelligent trading bots capable of analyzing data, generating signals and even executing trades. This guide analyzes the fundamentals of building a beginner-friendly AI crypto trading bot using Custom GPTs. It covers setup, strategy design, coding, testing and important considerations for safety and success. What is a custom GPT? A custom GPT (generative pretrained transformer) is a personalized version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT . It can be trained to follow specific instructions, work with uploaded documents and assist with niche tasks, including crypto trading bot development. These models can help automate tedious processes, generate and troubleshoot code, analyze technical indicators and even interpret crypto news or market sentiment, making them ideal companions for building algorithmic trading bots. What you’ll need to get started Before creating a trading bot, the following components are necessary : OpenAI ChatGPT Plus subscription (for access to GPT-4 and Custom GPTs). A crypto exchange account that offers API access (e.g., Coinbase , Binance, Kraken ). Basic knowledge of Python (or willingness to learn). A paper trading environment to safely test strategies. Optional: A VPS or cloud server to run the bot continuously. Did you know? Python’s creator, Guido van Rossum, named the language after Monty Python’s Flying Circus, aiming for something fun and approachable. Step-by-step guide to building an AI trading bot with custom GPTs Whether you’re looking to generate trade signals, interpret news sentiment or automate strategy logic, the below step-by-step approach helps you learn the basics of combining AI with crypto trading . With sample Python scripts and output examples, you'll see how to connect a custom GPT to a trading system, generate trade signals and automate decisions using real-time market data. Step 1: Define a simple trading strategy Start by identifying a basic rule-based strategy that is easy to automate. Examples include: Buy when Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) daily price drops by more than 3%. Sell when RSI (relative strength index) exceeds 70. Enter a long position after a bullish moving average convergence divergence (MACD) crossover. Trade based on sentiment from recent crypto headlines. Clear, rule-based logic is essential for creating effective code and minimizing confusion for your Custom GPT. Step 2: Create a custom GPT To build a personalized GPT model: Visit chat.openai.com Navigate to Explore GPTs > Create Name the model (e.g., “Crypto Trading Assistant”) In the instructions section, define its role clearly. For example: “You are a Python developer specialized in crypto trading bots.” “You understand technical analysis and crypto APIs.” “You help generate and debug trading bot code.” Optional: Upload exchange API documentation or trading strategy PDFs for additional context. Step 3: Generate the trading bot code (with GPT’s help) Use the custom GPT to help generate a Python script. For example, type: “Write a basic Python script that connects to Binance using ccxt and buys BTC when RSI drops below 30. I am a beginner and don’t understand code much so I need a simple and short script please.” The GPT can provide: Code for connecting to the exchange via API. Technical indicator calculations using libraries like ta or TA-lib. Trading signal logic. Sample buy/sell execution commands. Python libraries commonly used for such tasks are: ccxt for multi-exchange API support. pandas for market data manipulation. ta or TA-Lib for technical analysis. schedule or apscheduler for running timed tasks. To begin, the user must install two Python libraries: ccxt for accessing the Binance API, and ta (technical analysis) for calculating the RSI. This can be done by running the following command in a terminal: pip install ccxt ta Next, the user should replace the placeholder API key and secret with their actual Binance API credentials. These can be generated from a Binance account dashboard. The script uses a five-minute candlestick chart to determine short-term RSI conditions. Below is the full script: ==================================================================== import ccxt import pandas as pd import ta # Your Binance API keys (use your own) api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY' api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET' # Connect to Binance exchange = ccxt.binance({ 'apiKey': api_key, 'secret': api_secret, 'enableRateLimit': True, }) # Get BTC/USDT 1h candles bars = exchange.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USDT', timeframe='1h', limit=100) df = pd.DataFrame(bars, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']) # Calculate RSI df['rsi'] = ta.momentum.RSIIndicator(df['close'], window=14).rsi() # Check latest RSI value latest_rsi = df['rsi'].iloc[-1] print(f""Latest RSI: {latest_rsi}"") # If RSI if latest_rsi order = exchange.create_market_buy_order('BTC/USDT', 0.001) print(""Buy order placed:"", order) else: print(""RSI not low enough to buy."") ==================================================================== Please note that the above script is intended for illustration purposes. It does not include risk management features, error handling or safeguards against rapid trading. Beginners should test this code in a simulated environment or on Binance’s testnet before considering any use with real funds. Also, the above code uses market orders, which execute immediately at the current price and only run once. For continuous trading, you’d put it in a loop or scheduler. Images below show what the sample output would look like: The sample output shows how the trading bot reacts to market conditions using the RSI indicator. When the RSI drops below 30, as seen with “Latest RSI: 27.46,” it indicates the market may be oversold, prompting the bot to place a market buy order. The order details confirm a successful trade with 0.001 BTC purchased. If the RSI is higher, such as “41.87,” the bot prints “RSI not low enough to buy,” meaning no trade is made. This logic helps automate entry decisions, but the script has limitations like no sell condition, no continuous monitoring and no real-time risk management features, as explained previously. Step 4: Implement risk management Risk control is a critical component of any automated trading strategy . Ensure your bot includes: Stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. Position size limits to avoid overexposure. Rate-limiting or cooldown periods between trades. Capital allocation controls, such as only risking 1–2% of total capital per trade. Prompt your GPT with instructions like: “Add a stop-loss to the RSI trading bot at 5% below the entry price.” Step 5: Test in a paper trading environment Never deploy untested bots with real capital. Most exchanges offer testnets or sandbox environments where trades can be simulated safely. Alternatives include: Running simulations on historical data (backtesting). Logging “paper trades” to a file instead of executing real trades. Testing ensures that logic is sound, risk is controlled and the bot performs as expected under various conditions. Step 6: Deploy the bot for live trading (Optional) Once the bot has passed paper trading tests: Replace test API keys: First, replace your test API keys with live API keys from your chosen exchange’s account. These keys allow the bot to access your real trading account. To do this, log in to exchange, go to the API management section and create a new set of API keys. Copy the API key and secret into your script. It is crucial to handle these keys securely and avoid sharing them or including them in public code. Set up secure API permissions (disable withdrawals): Adjust the security settings for your API keys. Make sure that only the permissions you need are enabled. For example, enable only “spot and margin trading ” and disable permissions like “withdrawals” to reduce the risk of unauthorized fund transfers. Exchanges like Binance also allow you to limit API access to specific IP addresses, which adds another layer of protection. Host the bot on a cloud server: If you want the bot to trade continuously without relying on your personal computer, you’ll need to host it on a cloud server. This means running the script on a virtual machine that stays online 24/7. Services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), DigitalOcean or PythonAnywhere provide this functionality. Among these, PythonAnywhere is often the easiest to set up for beginners, as it supports running Python scripts directly in a web interface. Still, always start small and monitor the bot regularly. Mistakes or market changes can result in losses, so careful setup and ongoing supervision are essential. Did you know? Exposed API keys are a top cause of crypto theft. Always store them in environment variables — not inside your code. Ready-made bot templates (starter logic) The templates below are basic strategy ideas that beginners can easily understand. They show the core logic behind when a bot should buy, like “buy when RSI is below 30.” Even if you’re new to coding, you can take these simple ideas and ask your Custom GPT to turn them into full, working Python scripts. GPT can help you write, explain and improve the code, so you don’t need to be a developer to get started. In addition, here is a simple checklist for building and testing a crypto trading bot using the RSI strategy: Just choose your trading strategy, describe what you want, and let GPT do the heavy lifting, including backtesting, live trading or multi-coin support. RSI strategy bot (buy Low RSI) Logic : Buy BTC when RSI drops below 30 (oversold). if rsi place_buy_order() Used for: Momentum reversal strategies. Tools: ta library for RSI. 2. MACD crossover bot Logic : Buy when MACD line crosses above signal line. if macd > signal and previous_macd place_buy_order() Used for: Trend-following and swing trading. Tools : ta.trend.MACD or TA-Lib. 3. News sentiment bot Logic : Use AI (Custom GPT) to scan headlines for bullish/bearish sentiment. if “bullish” in sentiment_analysis(latest_headlines): place_buy_order() Used for: Reacting to market-moving news or tweets. Tools: News APIs + GPT sentiment classifier. Risks concerning AI-powered trading bots While trading bots can be powerful tools, they also come with serious risks : Market volatility : Sudden price swings can lead to unexpected losses. API errors or rate limits : Improper handling can cause the bot to miss trades or place incorrect orders. Bugs in code : A single logic error can result in repeated losses or account liquidation. Security vulnerabilities : Storing API keys insecurely can expose your funds. Overfitting : Bots tuned to perform well in backtests may fail in live conditions. Always start with small amounts, use strong risk management and continuously monitor bot behavior. While AI can offer powerful support, it’s crucial to respect the risks involved. A successful trading bot combines intelligent strategy, responsible execution and ongoing learning. Build slowly, test carefully and use your Custom GPT not just as a tool — but also as a mentor.",,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-13 11:41:28

Waylon Wilcox, 45, admitted to filing false income tax returns for the 2021 and 2022 tax years. The former CryptoPunk investor pleaded guilty on April 9 to two counts of filing false individual income tax returns , federal prosecutors said in an April 11 press release . Back in April 2022, Wilcox filed a false individual income tax return for the tax year 2021, which underreported his income tax by roughly $8.5 million and reduced his tax due by approximately $2.1 million. In October 2023, Wilcox filed another false individual tax income return for the fiscal year of 2022, underreporting his income tax by an estimated $4.6 million and reducing his tax due by nearly $1.1 million. Wilcox pleads guilty to false tax filing, press release. Source: Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania “The total maximum penalty under federal law for these offenses is up to six years of imprisonment, a term of supervised release following imprisonment, and a fine,” according to the statement. However, the exact details and timing of his sentence remain unclear.

Source: CryptoPunks In 2021, Wilcox sold 62 CryptoPunk NFTs for a gain of about $7.4 million but reported significantly less on his taxes. In 2022, he sold 35 more CryptoPunks for $4.9 million. The Department of Justice said Wilcox intentionally selected “no” when asked if he had engaged in digital asset transactions on both filings. “IRS Criminal Investigation is committed to unraveling complex financial schemes involving virtual currencies and NFT transactions designed to conceal taxable income,” Philadelphia Field Office Special Agent in charge Yury Kruty said, adding: “In today’s economic environment, it’s more important than ever that the American people feel confident that everyone is playing by the rules and paying the taxes they owe.” The case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Criminal Investigation Department. Related: CZ claps back against ‘baseless’ US plea deal allegations Crypto tax rules gain traction Crypto tax laws attracted interest worldwide in June 2024 after the IRS issued a new crypto regulation making US crypto transactions subject to third-party tax reporting requirements for the first time. Since January, centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) and other brokers have been required to report the sales and exchanges of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. On April 10, US President Donald Trump signed a joint congressional resolution to overturn a Biden administration-era legislation that would have required decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to also report transactions to the IRS. Set to take effect in 2027, the so-called IRS DeFi broker rule would have expanded the tax authority’s existing reporting requirements to include DeFi platforms , requiring them to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions. However, some crypto regulatory advisers believe that stablecoin and crypto banking legislation should be a priority above new tax legislation in the US. A “tailored regulatory approach” for areas including securities laws and removing “obstacles in banking” is a priority for US lawmakers with “more upside” for the industry, Mattan Erder, general counsel at layer-3 decentralized blockchain network Orbs, told Cointelegraph.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Tom Lee says that tariff negotiations between the nations cooling down would decrease the probability that the economy goes through a recession. “We know markets have gotten very pessimistic, they’ve priced in a 60% probability of a recession, and if tariff negotiations de-escalate, then the probability isn’t that high, so I think that there’s still a big window for markets to have a large rebound but it’s really the path of this de-escalation.” According to Lee, investors should pay attention to how the tariff war between the US and China plays out. He says that if the tariffs remain in place, it could be bad news for the world economy. However, if one of the nations capitulates or the situation de-escalates – a scenario he deems likely – it could lead to a turnaround for the stock market. “The US and China have absurd levels of reciprocal tariffs at the moment. And if you believe those are in place, then the global economy is in trouble and you should be bearish. But if this is a matter of who makes the overture first or blinks, but we know it de-escalates, then I think the downside comes off dramatically, and I think stocks can actually do really well into the rest of the year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The move comes after a volatile week in financial markets and is seen as the first real sign that Trump might ease trade tensions with China. According to a Customs and Border Patrol notice, the exemption covers items such as smartphones, routers, laptops, and chipmaking equipment. This decision arrives shortly after Trump imposed 125% tariffs on Chinese imports, sending shockwaves through global markets and wiping out around $700 billion from Apple’s market value in just a few days. Apple stands to benefit significantly , as most of its iPhones are still produced in China despite efforts to shift some manufacturing to India. The White House emphasized that US tech firms are now working to bring production back to the US, in line with Trump’s push for tech independence from China. Still, the broader 20% tariffs on Chinese goods tied to fentanyl production remain in place. While the exemptions mirror similar decisions made during earlier trade wars in 2018 and 2019, experts warn that Trump could reverse course again. China called the exemption a small but positive move , though it continues to monitor the broader impact.

The move is part of a cost-cutting overhaul that includes significant workforce reductions and a modernization of communication strategies. According to sources cited by WIRED , the SSA will discontinue its traditional use of mailed letters and press releases, relying solely on X for public announcements, updates, and policy changes. SSA Workforce Cut by 7,000 Amid Push for Leaner, More Efficient Operations The transition coincides with the agency’s decision to reduce its workforce from 57,000 to approximately 50,000 employees to streamline operations and improve efficiency. “SSA has operated with a regional structure consisting of 10 offices, which is no longer sustainable,” in a statement issued in February 2025, the SSA said. “The agency will reduce the regional structure in all agency components down to four regions. The organizational structure at Headquarters also is outdated and inefficient.” Elon Musk, who heads DOGE, has publicly criticized the SSA for alleged mismanagement and waste, claiming the agency has distributed billions in improper payments—an assertion later echoed by the White House. The claims have sparked national debate over the long-term sustainability of Social Security and government spending practices. DOGE, though unofficial in its status, plays a growing role in federal restructuring. In March, it launched an internal review of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), gaining access to internal systems and data. SEC officials confirmed their cooperation and pledged transparency throughout the investigation. DOGE has also recommended cutting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) workforce by 20%, potentially impacting 6,800 jobs. If approved, those cuts could be implemented as early as May 15, a month after the federal tax deadline. Looking ahead, DOGE is reportedly exploring blockchain-based solutions for public finance, including placing the entire U.S. government budget onchain to enhance transparency, reduce spending, and boost accountability. Elon Musk’s DOGE Team Gains Access to SEC Systems Meanwhile, Musk’s DOGE is reportedly being integrated into the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under a newly formed liaison initiative. As reported, the SEC has agreed to allow DOGE representatives access to its internal systems and data, effectively treating them as staff for integration and network purposes. An internal SEC email cited in the report confirmed that DOGE team members will be granted the same access rights as SEC employees when it comes to networks, systems, and sensitive data. The SEC has begun assembling a dedicated liaison team tasked with working alongside DOGE representatives. The internal communication emphasized that all processes will adhere to standard protocols, including ethics clearances, IT security reviews, and access approvals.

This is coming after sweeping workforce cuts recommended by Musk under the umbrella of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) agency. According to an anonymous source that spoke with WIRED , the government agency will no longer rely on its customary letters and press releases when relaying information to the general public. Instead, it will start using X as a means of primary communication. SSA regional commissioner Linda Kerr-Davis issued the directive to managers in a meeting this week. “We are no longer planning to issue press releases or those dear colleague letters to inform the media and public about programmatic and service changes.” She added that X will become the communication mechanism henceforth. US Social Security plans move to X to engage the public The agency had previously used dear colleague letters to engage with advocacy groups and third-party organizations to help people gain access to social security benefits. Recent letters from the agency covered everything about the SSA, from its new identity verification procedures to the updates on the accuracy of SSA death records. The letters and press releases were also an important tool for communications that the SSA employees used, using these tools to stay up to date on agency news. However, the change could have a dire effect on the ability for employees to do their jobs since SSA staff cannot sign up for social media on government computers without providing a special security request. It could also impact people receiving social security benefits who rely on the letters for information about access to these benefits. “Do they really expect senior citizens will join this platform?” asked one current employee. “Most managers aren’t even on it. How isn’t this a conflict of interest?” Another staffer added: “This will ensure that the public does not get the information they need to stay up-to-date.” SSA downsizes workforce to improve efficiency The shift is coming after the SSA cut its workforce from about 57,000 employees to roughly 50,000 to reduce costs and improve efficiency. “SSA has operated with a regional structure consisting of 10 offices, which is no longer sustainable. The agency will reduce the regional structure in all agency components down to four regions. The organizational structure at Headquarters also is outdated and inefficient,” the SSA statement said. White House spokesperson Liz Huston also responded in reaction to news of job cuts within the Social Security Administration trailing around, noting that it is misleading. “There has not been a reduction in the workforce. Rather, to improve the delivery of services, staff are being reassigned from regional offices to front-line help – allocating finite resources where they are most needed. President Trump will continue to always protect Social Security,” Huston said. Head of DOGE, Elon Musk has accused the Social Security system of distributing billions of dollars in wrongful payments, a claim that the White House has echoed. Musk’s comments have also caused debates about the activities and future of the retirement program as he continues to push for sustainable government spending. The Department of Government Efficiency, which has been tasked with identifying and cutting wasteful public spending through reduction of budget and personnel cuts, recently moved to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). DOGE gained access to its internal systems, with the agency noting that it is ready to cooperate with DOGE. While Elon Musk and DOGE have been sweeping through federal agencies and cutting budgets and jobs, there have also been attacks directed towards him, with his company, Tesla, bearing the brunt. However, that has not stopped Musk, who has proposed a 20% workforce cut at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by May 15. He has also reportedly mentioned exploring the use of blockchain to limit public spending by putting the budget on-chain for transparency. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This positive news helped Bitcoin move closer to $85,000, which triggered buying interest in popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Still, both DOGE and SHIB are having trouble breaking past key price levels, which means there could be a short-term dip before any further gains. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Face Boost in OI The recent price jump in DOGE and SHIB has led to a rise in open interest, which means more traders are entering the market. According to Coinglass, Dogecoin’s open interest went up by about 3.2%, hitting around $1.57 billion. Meanwhile, SHIB’s open interest saw a smaller increase of 0.05%, reaching over $120 million. However, the increased price swings and a growing number of short trades near key resistance levels for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu could lead to uncertainty and mixed signals on their price charts. Dogecoin Price Analysis Dogecoin is having trouble breaking clearly above the $0.17 resistance level. Right now, buyers are mostly in control and pushing the price higher, but there are signs that sellers could step in soon and push DOGE below the 23.6% Fibonacci level. At the moment, Dogecoin is trading at $0.165, up over 2% in the past 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting at 58, which suggests there’s still strong buying momentum. If buyers continue to push, DOGE could climb toward the $0.2 resistance level. Breaking past that might boost market confidence and even lead to a rally toward $0.25. On the flip side, if DOGE can’t hold above the rising support line, it could start to drop, potentially falling to around $0.13. If it breaks below that, it could trigger more selling and strengthen the bearish trend. Shiba Inu Price Analysis Right now, Shiba Inu is struggling to break past the immediate resistance at $0.000013. Because of this, sellers are keeping the price stuck in a tight range, preventing any big upward moves. At the moment, SHIB is trading at $0.0000122, up just over 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Even with some bearish pressure, buyers are still trying to push the price higher, showing there’s solid interest from the bulls. However, sellers are strongly defending against any breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 56, slightly above the midpoint, which suggests buyers might gain the upper hand soon. If buyers manage to break above the $0.000013 resistance, SHIB could head toward the next target at $0.0000157. On the other hand, if selling pressure increases and the price drops below the 20-day EMA support, SHIB could fall further, possibly down to around $0.0000102.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-13 11:58:09

With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , this rising star is quickly becoming a top altcoin to watch , earning mentions from major crypto publishers and catching fire across Telegram, X (Twitter), and Reddit. XRP STAYS STRONG — BUT UPSIDE IS CAPPED XRP is no stranger to investor watchlists. It continues to trend as one of the most searched and traded tokens globally, especially with positive momentum building around the SEC case. However, seasoned traders know: the days of 25x gains for XRP are largely behind us. For XRP to even triple from here would require a substantial influx of institutional capital and a bullish legal resolution — both far from guaranteed in the short term. MAGACOIN FINANCE: APRIL’S MOST TALKED-ABOUT NEW ALTC0IN While XRP commands legacy respect, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the attention of traders searching for early-stage opportunities with significantly higher upside. This top altcoin to watch is: Now featured by major crypto publishers Trending in crypto news outlets Gaining traction on Telegram, X, and YouTube Generating serious buzz with a CMC listing around the corner With a listing target of $0.007 and current entry levels at just $0.0002908 , the project still offers a staggering 25x ROI potential — or 2,300% gains — for those securing a spot before the token hits exchanges. ANALYST PREDICTIONS: “THE NEXT 100X ALTC0IN? While some experts remain cautiously bullish on XRP, others are shifting attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Why? Because it checks every box for a breakout altcoin : Structured multi-stage presale model Strong community growth from organic hype Viral traction before launch Strategic pricing — and still under a $1M market cap pre-launch These fundamentals have led several analysts to tag it as a 30x–35x opportunity in the months ahead, especially as Q2 2025 heats up. FINAL THOUGHTS: THE MARKET LOVES A NEW STAR ⚠️ FINAL HOURS: CLAIM 50% EXTRA BONUS — CODE MAGA50X XRP remains a powerhouse — but its explosive days may be behind it. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is just beginning to show its firepower. With Stage 7 now LIVE , visibility rising daily, and a path from $0.0002908 to $0.007 , this fast-growing altcoin project is delivering the kind of buzz we haven’t seen since early PEPE or FLOKI.

Despite some retracement in the last few hours, the growing bullish momentum in the ETH market shows signals of a sustainable price rally. Notably, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted the potential next price target for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Rebound: Breakout To $1,800 With These Two Supply Zones ETH Bulls Set Sights On $1,810 Resistance In an X post on April 12, Martinez shares an Ethereum price prediction using on-chain data from analytics company IntoTheBlock. Martinez’s post shows that Ethereum has now reclaimed a critical support level at a demand zone between $1,547 and $1,595. This zone represents a significant accumulation area, with approximately 5.48 million ETH held by 2.83 million addresses at an average purchase price of $1,574. The resurgence in buying activity around this price region indicates a considerable trading volume which is critical to sustaining the current bullish momentum. At press time, Ethereum trades at $1,642 showing signs of resilience following its recent breakout. If the price rally persists, Martinez explains the altcoin is headed for a strong resistance zone between $1,791.11 and $1,838.86. This area contains 1.61 million ETH held by 3.2 million addresses at an average price of $1,810. Notably, this zone is visualized in red indicating that many of these investors are “out of the money” and are likely to sell once prices recover— offering a potentially significant resistance to Ethereum’s ongoing rebound. If ETH bulls can surge past this resistance level, it could confirm a trend reversal for the altcoin following a consistent decline since the altcoin hit the $4,000 price zone in December 2024. Related Reading: NEAR Poised For Surge To $2.40 As Bullish Pattern Forms Ethereum Market Overview Generally, IntoTheBlock’s data shows 56.7% of ETH addresses are currently “in the money,” representing 8.3 million ETH worth about $13.24 billion. In contrast, 41.99% (6.14 million ETH) of holders are “out of the money,” suggesting the market sentiment still largely remains cautious. Meanwhile, only 191,830 ETH (1.31% of total volume) is considered “at the money,” signaling minimal congestion around the current price level, which may favor a swift move in either direction. At the time of writing, Ethereum continues to trade at $1,642 as earlier stated, with a price decline of 8.50% in the last week. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 13.08% indicating a waning market interest which could be potentially harmful to the ongoing price rally.

It’s on the verge of breaking up following a reversal formation. Last month marked a temporal halt in Ray’s short-term bearish move after a month breakdown from the crucial support level. Luckily, the $1.45 level produced support and the price increased for two weeks. It faced multiple rejections at $2.1 last week, and the price rolled over. This led to a bearish weekly start, but the crypto later established support after managing to stay above the previous monthly low on Monday. The price increased steadily to where it is trading at $2 at the time of writing. A successful surge above last week’s high should validate the double-bottom pattern forming in the past month. This bullish reversal pattern should set the market up for a huge rally while recovering lost levels. The main level to watch for such a rally lies at the crucial $4 resistance broken as support during late February’s crackdown. A rejection should be expected as soon as the price tests this crucial resistance level. Failure to reject it could trigger more recoveries to the main top. This should bring a complete trend reversal when the market breaks higher. RAY’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Overcoming the $2.1 resistance level, which has been a major barrier for the bulls over the past month, the $2.5 and $3.1 levels are the next key resistance to watch on the way up. For now, the $1.8 level is considered a support in case of a pullback. The main support is located at $1.455. A drop off this level could plunge the price to $1.23 and potentially $1. Key Resistance Levels: $2.1, $2.5, $3.1 Key Support Levels: $1.45, $1.23, $1 Spot Price: $2 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Proponents of Biden’s regulation saw it as necessary for tax compliance, while critics argued that it “hindered American innovation” and burdened the IRS. Tariff mess is great news for Bitcoin: Binance CEO Binance CEO Richard Teng argued that “trade protectionism” could actually “accelerate interest in crypto as a non-sovereign store of value.” On the heels of Trump’s on-again-off-again tariffs, stocks crashed and remain volatile while crypto took a hit. Bitcoin ( BTC ), at last check Sunday, is trading at about $84,300.

Reports had suggested a wallet tagged by blockchain data firm Arkham as potentially belonging to the project had liquidated ETH.

Recent trends and developments suggest that specific coins could be poised for growth. This article delves into the key factors that may drive significant price trends for these cryptos, making them ones to watch closely. XRP: Strong Six-Month Growth Amid Short-Term Dips XRP experienced an 8.09% decline over the past month, alongside a one-week drop of 3.31%. In contrast, the coin showed impressive growth of 270.33% over the previous six months. This price behavior highlights temporary resistance to upward movement while indicating significant long-term interest from investors. Recent weeks reflect some pressure; however, the overall trend remains positive. XRP is currently trading within a range of $1.66 to $2.77, with key support identified at $1.23 and resistance at $3.45. Short-term indicators suggest a slight bearish sentiment, as momentum and oscillator readings show weakness. The lack of a clear trend presents a potential buying opportunity near support, while selling or exiting positions should be considered if the price exceeds the resistance level. SOL Reflects Recent Volatility with Signs of Recovery Solana performance over the past month shows a steady decline of 6.80%, while the six-month change stands at -20.18%. The price behavior has been marked by consistent downward pressure and volatility. Sellers have maintained control over the coin, leading to a significant drop in value over this period. Current pricing hovers between $97.94 and $165.67, with key support at $71.30 and resistance near $206.76. The bears currently dominate, as indicated by a negative Awesome Oscillator at -15.32 and a slightly downbeat Momentum Indicator at -9.77. Traders might consider long opportunities if the price approaches support, while being mindful of resistance levels for potential exit points. Ondo Consolidates Gains Amid Anticipation of Altcoin Surge Ondo price action over the last month saw a modest increase of around 0.81%, while the six-month trend showed a robust climb of nearly 17.34%. The coin experienced short-term gains with a 2.56% rise over the past week, reflecting steady growth in a bullish environment. Recent movements suggest an underlying buildup in long-term value with gradual yet persistent upward momentum. The coin currently trades between $0.60 and $1.10, facing first resistance near $1.42 and a secondary hurdle at $1.92, with firm support at $0.41. Indicators like an RSI of 49.72 and near-neutral momentum readings point to a balanced market with no strong trend.

Other altcoins like Tezos, EOS, Movement, Toncoin, and Ethereum crashed by double digits. Bitcoin ( BTC ) remained in a consolidation phase during the week, even as the US dollar index plunged and U.S. equities wavered. This article explores why Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Solana ( SOL ), and Arbitrum ( ARB ) are the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week. Solana SOL price chart | Source: crypto.news Solana, the giant layer-1 network will be in the spotlight this week because of its rising transactions. Nansen data shows that its transactions rose by 6.6% in the last seven days to 355 million, while its fees rose to over $6.15 million. Also, Solana has flipped Ethereum ( ETH ) in terms of decentralized exchange transactions, as it handled over $15 billion in the last seven days. Additionally, some popular meme coins in the network like Popcat ( POPCAT ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Fartcoin have soared. Therefore, this performance may help to boost the Solana price this week. The chart above shows that SOL price has rebounded to $129 after bottoming at $94.65 earlier this month. More upside will see the token rise to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement point at $170. Fartcoin Fartcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Fartcoin is another top cryptocurrency to watch this week because of its recent performance as it jumped by over 364% from its lowest point this year. It has jumped to the highest point since February 1. This peformance happened as whales accumulated it, leading to fear of missing out among investors. Technically, it has formed a cup and handle pattern, pointing to more upside in the next few days. If this happens, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance at $1.5.

Data shows that the volume handled by its DEX protocols jumped by over 40% in the last seven days to $4.6 billion. Arbitrum will be in the spotlight for two main reasons. First, its network is likely to cross the $500 billion milestone in terms of DEX transactions . Its protocols, like Uniswap, Fluid, PancakeSwap, and Camelot, have handled over $495 billion. Second, the ARB price will be in the spotlight as the network unlocks tokens worth over $28 million, representing 2% of its float. The network’s regular unlocks explain why the token has crashed by 87% from its all-time high. On the positive side, the Arbitrum price has formed a falling wedge pattern. Also, as shown above, the Awesome Oscillator has formed a bullish divergence pattern, pointing to an eventual rebound.

Buterin said this while responding to discussions about the need to reembrace cypherpunk values on the network. According to Buterin , the call for good social philosophy on Ethereum layer-1 might not be necessary because the network is mostly general purpose. Instead, he believes that good social philosophy should happen more on the application layer, and builders should develop apps that align with cypherpunk ethos. In his view, it does not matter much how many social goods are integrated into the operating codes for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) because the base layer mostly serves a general purpose. However, the applications are 80% special purpose and ought to reflect good social philosophy. He said: “Apps are ~80% special purpose. What apps you build depends heavily on what ideas you have of what ethereum apps (and ethereum as a whole) are there to do for the world. And so having good ideas on this topic out there becomes crucially important.” Buterin cites positive and negative examples of apps Buterin went on to list examples of what he considers to be good and bad social philosophy. He considers Railgun, Farcaster, Signal, and Polymarket as good, while FTX, Terra/Luna, and Pump.fun are bad. For him, what matters is what the developers of these apps seek to accomplish, and builders can always encode such values into their apps by default if they believe in the idea. Meanwhile, the Ethereum co-founder compared the EVM to the C++ programming language, noting that the values of those who created the language have minimal impact on its usefulness because it is mostly general purpose. Buterin wrote: “Imagine that C++ had been made by a totalitarian racist fascist. Would it be a worse language? Probably not. C++ is general purpose, there isn’t much surface for bad social philosophy to wreck it (or good social philosophy to improve it).” However, he acknowledged that Ethereum is not in the same position and added that the network already has several cypherpunk values encoded, such as decentralization, light clients, transition to Proof of Stake, etc. Ethereum holders and stakeholders appear divided on priority Discussions over cypherpunk values on Ethereum are a result of a post by the Ethereum official account on the topic. The post focused on how the Ethereum network represents this ethos and highlighted apps on the network that reflect them. However, reactions to the post have been negative, with many users currently frustrated by the network performance. One user, Owocki , on X, noted that Ethereum should be focused on scaling L1 to better support the application layer instead, and the network can have more people embrace cypherpunk if it creates a winning product. This opinion appears to align with that of many ETH holders. According to Santiment , analysis of social media sentiments shows many users are skeptical about Ethereum’s ability to stage a comeback and how it has significantly underperformed BTC. Despite the recent gains in the crypto market, ETH remains one of the worst performers with the token trading at $1,600 and down 52% year-to-date. Almost all the other major altcoins have seen a better performance in the last 24 hours. Over 3 million addresses bought ETH at an average price of $1.810 (Source: Ali_Charts) However, there might be some hope for ETH. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez said that the token has already reclaimed a key support level at $1,574 and could rise up to $1,810 before seeing its next major resistance.

Source: Coinstats According to Coinmarketcap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $7 in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-13 12:40:00

In this environment, early-stage tokens with real utility and well-structured tokenomics are beginning to take center stage. One of the names drawing increasing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a DeFi protocol still in presale, priced at $0.025, and steadily positioning itself as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Mutuum Finance is not another copy-paste DeFi project. It’s been built to solve key inefficiencies in how crypto lending and borrowing currently work—by offering users flexibility, autonomy, and clearer incentives across two distinct models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. Combined with a fair presale structure and a growing base of long-term holders, the project is beginning to stand out for all the right reasons. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The current presale price of $0.025 isn’t just attractive—it’s time-sensitive. With over 8,100 holders already on board and more than $6.5 million raised, the demand speaks for itself. Once this phase closes, the price will increase to $0.03, before launching publicly at $0.06. That’s more than double the entry point for those joining now. What makes this especially appealing is that Mutuum isn’t just promising future utility—it’s already laid out a clear roadmap, including the launch of a beta platform post-presale and upcoming exchange listings. The protocol’s growth is being driven by practical features, not marketing alone. Dual Lending Models: P2C and P2P What truly sets Mutuum apart is its hybrid approach to DeFi lending. In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, users deposit assets into a shared liquidity pool. Borrowers can access these funds by providing overcollateralized assets, and interest rates adjust automatically based on pool utilization. Lenders earn passive income through this system, and all transactions are handled transparently by smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model, on the other hand, introduces a more flexible option. Instead of relying on a shared pool, users can directly negotiate lending terms with others. This opens up opportunities for assets that don’t qualify under traditional models—like meme coins or highly volatile tokens. For example, borrowers holding Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Pepe (PEPE) can use these tokens as collateral in custom P2P agreements, allowing them to access liquidity without having to convert or sell. This dual system gives users a choice: the stability of pooled lending through P2C or the customization and asset flexibility of P2P. Few protocols offer both in a single ecosystem, which is part of why Mutuum is gaining traction. Unlike protocols that rely on token inflation or high-risk staking loops, Mutuum is designed to generate real yield through actual usage. When users deposit assets, they receive mtTokens, which represent their deposit and increase in redeemable value as interest accrues. These mtTokens can be held, transferred, or used in other DeFi applications—making them both functional and yield-generating. In addition, a portion of the platform’s revenue is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to mtToken holders. This ongoing cycle ties user activity directly to long-term incentives, creating a sustainable model for growth. Mutuum’s momentum hasn’t come from viral tweets or celebrity endorsements. It’s come from consistent progress, community growth, and a clearly structured presale that makes sense for early participants. The team has announced an upcoming CertiK audit, reinforcing its commitment to security. With more than 8,100 users already invested, the protocol is gaining serious attention without needing to rely on noise. In short, it’s the kind of project that tends to perform well once the wider market catches on—offering practical features, real use cases, and an economic model that benefits long-term holders. For anyone wondering what crypto to invest in right now, Mutuum Finance deserves a closer look. It’s still early, it’s priced affordably, and it’s delivering on features that users actually want—especially in a DeFi space that’s become increasingly cautious of overpromised returns. With a working P2C model, flexible P2P lending, and passive income mechanisms already in place, MUTM isn’t just another presale token. It’s shaping up to be one of the most well-rounded DeFi entries of the year—and at $0.025, the window to get in early is still open, but it won’t stay that way for long.

The market is hungry for alternatives that deliver real utility, and Qubetics is serving it up with style. Qubetics is in its 29th crypto presale stage, with $0.1573 per $TICS token. Over 507 million tokens are already spoken for, and the tally has smashed through $16 million. That’s more than just traction—it’s momentum with muscle. With over 24,600 token holders, community confidence is sky-high. Buyers aren’t just looking at what Qubetics is right now, but what it could become. Analysts have tossed around $TICS price projections like $1, $6, even $15. That’s a potential ROI of 536% to a jaw-dropping 9,435%. Try finding those numbers in Wall Street’s playbook. One of Qubetics’ most impressive features is its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. This isn’t just about convenience—it’s about full control. Imagine a small business in São Paulo using the wallet to pay vendors across different chains without juggling apps or exchanges. Or a freelancer in Caracas being able to hold assets in Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon—without relying on a centralized exchange that might freeze their funds. For digital nomads and remote teams in South America, this kind of flexibility isn’t a luxury—it’s survival. $500 Now Is $47,730 Later — If You Act Before the Next Stage Hits A $500 contribution today nets roughly 3,182 tokens. At $1, that’s $3,182. If the project hits $5, the return grows to $15,910. But if $TICS moves toward the $15 mark, this single presale entry becomes $47,730. And remember: the next stage increases token cost by up to 10%, slashing future ROI. With listings around the corner and over half a billion tokens already sold, this stage won’t wait for hesitation. Tezos: The Quiet Titan of On-Chain Governance Tezos has carved out a niche among protocol purists and corporate players who value on-chain governance and self-amendment. It’s been around since 2018 and weathered every market cycle since. Among the top cryptos to invest in today, Tezos holds a unique reputation for stability and upgradability. What makes Tezos click with long-term backers is its low-energy proof-of-stake system and active developer community. Over the years, it’s been the go-to chain for projects needing tight security and seamless upgrades. From Ubisoft’s blockchain gaming experiments to tokenized art on objkt.com, Tezos has found real-world traction without selling out. In South America, Tezos has supported digital ID pilots and education-focused blockchain projects—a quiet but firm push toward adoption. While it doesn’t scream hype, it whispers assurance. And that, for many, is enough. Bitcoin Cash: Practical Crypto Power for Real-World Payments Bitcoin Cash came into the scene in 2017 as Bitcoin’s rebellious younger sibling. While BTC went full store-of-value, BCH stayed loyal to the “peer-to-peer electronic cash” mantra. For people tired of high BTC fees and sluggish confirmation times, BCH was a breath of fresh air. Fast forward to now, and it’s still seen as a practical payment crypto, especially in regions where banking is a headache. BCH still has traction among small merchants and locals who don’t trust fiat volatility. It’s cheap, fast, and widely supported across crypto wallets. While it might not top charts in terms of media hype, Bitcoin Cash remains one of the top cryptos to invest in today for buyers looking for transactional utility. It holds value where the rubber meets the road: everyday usage. Conclusion: Which Crypto Holds the Crown in 2025? When it comes to picking the top cryptos to invest in today , it’s all about use case, adoption, and upside. Tezos is a reliable player with a strong foundation and ongoing upgrades. Bitcoin Cash holds down the fort as a real-world payment tool. But Qubetics? It’s the future-focused project with speed, scalability, and serious community momentum. Its presale numbers don’t lie, and neither do the ROIs floating around crypto forums. Whether you’re a solopreneur in Medellín, a startup founder in Santiago, or just someone tired of low bank yields, Qubetics offers something new, sharp, and tailored for real life. Grab the bag before the price hikes again. The presale is deep into Stage 29, and the clock’s ticking.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of them. And although it’s still in presale at just $0.025, it has already crossed an important milestone: over 8,100 holders have joined early, positioning themselves ahead of what many believe could be a shift in how passive income is earned in DeFi. Mutuum isn’t pitching wild APYs or complicated staking strategies. It’s offering a new model for generating consistent, user-friendly yield through crypto lending—one that’s built around usability, transparency, and long-term value. A Simpler Way to Earn Mutuum’s model is grounded in a simple idea: users should be able to earn from their crypto without giving up control or navigating a maze of token lockups. When you deposit assets into Mutuum’s protocol, you receive mtTokens, which reflect your deposit and accumulate interest automatically. These tokens grow in value as borrowers pay interest into the pool, and they can be redeemed anytime, assuming available liquidity. There’s no staking dashboard, no multiple-token systems, and no countdown timers. Earnings come in steadily, tied directly to how the platform is used. Here’s a real-world example: imagine a user deposits $5,000 worth of ETH into Mutuum. In return, they receive mtETH. As other users borrow ETH from the pool and pay interest, the user’s mtETH balance increases in redeemable value. Over the course of a few months, that deposit might generate $300 to $400 in passive income, depending on pool activity. It’s the kind of system that mimics traditional interest-bearing accounts—only fully decentralized and permissionless. Lending for Yield, Borrowing for Flexibility Mutuum doesn’t just serve passive income seekers—it also appeals to those looking to borrow without selling their crypto. Say a trader holds $10,000 in stablecoins and sees a short-term opportunity in ETH. Rather than selling off long-term holdings, they lock their stablecoins as collateral, borrow ETH from the platform, and make the trade. If it works out, they repay the loan and reclaim their original funds. If not, their position remains overcollateralized, protecting the lender while giving the borrower time to recover. This kind of flexibility is part of what makes Mutuum attractive to both casual users and active market participants. It’s not just about yield—it’s about control. What really sets MUTM apart is how the protocol shares its success with users. A portion of platform revenue is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken holders. This approach creates ongoing demand for the token and incentivizes long-term participation without relying on high emissions or inflation. It also ensures that the community benefits directly from platform usage. As more users borrow, lend, and engage with the protocol, rewards scale accordingly—making passive income more sustainable and aligned with actual activity. Security is a key pillar of the project. Mutuum Finance is preparing for a smart contract audit by CertiK, a trusted name in blockchain security. This move ensures that all underlying contracts are reviewed and hardened before the token goes live, helping build trust with both early backers and institutional watchers. In addition, a beta version of the platform is expected to launch shortly after the public listing, giving users a real opportunity to test the protocol firsthand. With major exchange listings anticipated to follow, the next few months are likely to be an important growth phase for MUTM. Mutuum Finance isn’t aiming to be the loudest project in the room—it’s focused on being the most functional. With more than 8,100 holders, a working model for crypto income, and a clear plan for rollout, it’s redefining how DeFi can serve everyday users. The passive income it offers is real, trackable, and tied to the fundamentals of lending and borrowing—without the need for trust in third parties. For those looking beyond hype, and toward sustainable earning opportunities in 2025 and beyond, MUTM might not just be another DeFi token—it could be one of the smarter plays for long-term passive income in crypto.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from “Bitcoin tourists”—newcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $84,420 Market cap $1,538,914,422,643 Trading volume $55,318,495,561 Circulating supply 19,849,062 All-time high $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $86,115 24-hour low $84,216 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $84,420 Price Prediction $ 116,112 (38.22%) Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 2.97% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 89,357 200-Day SMA $ 84,704 14-Day RSI 45.26 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that BTC price is facing strong bearish trend below $86K Resistance for BTC is at $89,115 Support for BTC/USD is at $78,937 The BTC price analysis for 13 April confirms that BTC faces a surge in buying demand as it triggers a recovery rally toward $86K. However, it soon faced strong selling pressure and dropped below $85K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price faces increased volatility below $86K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faced a buying demand toward the high of $86K. However, it failed to meet buyers’ demand near higher levels and triggered a decline later toward $84K. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.19 billion, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $84,420, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around the buying region at 51, hinting that bullish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. However, bulls maintain buying confidence as the BTC price corrects upwards. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.53, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $89,115, it will fuel a bullish rally to $92,691. BTC Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $78,937, beginning a bearish trend to $74,518. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bears gained control after Bitcoin failed to move above $86K. This triggered a bearish decline toward $84K. Will Bitcoin Price Recover? If buyers successfully defend the $78K bearish level, they might aim for another surge toward $85K. We might see a strong recovery if Bitcoin maintains that level. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price currently aims to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are set to expand the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business portfolio by investing in Bitcoin mining-focused Hut 8. Hut 8, based in Miami, announced the launch of its majority-owned subsidiary, American Bitcoin, dedicated to Bitcoin mining and strategic reserve development. Bitcoin price prediction April 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance is notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. Will the BTC price recover in April 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction April 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April.

Jasmy Coin ( JASMY ), popularly known as Japan’s Bitcoin, has rebounded after bottoming at $0.0082 earlier this month. It rose to a high of $0.017, up by 103% from its lowest level this month. The rebound happened as the crypto market stabilized, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading above $84,000. Other top tokens like Solana ( SOL ) and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) have also bounced back in the past few days. On-chain data shows that the number of JASMY active addresses has jumped in the past few days. According to Santiment , these active addresses rose to 1,307 on Sunday, the highest level since Feb. 1. It has jumped sharply after bottoming at 382 earlier this month. Further data shows that the Mean Dollar Invested Age or MDIA figure has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months. The two-year MDIA figure rose to 241, up from 180 on Jan. 1, a sign that long-term investors are still not selling their tokens.

Futures open interest | Source: CoinGlass Jasmy price technical analysis JasmyCoin chart | Source: crypto.news The ongoing JASMY surge happened after the coin formed a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. This pattern is made up of two descending and converging trendlines. A bullish breakout happens when the two trendlines near their convergence, which happened recently. The coin has moved above the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.015. It has also jumped above the key resistance level at $0.016, the lowest swing on Nov. 3. The coin also rose above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.031, up by 90% from the current level. A drop below the lower side of the wedge at $0.0082 will invalidate the bullish outlook. JASMY is the native token of JasmyCoin, a Japan-based blockchain project focusing on data privacy and the Internet of Things. The project was founded by former Sony executives and engineers.

The flagship cryptocurrency went past $85,000 early on but lost momentum after reaching a high of $85,778 and registered a marginal decline to its current level. BTC is up over 1.31% over the past 24 hours after enduring a rollercoaster week that saw the price plunge below $80,000 to a low of $74,393. Trump Exempts Tech Items From Reciprocal Tariffs In a relief for the markets, President Donald Trump has exempted computers, smartphones, and other tech items from reciprocal tariffs, cushioning the industry and consumers and benefiting industry giants like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. The move also dials down the escalating trade war with China. The exclusions were published by the US Customs and Border Protection office, excluding hard drives, laptops, computer processors, memory chips, smartphones, and other tech products from reciprocal tariffs rolled out a week ago. The exemption narrows the scope of the levies by excluding several products from the 125% China tariff and the baseline 10% global tariff imposed on almost all trading partners, benefiting companies like Apple, Dell, and Nvidia. Prominent Scottish Boarding School To Accept Bitcoin Lomond School, a prominent Scottish boarding school, has announced it will begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC) for tuition payments up to $49,711 (£38,000) annually. The school will begin accepting payments starting autumn and claims to be the first private school in the United Kingdom to do so. Once a payment is completed, the school plans to convert the BTC into British Pounds to manage currency risk. According to school authorities, the decision was made due to parent requests and aligns with the school's ethos of independent thinking and innovation. The school also emphasized the security and legality of the transactions, adding that it will only accept BTC and no other currencies. It also acknowledged Bitcoin’s extreme volatility. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a marginal decline during the current session, as it struggles to claim $85,000. The flagship cryptocurrency had moved past this level on Saturday but lost momentum after reaching a high of $86,030 thanks to selling pressure around the 50-day SMA. BTC has shown significant resilience in recovering and reclaiming $80,000 after plunging to a low of $74,393 earlier in the week. Bulls did not cede much ground despite selling pressure with BTC resuming an upward trajectory after Wednesday’s substantial increase. The recovery comes after Data from CryptoQuant suggested that Bitcoin whales and large institutional holders are loading up on the asset again. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, wallets associated with long-term investors received 48,575 BTC , the largest inflow since February 2022. “Massive $3.6 Billion Bitcoin Inflow to Accumulation Addresses! Bitcoin accumulation addresses received 48,575 BTC — the largest single-day inflow since February 1, 2022. When accumulation addresses move this aggressively, it’s worth paying attention.” While BTC rebounded over the weekend, one analyst believes it is enjoying a temporary relief, identifying a pattern that could influence its price trajectory over the next few weeks. Analyst Ali Martinez believes BTC’s recent resurgence could be a precursor to another price correction towards $74,000. Martinez has based the prediction on a “double top” pattern on BTC’s hourly chart. The double-top pattern is a rare phenomenon and indicates investors are looking to book profits during an extended bearish phase, indicating trader exhaustion and a bearish reversal. BTC started the previous weekend in the red, registering a marginal decline on Saturday. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as markets crashed. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped over 6%, going below $80,000 and settling at $78,301. The price faced volatility on Monday thanks to uncertainty fueled by rumors of a tariff pause, with BTC falling to a low of $74,393 before surging to a high of $86,190. The flagship cryptocurrency ultimately settled at $79,164, registering an increase of 1.10%. Sellers returned to the market on Tuesday as BTC fell almost 4% and settled at $76,283. Source: TradingView BTC rallied on Wednesday as President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, surging over 8% to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,593. However, the rally lost momentum on Thursday, with the price dropping 3.63%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $79,592. Bullish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC reclaimed $80,000 and settled at $83,370 after an increase of almost 5%. Buyers retained control on Saturday as BTC climbed above the 20 and 50-day SMAs, moving past $85,000 and settling at $85,378. The current session sees BTC marginally down, slipping below $85,000 and trading at $84,861. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In October 2023, Wilcox filed another false individual tax income return for the fiscal year of 2022, underreporting his income tax by an estimated $4.6 million and reducing his tax due by nearly $1.1 million.

According to reports, cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a sophisticated malware campaign that is targeting crypto users through compromised npm packages. According to the report, the attack specifically targets users of the Atomic and Exodus wallets, with the attacker hijacking transactions by injecting malicious codes that redirect funds to the attacker’s wallet. The latest campaign is in line with the ongoing chain of attacks against crypto users through software supply chain attacks. The origin of the attack is usually from the developers, with most of them unknowingly installing the compromised npm packages in their projects. One such package identified in this campaign is “pdf-to-office,” which appears normally and looks legitimate but contains hidden malicious codes. After it is installed, the package scans the user’s device for installed crypto wallets and injects the malicious code that is capable of intercepting and redirecting transactions without the user’s knowledge. Cybersecurity researchers flag malicious codes targeting crypto wallets The impact of this attack is very dire for victims, with the malicious codes capable of silently redirecting crypto transactions to the wallets controlled by the attacker. These attacks work across several digital assets, including Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Tron-based USDT. The malware effectively carries out this attack, switching the wallet addresses from the legitimate one to the attacker-controlled address at the moment that a user wants to send funds. The malicious campaign was discovered by ReversingLabs researchers through their analysis of suspicious npm packages. The researchers mentioned that there are so many tell signs of malicious behaviors including the suspicious URL connections and code patterns similar to previously discovered malicious packages. They mentioned that there have been a number of campaigns that have attempted to use the malicious code this week. They believe that the attackers are using this technique to maintain persistence and evade detection. “Most recently, a campaign launched on April 1 published a package, pdf-to-office, to the npm package manager that posed as a library for converting PDF format files to Microsoft Office documents. When executed, the package injected malicious code into legitimate, locally-installed crypto wallet software Atomic Wallet and Exodus, overwriting existing, non-malicious files in the process,” ReversingLabs said. Infection mechanism and code injection According to technical examination, the attack is multi-stage and begins when a user installs the package. The rest happens when they proceed through wallet identification, file extraction, malicious code injection, and ultimately transaction hijacking. The attackers also use obfuscation techniques to hide their intentions, making it hard for traditional tools to pick it up, making it too late by the time the user discovers. After installation, the infection begins when the malicious package executes its payload targeting installed wallet software. The code identifies the location of the wallet’s application files before targeting the ASAR package format used by Electron-based applications. The code specifically searches for files in paths such as “AppData/Local/Programs/atomic/resources/app.asar”. Once it locates it, the malware extracts the application archive, injects its malicious code, and then rebuilds the archive. The injections specifically target JavaScript files that are inside the wallet software, especially vendor files like “vendors.64b69c3b00e2a7914733.js”. The malware then modifies the transaction handling code to replace the real wallet addresses with the ones belonging to the attacker using the base64 encoding. For example, when a user tries to send Ethereum, the code replaces the recipient address with a decoded version of the address. After the infection is completed, the malware communicates using a command-and-control server, sending installation status information including the user’s home directory path. This allows the attacker to track successful infections and potentially gather information about the compromised systems. According to ReversingLabs, the malicious path has also shown evidence of persistence, with the Web3 wallet on systems still infected even when the package has been removed.

Pi coin ( PI ) token jumped to a high of $0.7375 this weekend as investors bought the dip. It has soared to its highest level since March 31, with its daily volume rising by over 80% to over $700 million. The token rose as the crypto industry held steady amid the ongoing trade jitters. Top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ) have bounced back this week. BTC rose to $84,000, while Solana jumped to $130. Traders believe that the Federal Reserve will intervene as the economy absorbs Donald Trump’s tariffs. In a statement to the Financial Times , Boston Fed President Susan Collins confirmed that the bank was prepared to intervene to support the economy. Pi Network price has also jumped as investors bought the dip after it crashed by over 86% from its highest point in February. Some of these participants viewed the crash as a bargain.

The most likely one will be Binance, whose community members approved its listing in February. Other potential exchanges that may list it are Coinbase, Kraken, and Upbit. The main reason is that these exchanges will want to take some of the trading fees currently going to exchanges like OKX and MEXC. The other potential catalyst for the Pi coin price rebound is the launch of burning. Burning will help offset the impact of the ongoing token unlocks and mining rewards. Pi Network price analysis PI price chart | Source: crypto.news The 4H chart shows that the PI coin price has bounced back in the past few weeks, reaching the key resistance level of $0.7385. This rebound happened after the token formed a falling wedge pattern between February and earlier this month. Pi Network has now moved above the 50-period moving average, a bullish sign. Also, top oscillators like the Relative Strength Index and the Awesome Oscillator have all pointed upward, indicating that it has gained momentum. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance at $1.7365, the highest swing on March 13. A move to that level signals a 135% increase. However, there is also a risk that the ongoing rebound is part of a bull trap since it has formed a small rising wedge pattern. If this happens, then there is a risk that it will drop and retest the support at $0.40.

A crypto analyst highlighted this zone as one where Bitcoin’s trajectory could either extend to new highs or face its next rejection. Related Reading: From Joke To Juggernaut: Dogecoin Value Revolution Gets Nod From Global Asset Giant Descending Broadening Wedge Breakout Clears Path To $100,000 Again Bitcoin’s price action in the past 24 hours is highlighted by a return to $85,000 as buying pressure started to creep in. Interestingly, this buying pressure has broken out above the upper trendline of a descending broadening wedge formation. This pattern is typically considered a reversal signal, and its breakout implies strong upward continuation if validated. The breakout of the formation was noted in an analysis posted on social media platform X by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto. Notably, the price chart shared by the analyst shows that the wedge formation has been taking place in the daily candlestick timeframe over the past three months. The wedge began forming after Bitcoin’s peak above $108,000 in late January and gradually widened. At the time of the analysis, Bitcoin’s price had already made two daily candlestick closes above the upper trendline of the broadening wedge. According to the analyst, the breakout will most likely be confirmed this week. If confirmed, this will open up the stage for a run above the $100,000 price level again or at least $96,200. Particularly, Titan of Crypto highlighted the region between $96,200 and $102,100 as the next target zone. The analyst emphasized that this range may act as the actual test of Bitcoin’s strength, as it will reveal whether the breakout leads to continuation or stalls into rejection. Image From X: Titan of Crypto Leverage Build-Up Points To $8 Billion Short Squeeze Potential Above $90,000 Crypto analyst Sensei also commented on Bitcoin’s current price structure, noting that a move to $90,000 could trigger a massive liquidation event. Based on data from Coinglass, more than $8 billion in short positions would be vulnerable if Bitcoin rose above $90,000 again. The cumulative short liquidation chart from Coinglass shows a large wall of leveraged short interest concentrated below that level across major exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit. Image From X: Sensei Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Takes Aim: Ethereum’s True Value? Lower Than You Think The data reflects a significant imbalance in the derivatives market, with short positions dominating until the $90,000 mark, beyond which liquidation-driven buying could intensify. If Bitcoin does push into this zone, the resulting cascade of liquidations among short positions may provide the momentum required to push the Bitcoin price toward the $96,200 to $102,100 target zone. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,706.

During recent statements, Lummis claimed that if the U.S. holds Bitcoin for 20 years, it could potentially reduce the national debt by half, based on current modeling. She is advocating for the reintroduction of the Bitcoin Act, which aims for the U.S. to acquire 1 million Bitcoin over the next five years, involving annual purchases of 200,000 Bitcoin. Bo Hines, the Executive Director of Digital Assets, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the urgency to accumulate Bitcoin quickly before prices rise further. Hines suggested that the U.S. could utilize its gold reserves to fund these Bitcoin purchases, presenting a budget-neutral approach to increasing national Bitcoin reserves. This initiative reflects a growing interest among U.S. policymakers in leveraging cryptocurrency to enhance financial stability and potentially outpace global competitors, particularly China.

The forecast highlights several catalysts: the final settlement between Ripple and the SEC involving a $50 million penalty, growing institutional adoption, and the anticipated approval of an XRP ETF. These insights come from a report by Geoffrey Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, published via The Block . “By the end of 2028, we see XRP’s market cap overtaking Ethereum’s,” Kendrick stated in an email to The Block, adding, “That would make XRP the second-largest (non-stablecoin) digital asset at that time.” If the prediction proves accurate, it could send shockwaves through the crypto market—potentially sparking a new wave of volatility and prompting investors to seek the best crypto to buy now, especially among promising crypto ICOs. Mix of Regulatory Developments, Institutional Adoptions and Expanded Use Cases Could Lead to XRP's Growth – Report The report offered a detailed rationale for why XRP could overtake Ethereum in the near future. Geoffrey Kendrick pointed to a combination of recent regulatory progress, Ripple’s legal resolution with the SEC, the prospect of a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration, and the expanding use cases within the XRP ecosystem as key drivers behind the bullish prediction. Notably, Ripple has agreed to settle its long-standing case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, reducing the financial penalty from $125 million to just $50 million —significantly lower than what had been proposed under the previous administration. Kendrick also expects the SEC to approve an XRP ETF by the end of Q3 2025, which would further validate XRP in the eyes of institutional investors and potentially unlock significant liquidity. On the development front, Ripple continues to expand aggressively. Ripple President Monica Long recently announced that Ripple will acquire Hidden Road in a $1.25 billion deal—making it the first company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. In terms of technicals, XRP has established a clear upward momentum, with multiple consecutive green candles forming on its price chart. The XRP price is currently trading above the $2.1 level, with a market capitalization upwards of $125 billion. With $2.2 acting as the immediate resistance, analysts suggest XRP may soon retest its second all-time high—and if Standard Chartered’s forecast holds, it could push as far as $12.5, overtaking Ethereum. While XRP Flies High, Ethereum Struggles to Maintain Momentum The growing narrative that XRP could soon flip Ethereum has been reinforced by the recent struggles faced by the world’s largest altcoin. For one, Ethereum’s price has corrected by more than 60% since December 2024, and institutional demand appears to be weakening. A clear indicator of this is the substantial outflow of over $94.1 million from Ethereum-focused investment vehicles in the past few weeks. Network activity has also seen a sharp decline over the last 30 days. With a 33% drop in the number of unique active wallets, Ethereum’s transaction fees have plummeted —reducing the amount of ETH burned and leading to an inflationary trend.. At the time of writing, ETH is trading around the $1.6K level, with a market capitalization just above $185 billion. Since most altcoins are built on the Ethereum chain, any sustained drop in Ethereum’s performance is likely to ripple through their native token prices—unless those chains offer unique and independent utility. As a result, investors looking to hedge against market risk may find better opportunities in crypto presales instead. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Presales with Massive Upside Potential BTC Bull XRP’s recent growth may partly be attributed to Bitcoin surging past the $84K resistance. However, this is merely a passive effect of Bitcoin’s rally that XRP managed to ride. BTC Bull , on the other hand, takes a more active approach. This meme coin project has built an ecosystem that mirrors Bitcoin’s growth in real time, aiming to help low-cap investors benefit directly from BTC’s bullish trajectory. Among its standout features is a token burn mechanism, designed to leverage supply-demand dynamics in favor of long-term holders. Additionally, BTC Bull offers Bitcoin airdrops, rewarding its community with free BTC as part of its unique tokenomics. With over $4.5 million already raised, investor interest is clearly gaining momentum. Crypto YouTubers like Casperer have reviewed BTC Bull favorably, noting its potential to ride the wave of the next major bull run. SUBBD SUBBD is a decentralized content creation platform built for the Web3 ecosystem, powered by AI-driven tools. This AI creator coin aims to give users the ability to generate and monetize their own AI content within a market valued at over $85 billion. Tapping into a space with more than 250 million active followers across platforms, SUBBD has already onboarded top content creators to kickstart its growth. According to the team, SUBBD’s AI tools will handle a range of administrative tasks for creators, including fulfilling custom content requests—helping them save time and scale output efficiently. At its core, SUBBD is designed to power a more rewarding ""create-to-earn"" economy. Creators can boost their revenue by upselling enhanced content through AI, while fans can participate in an entirely new mode of interaction—one that goes beyond simple transactions into actual collaboration. Even content distributors stand to gain, as SUBBD offers perks to those who share content—a move intended to discourage piracy and unauthorized leaks. YouTuber Alessandro De Crypto recently reviewed the project and highlighted its unique utility, stating that SUBBD could have 100x potential in the upcoming cycle. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe is an AI-driven cryptocurrency project that has captured attention through its meme-based appeal. In a market that could grow increasingly volatile—especially if XRP manages to flip Ethereum—such meme-based narratives could play a vital role in driving engagement and momentum. However, beyond its meme aesthetic, MIND of Pepe also positions itself as an AI agent token. According to its tech roadmap, this AI agent will be capable of interacting with the broader crypto community on social media—providing real-time insights, discussing market conditions, and delivering sharp commentary. Other features of the project include real-time intelligence tools and hive-mind analysis, with perks such as alpha calls exclusive to holders and immediate market insights. A token deployment utility is also in development, though further details are still being released. Simply put, MIND of Pepe blends meme coin charm with functional AI-driven perks. While the concept isn’t groundbreaking, its familiar imagery and practical utility could give it long-term staying power—making it a project to watch in both the short and long term. Final Words The sentiment that XRP could flip Ethereum has been gaining traction for some time now. John E. Deaton, founder of CryptoLawUS, echoed these views in a tweet posted on April 9. While this may appear as good news for XRP holders and institutional investors, the potential flipping of Ethereum could inject significant volatility into the broader crypto market. To prepare for the uncertainty ahead, investors should consider loading up on the best crypto to buy now—particularly those found among promising crypto presales. These emerging assets not only offer a hedge against market-wide turbulence but also bring real utility, which could help them withstand the aftershocks if Ethereum loses its position as the world’s leading altcoin.

IOTA ( IOTA ) was trading at $0.1670, a few points above the year-to-date low of $0.1360. It remains significantly below last year’s high of $0.6375. The coin could experience big gains in the next few weeks as the developers unveil the Rebased upgrade. While the date has not been announced, there are rumors that it will happen later this month. Rebased is a major upgrade that will transition the network into a more accessible layer-1 network. It will introduce full decentralization using delegated proof-of-stake technology with over 50 validators. You might also like: IOTA price prepares for a big move ahead of Rebased launch This decentralization means that IOTA will introduce staking, where delegators will receive an annual return of 10% and 15%. That will be a significantly higher return than popular proof-of-stake tokens like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). IOTA will also switch to the Mysticeti Consensus, which will make it one of the fastest players in crypto, handling over 50,000 transactions per second. In contrast, Ethereum handles less than 50 TPS, while Solana has less than 3,000. IOTA will also become a deflationary as it will introduce a fee burning mechanism. Burning is a process where a crypto project reduces the number of tokens in circulation by sending them to an inaccessible address. IOTA price analysis IOTA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the IOTA token has formed a rare pattern known as a falling wedge. This pattern comprises two descending and converging trend lines. In IOTA’s case, these two lines are about to converge, raising the possibility of a breakout ahead of the upgrade. The Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have also formed a bullish divergence pattern. This situation is where these oscillators rise as an asset’s price pulls back. Therefore, the token will likely have a bullish breakout in the coming weeks. The target will be at $0.4175, the highest point in March last year, which is about 150% above the current level.

It’s Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), an AI agent-based meme coin launched in October last year. $FARTCOIN has surged by more than 350% since March 10 and over 90% since just the last week. What’s more, its market capitalization now stands at a whopping $877M. Read on to know how this surge in $FARTCOIN is a very positive sign for the crypto industry. We’ll also list down three of the best meme coins that can follow in $FARTCOIN’s footsteps and make you significant profits. What Does $FARTCOIN’s Surge Indicate? In an uncertain market marked by volatility, $FARTCOIN has been able to outperform safe-haven assets like gold in the last month. Additionally, $FARTCOIN’s peers, like $DOGE, $PEPE, and $TRUMP, have been hovering around their lows. But $FARTCOIN has been making fresh highs every day. This is particularly interesting, and why we’re here talking about this ‘stinky’ token in the first place. After its initial launch, $FARTCOIN garnered a lot of hype, and its market cap reached a massive $2.5B with a 17,000% surge in price. However, the crypto winter was harsh on it, as it tumbled by 91% from its all-time highs. But the coin has regained half of that lost value thanks to the recent surge. Crypto trader Smiley Capital said that this aggressive up move can be a sign of risk-on sentiment making a comeback in the crypto space. ‘It’s also a barometer and frontrunner for broader risk assets,’ he said. This means the $FARTCOIN move is an indicator of improving market health and a change in sentiments. After a tough few months, meme coin investors are now feeling more confident. $FARTCOIN may also turn out to be a trailblazer in a series of price surges to follow. If you’re looking for assets that may replicate $FARTCOIN’s historic rise, here are a few top trending cryptos you cannot ignore. 1. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Best Meme Coin to Buy In 2025 SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is a new and revolutionary AI-powered crypto that could easily replicate Fartcoin’s performance. For instance, our SUBBD price prediction suggests the token could reach as high as $0.668 by the end of 2026. Considering $SUBBD is currently priced at just $0.05515, that would be a nearly 1,200% gain in less than two years. What’s so special about SUBBD, you ask? It’s the first-ever crypto subscription platform that uses AI to reduce the time and effort needed by online creators to manage the content that they put out. Creators will not only benefit from SUBBD’s suite of AI tools that will help them streamline content production, but they’ll also be able to set up various monetization schemes for their fans. These include subscriptions, tipping, pay-per-view (PPV) content, and even NFT sales. The fans, on the other hand, can use $SUBBD tokens to access the exclusive content of their favorite creators on the SUBBD platform. What’s more, owning $SUBBD also offers staking rewards, discounts on content and subscriptions, governance rights, and so much more. All in all, $SUBBD is easily one of the best cryptos to buy now – for both its use cases as well as its potential price jump. The SUBBD Token is currently in presale, where it has already raised over $159K. Get $SUBBD now for just $0.05515 – here’s how to buy it . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – New Meme Coin Revolutionizing the Solana Blockchain Even though pure meme coins like $FARTCOIN and $BROCCOLI are all the rage right now, it’s worth backing a top altcoin like Solaxy ($SOLX) that not only has the same degen energy backing it but also carries real utility. Solaxy aims to solve the pain points of Solana, which has been struggling with network congestion and scalability due to the groundbreaking success of $TRUMP, $MELANIA, and Pump.fun. These coins chose Solana because of its memecoin-friendly infrastructure. However, they attracted a lot of investors to Solana, which it wasn’t prepared for. This overloaded the blockchain. Solaxy will build the very first Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. To put it simply, Solaxy plans to direct some of Solana’s transaction requests to a sidechain. This will allow its mainnet the breathing space it’s currently not getting. Another reason crypto experts are bullish on Solaxy is its mind-boggling presale performance. It has amassed close to $30M at the time of writing, with both retail and whale investors backing it. The best bit? You can purchase one of the best crypto presales on the market right now for only $0.001692 per token. For more info, here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX . 3. FirstBroccoli ($BROCCOLI) – Another Hype-Backed Meme Coin up over 236% in the Last Month Although $FARTCOIN has been the center of attraction this past week, $BROCCOLI has posted some equally ridiculous gains. It’s up nearly 150% in the last seven days – and a whopping 221% in the last month. Moreover, its latest rally has broken out of the $0.014 resistance zone. This means $BROCCOLI is in a pole position to rally higher, with online predictions suggesting it could climb up to $0.60, close to its all-time highs. $BROCCOLI is similar to $FARTCOIN in that it, too, is a hype-backed token that relies on the favor of online crypto communities. What’s more, like Fartcoin, $BROCCOLI is also linked to a crypto celebrity. The token came into existence when Binance’s ex-CEO, CZ, publicly acknowledged the power of meme coins and suggested he’d be on board to launch one based on his pet dog, Broccoli. As soon as CZ revealed the name of his dog, multiple $BROCCOLI tokens sprung to the surface. However, only a few really got going. FirstBroccoli is one of them. Final Thoughts Although the success of $FARTCOIN is a positive signal we’re re-entering another meme coin bull run, we suggest treading on the side of caution. That’s because meme coins, especially those that rely heavily on the attention they get, can just as quickly go bust as they rocket to the moon. It’s advisable to only invest an amount you don’t mind losing. Additionally, kindly do your own research and due diligence before investing.

Discover why Near Protocol , Polkadot , and Render are grabbing attention with their impressive features. This article delves into the unique utilities these coins offer and why they could be key players in the short-term market surge. Explore their potential and what sets them apart in the crypto landscape. NEAR Protocol: Past Downturn and Critical Price Levels NEAR Protocol experienced a 16.13% price drop over the last month and a 57.06% decline over the past six months. These decreases highlight ongoing market weakness, with negative momentum indicators and broad declines in performance. Investors have consistently faced pressure, revealing a lack of recovery in recent trends. The coin currently trades between $1.92 and $3.34. Immediate resistance is at $4.16, with support at $1.32 and a second resistance level at $5.58. Bearish signals, such as a negative oscillator and an RSI below mid-range, indicate a prevailing downtrend. Trading ideas suggest watching for a bounce from support or potential signals of a reversal when testing resistance. Polkadot DOT: Bears at Play Amid Clear Trading Levels Last month saw a decline of 8.06%, accompanied by a six-month drop of 16.67%, indicating a downtrend in DOT ’s performance. A one-week fall of 7.59% further highlights the cautious market stance observed in recent periods. Price activity has remained within a narrow range, illustrating the coin’s ongoing struggle to gain momentum. The coin currently trades between $3.38 and $4.96, with immediate support at $2.73 and nearby resistance at $5.89. Further levels include $1.15 for additional support and $7.47 for extra resistance. Bears dominate the market as negative momentum persists, suggesting opportunities for short positions near resistance and selective entries near support. Altcoin Price Action Poised for a Bullish Setup Render price has risen over 30 percent in the last month, with a nearly 25% gain in the past week. However, a decline of around 30% over six months highlights the volatility in its trend. The movements indicate rapid surges followed by significant pullbacks, pointing to active trading and a market balancing between strong buying and cautious selling. Prices currently range between $2.46 and $4.42, with immediate resistance at $5.43 and firm support at $1.52. Bulls show some strength with an RSI near 60, although the trend remains uncertain. Traders may consider a breakout above $5.43 to target the $7.39 resistance while monitoring the support level for potential bearish reversals. Conclusion NEAR Protocol , Polkadot , and Render present strong potential for short-term growth. NEAR offers innovative technology, enhancing transaction speed. Polkadot enables better connectivity between different blockchains. Render supports an efficient way to share computing power. These factors highlight why these three assets could perform well in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite this somewhat bullish move, bearish market conditions still persist. According to a weekly report from the market analytics platform CryptoQuant, bitcoin (BTC) has been in one of its least bullish phases since November 2022. The asset’s on-chain metrics signal that a sustained rally in the near term is unlikely. BTC Rallies on Paused Tariffs The week began with high volatility that triggered a sell-off that dragged bitcoin’s price from $84,000 to a five-month low of $74,000. Ether (ETH) also fell to its March 2023 low of $1,385 as China and the European Union imposed retaliatory tariffs against the United States. By the middle of the week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except China. During these three months, China will be subject to 125% tariffs while 10% will be imposed on other countries. The development triggered a rally among crypto assets, with BTC rebounding after touching its 365-day moving average; CryptoQuant said this level has acted as support in current and previous market cycles. While BTC currently trades at $83,460, CryptoQuant believes it has found support at its 365-day moving average of $76,100. A sustained plunge below this level would signal the onset of a bear market. Market Still in Bearish Condition Although market sentiment improved after Trump paused the tariffs, it is worth noting that BTC has recorded its largest drawdown of this cycle – a 27% correction. Data from CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index shows the cryptocurrency is still in one of its least bullish phases in over two years. As reported earlier by CryptoPotato , the Bull Score Index assesses bitcoin’s investment environment by evaluating nine on-chain indicators and one market metric. The model measures the conditions of the metrics from 0 to 100, with the former being bearish and the latter being bullish. The index has now fallen to 10 after hovering around 20 since mid-March; a continued stay below 40 indicates weak investor sentiment and the beginning of a bear market. Besides that, only one metric is flashing bullish signals in the metric, which is the price of BTC hovering above its 365-day moving average. The remaining nine have mostly been bearish since February 23, when BTC was still changing hands at $96,000. Meanwhile, analysts have marked the $84,000 and $96,000 levels as resistance zones if BTC continues its ascent in the coming days.

The pair had reacted well to news that US President Donald Trump had decided to exclude certain key products from his ongoing trade tariffs against China. Traditional markets are closed on weekends —creating lower-liquidity trading in crypto markets and raising the chance for price volatility— with Bitcoin subsequently dropping under $84,000. With hours to go until the weekly close, BTC/USD was thus up 7% for the week, having started with a trip to new five-month lows . Commenting, traders were cautious over BTC price strength.

The momentum shifts fast, and timing can make all the difference between catching a wave and missing the boat completely. Across Latin America and beyond, more people are looking for short-term opportunities that still offer real value—projects with actual use cases, passionate communities, and strong fundamentals. The flashy, short-lived meme pumps aren’t cutting it anymore. That’s exactly why Qubetics (TICS) is making noise. This isn’t another hollow presale—it’s a full-stack ecosystem with powerful tools and built-in demand, and it’s quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits . Meanwhile, blockchain veterans VeChain and SUI have carved out their own lanes as reliable, utility-rich platforms. One leads in enterprise adoption; the other dominates the speed and scalability conversation. All three bring serious potential, but only one still offers early entry pricing that could change the game. Qubetics (TICS): QubeQode IDE + Real-World Dev Simplicity Qubetics isn’t just riding hype—it’s building smart, simple tools that make blockchain development accessible to everyone. At the center of that? The QubeQode IDE —a no-code, drag-and-drop environment that allows users to build decentralized applications (dApps) without needing to touch a line of code. This tool alone puts Qubetics at the front of the pack when listing out the best cryptos to join for short term profits . Let’s put it into perspective. A freelance developer in Buenos Aires can now build a DeFi app, smart contract-based invoicing system, or digital voting platform—without hiring a Solidity dev or learning Rust. A logistics firm in Bogotá can tokenize its supply chain in a weekend. Even non-technical professionals can prototype blockchain apps for clients in real estate, e-commerce, or event ticketing. That kind of speed-to-build lowers the barrier and invites a wave of real-world users onto the chain. And it’s not just a single tool. Qubetics’ ecosystem also includes a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, decentralized VPN, and tokenization marketplace. It’s all designed for flexibility, security, and compliance—features that professionals and businesses across LATAM and the US are actively seeking. Every feature in the ecosystem is powered by $TICS, the native token driving transactions, governance, and access. This multi-layered utility makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits , especially for community members who want exposure to real infrastructure while it’s still early. Qubetics Presale Stage 29: Entry Timing & ROI Projections The crypto presale is now in Stage 29 . So far, it’s sold over 507 million tokens to more than 24,600 holders , raising $16 million . Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.1573 , and backers who entered at Stage 1 ($0.01) are already sitting on 1473% gains . And yet—it’s not too late. Buying at the current level could still bring substantial returns. Analysts forecast $TICS at $1 after launch , meaning a 535% ROI from today’s price. More aggressive predictions place the token at $5 (3078%) , $6 (3713%) , $10 (6256%) , or even $15 (9434%) after mainnet. In terms of upside with active product rollout, Qubetics easily ranks among the best cryptos to join for short term profits right now. VeChain: Enterprise Utility That’s Built to Last VeChain is the definition of enterprise-grade blockchain. It’s one of the few projects in the space that’s fully focused on real-world supply chain, sustainability, and data management solutions —with dozens of multinational partnerships to prove it. For years, it has stood strong as one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits and long-term plays alike, thanks to its grounded use cases and consistent tech delivery. Backed by the VeChainThor blockchain, this ecosystem is designed to help businesses track goods, verify authenticity, and digitize data on-chain in a secure and transparent way. From luxury goods and wine to carbon credits and cold-chain shipping, VeChain provides tools that let global brands operate smarter and more transparently. The dual-token model, which includes VET for value transfer and VTHO for gas, ensures cost predictability and separation of function—a structure that’s well-suited for corporate use. That’s why companies like BMW, PwC, Walmart China, and others have tapped into VeChain’s infrastructure. In Latin American regions where supply chain integrity, anti-counterfeit tools, and sustainability reporting are becoming critical issues, VeChain provides plug-and-play solutions. For enterprise buyers and professionals tracking reliable, application-first tokens, VeChain continues to prove why it’s one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits , especially when adoption timelines start to accelerate. The community also values its consistency. VeChain doesn’t rely on hype. It relies on use, trust, and partners who show up. That type of quiet strength often signals staying power—and market opportunities that don’t disappear overnight. SUI: A Scalable Powerhouse for dApps and Digital Ownership When it comes to speed, composability, and developer support, SUI is carving out its space as one of the most exciting new Layer 1s. Built by former Meta (Facebook) engineers, SUI is based on the Move programming language, and it’s optimized for asset ownership and high-speed digital application delivery. It’s not just another chain—it’s built for massive scale. At the core of SUI’s performance is its ability to execute transactions in parallel. This means faster confirmation, lower congestion, and virtually instant user interactions. For devs building games, social apps, or consumer-facing financial tools, this opens the door to Web2-like experiences with full decentralization under the hood. Communities in Latin America are tapping into this innovation. A developer collective in Medellín, for example, can now create a cross-platform loyalty system that runs on SUI without struggling through gas fees or slow sync times. SUI enables NFT integration, gaming mechanics, and DeFi tools to run with fluid performance. Its commitment to developer-friendly onboarding also makes it one of the best cryptos to join for short term profits , particularly for teams who want to get products out the door quickly. Wallet integrations, SDKs, and permissionless launch tools are all easily accessible—making SUI an attractive pick for those tired of slow, bloated chains. Backers of SUI see it as a chain built for the next billion users—not just insiders. Its flexible design and low-latency interactions have made it a go-to platform for next-gen apps across Latin America and Asia. And for those exploring early infrastructure plays, it’s hard not to include SUI in any shortlist of best cryptos to join for short term profits . Final Thoughts Not all cryptos deliver equal upside—especially when short-term profits are the goal. The key is to find projects with a working product, growing adoption, and a real need in the market. That’s what separates hype from potential. Qubetics stands out as a presale-stage gem that’s already solving problems across wallets, dApps, and multi-chain systems. Its QubeQode IDE is a massive value-add for builders, and the presale stage offers rare early pricing with huge projected returns. It easily ranks among the best cryptos to join for short term profits , especially before launch day hits. VeChain continues to show up for enterprise users, with battle-tested infrastructure and real business adoption. It’s the kind of project that builds slow, strong momentum and rewards those who stay dialed in. SUI is positioned as the next-gen chain for digital ownership, dev scalability, and high-performance apps. It brings together UX and speed in a way few Layer 1s can match right now. For anyone looking to get in with timing on their side and products that matter— these three projects offer sharp, actionable entries this month . Qubetics, in particular, is still wide open for entry. But the window won’t stay open forever.

Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token.

If buyers defend the $1.7 level, we might see a strong recovery toward $2. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 543,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC is showing bullish divergence with the relative strength index (RSI). A bullish divergence happens when a momentum-focused indicator like the RSI trends higher while price goes lower or sideways, suggesting a foreshadowing of price reversal. Rekt Capital points out there were similar divergences in August of 2024, August of 2023 and November of 2022. “Bitcoin is developing yet another Higher Low on the RSI while forming Lower Lows on the price. Overall, throughout the cycle, Bitcoin has formed Bullish Divergences like this on a few occasions already. Each Bull Div preceded reversals to the upside.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Zooming in, the analyst says that BTC’s downward trend is officially broken once a clean break of the lower high structure, currently at around $82,000, occurs. “Bitcoin has successfully retested red as support and the Daily RSI Higher Low continues to maintain itself as well. Growing signs of a maturing Bullish Divergence here, with price just below the key Price Downtrend (blue). BTC needs to break this Downtrend to enable the Bull Div to play out.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,789, slightly above Rekt Capital’s blue, downward trend line depicted in the chart, suggesting that the reversal may be underway.

Dimon's comments come as bond yields spike and market volatility rises. The rising yields have suggested investors are pulling back from popular trades that exploit gaps between Treasury prices and futures, adding stress to a market already rattled by trade tensions under the escalating U.S.-China trade war. Dimon said current regulations are keeping banks from stepping in as buyers when liquidity dries up. In 2020, a similar situation forced the Fed to launch a multi-trillion-dollar bond-buying program to keep the market functioning. He’s pushing for reforms that would let banks act more freely as intermediaries. One idea under discussion is exempting Treasuries from leverage ratio calculations, which could allow institutions to buy more government debt without hitting capital buffers. “If they don’t [change the rules], the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea,” Dimon said. The Treasury market plays a central role in global finance, setting the tone for everything from mortgage rates to corporate bond yields. Dimon warned that if the system locks up again, the consequences could ripple across the economy. A Treasury market disruption that leads to Fed intervention could drive some investors toward bitcoin (BTC), which is often seen as a hedge against monetary instability. That appears to have been the case in 2020, when bitcoin's price surged following the Fed’s aggressive stimulus response.

Rising activity from large holders suggests potential price movements. Investors should stay alert as these popular memecoins could be on the verge of a significant shift. The article delves into the latest trends and the whispers of market watchers anticipating an upward swing for these digital assets. Dogecoin Trading Snapshot: Short-Term Dip Amidst Long-Term Surge The past month DOGE saw a slight drop of 0.30%, while the six-month performance recorded a strong rise of 40.17%. A recent weekly decline of 2.79% indicates short-term volatility. These numbers reflect minor weakness in the one-month change contrasted by a robust recovery over the last half-year, suggesting that Dogecoin has experienced periods of both bearish pressure and overall bullish backing. Current trading is confined between a support level near $0.08 and resistance at around $0.28, with movements within a range of $0.13 to $0.23. Technical signals lean slightly bearish, and the neutral RSI near 47 suggests no clear trend. Traders may want to watch for potential breakouts above resistance or opportunities to test the lower band for entry. Shiba Inu Market Recap: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels Modest gains of approximately 2.41% in the past month contrast with a steep 34.21% drop over the last six months. Price action shows short-term recovery alongside longer-term pressure from sellers. The asset has trended within a narrow band, reflecting both vulnerability and potential for rebound. Data indicates that the coin has experienced volatile shifts, prompting interest from short-term traders while cautioning longer-term holds. Current prices trade between $0.00001 and $0.00002 with immediate resistance at $0.00002 and support at $0.00001. Indicators like an RSI of 48.68 and mixed oscillators suggest a neutral trend where bulls and bears are fairly balanced. Traders might consider range-bound strategies by buying nearer support and watching the approach to resistance for potential reversals. Conclusion DOGE is aiming to reverse its recent trend and bounce back. SHIB is setting new price targets. Increased activity from large holders hints at potential upward movements for both coins. Excitement is building around the possibilities ahead. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Scott recently stated that it is important to encourage innovation in the digital asset space before imposing heavy regulations. “There was clear resistance to crypto under the Biden administration and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler,” Scott said. “What I often say is simply this: We need to innovate before we regulate.” The senator said the United States must support domestic crypto innovation to maintain its leadership in the global digital economy. “Allowing innovation in the digital asset space to happen right here at home is critical to America’s economic dominance around the world,” he said. Related News: Bitcoin Hit Support in Special Metric, Analytics Company Says: Here Are the Scenarios That Could Happen If It Falls or Bounces Scott also touched on the recent advancement of the GENIUS Act, a comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework that was successfully passed by the Senate Banking Committee in March 2025. He described the legislation as a crucial step toward establishing a regulatory foundation that supports crypto innovation rather than stifling it. Describing the GENIUS Act as a bipartisan success, Scott commended the committee for its swift action and signaled optimism for broader crypto market structure legislation to move forward. “That’s how you get things done,” he said. Scott also noted President Donald Trump’s stance on digital assets, saying, “President Trump is leading a crypto revolution, starting with the Banking Committee.” With both political and legislative momentum growing, Senator Scott reaffirmed that cryptocurrency policy remains a top priority for Congress in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

This lackluster experience for Web3 is losing the attention of as many users as desired, and with how fast the ecosystem moves, these shortcomings are rarely paid attention to. AI agents can be an excellent tool to overcome these weaknesses. Their potential to improve development and user experience is remarkable, although it has yet to reach its real potential. Once combined with emotional AI, which will enable us to understand contexts beyond their programming, we will see a quantum leap from Web3 tools to ordinary users. Web3’s learning curve is very steep Consider your first interactions with a Web3 wallet — a scary, difficult experience. Many people fear that, at any moment, they could make a mistake, which could mean losing money. This situation can be less uncomfortable if we add agents with emotional AI that can guide new users and provide personalized support, keeping people at ease during their learning process. If the first interaction with Web3 is seamless in this way, adoption could grow. A better user experience would be a win-win for the entire industry, which suffers from having few users. Reaching a level of adoption of a Web2 tool would be a win for the ecosystem. Emotional AI companions would make everything easier With the potential that emotional AI agents have, they would facilitate the experience of new users, and they could serve as personal assistants to interact with the rest of the Web3 tools in a more autonomous, personalized way. Emotional AI agents could act as motivational coaches, providing continuous, personalized and empathetic accompaniment that enables them to connect deeply with their users and guide them in the best practices to avoid significant losses in Web3. Recent: Inside an AI-powered Web3 game’s race to 100 million users These are just some of the most evaluated uses of Web3 today. The more applications it has in the future, the more potential is unlocked. Combining so much state-of-the-art technology, however, entails significant risks that must be considered in its development. Implementing emotional AI in Web3 carries risks Integrating emotional AI within the Web3 ecosystem could be very beneficial. Still, it must be considered that it entails risks that any AI has, plus what the use of Web3 implies. One of the most significant risks would be using personal information because, as an emotional AI, it will require more information from its users, which increases the danger of data leakage. This same personalization could generate an unhealthy dependence on its emotional AI partner, so safeguards against this would have to be implemented. Even being so personalized, it will generate biased information, which will close the scope of the AI agent. Considering the risks mentioned above, while the technology is under development, by the time emotional AI agents launch, developers can forge the path to reduce these risks and implement all the benefits of this technology. Emotional AI is the key to greater adoption of Web3 AI tools have become more widespread at a rate we have not seen since the launch of the internet. The speed of adoption is because AI tools have become straightforward tools to facilitate any task. The next step is emotional AI agents, which allow for closer AI companions who can provide better support. As complicated as the Web3 industry is, if these emotional AI companions became the standard in the ecosystem, all these tools would be available to any user. The Web3 adoption it would facilitate would be enormous, and all this value would be worth the risks. Opinion by: Max Giammario, founder and CEO of Kindred.

And now, amidst all this, one project is catching the eye — Mutuum Finance (MUTM), whose Phase 4 of presale is steamrolling at full speed ahead. $6.6 million has been raised and 400 million tokens have been sold to 8,200 holders since the presale began. At just $0.025, MUTM is in stark contrast to the volatility of ETH, with a 20% increase to $0.03 in Phase 5. The half-a-cent exchange listing has been built into its tokenomics, a staggering 140% return for early backers, rising to $3.50 in post-launch estimates. With ETH on the fritz, whales are turning to MUTM’s structured growth model and banking that its algorithmic lending protocols and buy-pressure mechanics will win the 2025 altcoin race. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has never been in higher demand, with its Phase 4 presale highlighting belief in decentralized lending’s future. And it has built a system where revenue from the project is used to purchase MUTM, ensuring perpetual demand. This further incentivizes staking to those holding positions long term whilst slicing into selling pressure as the tokens gained are then redistributed to stakers. The mechanism, combined with the introduction of mtTokens—interest generating assets that represent user deposits—transforms MUTM into a versatile asset: offering both utility as well as passive income. The current Phase 4 entry price stands at $0.025 since it will reach its peak at $0.03 in the forthcoming phase. New investors obtain a 140% profit gain when entering at the start but analysts estimate this value will increase to 14,000% if MUTM reaches a $3.50 listing price. The overcollateralized lending approach and ongoing Certik audit make Phase 4 attractive to investors based on estimated 14,000% price growth to $3.50 when combined with its low default risk profile. Mutuum Finance implemented a top 50 holder dashboard to give reward bonus tokens that intensify FOMO among stakeholders up until Phase 4 concludes. Ethereum’s Struggle Contrasts MUTM’s Ascent Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blooms whilst Ethereum (ETH) faces a market capitation stage In its recent price action, ETH dropped below its Realized Price—an indicator of the average cost for all Ether holders—suggesting almost all investors in that cryptocurrency are in loss. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) index has dropped into historic “capitulation” zones, a signal that has historically foreshadowed bottoms. But the recovery is uncertain. ETH’s weekly RSI is still hovering above oversold levels, implying commodity for declines toward $1.000, analysts at Saito Capital. While some forecast a move back up to $5,000-$7,000, the timelines are thoroughly uncertain, leaving holders still in no mans land. ETH’s woes underscore the crypto market’s volatility, redirecting capital to projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with more obvious upside paths. Where ETH dependencies on speculation, MUTM is based on DeFi utility and a blend of lending efficiency with tokenomics to fuel its appreciation. And this divergence explains why whales are re-allocating: MUTM’s presale structure ensures per-transaction gains, whilst ETH’s growth is dependent on wider market reversals. A Strategic Shift Towards Predictable Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just taking advantage of ETH dip, they’re taking altcoin value systems to the next level. Phased pricing in the presale enables early stage buyers to accrue gains, a strategy that resonates against the backdrop of crypto’s volatility. As Phase 4 flies ahead, the opportunity to lock in tokens at a cost of $0.025 fades every — single — day. Ethereum (ETH) is fighting for its life in choppy waters, which may lead some traders to look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for strategic wins. Its pending Certik audit grants it a further credibility boost, while the leaderboard initiative will help promote community engagement. For traders fleeing the volatility of ETH, then, the presale of MUTM presents a lifeline – an opportunity to step out of the maelstrom of uncertainty and directly into the realm of structured profit. With Phase 5’s price explosion approaching and exchange listings close at hand, waiting risks losing out on the potentially biggest-altcoin of 2025. Get your hands on MUTM tokens before the next jump.

It has dropped 22.3% from its all-time high of $108,786, reached on Jan. 20. Despite this correction, on-chain data suggests strong accumulation activity at critical price levels.

Breaking and holding above this level could accelerate its upward momentum. One analyst, who goes by the moniker “Merlijn The Trader,” has identified additional bullish signals. He noted that Bitcoin has broken out of a falling wedge pattern with a bullish divergence forming on momentum indicators. This combination often precedes significant price movements, with the analyst setting a potential target of $102,000. “This is how trends begin,” Merlijn stated. BITCOIN BREAKOUT + BULLISH DIVERGENCE = EXPLOSION? $BTC broke out of the falling wedge. RETEST incoming. Momentum building. Target: $102,000 This is how trends begin. BUCKLE UP. pic.twitter.com/NG9RYEm1qP — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) April 13, 2025 In technical analysis, the falling wedge pattern is considered a bullish reversal formation characterized by converging downward trend lines. When price breaks above the upper trend line, it typically signals the exhaustion of selling pressure and a potential shift toward buying momentum. The current technical setup comes after Bitcoin has experienced substantial volatility in recent months, primarily influenced by broader macroeconomic factors. However, the underlying accumulation patterns suggest institutional and retail investors continue to view price dips as buying opportunities. On-chain data further supports this view, as long-term holder supply reached historic levels despite the recent price correction. This shows confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition among investors with historically low time preference. If Bitcoin confirms the breakout from its multi-month downtrend as analysts suggest, the next major resistances beyond $83,500 would likely appear at the $90,000 psychological level and the $100,000 threshold.

According to pseudonymous analyst RizeSenpai , XRP has the potential to climb to between $27 and $30 in the current market cycle, with an ultra-long-term target of $120. In a TradingView post on April 12, the expert drew parallels between XRP’s price action and Bitcoin’s historical performance, leveraging technical setup and Fibonacci extensions to support the prediction. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analyst highlighted XRP’s recent breakout above its previous all-time high resistance, a level it has been consolidating above for several months. This breakout mirrors BTC’s past behavior. “Staying consistent with the trend of XRP following BTC’s moves but slower, XRP has recently broken above it’s range and has been consolidating above the previous ATH resistance for several months. Taking in these events one can assume that XRP is looking the buck the macro trend in the cryptocurrency markets and make it’s way up to the breakout levels,” the analyst said. According to the outlook, Bitcoin’s breakout led to a surge toward its 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $61,800, followed by a peak at the 1.902 Fibonacci level. XRP, currently priced at $2.17, is projected to follow a similar path, targeting the 1.618 Fibonacci extension around $27 to $30 and potentially reaching $71 at the 1.902 level in the longer term. RizeSenpai also identified key resistance levels for XRP at $2.99 (1.414 Fibonacci) and $4.5773 (1.618 Fibonacci), with historical resistance zones at 1.618 and 1.902 Fibonacci levels. Unlike BTC and Ethereum ( ETH ), which the analyst predicts will underperform and fail to reach new highs, XRP is expected to buck the broader crypto market trend. If this pattern plays out, XRP’s conservative high target might be $30, which would attract a market cap of approximately $1.73 trillion, almost the same as Bitcoin’s. XRP’s price fundamentals Beyond technicals, several bullish factors could support XRP’s rally. For instance, on April 10, Glassnode data showed whales moved 70 million XRP, a strong signal that large investors are anticipating growth. This comes shortly after the launch of the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP leveraged exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), which may draw institutional interest. XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Glassnode/Ali_charts Retail sentiment also appears optimistic, considering a Finbold report revealed a drop in XRP held on exchanges, suggesting investors are holding rather than selling in anticipation of a price increase. However, Ripple’s ongoing release of XRP from escrow, most recently 200 million tokens , could introduce short-term volatility. XRP price analysis XRP was trading at $2.17 at press time, dropping 0.21% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the token has rallied over 5%. XRP seven-day price chart.

The draft bill , titled the “Clean Cloud Act of 2025,” aims to cut emissions from crypto miners’ activities and encourage them to use renewable energy. Crypto Mining: Emission Caps and Renewable Energy Mandates Notably, the bill introduced by two Democratic Party senators, Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman, seeks to amend the Clean Air Act. In the draft, the senators propose that all crypto miners cut down their emissions by 2035. The penalty for not meeting the set deadline will result in fines being paid by the erring crypto-mining facility. The bill will set emission caps by the end of this year and progressively see it lowered annually by 11% until it hits zero in 2035. An interesting aspect of the penalty for those who flout the law is that they would not be allowed to pass on the costs imposed by the fine to customers. The authorities would use the collected funds to subsidize increases in residential electricity costs. This would come in the form of grants to local municipalities and research in clean energy utilization. Bill Targets Crypto and AI’s Environmental Toll According to the official X handle of the Democrats in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, “crypto and AI data centers” drive up energy prices for families. They should support clean energy and stop burning fossil fuels. As per the bill, these crypto-mining facilities would provide comprehensive annual reports about their electricity consumption and sources. The goal is to enable the EPA to calculate each facility’s greenhouse emissions volume. The fines for violators will affect the facility’s user or tenant, not the landlord. Bitcoin mining and power consumption have remained a major concern worldwide. Miners’ activity has a huge impact on the nation’s electricity grid. Partisan Divide and Industry Pushback Expected Although the bill has been introduced in Congress, many expect Republican Senators to oppose it. The Republicans might want to side with President Donald Trump, who has signaled interest in making the U.S. the world’s leading Bitcoin mining hub. Additionally, Trump’s eldest sons recently indicated plans to list their own Bitcoin mining company publicly. So, many expect intense lobbying that could block the bill from passage.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the White House’s decision to exempt items like smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics from steep tariffs earlier this month was only temporary. A new set of duties focused on semiconductors is expected within “a month or two,” he said. “All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,” Lutnick said during an interview on ABC’s This Week . The goal, he added, is to encourage chip and flat panel production in the U.S. and reduce dependence on Asian manufacturing. The clarification follows a bulletin from U.S. Customs and Border Protection released late Friday bringing a temporary exemption for a range of key electronics from the reciprocal tariffs President Donald Trump announced earlier this month. However, Lutnick emphasized that those same items would soon be swept up under a more targeted policy aimed at “national security” industries like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. “We need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels — we need to have these things made in America,” Lutnick said. The price of bitcoin dropped roughly 1% on headlines reporting on Lutnick’s words, before recovering back to the $84,000 mark.

Chainlink continues to expand its reach and utility across the blockchain ecosystem, showcasing its robust integration capabilities. Recent updates highlight 14 new integrations of 5 Chainlink services across 10 different blockchain platforms, including prominent names like Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Ethereum. These integrations enhance Chainlink’s network and solidify its position as a critical player in decentralized applications’ interoperability and functionality. Understanding Chainlink’s potential price movements involves analyzing market trends, technological advancements, partnerships, and overall market sentiment. This chainlink price history prediction aims to provide insights into its future performance by examining technical analysis and fundamental aspects that could influence its value. Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $12.87 Market Cap $8.46B Trading Volume $434.85M Circulating Supply 657.09M LINK All-time High $52.88 May 09, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 24-hour High $13.17 24-hour Low $12.39 Chainlink price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price prediction $ 17.46 (23.27%) Volatility 6.87% 50-day SMA $ 15.96 14-day RSI 45.06 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $ 17.33 Chainlink price analysis: LINK shows modest uptick, faces key support zone LINK is consolidating between $12.70 support and $13.30 resistance, with no clear breakout. RSI and MACD show indecision, signaling weak bullish or bearish pressure. Narrowing Bollinger Bands suggests a breakout move is likely soon. On 13th April 2024, Chainlink (LINK) shows a downtrend, trading at $12.80, reflecting a 0.44% increase over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The circulating supply stands at 657.09 million LINK, with the token showing moderate fluctuations in the intraday market. The price has ranged between $12.73 and $13.27 in the last 24 hours. Despite the slight upward movement, the momentum remains constrained, indicating potential uncertainty or consolidation among market participants. Recent developments around LINK suggest that the asset is attempting to maintain its value above key psychological levels amid broader market hesitation. LINK has experienced repeated rejection near the $13.20 region while finding support close to $12.70. Chainlink on the daily chart: Consolidation phase with a bearish undertone The daily chart shows LINK attempting to stay afloat near the $12.80 support level after hitting an intraday low of $12.73. Price action reveals several rejections around $13.20–$13.25, forming a short-term resistance zone that has not been broken convincingly over the past week. The recent high wick rejections and lack of follow-through volume confirm higher-level distribution. A failure to maintain above the $12.75–$12.80 range could invite further downside pressure. The RSI is trending sideways near the neutral 50 zone, showing a lack of strength on either side. MACD remains flat with histogram bars close to the zero line, offering no clear crossover signal confirming indecision. Volume has also been decreasing, adding to the narrative of weakening momentum. The price remains within a sideways channel, with no clear breakout or breakdown confirmation for the daily timeframe. Chainlink 4-hour chart: Tightening range signals imminent volatility shift The 4-hour chart shows a rejection from the $13.20 level and a retracement toward $12.80. Price tests the lower Bollinger Band, hinting at a possible short-term bounce if it holds. The 200-day EMA is positioned above current levels, acting as dynamic resistance, while the 50-day EMA continues to converge with price action, indicating short-term compression. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, a potential precursor to a volatility expansion move. Traders will closely watch whether the price breaks below $12.70 or reclaims the $13.30 level to determine direction. A daily close below $12.70 would likely invite sellers, while a move above $13.30 could trigger a bullish continuation.

In 2019, LINK had substantial growth, reaching $1 in May and peaking around $3 by year-end, driven by its utility in providing reliable data feeds for smart contracts. 2020 marked a breakout year as LINK surged from $2 to $20 by August, fueled by DeFi demand.

This unexpected surge has caught the attention of traders and investors alike. Could these coins be on the verge of a longer-term comeback? The article explores the factors driving this rise and whether it's sustainable. Raydium Market Update: Price Trends and Key Levels Raydium experienced a 29.39% gain over the past month, showing strong short-term momentum. However, the coin saw a decline of 6.41% over the last six months, indicating a longer-term correction phase. Recent price action reflects a shift from lower levels into a wider trading range, highlighting both rapid upward movement and necessary adjustments in the market. The current trading window spans roughly $1.09 to $2.69. Immediate resistance is around $3.67, with support at approximately $0.47 and a higher barrier near $5.27. Momentum indicators are neutral, suggesting no clear trend between bulls and bears. Cautious trading near support levels or confirmed breakouts from resistance could provide potential trading opportunities. SUI Market Snapshot: Steady Gains Amid Balanced Trading Levels SUI has recorded steady recovery with a weekly gain of about 5.92%, a monthly increase of 8.46%, and a six-month rise of 4.19%. Price behavior over these periods shows moderate short-term momentum paired with longer-term stability, as recent moves have lifted the coin without dramatic volatility. Current trading finds SUI moving within a price range of roughly $1.74 to $3.03. Immediate support sits at about $1.21, while resistance emerges at nearly $3.78, with a second barrier at $5.07. Bulls and bears are fairly balanced, suggesting that breakout trades or range-bound strategies could work well between these key levels. Conclusion The recent 7% surge in RAY and SUI has caught attention. While short-term gains are notable, the key question is if this upward trend will hold. Past performance, market trends, and underlying factors should all be considered. Investors should keep an eye on these coins, as their progress could indicate a more substantial trend. The future movement of RAY and SUI remains to be seen, but current signs are encouraging. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

33767162,[object Object],1744558235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Surges Amid Leverage-Driven Price Action – Will It Last?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surges-amid-leverage-driven-price-action-will-it-last/,"Bitcoin is now trading above the $85,000 mark following an impressive rally that began on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China. The announcement injected a wave of optimism across financial markets, helping to ease investor fears and ignite fresh momentum in the crypto space. Since then, BTC has surged more than 15%, marking one of its strongest short-term recoveries in recent weeks. Market sentiment has shifted quickly as buyers step back in, and Bitcoin’s strength above key technical levels suggests growing confidence among traders. However, beneath the surface, there are signs that caution is warranted. According to new insights from CryptoQuant, this rally appears to be driven in large part by leverage. Analysts warn that a leverage-driven pump is underway, not just in Bitcoin, but also across major altcoins, which could introduce heightened volatility in the coming sessions. While the recent bounce has revived bullish hopes , the reliance on leveraged positions could leave the market vulnerable to sharp reversals. Whether this momentum can be sustained or leads to another round of liquidations remains the key question in the days ahead. Bitcoin Faces Critical Test Amid Leverage-Driven Rally Bitcoin is now facing a critical test as bulls attempt to reclaim the $90,000 level, a key threshold that could confirm a recovery rally and signal the end of the recent downtrend. After weeks of relentless selling pressure and macroeconomic uncertainty, Bitcoin has bounced strongly from sub-$75K levels, now trading just above $85K. Yet despite this impressive rebound, the broader market remains on edge. Global tensions, particularly those surrounding US trade policy and the risk of a broader economic slowdown, continue to inject volatility into financial markets. Bitcoin, often seen as a high-risk asset, remains 22% down from its all-time highs as it attempts to rebuild momentum. While bulls are showing signs of strength, concerns are mounting that the recent surge may not be entirely organic. Top analyst Maartunn shared on X that this latest move appears to be a leverage-driven pump. His data shows a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s Open Interest alongside the price surge — a signal that leveraged positions are fueling the rally. According to Maartun, this behavior is not isolated to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are also showing similar leverage-driven characteristics. This trend introduces the risk of sharp corrections if positions are unwound suddenly. With funding rates and open interest climbing across major assets, the next few days will be crucial. If bulls can push BTC above $90K and sustain momentum, the recovery may continue. But failure to break this resistance — combined with excessive leverage — could lead to another round of long liquidations and renewed selling pressure. Testing Key Technical Levels Amid Recovery Attempt Bitcoin is currently trading at $84,900 as bulls test a major technical milestone: the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Just above lies the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) near $87,300, placing BTC less than 3% away from breaking through both critical resistance zones. These indicators often serve as long-term trend signals, and reclaiming them would strengthen the case for a full recovery rally. If bulls manage to push the price above the recent local high at $88,800, it could confirm a short-term trend reversal and open the path toward $94K and beyond. Momentum is building following a 15% surge over the past few days, supported in part by macroeconomic relief, including a 90-day pause on US tariffs. However, risks remain. Failing to hold the $82K support level would be a bearish signal, likely triggering increased selling pressure. A decisive move below $82K could drag BTC back under $80K, erasing recent gains and placing bulls on the defensive once again. With volatility still elevated and market sentiment mixed, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can sustain this upward momentum or face renewed downside.

Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin encouraged teams to embrace the current climate as a period for strategic growth. “Create new games and product lines, consolidate our market share, and get ready for the next market expansion,” he posted on X, calling it a “coiling phase” before potential explosive growth. This is some interesting research. Basically, the amount of money it costs to onboard someone into web3 increases during bear markets and decreases during bulls.

According to the data, DeFi and CeFi campaigns posted a median CPW of $2.79, with some reaching as low as $0.10. The insights were derived from 200 programmatic ad campaigns managed by Addressable, involving over 70 advertisers targeting around 9.5 million crypto users globally. The report also tracks how CPW varies by region, campaign type, and market cycle. Nadler highlighted that premium markets like the U.S. and Western Europe saw CPW surge dramatically in 2024—up to four times in the U.S. and 27 times in Western Europe from Q1 to Q3—as interest among crypto wallet users declined during market consolidation. While these regions offer scale during bullish phases, they become expensive and less sustainable in bearish conditions. Emerging markets like Latin America and Eastern Europe offer lower CPW during favorable periods, but with greater volatility. Blockchain Gaming Sees More Deals but Less Funding in Q1 2025 The blockchain gaming sector experienced a mixed performance in the first quarter of 2025, with a notable rise in deal volume but a sharp decline in total funding. Web3 gaming projects raised $91 million in Q1 2025, marking a 71% drop from the previous quarter and a 68% decline year-over-year, according to DappRadar’s latest State of Blockchain Gaming report. DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas noted that the significant downturn highlights growing challenges for early-stage startups, especially in the current macroeconomic environment. “Unless broader market conditions improve, 2025 may prove more difficult than previous years,” she wrote. Last month, members of the Arbitrum decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voted to revoke funds previously allocated to its gaming ecosystem initiative, citing insufficient progress and transparency from the program’s administrators. The debate unfolds amid broader headwinds in the Web3 gaming sector. ZKsync recently discontinued its liquidity rewards initiative, citing poor market conditions.

The attack mainly targets Atomic and Exodus wallet users through compromised node package manager (NPM) packages. It then redirects transactions to attacker-controlled addresses without the wallet owner’s knowledge. The attack begins when developers unknowingly install trojanized npm packages in their projects. Researchers identified “pdf-to-office” as a compromised package that appears legitimate but contains hidden malicious code. Once installed, the package scans the system for installed cryptocurrency wallets and injects malicious code that intercepts transactions.

The malware can redirect transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum ( ETH ), Tron-based USDT, XRP ( XRP ), and Solana ( SOL ). ReversingLabs identified the campaign through their analysis of suspicious npm packages and detected multiple indicators of malicious behavior including suspicious URL connections and code patterns matching previously identified threats. Their technical examination reveals a multi-stage attack that uses advanced obfuscation techniques to evade detection. The infection process begins when the malicious package executes its payload targeting wallet software installed on the system. The code specifically searches for application files in certain paths. You might also like: Popcat price surges as exchange reserves fall, profit leaders hold Once located, the malware extracts the application archive. This process is executed through code that creates temporary directories, extracts the application files, injects the malicious code, and then repacks everything to appear normal. The malware modifies transaction handling code to replace legitimate wallet addresses with attacker-controlled ones using base64 encoding. For example, when a user attempts to send ETH, the code replaces the recipient address with an attacker’s address decoded from a base64 string. The impact of this malware can be tragic because transactions appear normal in the wallet interface while funds are being sent to attackers. Users have no visual indication that their transactions have been compromised until they verify the blockchain transaction and discover funds went to an unexpected address.

Despite this uptick, the meme coin is still over 80% off its all-time high from 2021, raising doubts about its ability to reach previous heights. Elsewhere, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been enticing investors during its fourth presale stage, raising $6.6 million and selling more than 400 million tokens since launch. Skyrocketing the project ahead of phase five where a convenient $0.025 price point that sits below the 20% jump to $0.03 alongside 8,200 holders underlines the success of MUTM. While Dogecoin navigates on weak fundamentals, Mutuum Finance’s structural growth mechanisms make it the better candidate for 4-digit returns. Dogecoin’s Uphill Battle The recent price jump for Dogecoin comes amid plans for a dedicated exchange-traded product (ETP) from 21Shares. Analysts such as Master Kenobi predict a $0.73 rally — and breaking above $1 by mid-2025. But hope also collides with brutal facts: this month DOGE whales sold 1.3 billion tokens and network activity dropped 94% since April. Transaction counts drift awash in years of record lows, suggesting waning retail interest. With the volatility of Bitcoin and global economic tensions, it is the utility that dogecoin lacks; this really is enough to fuel its recovery, but rather dogecoin is dependent on speculative hype. Without continued demand or ecosystem innovation, DOGE is in danger of remaining a remnant of meme culture’s history. The Presale Surge of Mutuum Finance Unlike its meme-driven counterpart, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers much more. The fourth presale phase of the project has fired up investors, who can get tokens for $0.025 before an increase to $0.03 is implemented in the next stage — a 20% profit for early participants. Visible incentives from tokenomics cement that a launch price of $0.06 gives existing buyers a 140% guarantee. While listing followers sit at the post mark with targets dwelling at $1.65, a higher 6,500% upside. This is based on the lending protocols of MUTM, which creates perpetual buy pressure through revenue-based token redistribution. This model has already been utilized by over 8,200 holders, which has led many to predict a supply squeeze once the launch is over. The Convergence of Innovation and Incentivization Mutuum Finance’s latest addition to their dashboard is a leaderboard with the 50 top tokens holders, who will receive bonus rewards for staying in their position. This approach not only breeds loyalty, but increases the sense of urgency as phase four moves into sell-out mode. The team is also completing a Certik audit of its smart contracts — another milestone that is likely to boost investor confidence when completed. These measures are consistent with MUTM’s emphasis on transparency, which is in stark contrast to Dogecoin’s dependence on celebrity endorsements and predilection to social media trends. Considered Expansion vs Speculative Hype So where Dogecoin’s future depends on the whims of the market, Mutuum Finance utilizes quantifiable metrics. The tiered structure of the presale guarantees gradual increases in price, benefiting early adopters at every stage. After launch, analysts have linked the $1.65 prediction for MUTM to its buy-and-distribute model, where platform fees are recycled into token purchases in a self-sustainable circuit framework that isolates from volatility. Dogecoin lacks similar mechanisms to hedge this risk — trapping token holders and traders at the mercy of whale movements and macroeconomic trends. Dogecoin may still be reminiscent of previous rallies but its path to 6,500% does not come without pitfalls. In contrast, Mutuum Finance democratizes DeFi onboarding into a ring-fenced series of steps, where carefully planned entry points align tightly with ecosystem incentives. Without a focus on speculative value, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as the top choice because it delivers structured opportunities. Early investors standing ready to adopt MUTM can secure returns reaching four digits yet Dogecoin shows marks of unsure growth prospects. The imminent phase four launch combined with pending Certik verification demonstrates that MUTM presale now offers a restricted time to acquire position ahead of the upcoming market wave.

But its reliance on hype rather than utility is starting to wear off. While the occasional tweet from a big name sparks temporary interest, Dogecoin’s lack of meaningful updates or features leaves nothing for investors to hold on to. So for those looking for real value and long term growth, the question becomes: is Dogecoin worth it? Meanwhile a new player in the blockchain space is proving that purpose driven projects are the key to long term success. Meet Ruvi AI , an AI powered platform that’s changing the way investors connect with opportunities. Innovation, transparency and big rewards, RUVI is the smarter alternative.

Traders are holding firm, institutions are staying active, and dips are being bought quickly. But while blue-chip cryptos weather the storm, a lesser-known contender— MAGACOINFINANCE —is quietly emerging as one of the most aggressive early-stage plays analysts are watching this quarter. Meanwhile, broader ecosystem coins like Solana (SOL) , TON , SUI , and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are keeping momentum with developer activity, ecosystem growth, and Layer 1 efficiency plays. MAGACOINFINANCE UNDER $0.0004 — 100x COMING! MAGACOINFINANCE Could Be Q2’s Best Risk-Weighted Entry As a market analyst tracking early-stage altcoin velocity, I’ve seen dozens of projects launch with high ambition but little structure. MAGACOINFINANCE is not one of them. With Stage 6 now sold out and Stage 7 live at $0.0002908 , what stands out isn’t just the 25x ROI to its confirmed listing price of $0.007 —it’s the precision of execution. This is a token built without insider favoritism: no early unlocks, no seed allocations, and no backroom deals. Just one price, one supply ( 100 billion tokens ), and a rapidly growing base of retail holders already over 12,500 strong. If you’re looking for a high-upside move with structural clarity and accelerating wallet growth, this may be your best shot in Q2. MAGA50X Bonus – 50% Token Boost Still Available The MAGA50X promo gives contributors a 50% token bonus —but only for Stage 7 participants. The moment this round fills, it’s over for good. This is the bonus that early whales are already leveraging.

As Ethereum's application layer continues to grow, he argued that strong ideological foundations and a genuine belief in decentralization are more necessary than ever. “I actually think that the growth of the application layer is exactly when a good social philosophy is needed the most,” Buterin said, noting the impact of developers’ values on the types of applications that are created. Drawing an analogy, Buterin likened Ethereum to general-purpose programming languages like C++, noting that while the technical infrastructure is largely unaffected by ideology, the application layer is more susceptible to the beliefs of its creators, adding: “Imagine C++ being made by a totalitarian. Would it be a worse language? Probably not… But Ethereum is maybe 50% general-purpose. The applications are ~80% special-purpose.” Related News: Bitcoin Hit Support in Special Metric, Analytics Company Says: Here Are the Scenarios That Could Happen If It Falls or Bounces Buterin noted that developers who are not committed to decentralization may miss key features like light clients, account abstraction, or the move to proof-of-stake, a journey Ethereum has undertaken to address energy concerns. He noted that developing applications on Ethereum is significantly influenced by developers’ vision of how blockchain technology should play a role in the world. He cited several projects that align with these principles as positive examples, including privacy protocol Railgun (RAIL), social network Farcaster, prediction market Polymarket, and secure messaging platform Signal. In contrast, he criticized practices such as memecoin platform Pump.fun, failed algorithmic stablecoin project Terra/Luna, and collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, describing them as examples of weak philosophical foundations that lead to harmful outcomes.

They’re reshaping the financial landscape, disrupting traditional banking, and opening up new avenues for cross-border transactions. If you’re wondering which crypto might be the next big thing, the next crypto to hit $1, it’s time to dive deep into three projects making waves: Qubetics ($TICS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Bittensor TAO (2025). Each has its unique features, promises, and market potential, but how do they stack up against one another? Let’s break it all down! In recent news, Qubetics is gearing up for a massive breakthrough in cross-border transactions. Its presale has already sold over 507 million tokens to more than 24,600 holders, raising over $16 million. On the other hand, Arbitrum (ARB) is making waves with its Layer 2 scalability solution for Ethereum, improving transaction speeds and lowering costs. Meanwhile, Bittensor TAO (2025) is focusing on the integration of AI into blockchain, offering innovative decentralized machine learning protocols. But here’s the burning question: which of these is the next crypto to hit $1? Let’s take a closer look at each one and find out what sets them apart. Qubetics ($TICS): The Next Crypto to Hit $1? Qubetics is quickly emerging as a frontrunner in the blockchain space, thanks to its groundbreaking focus on improving cross-border transactions. In today’s globalized world, businesses, professionals, and individuals face significant barriers when transferring funds across borders. Traditional banking systems are slow, costly, and often riddled with red tape. This is where Qubetics shines. By leveraging $TICS, Qubetics aims to revolutionize how to think about and execute cross-border payments. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 29th stage, having already sold more than 507 million tokens to over 24,600 holders, raising over $16 million in the process. The token is priced at $0.1573 right now, with analysts predicting that it could see a 535% ROI when it hits $1 after the crypto presale . What sets Qubetics apart is its scalability and low-cost transactions, making it a promising player in the future of digital finance. This cross-border capability offers businesses, professionals, and everyday users the chance to make payments without the hefty fees that come with traditional methods. The innovative use of blockchain technology ensures that every transaction is secure, fast, and transparent. For those looking for real-world applications, Qubetics could be a game-changer. Imagine being able to send money across the globe in seconds without worrying about exchange rates, processing delays, or hidden fees. Whether you’re a freelancer working with international clients or a business expanding into new markets, Qubetics makes it easier and cheaper to handle transactions. Here’s a quick look at Qubetics’ ROI potential: $TICS at $1 After the Presale: 535% ROI $TICS at $5 After the Presale: 3078% ROI $TICS at $15 After Mainnet Launch: 9434% ROI Why Qubetics is the Next Crypto to Hit $1 Qubetics isn’t just a buzzword—it’s tackling real-world problems with tangible solutions. Its presale success and strong roadmap indicate that this project is ready for mass adoption. If you’re looking for the next crypto to hit $1, keep your eyes on Qubetics, as it could very well be the one to lead the pack in the coming years. Arbitrum (ARB): Ethereum’s Game-Changer When it comes to scalability, Arbitrum (ARB) is setting the standard. As a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum enhances the network’s transaction speed and dramatically reduces fees. For those looking to solve Ethereum’s well-known scalability issues, Arbitrum is the next logical step. What makes Arbitrum so attractive is its ability to increase Ethereum’s throughput while maintaining the security and decentralization of the network. Ethereum transactions have often been slow and expensive, especially when the network gets congested. Arbitrum solves this by moving most of the transaction processing off-chain, allowing for faster and more affordable transactions. Arbitrum’s rollups are a key feature, enabling Ethereum to handle much more data while still relying on Ethereum’s security model. This makes ARB a highly promising crypto for the next big leap in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Bittensor TAO (2025): AI Meets Blockchain For those interested in AI and machine learning, Bittensor TAO (2025) could be the next big thing. Bittensor is an open-source blockchain protocol designed to incentivize decentralized machine learning. It is setting out to revolutionize the AI space by creating a marketplace for neural networks. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which require large amounts of centralized data and computing power, Bittensor’s decentralized approach gives developers and organizations access to a global pool of machine learning resources. The Bittensor network allows users to share and sell machine learning models, opening up new avenues for collaboration, innovation, and value creation in the AI sector. By 2025, Bittensor is positioning itself as a key player in the AI and blockchain space, especially with its focus on creating a decentralized model that avoids the bottlenecks of centralized data processing. For those looking for the next crypto to hit $1 in the AI industry, Bittensor (TAO) is definitely one to watch. Cross-Border Transactions and the Future of Blockchain Payments Cross-border transactions have always been a pain point for businesses and individuals alike. Whether it’s high fees, slow processing times, or lack of transparency, the traditional methods have simply not kept up with the needs of the modern world. This is where Qubetics really takes the lead, with its commitment to revolutionizing cross-border payments through blockchain technology. Here are some of the key benefits of using blockchain for cross-border transactions: Speed: Transactions that once took days can now be completed in seconds. Low Costs: Blockchain cuts out middlemen, reducing transaction fees significantly. Transparency: Blockchain’s open ledger ensures all transactions are secure and easily traceable. Global Reach: Send money anywhere in the world without worrying about borders or exchange rates. In the context of cryptocurrencies, Qubetics stands out by addressing the real-world challenges that traditional banking systems often fail to solve. As the project gains momentum, its role in making cross-border transactions smoother, faster, and cheaper will become more evident, making it an essential player in the future of digital finance. Conclusion: The Next Crypto to Hit $1 Looking at Qubetics, Arbitrum (ARB), and Bittensor TAO (2025), each offers a unique angle in the world of blockchain.

SEC and Binance Seek Fresh Delay in Lawsuit,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-clash-on-hold-sec-and-binance-seek-lawsuit-delay/,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange giant Binance have filed a motion seeking a 60-day hold on their ongoing lawsuit. The motion was jointly filed before a federal judge in the District of Columbia and requested a pause to continue discussions. SEC and Binance Discussions Gain Momentum Post-Gensler Exit As per the filing , the SEC and Binance have made significant progress in their talks since the court halted proceedings. Some of the discussion between the SEC and the exchange centers on how the efforts of the crypto task force could impact the regulatory body’s claims. The duo anticipates their ongoing conversations might lead to an amicable lawsuit resolution. Interestingly, the SEC initiated the request and agreed upon it with Binance. The crypto exchange considers this route to become more efficient in resolving issues. This is the second time that both parties are seeking an extension. The first request for a stay of proceedings was granted in February 2025, just after ex-Chair Gary Gensler left office. Following Gensler’s resignation, the SEC has been responsible for the SEC. Many in the crypto space consider him to have a more favorable disposition towards digital assets. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force’s objectives include clarifying regulatory guidance and properly managing the allocation of enforcement resources. 13 Charges Looms Over Binance The legal battle between the SEC and Binance commenced in 2023, with 13 charges filed against the exchange. The regulatory body has alleged that Binance engaged in unregistered sales of its BNB and USD tokens. Other allegations against Binance involve the operation of products such as the Simple Earn and BNB Vault, a staking program. The crypto exchange and Changpeng Zhao , its former CEO, have vehemently denied all the allegations. Is the SEC Adopting a Softer Approach to Regulation? It is unclear if both parties would find a resolution outside the courtroom. However, it is noteworthy to highlight that the SEC has withdrawn some lawsuits that border on enforcement actions. For instance, the SEC withdrew its case against Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, and Robinhood. These withdrawals suggest that the regulatory body is shifting toward crypto assets, possibly due to new leadership. The post Is Crypto Clash on Hold?

The incoming purchase will be the company’s first in Q2 after pausing Bitcoin purchases at the start of April in an eyebrow-raising move. Michael Saylor Flashes Bitcoin Buy Signal MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has dropped clues that the software company will continue its Bitcoin accumulation spree. In an X post , Saylor shared MicroStrategy’s portfolio tracker revealing the company’s Bitcoin holdings and valuations. Michael Saylor’s previous posts sharing Microstrategy’s portfolio tracker over the weekend have resulted in purchases at the start of the week. Investors are lapping up Saylor’s portfolio tracker post and the accompanying caption as cues for a BTC purchase on Monday. “No tariffs on Orange Dots,” said Saylor, taking a jibe at brewing tariff wars between the US and China. MicroStrategy had previously halted its Bitcoin purchase spree at the start of April leading to a slump in MSTR price. At the time, there was significant chatter that MicroStrategy may be forced to offload its Bitcoin holdings to cover obligations following a dip in prices. Per the portfolio tracker, MicroStrategy holds 528,185 BTC on its balance sheet valued at $44.7 billion. Michael Saylor hinting at a potential Bitcoin purchase follows a small dip in prices with BTC holding the $83K mark. Will Bitcoin Price Rally? Saylor’s hint at buying Bitcoin has triggered a small bump in prices as the top cryptocurrency surpassed $83K. However, an actual purchase will trigger a significant price action for BTC in line with previous accumulations. MicroStrategy’s last Bitcoin purchase of 22,048 BTC jolted the markets in line with investors’ expectations. However, there are fears that macroeconomic events like the US-China tariff war may affect a potential BTC rally following MicroStrategy’s incoming purchase. Bitcoin price has rebounded after a previous bloodbath, sparking fresh optimism in the markets. Crypto Joao Wedson predicts that Bitcoin is not out of the woods yet and a grim drop to $65K is still a possibility for the top cryptocurrency. “We’re not ruling out the possibility of the price dipping below $65K, as several metrics point to that region as strong support – such as the True Market Mean Price and Alpha Price, both sitting exactly around $64,700,” said Wedson. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit warns that a BTC price drop to these levels may force MicroStrategy to sell MSTR to avoid liquidation.

But that was just the beginning—the school has now linked up with internationally renowned Bitcoin economist and philosopher Dr. Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, to create an educational curriculum centered on Bitcoin and Austrian economics. A Groundbreaking Curriculum with Global Reach On April 12, in a tweet on X (formerly Twitter) , Dr. Ammous posted that he would collaborate with Lomond School to develop a new curriculum based on Bitcoin and Austrian economic school. “I’ll be collaborating with Lomond School to develop a curriculum for Bitcoin and Austrian economics,” Ammous stated. “Looking forward to making the content accessible globally.”. The course will be expected to explore the Austrian economics principles—i.e., sound money, personal freedom, and market-driven innovation—while introducing Bitcoin as a real-world application of these concepts. A First for the UK: Bitcoin as Tuition Payment The announcement came hot on the heels of the news that Lomond School would begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC) for school fees from autumn term 2025, a significant UK education sector first. The principal of the school, Claire Chisholm, was enthusiastic about the collaboration, stating she was “delighted to be working with Dr. Ammous” and appreciated the “positivity of the Bitcoin community.” The Global Rise of Bitcoin in Education This initiative is part of a broader global trend, with schools embracing Bitcoin both in the classroom and in their finances. University of Nicosia (Cyprus) launched the first Master’s in Digital Currency in 2013. NYU Stern School of Business (USA) launched one of the first U.S. Bitcoin courses in 2014. Stanford University (USA) followed up with its own course on cryptocurrency in 2015. In February 2025, the University of Austin rolled out a $5 million Bitcoin investment fund, supported by its $200 million endowment. Emory University previously reported having more than $15 million in Bitcoin via Grayscale’s spot ETF. These actions demonstrate an increasing understanding of Bitcoin as not only an asset class, but as a driver of economic and philosophical education. A New Era for Financial Literacy in Schools Lomond School’s embrace of Bitcoin for financial transactions and intellectual growth puts it at the vanguard of a new generation in education—one that encourages decentralized finance, economic education, and digital entrepreneurship. When Dr. Ammous’ curriculum is developed, it could potentially be a model for other schools globally seeking to incorporate Bitcoin and traditional economic theory into the mainstream education.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-13 16:27:46

The parallel stack, a robust, open-source framework designed for crafting rollups and layer 2s that harness parallel processing, is now on SEI V2. The stack enhances Ethereum ’s performance by targeting most bottlenecks that Layer 2 blockchains face. Such developments are anticipated to drive SEI value over the long term.

SEI price analysis shows the market was bearish for the better part of the month, however, it shows signs of recovery in the shorter timeframes. Why is SEI down? SEI was bearish over the last weeks as it fell into annual lows. The drop continues despite a rising TVL, indicating rising interest in its DeFi market. Will SEI reach $1? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI will rise above $1 in 2028, when the coin will reach a high of $1.21. Can Sei Coin reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Will SEI reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Does SEI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, SEI will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory Is SEI a good investment? SEI has growing utility, and its EVM compatibility helps it steal a share of Ethereum’s dominance. While the technical analysis is bearish, price predictions paint a different picture.

After a sharp correction, Bitcoin’s resilience could set the stage for another significant bull run.” In addition, van de Poppe wrote, “It’s not at [sic] matter of speculation where the markets will be at tomorrow. It’s rather a case of 6 months from now and build your investment thesis around it.” Bitcoin prices exhibit a strong historical trend of appreciating over many 6-month periods and delivering markedly higher returns on investment than average US stock returns. “If this correction is comparable to March ’20, then we’re about to witness a strong upwards run on #Bitcoin and #Altcoins,” the crypto fund manager added.

According to an on-chain analyst, this recent correction might not be as ominous as initially thought and could be part of a broader bull cycle. Can BTC Price Reach A New All-Time High In This Cycle? An analyst with the pseudonym ShayanBTC, in a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, shared fresh insights into the current Bitcoin market dynamics and the implications of the most recent price pullback. This evaluation is based on the Realized Cap of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) age bands, which analyzes the holding pattern of different investor cohorts. Related Reading: XRP Price To Hit $45? Here’s What Happens If It Mimics 2017 And 2021 Rallies The UTXO age bands metric tracks the average price at which Bitcoin holders purchased their coins compared to how long they’ve held the assets. In ShayanBTC’s latest analysis, the relevant age bands are the 3 – 6 months and 6 – 12 months cohorts. According to data from CryptoQuant, the percentage of coins held by this class of investors has been on a steady rise. ShayanBTC noted that this climb appears similar to the accumulation patterns observed during the prolonged correction in the summer months of 2024. The Quicktake analyst noted this pattern points to a “holding trend”, where the 3 – 6 months and 6 – 12 months investors are not offloading their assets despite the ongoing market correction. “As more coins move into the hands of long-term holders, the available circulating supply shrinks, increasing Bitcoin’s scarcity,” ShayanBTC added. From a historical standpoint, these supply constraints could be a positive catalyst for robust price rallies, especially when combined with fresh demand. According to ShayanBTC, this market dynamic could set the stage for price discovery and propel the Bitcoin price to new all-time highs. Furthermore, the Quicktake analyst believes that, with the current on-chain structure, there is a reduced likelihood that the Bitcoin market is currently at the start of a bear season. The ongoing drawdown instead seems to be a healthy correction within a broader bullish cycle. Bitcoin Price At A Glance The Bitcoin price appears to be building some bullish momentum, briefly crossing the $86,000 in the early hours of Sunday, April 13. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $85,200, reflecting an over 2% increase in the past 24 hours.

Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to give out a bearish verdict. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.466 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.1636 over the last 24 hours. DOGE is yet to overcome the strong resistance at the $0.1721 mark. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.300041 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2030. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 3002.18 DOGE in April; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.468 on December 8, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.30 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, while at the start of April, DOGE depreciated further to the $0.167 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-13 16:45:16

Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reports that Binance wants the Treasury Department to remove one of the two monitors that oversee the exchange. The US government is keeping a close eye on Binance after it pleaded guilty to having engaged in anti-money laundering (AML), unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations. The Treasury Department appointed a monitor to ensure that Binance complies with anti-money laundering laws, but a spokesperson for the exchange says that monitors led to “inefficient and costly burdens.” The report says that during last month’s meeting, Binance chief executive Richard Teng and Chief Legal Officer Eleanor Hughes asked Treasury officials to remove the monitorship, or reduce its duration and scope. Binance’s executives are said to be optimistic that the Trump administration will greenlight the request. According to WSJ, the meeting took place after Binance and representatives from the Trump family-backed crypto venture World Liberty Financial held discussions to list the project’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, on the crypto trading platform. A spokesperson for World Liberty Financial says that the company is aiming for USD1 to be “accessible for millions globally.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

XRP Gains 252% & SUI Builds in DeFi",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdags-6k-testnet-payouts-and-2380-growth-capture-the-markets-focus-xrp-gains-252-sui-builds-in-defi/,"Creating real value in blockchain today involves more than watching prices rise. XRP is focused on improving global transaction speed, and SUI is pushing limits in DeFi and NFTs. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is following another path—one that rewards real usage during its Beta Testnet. Rather than riding on market excitement, BlockDAG’s approach rewards meaningful activity such as mining, transactions, and wallet activity. This reflects a shift in focus—moving from promises to proof of function. Having raised $214 million and sold 19 billion coins, BlockDAG’s Testnet with 2,380% ROI from batch 1 highlights how genuine engagement can contribute to shaping the foundation of the network. XRP: Framework and Price Growth Overview XRP powers the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain built for quick and low-cost global payments. It uses a consensus mechanism where trusted validators confirm the sequence and results of transactions, settling in just 3 to 5 seconds. In 2012, XRP created 100 billion coins, allocating 80 billion to Ripple Labs for development. Ripple also locked 55 billion XRP in escrow to manage steady release. By March 28, 2025, XRP trades at $2.22 with a 24-hour volume of $3 billion. This shows a sharp rise from April 2024’s price of $0.63—a growth of around 252%. Circulating supply has also grown, reaching about 57 billion XRP by December 2024. SUI: Key Features and Market Movement SUI operates as a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain designed to boost both scalability and the user journey, especially in DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. Built with the Move language, adapted from Meta’s Diem project, it ensures a safe and efficient development space. SUI runs on a delegated proof-of-stake system that allows network users to contribute to security and decision-making. During 2024, SUI surged by more than 500%, hitting an all-time high close to $5. However, by March 2025, prices had leveled out. On March 27, 2025, it traded between $2.26 and $2.38, a weekly gain of 6.29%. Even with these shifts, SUI’s rise in DeFi and its goal of improving scalability give it a strong standing among Layer 1 chains. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Encourages Real Network Interaction What sets BlockDAG apart is its decision to reward genuine use in its Beta Testnet. From March 28 to May 31, 2025, three participant categories—highest transaction counts, top miners, and wallets with the most BDAG—can each win $2,000 in BDAG, totaling $6,000 in prizes. This reward system is specific: the 10 highest-ranking wallets by number of transactions, the 10 most active mining nodes, and the 10 wallets holding the most coins each receive $2,000 worth of BDAG. These coins are valued at $0.05 at the mainnet launch and are real assets, not mock tokens, giving participants a strong reason to take testing seriously. This setup is designed to assess decentralization, test scalability under pressure, and prove security based on real usage. Rather than quantity alone, it values how users interact with the network in ways that will reflect future mainnet behavior. BlockDAG aims to see actual usage patterns and is offering rewards for that direct involvement. The financial progress reinforces this direction. Currently, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has secured $214 million, and over 19 billion BDAG coins have been sold. Batch 27 is now priced at $0.0248, showing a 2,380% return since batch 1. The method is straightforward: reward meaningful engagement and build a usable platform. Wrapping Up! Each of the three—XRP, SUI, and BlockDAG—brings unique strengths like fast transactions, better scalability, and user-oriented design. While XRP fine-tunes payment systems and SUI opens new doors for developers, BlockDAG pays attention to how people truly interact with its system. Its Beta Testnet isn’t for show—it’s designed to gather data from real use and reward actions that signal long-term value. By aligning rewards with real activity and designing test goals around measurable outcomes, BlockDAG presents a clear view: real network strength grows from usage, not just noise. For those who build or use blockchain, this metric shows what really counts.

Mantle, known for its modular setup and compatibility with Ethereum, is focused on scaling effectively, despite recent drops in its token’s price. But while both chains offer practical use cases, BlockDAG is gaining more traction at a crucial stage. A recent $5 million raise within 48 hours—bringing total funds raised to $214 million—shows real momentum. With a 2,380% ROI for early participants and mainnet close, BlockDAG is becoming a key focus for crypto investors. Solana: Speed and Ecosystem Growth Drive Value Solana is built for performance and is known for fast processing and high throughput. It combines Proof of History with Proof of Stake, enabling thousands of transactions per second at very low cost. This structure has attracted a range of projects looking for speed and affordability. The price of SOL has seen solid growth over the last year. On March 30, 2025, it was around $125.87, up from $80.00 in March 2024. That’s a 57.34% increase in 12 months. The network also benefits from an active developer community and consistent platform upgrades, which continue to draw in new users and build retention. Solana’s performance track record, combined with continued development, makes it a blockchain that still holds weight in the conversation around high-utility platforms. Mantle: Ethereum-Based Scaling With Flexible Architecture Built as a Layer-2 on Ethereum, Mantle uses a modular structure to support scaling while staying secure. It works through optimistic rollups and a decentralized data availability layer, which helps reduce costs and boost transaction speed. The project is directed by its community through token governance, giving holders influence over development. Mantle also supports fast finality, smart contract deployment, and low fees—all of which appeal to DeFi builders. However, the token price has declined. On March 30, 2025, MNT was priced at $0.809, down from $1.00 in March 2024—a 19.1% drop. Still, Mantle hit a TVL high of $2.36 billion in December 2024, showing that users are engaging more with the network. The long-term appeal comes from its modular approach, which allows changes and upgrades without disrupting core functions. Despite current price dips, its practical features and developer support suggest room for future gains. $214M and Counting: BlockDAG’s Mainnet Launch Fuels Strong Investor Demand BlockDAG is drawing increased attention as it nears its mainnet launch. The platform added $5 million in new funding in just two days, lifting its total presale to $214 million. The speed of this latest raise points to growing confidence in the network’s next stage. Now in batch 27, BlockDAG’s token is priced at $0.0248. Over 19 billion coins have been purchased so far. Since batch 1, early buyers have gained 2,380% in returns. These figures show that participation is not only high but growing, especially as the mainnet deadline comes closer. The March 28 Beta Testnet rollout allowed users to interact with key functions, including deploying smart contracts, exploring mining features, and tracking token vesting in real time. This practical exposure seems to be a major driver behind recent interest. Rather than relying on future promises, BlockDAG’s current traction is built on actions already in motion. With both users and developers already onboard, and the core system being tested in real time, support is coming from those who are actively involved—not just watching from the sidelines. This strong wave of participation suggests that many see the upcoming mainnet as more than just a technical launch—it’s a validation of what has been built and tested over months. The focus now shifts to what happens next, and by the numbers, many are ready for it. Investors Take Notice of Progress That’s Already Happening Solana continues to show strength in terms of speed and adoption. Mantle’s model allows for flexible upgrades and lower costs on Ethereum. However, the spotlight is shifting toward projects showing active progress. BlockDAG stands out by delivering results—$214 million raised, 2,380% gains for early participants, and testnet functions already live. As the crypto space starts leaning more on proof than potential, platforms with real-time engagement and clear updates are gaining traction. The increased attention going to BlockDAG shows that investors are watching more than roadmaps—they’re watching performance. And right now, BlockDAG is turning that attention into real support.

The company's most recent acquisition of 22,048 Bitcoin on March 31 brought its total holdings to 528,185 BTC. According to SaylorTracker, Strategy's BTC investment is up by approximately 24%, representing over $8.6 billion in unrealized gains. Strategy continues to accumulate BTC amid the recent market downturn that took Bitcoin's price below the $80,000 level, and the company continues to be closely monitored by BTC investors as a barometer for institutional interest in BTC.

Bitcoin's store-of-value narrative grows despite the recent price decline The current macroeconomic uncertainty from the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China has negatively impacted risk-on assets across the board. Stock markets wiped away trillions in shareholder value in response to Trump's sweeping tariff order, and crypto markets also experienced a deep sell-off. Data from the Total3, an indicator that tracks the market capitalization of the entire crypto sector excluding BTC and Ether ( ETH ), shows that altcoins have collectively shed over 33% of their value since the market peak in December 2024. By comparison, BTC is only down roughly 22% from its peak of over $109,000 in January 2025 and is currently rangebound, trading around the $84,000 level. The Total3 crypto market cap, pictured in blue, compared to the price of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView The price of Bitcoin remained relatively stable amid a $5 trillion sell-off in the stock market, lending credence to Bitcoin's use case as a store-of-value asset as opposed to a risk-on investment. Speaking with Cointelegraph at Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Cypherpunk and CEO of digital asset infrastructure company Blockstream, Adam Back said the macroeconomic pressures from a prolonged trade war would make Bitcoin an increasingly attractive store of value. Back forecasted inflation to surge to 10-15% in the next decade, making real investment returns on traditional asset classes such as stocks and real estate incredibly difficult for market participants. ""There is a real prospect of Bitcoin competing with gold and then starting to take some of the gold use cases,” Back told Cointelegraph managing editor Gareth Jenkinson.

The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $51.49 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $4.00 Market Cap $6.26B Trading Volume $159.84M Circulating Supply 1.56B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $4.12 24-hour Low $3.96 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 5.74% 50-Day SMA $ 4.74 14-Day RSI 43.57 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 18 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $5.98 Polkadot price analysis: DOT sees renewed activity amid network upgrades and market volatility Polkadot is seeing increased on-chain activity driven by network upgrades. DOT is trading in a consolidation range amid market uncertainty. Parachain development and governance engagement are gaining traction. On 13th April, Polkadot (DOT) showed an uptrend, trading at $3.72. The multichain network facilitating cross-chain transfers and interoperability has been showing renewed on-chain activity and community engagement. With recent developments surrounding network upgrades and ecosystem expansion, DOT’s price movement has drawn the attention of traders and long-term holders. Currently, DOT is attempting to hold above key support levels while facing resistance zones that have capped upward momentum. The broader crypto market sentiment, driven by macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin’s price trajectory, significantly influences DOT’s short-term performance. Polkadot on the daily chart: Testing key resistance while holding critical support DOT is consolidating between $6.40 and $7.20, struggling to break the descending resistance trendline. RSI and MACD suggest limited bullish momentum and a daily close above $7.20 is needed to shift bias. During the daily timeframe, DOT trades between $6.40 and $7.20, with the price currently consolidating near the midpoint at around $6.85. The 50-day EMA acts as dynamic resistance, presently intersecting at $6.95, while the 200-day EMA sits higher at $7.45, forming a strong confluence resistance zone. Price action remains trapped between a descending trendline from the February high and a horizontal support from the March low, creating a descending triangle pattern. This structure generally signals bearish continuation unless invalidated by a decisive breakout above the trendline resistance. Polkadot 4-hour chart: Short-term weakness persists below key EMAs The 4-hour chart shows DOT trades below the 20 and 50 EMA, showing local weakness. A reclaim of $6.90 is crucial for bulls, while failure to hold $6.65 could trigger another leg down toward $6.40. Momentum indicators are showing mixed signals. The RSI on the daily chart hovers around 48, signaling a neutral stance but leaning toward a bearish bias due to lower highs. MACD prints a slight bearish crossover with weakening histogram bars, suggesting a potential move lower if volume picks up. The volume profile shows a high-volume node around $6.80, adding weight to the current consolidation area as a critical level. A break above $7.20 with volume confirmation could open a path toward $7.80, while a breakdown below $6.40 may expose $6.00 as the next support. Bulls must reclaim the 50-day EMA with strong follow-through to invalidate short-term bearish risks.

Polkadot (DOT) shows potential as a long-term investment due to its strong focus on interoperability, active development, and a growing ecosystem. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries risk, and its short-term performance remains influenced by broader market conditions. Investors should consider both its technology and market volatility before making decisions. Will Polkadot recover? Polkadot (DOT) shows signs of recovery with a recent upward trend. If positive market conditions continue, Polkadot has the potential to recover. Will Polkadot reach $10? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $10 by 2027. Will Polkadot reach $100? Reaching $100 for Polkadot (DOT) is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Does Polkadot have a good long-term future?

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In December 2024, Polkadot showed signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4. In January 2025, Polkadot peaked at $7.98 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $4.64 – $5.28 in February. As of March, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at approximately $4.30. As of April 2025, Polkadot (DOT) has been experiencing a gradual downtrend, with its price hovering slightly below the $4 mark amid ongoing market volatility.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-13 17:15:00

In the past few weeks, we’ve seen whispers about central banks doubling down on digital currencies, DeFi protocols outpacing traditional finance in capital efficiency, and Ethereum gas fees spiking again as NFT and L2 ecosystems go wild. While mainstream markets are stuck on inflation talk, the crypto world is quietly building a new kind of economic machine. And right there, gaining momentum like it’s been turbocharged, is Qubetics —a Web3 beast that’s racking up presale dollars faster than the big names did in their early days. While others are waiting for Bitcoin’s next move, savvy backers are eyeing the best altcoins to buy in April 2025—and Qubetics, Maker, and Aptos are the ones the sharpest folks keep circling back to. Why? Let’s dive deep. Qubetics: The World’s First Web3 Aggregator Doing Real Work It’s not often a project comes along and smashes it on utility, design, and vision all at once. But Qubetics, currently in its 29th crypto presale stage, is doing just that. The numbers don’t lie—over $16 million raised, 24,600+ token holders, and 507 million $TICS already sold at $0.1573. That’s not just traction—that’s movement. And with real ROI projections of 536% if $TICS hits $1, and over 9,435% if it rockets to $15, the hype isn’t hype—it’s math. But here’s what sets it apart—interoperability. Qubetics isn’t building another isolated blockchain. It’s building digital bridges. Picture this: a logistics business in Brazil integrating Qubetics’ system to connect with both Solana for supply tracking and Ethereum for financial settlements. Or a solo dev in Colombia launching a DeFi app that reads smart contracts from multiple chains without writing separate codebases. That’s life made simpler. Interoperability here doesn’t just mean talking across blockchains—it means real-world plug-and-play functionality for businesses, creators, and even government services. $750 in Qubetics? That’s How You Beat Inflation and Then Some You toss in $750, and you’ve got 4,772 tokens in your stash. If $TICS slides past $10, you’re sitting on $47,720—from less than a grand. That’s tuition, a house deposit, or your exit from paycheck-to-paycheck mode. People talk about missing Bitcoin at $1. This? This is the part where you either repeat history—or rewrite it. Maker: The Quiet Workhorse of DeFi Stability You can’t talk about DeFi without giving Maker some serious respect. This OG protocol—home to the DAI stablecoin—has been doing the unglamorous but critical work of building trust and transparency in decentralized finance since before it was cool. While others popped off with temporary hype, Maker held it down through bear markets and liquidity crunches, earning a reputation as one of the best altcoins to buy in April 2025 if you’re all about reliability with upside. Recently, MakerDAO has rolled out more automated vault strategies and expanded collateral types, making it easier for users across South America to park real-world assets and mint DAI without central bank approval or third-party censorship. It’s about freedom and function. And yes, it’s still a top pick for anyone looking for an alternative to unstable fiat or broken banking systems. And that’s the kind of real-deal energy that keeps old-school Ethereum whales and new backers holding strong. Aptos: Speed Demon With Layer-1 Ambitions Built by former Meta (yep, that Meta) engineers, Aptos came onto the scene swinging. It promised the world blazing-fast Layer-1 transactions, smart contract security via Move programming language, and enough TPS to make even Solana sweat. While its launch was rocky, Aptos has seriously hit its stride in early 2025. Aptos is best known for its sub-1-second transaction finality and solid uptime—two things that really matter when you’re trying to build at scale. Latin American builders, especially those working in real-time fintech and on-chain commerce, are loving the reliability it brings. Aptos is pushing into tokenized finance, digital ID systems, and mobile-first dApps, making it a go-to choice among devs looking for speed without breaking UX. If you’re lining up your April buys, Aptos should absolutely be on your radar. It’s fast, it’s stable, and the adoption data proves it’s not just another VC-fueled flash in the pan. Among all the best altcoins to buy in April 2025, Aptos has earned its place through raw performance and a no-drama execution style. Final Thoughts: Don’t Sleep on What’s Next Crypto ain’t what it was in 2017. It’s no longer just about flipping JPEGs or holding Bitcoin to feel like you’re part of something big. The top tokens right now—Qubetics, Maker, Aptos—are bringing real solutions to broken systems and giving people more control, transparency, and speed in how they deal with money, data, and digital services. But here’s the kicker—Qubetics isn’t just catching up to the big names. It’s building infrastructure that others will rely on. It’s shaping up to be the central hub in a multichain future. If you’re still stuck watching Bitcoin’s chart, you’re looking the wrong way. The action is happening in these rising altcoins, especially with presales like Qubetics offering actual upside. So if you’re even thinking about what the best altcoins to buy in April 2025 are, start there. Because by the time mainstream finance wakes up, the smart money will already be miles ahead. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other altcoins? Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, offering real interoperability across blockchains. It’s focused on helping real businesses, devs, and users deploy multichain apps with ease. Is Aptos still a good buy after its early 2025 run-up? Yep. Aptos has solid user growth, great uptime, and real-world developer traction. It’s one of the best altcoins to buy in April 2025 for long-term use-case adoption. Why is Maker still relevant in 2025? Maker remains DeFi’s backbone. It offers decentralized stablecoin issuance (DAI), solid governance, and has evolved with the times. It’s a consistent performer, not a hype coin.

43296833,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709085,1744565400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43296833.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Better Altcoin Buy Than Ripple (XRP)?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-better-altcoin-buy-than-ripple-xrp/,"MUTM presale has recorded over 8200 Holders and $6.6 million funded in 4 rounds. With 400,000,000 tokens sold overall, the current price of the project is $0.025, which will increase 20% to $0.03 when phase five begins. Those who get in today could make a cool 140% when MUTM lists at $0.06, and analysts are forecasting post-launch increases of anywhere from $1.50 to $3.50 by the end of 2025. While Ripple (XRP) wrestles with a 46% price drop and mass exodus of short-term holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) cuts an alternative figure that is a mix of urgency and concrete growth mechanics. Early Success and Quick Gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on fire in phase four of its presale period, thanks to its tokenomics structure and the buy pressure incentives offered. Phase five will see rate hikes for early backers locking in tokens at higher prices. Transitioning to phase five will increase the token price by 20%, generating immediate paper profits for existing buyers. Initial expectations for performance beyond the launch are set on a conservative assumption of a 140% return based on listing price at $0.06, though independent forecasts are much bolder predicting the token will reach $2.80 by 2025, underpinned by buybacks of profit from Mutuum Finance’s revenue-generating protocols and staking rewards. This is in sharp contrast to Ripple (XRP), which is mired in a bearish channel since January. The road for XRP to recover remains speculative as XRP is the network that drives its adoption where we see signals pointing to a potential bottom, including oversold RSI levels and capitulation of short-term holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) on the other hand drives activity through its lending protocols and mtTokens — the commercial lifeblood of the platform to deliver token value and utility beyond speculation. Built-in Demand and Ecosystem Incentivization Controlled buy-pressure is baked into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s model, avoiding the need to function off market sentiment. Part of the platform fees go to automatic MUTM purchases, redistributing tokens among stakers and liquidity providers. This cycle alleviates sell-side pressure and exalts long-term involvement. To further the initiative, the recent launch of a holder dashboard has added a competitive twist: the top 50 wallets receive bonus tokens, encouraging both accumulation and retention. Ripple (XRP) does not have similar mechanisms. Its label price action is a symptom of much broader uncertainty in that market that has nothing to do with shifts in organic supply demand. Although analysts say the token’s RSI is sufficiently oversold that impulse buying could push it back toward $1.89, that kind of activity is contingent upon external factors such as regulatory developments or the behavior of Bitcoin. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the final stage of a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a move to bolster investor confidence. When completed, results will be provided through official channels consistent with the team’s commitment to transparency. Such a proactive stance is in sharp contrast to the unresolved skepticism surrounding Ripple’s current legal battles which continues to cloud XRP’s fundamentals. Timing with Accuracy & Tactical Advantage Ripple (XRP) might attract traders looking to get on board for short-term spikes (as the uptrend is surely in play), but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a gem with a clear trajectory for appreciation. As phase four sells out quicker than previous phases, the opportunity to buy tokens below $0.03 is closing. MUTM’s presale structure—combining urgency, utility, and audited security—will only become harder for investors to ignore, who are weighing a double-digit ROI against speculative swings. Mutuum (MUTM) very much views itself as a DeFi project, a product that is likely to vie for a fixed liquidity advantage that it can translate into strategic advantages against fair-weather behemoths like XRP.

The network is known for its speed and ability to handle many transactions simultaneously. It is seen as a helpful tool for fixing outdated financial systems. Crypto and business expert Olivia Vande Woude believes that Avalanche will play a big role in the future of mainstream finance. In a recent X post , she said that Avalanche is not trying to replace current systems but to improve them. Avalanche To Improve Old Financial Systems According to Woude, one of Avalanche’s biggest benefits is helping old systems like SWIFT and Fedwire work better. Banks use these systems to send and receive large payments, but they can be slow and costly. Avalanche can make these systems faster and more efficient by allowing real-time settlement and better liquidity. This means money can move more quickly and with fewer delays. Avalanche can also improve trade settlement, the process of confirming and recording trades. Currently, it is slow and has too many steps. Woude believes Avalanche can make it faster and reduce mistakes. This would improve the system’s performance and lower the time and cost of each trade. Avalanche Can Improve Trading for Big Exchanges Big financial exchanges like CBOE and ICE often have issues with trade delays and price changes. Woude thinks Avalanche’s fast and decentralized system can solve this. With Avalanche, these exchanges could get faster trade execution, lower costs, and more accurate prices. This would benefit both the exchanges and their customers. Custodians, companies that hold and protect financial assets, still use slow batch processing systems. Woude says Avalanche can bring safer and faster methods to manage these assets. Avalanche’s smart contracts can also contribute to the derivatives market. The network can help with better margin calculation and risk management. As U.S. financial rules continue to change, many banks and companies are turning to tokenization. Woude says Avalanche is well-suited for this task. Its tools can help manage liquidity and reduce risk in funding operations. AVAX Makes Ethereum Faster For ETFs The protocol is compatible with Ethereum blocks. This means institutions can still use their existing smart contracts while gaining the benefits of a faster network. Interestingly, Ethereum spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have been approved for options trading. Avalanche could also help create on-chain financial products that follow ETF performance. Likewise, it can provide permissioned chains that follow financial rules, giving institutions the necessary control and compliance. Avalanche’s role in traditional finance has helped increase the popularity of its token AVAX in the crypto market. The digital asset has increased by 1.38% in the past 24 hours, trading at $19.20. Its daily trading volumes have soared by 7%, showing growing interest from large investors and institutions.

In a formal written question to Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson, Nordin proposed a strategic change to Sweden’s reserve policy, not by purchasing Bitcoin directly, but by preserving BTC assets that have been seized by authorities such as the police or customs authorities. The investigation, listed under file number 2024/25:997, requires the government to respond by April 16. Nordin said Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and role as a hedge against inflation could benefit Sweden’s financial resilience. He drew on international examples, noting the growing interest in digital assets by U.S. states and federal agencies, where Bitcoin is seen as a modern equivalent to gold in times of geopolitical and economic volatility. Related News: Ripple (XRP) Price at Critical Crossroads: Analyst Says What It Takes to Rally to $2.5 “Bitcoin is already used globally as a method of payment and a hedge against hyperinflation,” Nordin said. “In authoritarian regimes, it provides individuals with a way to store value beyond state control.” The lawmaker argued that Sweden could take a budget-neutral approach by holding the confiscated Bitcoin instead of cashing it out — a model already implemented by some U.S. agencies — which would allow Sweden to accumulate a strategic digital asset reserve without the need for taxpayer-funded purchases or additional tax burdens. Currently, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, holds a conservative portfolio, mainly consisting of foreign currencies and gold. Nordin called on the government to reconsider its reserve strategy in light of evolving global financial instruments and trends. The Ministry of Finance has yet to make a statement on the proposal, and it remains unclear whether the government will consider changing the Riksbank's mandate to include Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $0.6223 Market Cap $769.62M Trading Volume $178.46M Circulating Supply 1.23B WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 Sep 13, 2023 24-hour High $0.7375 24-hour Low $0.6182 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 2.69 (229.67%) Volatility 11.42% 50-Day SMA $ 1.070994 14-Day RSI 41.37 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Worldcoin price analysis: WLD slides below $0.77 amid renewed market pressure The price dropped to $0.7617, reflecting a 2.43% decline, with sellers taking control below the $0.77 level. Lower highs, weakening volume, and failure to hold $0.77 suggest a move toward the $0.73 demand zone if $0.76 breaks. A falling trendline and rejection from $0.79 cap gains, with $0.755 as the next key support. On 13th April, Worldcoin (WLD) showed a downtrend, trading at $0.7617 at the time of writing, marking a 2.43% drop in the last 24 hours. The token recorded a daily low of $0.7604 and a high of $0.7904, showing limited upward momentum and renewed bearish sentiment. The recent dip placed WLD below the $0.77 psychological threshold as sellers reclaimed short-term control. The token’s price movement was affected by broader market uncertainty and limited buyer participation. Despite a rating of 4.3 stars and availability across multiple blockchain networks, WLD faced downward pressure, as seen on the Ethereum chain. Analytics data excluded WLD tokens held on Optimism or World Chain, reducing visibility into total token distribution. This limitation may hinder market transparency for investors and influence short-term decisions. Worldcoin on the daily timeframe: Bearish bias strengthens below $0.77 On the daily chart, WLD opened around the $0.7808 mark but failed to sustain momentum above the $0.79 resistance level. The price action showed consistent lower highs, indicating weakening bullish attempts and a clear dominance of sellers. Each recovery was met with selloffs, causing a breakdown below the $0.77 mark, where WLD consolidates. The inability to reclaim this level signals weakness and adds pressure to retest lower support zones. Worldcoin on the 4-hour timeframe: Consolidation continues below key resistance The 4-hour chart reveals a rejection from $0.79 followed by lower highs, confirming a bearish short-term bias. Buyers failed to maintain support at $0.77, triggering further declines toward the $0.76 level. The bearish structure is supported by fading volume and lower peak formations. A decisive close below the $0.76 mark could open the path toward the $0.73 demand zone. Conversely, if bulls push above $0.785, a short-term recovery could be possible, targeting $0.80. However, the broader trend remains bearish if the price trades below $0.79. Key support lies at $0.7604, while resistance holds at $0.7904.

Worldcoin (WLD) currently shows no bullish signs, with the price trading below the $0.77 support level and facing rejection at $0.79. Lower highs, fading volume, and a bearish trend on both daily and 4-hour charts suggest further downside risk toward $0.73 if $0.76 fails. Limited transparency due to excluded token data on Optimism and World Chain adds uncertainty, making WLD a high-risk asset at current levels. Will Worldcoin recover? The current WLD’s price action shows volatility and a slight recovery, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may have the potential for recovery. However, future performance will depend on the crypto market conditions and investor sentiment. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, as it would require substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. What will be the value of Worldcoin in 2025 Based on current trends and market conditions, Worldcoin’s average value is predicted to be $1.05, with the potential to reach a high of $2.58 by 2025. Does Worldcoin have a good long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; the token may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

DOGE’s price has decreased by over 5% in the previous 24 hours alone following a loss of control over a vital support level. Given the generally unfavorable market attitude influencing the crypto industry, DOGE’s market view seems bleak, with a price of about $0.166. Source: Tradingview The trading volume of Dogecoin has also dropped sharply to its lowest point in 2025. This suggests that traders and investors are losing interest because it relies on speculative trading and lacks practical use. Should DOGE continue to fall below the $0.166 threshold, it may have a further decline of 18%, bringing it down to $0.136. This drop implies that much of Dogecoin’s time in the public may be gone, so it becomes less appealing approaching April The sentiment of Dogecoin (DOGE) is declining as the crypto market moves into April 2025. Two more altcoins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Rexas Finance (RXS) , are under praise as the finest crypto bets approaching April. For the following reasons, these two assets have been hailed as main prospects for us into April 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is positioned as a strong new participant in the cryptocurrency market, as many investors are still reeling from DOGE’s poor price action. Rexas Finance is transforming the idea of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), including real estate, commodities, and financial instruments, unlike Dogecoin, which is essentially motivated by speculation and meme culture. Rexas has become somewhat popular and well-known by giving investors access to historically illiquid markets. With Rexas Finance’s tokenizing strategy, anyone can invest in highly valuable assets. With Rexas, for instance, an investor might have a fraction of a $10 million real estate property for just a few hundred dollars, therefore democratizing access to markets valued at trillions of dollars. Particularly in sectors like real estate, where tokenization may offer liquidity and flexibility, this creative approach to asset management has the ability to upend sectors. Rexas Finance has reacted well in its presale since its September 2024 introduction. In Stage 12, the project’s token price reflects a 567% rise from $0.03 to $0.20. $47,582,031 has already been raised, and the presale is nearly 91% sold out. With around 50,000 active RXS holders, Rexas is surrounded by constant FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Rexas Finance offers investors the chance to create passive income with its range of DeFi services, including staking, yield farming, and liquidity pooling. While the Rexas Launchpad provides early-stage investment opportunities for high-potential entrepreneurs, the project’s Rexas Token Builder system lets users quickly build and manage blockchain assets. With an initial listing price of $0.25, Rexas will debut on elite exchanges in June 2025. After the listing, experts estimate a 20,000% price rise; hence, RXS is among the most promising cryptocurrencies to purchase before the presale concludes. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Conversely, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also shown indications of a positive comeback. Following several months of falling price action, SHIB has broken free from its downward trend and is set for a 154% increase. From its intra-month low, SHIB has already demonstrated a robust rebound of 19%; analysts predict it may reach notable resistance levels in the not-too-distant future. The present price action points Shiba Inu toward a target resistance level of $0.0000328. Analyzers predict more price rises toward $0.00003514 as SHIB keeps gathering strength, indicating the beginning of a new bull run. With many long-term holders showing increased activity, the 784.24 trillion SHIB tokens represent great investor confidence. Another element influencing the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s capacity for a breakout is its expansion. Network activity on the coin has surged as support levels point to SHIB perhaps about to make major gains. While DOGE has a pessimistic view and is dropping volume, SHIB is gaining momentum, setting itself up for a significant price increase in 2025. Conclusion: A Shift Away from Dogecoin Rexas Finance and Shiba Inu are becoming more appealing substitutes as DOGE maintains a bearish attitude and its price stays around important support levels. While Shiba Inu shows indications of a bullish reversal that could result in significant price rises, Rexas Finance is revolutionizing crypto investment by tokenizing actual assets. Both of these altcoins show great growth potential as we enter April 2025; hence, they are top candidates for investors looking to diversify from Dogecoin and seize fresh prospects in the changing bitcoin market.

A familiar bullish pattern has formed, and if validated, it could drive the price to a level not seen in recent weeks. This new development was highlighted by popular analyst Titan of Crypto on social media platform X. Pattern Breakout Sets $143 In Sight Like every other large market-cap cryptocurrency, Solana has experienced an extended period of price crashes since late February. In the case of Solana, this price crash has been drawing out since January, when it reached an all-time high of $293 during the euphoria surrounding the Official Trump meme coin. Since then, Solana has corrected massively, even reaching a low of $97 on April 7. Related Reading: Bitcoin Maxi Takes Aim: Ethereum’s True Value? Lower Than You Think The price action before and after this $97 low has created an interesting formation on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart. As crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted, this formation is enough to send Solana back up to $143. At the heart of the latest bullish outlook is a clearly defined inverse head and shoulders structure, which is known for its reliability in signaling a reversal from a downtrend to a bullish breakout. The left shoulder of the pattern began forming in early April as Solana attempted to rebound from sub-$110 levels. The subsequent drop to the $96 bottom on April 7 formed the head of the structure. From there, a recovery started as buyers cautiously stepped back in, giving rise to the right shoulder. The breakout of the neckline resistance has taken place in the past 24 hours. With this in mind, Titan of Crypto predicted that $143 becomes the next logical destination based on the measured move from the head to the neckline. Image From X: Titan of Crypto Momentum Strengthens With Structure Confirmation Looking at the chart shared by the analyst, the momentum behind Solana’s price movement appears to be gaining strength. Trading volume is an important metric in evaluating the strength of a breakout, and the volume accompanying the recent breakout above the neckline seemingly confirms it. Particularly, Solana has seen a 5.3% increase in its price during the past 24 hours, with trading volume surging by 3.76% within this timeframe to $4.21 billion. Although it is common to see a throwback or minor consolidation just above the neckline, the projected path suggests continued upside as long as price action holds above that key breakout zone.

A move to $143 would not only represent a meaningful recovery from April’s lows but could also improve the confidence in Solana’s price trajectory moving into Q2. The next outlook is what happens after it reaches this target of $143, which will depend on the general market sentiment.

However, with the maturity of the crypto market and investors analyzing their portfolios, many high-net-worth individuals and institutional players are starting to question the long-term sustainability value of Shiba Inu. This token is being added to the list of cryptocurrencies with the rise of more innovative and practical projects, such as Rexas Finance (RXS) . Let’s examine why multi-millionaire investors shift their focus from SHIB to Rexas Finance. Reason 1: Shiba Inu’s Lack of Real Utility Rexas Finance is gaining attention in Inu’s fall from grace due to Shiba Inu’s lack of real utility. In addition, Shiba Inu has to face accusations of having too many reward tokens. Rexas Finance served as a backup currency to Shiba Inu for a while. Shiba Inu was taken less seriously when it gained more memes and attention. Shiba Inu has achieved attention but cannot offer tangible long-term value. Unlike other companies, Rexas Finance has stepped forward to capitalize on new market gaps by implementing a highly revolutionary model – tokenizing tangible assets. Rexas Finance is overcoming a massive barrier in the market by enabling investors to possess tokenized representations of tangible assets, which include, but are not limited to, real estate, luxuries, and commodities. The concept of tokenization can transform old-age industries by introducing new dimensions of liquidity and fractionalized ownership of economically significant valuables previously deemed uneconomical to invest in by the general public. Institutional investors and rich investors are heeding the appeal of more utility-driven projects. Rexas Finance’s tokenization brings traditional assets into the realm of blockchain, which enables the possibility of embracing digitized assets with real-world characteristics. High-net-worth individuals have high hopes for this innovative financing, which is a much more appealing choice than investing in Shiba Inu. Reason 2: How the Market Instability and Opacity of Meme Coins Impacts Investment Decisions Volatility and lack of clarity within meme coins is another reason why Shiba Inu is losing popularity among millionaire investors. Mimetic currencies such as SHIB are prone to abrupt price changes that are oftentimes more influenced by social media hype, celebrity speculation, and value-less purchases instead of any efforts or technological development. Even though such things can help investors make a lot of money very quickly, the uncertainty makes these coins very risky for anyone who wants to make a profit over a longer, more extended in a stable economy. On the contrary, Rexas Finance concentrates on real-world assets to provide a more secure and stable investment model. Using blockchain technology to represent tangible assets, Rexas Finance tokens cannot be separated from real-world economic factors. For investors needing more predictability and stability, the model Rexas Finance provides secures them in ways that meme coins like Shiba Inu cannot. Rexas Finance has an exceptional edge due to its ability to tokenize assets. It steps away from the volatile pricing of meme coins and builds value based on the actual performance of physical assets. Meme coins are surrounded by speculative bubbles, which exhaust investors, leading them to shift their focus toward Rexas Finance’s more substantial and viable long-term projects. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Viable Alternative For Wealthy Investors Rexas Finance is emerging as a cryptocurrency to watch as millionaires look for intelligent, long-term investments. Asset tokenization is more than just speculation; is an innovation in creating efficient, safe, and transparent markets. This singular characteristic places Rexas Finance well above meme coins, which lack sustainability and a definable purpose. Rexas Finance has also backed its revolutionary approach to blockchain with meticulous tokenomics and a well-defined plan. The presale of RXS has already raised over 47.5 million dollars, indicating investor support. With the token currently priced at 20 cents during the presale phase and expected to list at 25 cents on June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance highly appeals to investors focused on both short—and long-term returns. Investors who purchase early may benefit from what will become a transformative change in the financial sector. Rexas plans to position itself as a frontrunner in asset-backed cryptocurrencies. The power to buy functional assets through their tokenized versions could transform trillions of invaluable assets into untapped value. Conclusion By 2025, we observe that millionaire investors no longer find speculative investments appealing. While Shiba Inu fails to showcase its enduring value, Rexas Finance presents a striking, innovative substitute poised to transform the cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets. Rexas Finance is tackling the problem of fractional ownership and liquidity by focusing on real-world asset tokenization, creating an opportunity for early investors to reap substantial benefits. Rexas Finance is the best choice when looking to move beyond meme coins, providing the chance to diversify portfolios. It’s the best option due to its utility and transparency, and it boasts potential value in the ever-growing cryptocurrency space, proving it is ideal for investors hoping to establish a commanding position in the future.

Issued by Web3 infrastructure firm WLFI, USD1 appears to be gaining traction in the digital asset ecosystem. DWF Labs now holds a substantial $6 million of USD1, which puts it just behind Wintermute, the current leader among institutional holders, in terms of total on-chain holdings of the stablecoin. DWF Labs 已成为 WLFI 推出美元稳定币 $USD1 的链上持仓 TOP2 机构，目前持有 600 万枚 USD1 既 04.03 收到 100 万枚稳定币后，9 小时前再次在 BSC 网络收到 500 万枚 USD1，随后跨链至以太坊主网 做市地址： https://t.co/D5OPTWvRRg 本文由 #Gateio | @Gateio_zh 赞助 pic.twitter.com/q9L0PCBW7a — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) April 12, 2025 DWF Labs’ holdings have surged, following a recent large transaction that transpired in two distinct stages. On April 3, the firm received an initial tranche of $1 million in USD1. Then, approximately nine hours ago, an additional $5 million in USD1 was sent to DWF Labs through the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. In a deft cross-chain move, the funds were then sent to the Ethereum mainnet, where DWF Labs appears to be consolidating its holdings. USD1 Gaining Institutional Traction USD1, WLFI’s flagship USD-pegged stablecoin, has gained steady momentum since its launch, mainly due to rising institutional interest. This latest movement by DWF Labs is yet another expression of the growing confidence in USD1 as a stable digital asset, not just in DeFi, but in the wider crypto space. What makes USD1 appealing are its solid infrastructure and cross-chain capabilities, which allow it to move easily among all the major blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum and BSC. 此外，Wintermute 应为 USD1 链上持仓 TOP1 机构 目前四个地址累计持有 5700 万枚 USD1，是 DWF Labs 持仓规模的 9.5 倍 持仓地址 https://t.co/5M6sr1P166 https://t.co/3DUHCXIwE5 https://t.co/AeOxORu0y0 https://t.co/7OYXuGVNon pic.twitter.com/VbU4vXbY5s — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) April 12, 2025 Even though DWF Labs’ current holdings are amazing by themselves, a bigger picture becomes evident when we look at other groups of people. One group—four connected addresses—holds a ridiculous amount of money: a staggering $57 million in USD1. This is nearly 9.5 times larger than DWF Labs’ current holdings, and it is a classic case of institutional involvement backing that stablecoin. It is thought that the top holder of USD1 among these four addresses is Wintermute, a well-known player in the digital asset world and a provider of market-making and liquidity services. This addresses substantial exposure seems to signify that Wintermute has a high degree of trust in the stablecoin’s long-term viability and utility. The identities of the other three addresses have not been publicly confirmed, but they too are presumed to be of substantial crypto financial influence. Transferring big buckets of USD1 through BSC and Ethereum also underlines WLFI’s commitment to interoperability and its flexible stablecoin, of which cross-chain transfers are a part. It makes USD1 all the more suitable a central trading pair for decentralized exchanges. Implications for the Stablecoin Landscape The concentration of USD1 among elite trading firms such as Wintermute and DWF Labs holds a mirror up to a deeper trend of institutional engagement with the stablecoin market. As parallel developments see traditional, centralized stablecoins like USDC come under fresh regulatory scrutiny, more decentralized or semi-decentralized options like USD1 are likely to capture even greater investor interest. In addition, the small number of addresses holding a high concentration of assets suggests that USD1 could become a go-to liquidity tool in the DeFi and centralized trading ecosystems. Its attractiveness is further buoyed by WLFI’s tech setup, which is all about security, speed, and scalability across the many blockchain networks of a multichain world. Right now, everyone is focusing on DWF Labs and Wintermute as they keep working on the initial distribution and market dynamics of USD1. With $57 million in total spread across the four largest wallets and increasing, USD1 is fast establishing a major presence in the stablecoin arena—one with solid institutional backing and a major long-term play. The stablecoin environment keeps changing, which means that it watches closely some of the projects in its midst. Of these, USD1 may be the one that is followed most intently, not least because its adoption is starting to look a lot like that of DWF Labs and Wintermute, whose early successes in the space have made those outfits something to watch.

Just two hours ago, WLFI allocated $775,000 to acquiring approximately 4.894 million SEI tokens, entering at an average price of $0.158 per token. This latest acquisition showcases WLFI’s bold investment moves, conducted against a backdrop of considerable unrealized losses. By a straightforward count, WLFI has thus far deployed a truly staggering $344 million into a selection of 11 different tokens, all of which (except for ENA) are counted among the most lucrative and highly valued assets in the crypto economy. No one in crypto circles considers TRON or AAVE to be slouches, and Chainlink and Move rank up there among the most highly traded tokens in the business. 特朗普家族支持的 DeFi 项目 WLFI 在 2 小时前增加了 $SEI 的购买：77.5 万 U 购买了 489.4 万枚 SEI，价格 $0.158。 到目前为止，WLFI 投资组合总共是花了 3.44 亿 U 配置购买了 11 种代币：ETH/WBTC/TRX/LINK/AAVE/ENA/MOVE/ONDO/SEI/AVAX/MNT。 而这些代币目前的总价值为 $2.01 亿，整体浮亏… pic.twitter.com/fnVXwy3TsB — 余烬 (@EmberCN) April 12, 2025 Deep in the Red: WLFI’s Portfolio Takes a Hit Even with the diversified nature of its holdings, the WLFI portfolio has performed poorly. Its digital assets currently total about $201 million. This means that the portfolio has an unrealized loss of $143 million, or 41%, written on it. That amounts to almost half of the investment capital just sitting there, lighted and framed, in the WLFI art vault. The main part of this loss comes from WLFI being invested in Ethereum. Once the clear leader in smart contract platforms, ETH accounts for a $112 million hole in WLFI’s portfolio. It’s hard to say exactly when WLFI bought ETH and at what price, but the size of this loss suggests that the token was a major buy during the last crypto bull run. Other tokens in the portfolio have also experienced varying levels of depreciation, though not nearly to the extent we’ve seen with ETH. Notably, recent purchases such as SEI—despite its high-risk, high-reward nature as a still-developing blockchain and a burgeoning ecosystem—remain under pressure from the current market. With broader market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty still affecting the crypto sector, WLFI’s audacious investment strategy has resulted in substantial losses that we have not yet recognized. Nevertheless, the project still continues to double down. Its latest bet, the 775,000 SEI buy, seems to reflect a conviction in SEI’s future utility and potential price recovery. With the altcoin market in general so weak, why would a venture like WLFI bet anything on an altcoin like SEI? The answer may lie in SEI’s apparent long-term appeal, which comes not from its present success but from its focus on attempting to solve what its backers seem to believe are some long-standing problems with cryptocurrency trading and with the kinds of applications that run on blockchains. Strategic Accumulation or Miscalculated Risk? WLFI’s ongoing investments prompt certain key queries about the project’s overall strategy and how much risk it’s willing to absorb. Having the Trump family as part of this venture adds a whole new layer of political and public interest to its choices—both because of the visibility it provides and the amount of scrutiny that’s bound to come with it. But right now, WLFI seems to have adopted a high-risk, high-reward investment style, pushing ahead in assembling a digital portfolio no matter what state the market happens to be in. Whether this strategy will pay off remains to be seen. If the market rebounds and sentiment improves, the deeply discounted valuations at which WLFI has acquired many of its tokens could prove to be advantageous. However, should the crypto market remain range-bound or continue to slide, WLFI’s massive capital commitments may further deteriorate in value, placing it in an increasingly precarious position. Even with losses, WLFI keeps moving. This shows a belief in the long-term viability of DeFi and Web3. Its latest investment in SEI might be seen as both a calculated risk and a vote of confidence in the underlying technology of the project. WLFI is yet to face a major challenge, with a total of $344 million deployed in the crypto space stretching from WLFI’s inception across a series of initial coin offerings, an increasingly popular method of raising capital that has in recent months drawn scrutiny. Of that amount, $143 million appears to be lost, with the total claimable at any one time looking to be less than half that amount, since claims on even the $143 million cannot be made at all until any judgment is reached on the appeal that is in the works.

About six hours ago, they unstaked and spread across 22 separate addresses 186,000 SOL tokens valued at about $21.56 million. This follows a long-established pattern of on-the-10th-of-the-month moves that increasingly look like a systematic, strategic unwind of SOL holdings.

This view is supported by the historical record of past transactions, which shows a clear trend: when FTX and Alameda send Solana to other addresses, those addresses almost always send the Solana on to centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. Market analysts watch these movements closely, and for good reason. They happen to precede some of the biggest sell-offs in Solana that we have seen all year. A Billion-Dollar Exit Strategy Starting in November 2023, the estate of FTX/Alameda has executed transfers with notable consistency. In total, they have unstaked and staked back to the system 8.031 million SOL tokens. At current valuations, that represents about $1.03 billion. The transfers into the centralized exchanges have occurred at an average price of $128.30 per SOL token. With the price of SOL ranging from about $108 to $148 during the various phases of this market, these transfers do not seem to correlate with some kind of artificial price movement. They simply appear to be regular transfers. Despite being intended to maximize recovery amounts for creditors, the series of large-scale redemptions from the FTX estate have vexed SOL holders and traders. It’s definitely not a good look when you’re trying to maintain the price of an asset. Each time creditors cash out, they do so with substantial amounts of SOL. Pressing the sell button on FTX’s preferred asset is the very definition of a red flag. These funds are supposed to go to judges, attorneys, and creditors, not to FTX execs and SOL ding-a-lings. I mean really: Who in their right mind would work this hard for the creditors if they weren’t already cruising for a big payoff?! As it stands, FTX/Alameda controls a considerable amount of staked SOL, which amounts to 5.359 million tokens. That is worth about a half a billion dollars. And, if you can believe it, this is a picture of what we have left. Meaning, if I were FTX, I would be doing what you see in the picture above. In other words, don’t expect this part of the Recovery Plan to be completed anytime soon. Expect the going-concern nature of FTX to be factored into the picture of what comes next. The digital assets held by FTX have been steadily liquidated since the exchange’s spectacular collapse in November 2022. Billions in frozen user funds were tied up across trading accounts at the time. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s financial mismanagement and the global fallout from it have been the main story of the last eight months. While the court cases move forward, though, the estate of the exchange has been granted permission to sell off digital assets to pay back creditors. And if I’m doing the fractions correctly, the SOL represents one of the largest individual holdings in FTX’s pre-bankruptcy portfolio. Implications for the Solana Ecosystem These SOL liquidations occurring en masse and in a steady flow have complicated matters for the overall Solana ecosystem. Although, in other respects, things seem to be on an upward trajectory for Solana—network expansion, developer involvement, and observable on-chain activity all move in the right direction—the unfailing flow of unstaked SOL into exchanges means Solana’s native asset is still working its way back from the low it hit as part of the fallout from its unfortunate close association with FTX. FTX’s implosion caused a significant blow to Solana’s reputation. Sam Bankman-Fried and his companies were invested heavily in Solana; they endorsed it. However, in the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, Solana has attempted to rebuild some trust. Still, it is tarnished by the association with FTX. And this is not to mention that many moves in Solana’s price are clearly tethered to moves in the prices of FTX’s other former holdings. The impact of these liquidations on SOL’s future price trajectory has begun to be modeled by analysts. Even though the average realized price from FTX/Alameda’s historical transfers of $128.30 doesn’t look like it’s significantly undercutting the market, the volume involved in each batch of monthly liquidations remains sufficiently large to unsettle short-term sentiment. For the time being, market participants and commentators will be watching closely the 22 addresses that just received the newest installment of 186,000 SOL. If we take precedent into account, those wallets may soon direct a substantial portion of the tokens to cryptocurrency exchanges, which would further boost the SOL sell-side narrative. As FTX’s bankruptcy estate moves close to attaining its aim of maximizing asset recovery, Solana’s market journey keeps on being molded not just by technological progress but by the legacy holdings of one of crypto’s most notorious collapses.

The memecoin, which combines politically charged satire with viral internet culture, has quickly amassed a $15 million market capitalization and racked up a staggering $28 million in trading volume. Just 6 hours post-launch, Solana memecoin $BANG has surged 30,000%, hitting a $15M market cap with $28M in volume. $BANG is a satire-driven meme token themed around resisting U.S. hegemony and Chinese narratives, inspired by memes linked to Chinese diplomatic channels. … pic.twitter.com/DJcCOooRaY — Followin (@followin_io) April 12, 2025 Started in the early hours of the day, $BANG wasted no time in reaching retail traders, meme lovers, and degens across the strange universe of crypto. Its rapid price ascent—$BANG was just listed at press time, after all—speaks to the persistent power of meme-driven narratives and their ability to mesmerize market participants across all segments. $BANG is, in fact, a case study in how to not make a new token. Geopolitical Satire Meets Crypto Frenzy $BANG is set apart from all the other memecoins by a distinctly political edge. The token resists U.S. hegemony while mocking the geopolitical messaging of China. It draws direct inspiration from the meme content that is often seen in Chinese diplomacy and social media. This $BANG token is a very tongue-in-cheek way of saying, “East versus West, in blockchain culture too!” And a wide range of crypto natives who thrive on irony and spectacle really seem to enjoy it. Within hours of the launch, the branding and meme-inspired energy of $BANG was circulating rapidly on X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and among Solana communities. Memes featuring our panda mascot, references to “wolf warrior” diplomacy, and visual shots at global superpowers became the token’s informal marketing campaign, and early adopters seemed to be in a frenzy of FOMO (fear of missing out). The creators of the token seem to be entirely embracing the premise’s absurdity. The project has a satirical nature that straddles the line between political parody and chaos marketing, a mix that has historically worked quite well in the memecoin sector. And in a way, that makes sense, considering that the token is a kind of Internet-born offspring, like those tokens that have come before it. Even though $BANG has an unconventional subject matter, its technical rollout shows signs of serious coordination. The token was seeded with liquidity pronto, and it got listed on two centralized exchanges—LBank and MEXC—almost as quickly as it had gotten in the gate. These were solid, momentum-building moves for $BANG. A Flash in the Pan or the Next Meme Titan? Similar to all explosive memecoin introductions, the current issue with $BANG is whether it can maintain the kind of positive forward motion that sees upward-trending tokens safely escape the gravitational pull of token downturns. The very early price performance of $BANG was stellar and took the project to the front lines of memecoins. By our reckoning, however, $BANG is not a memecoin inside a meme universe. Nevertheless, $BANG has a potential edge because of its cultural playbook. Instead of being a community and humor-driven generic meme token, it places value on a narrative twist and ties itself to principles of global power dynamics and political internet memes. It is not your run-of-the-mill meme project. This could lend the project more staying power in a group of identical meme plays if it doesn’t fizzle out in the next bull run. Currently, $BANG’s market cap is $15 million, which is quite remarkable considering it was a microcap only a few hours before we started writing this. Trading volume has surged to $28 million, which means there are a lot of people who are interested in $BANG and a lot of liquidity available for it. By all accounts, $BANG’s market cap is as respectable as the liquidity profile of some mid-cap tokens. It is unclear whether $BANG will flame out as quickly as it started or become a favorite among the invest-in-humor set. What is clear, however, is that the memecoin meta is not done yet, and that with $BANG, we have further evidence of how, in the right circumstances, even the most ridiculous of tokens can prove just how protean and lucrative the crypto space remains.

While Solana increased by 6.12% and Fartcoin increased 2.55% after President Trump announced suspending U.S. tariffs on China, investors are elsewhere. These increases have sparked discussion about what tokens are ready to break out—Solana, Fartcoin and Remittix (RTX) happen to be taking all the steam of that discussion. While market responses tend to be fleeting, investors are wondering if these two assets will keep up momentum or if some other new star could outrun them in April. Solana Bounces Back Strong—But Is It the Best Crypto to Invest in Today? Solana continues to surprise following its recent surge to $123.03, with the trading volume increasing to over $4 billion. Most see this as a vote of confidence in the scalability of the network and its ability to host high-performing decentralized applications. With a market capitalization of $63.6 billion, SOL remains one of the most dominant Layer 1 chains. But even with these firm foundations, Solana still struggles with pressure from network outages and centralization concerns. Traders praise its performance but question whether this growth is sustainable or if it’s a temporary spike brought about by macroeconomic relief. That’s where Remittix steps in. With its payments-first approach and real-world adoption, it gives a more solid narrative for long-term growth. While Solana is the leader in velocity, Remittix gives solidity and cross-border usability, and these are gaining popularity as markets shift towards utility-based investing. Fartcoin Receives a Boost—But Speculation Still Prevails Fartcoin ‘s quirky name and its robust community helped it surge to $0.8859, with over $369 million daily trade value. The brief rallies in the meme space are the characteristic trait, and Fartcoin is no exception. Under the driving force of internet publicity, it shoots up whenever there are major news stories, like this recent tariff stoppage. But from jokes and short-term popularity alone, it’s difficult to rank Fartcoin as one of the leading cryptos to invest in today. While profits will be real, the fundamentals are poor, and volatility will be highly likely. Without a clear roadmap or long-term use, Fartcoin will fade away when the shine goes out. Meanwhile, Remittix has sold over 528 million tokens and has raised almost $14.5 million in presale. That kind of sustained support speaks volumes. Unlike meme coins, Remittix is not dependent on temporary headlines—it provides long-term value with its crypto-to-fiat solutions, making it a more intelligent option for investors who see beyond the hype. Why Remittix Tops the List of Best Cryptos to Buy Right Now Remittix is not just a hit altcoin—it’s becoming the cornerstone of the next payments revolution. Its PayFi ecosystem allows instant crypto-to-fiat conversion, solving a massive pain point for businesses and individuals who work across borders. Picture a small African logistics company that is paid by clients in the U.S. and EU. Traditional transfers take days and are very expensive. Using Remittix, they are paid in cryptocurrency and converted to local currency within seconds, without unexpected fees or delays. This smooth sail is what keeps Remittix different. Where Solana and Fartcoin take turns in creating bubbles, Remittix delivers solid value. Already over 528 million tokens sold, and that market price now standing at $0.0734 indicates tremendous investor confidence. While the global demand for remittances goes up and pay tokens like XRP and XLM are setting the world on fire, Remittix finds itself well poised to be in the vanguard of this latest trend. And while investors are looking for projects with utility, Remittix has risen to the top of the best cryptos to buy lists. Is the Tariff Pause a Turning Point or Just Noise? President Trump’s tariff pause announcement has sent a wave of bullish sentiment into the market. The market partyed, but savvy investors are cautious. These kinds of announcements usually produce short-term pumps, but the real test will be in the weeks to come. Solana’s pop and Fartcoin’s spike could be short-term responses to the tariff news. Both tokens could rebound once the hype dies down—especially Fartcoin, which relies on meme momentum rather than fundamentals. Meanwhile, Remittix keeps on rising, regardless of external policy changes. Its rise is organic, based on the solution of real-world issues. That’s why so many traders already consider it not only a hot presale, but one of the best cryptos to invest in today for short- and long-term profit. Want a token that’s more than hype? Remittix is worth checking out and seeing why it’s sitting at the top of investor watchlists worldwide.

The company has added 80,785 BTC to its balance sheet since the beginning of the year after raising a total of $7.69 billion during the first quarter, with over half of that coming from common stock sales. Most, if not all, of those funds were used to buy bitcoin. On Sunday, Saylor posted a BTC holdings tracker to X, a move that typically precedes a purchase announcement, commenting there are “no tariffs on orange dots.” The comment implies the company’s BTC purchases were unaffected by the reciprocal tariffs Donald Trump introduced earlier this month and the ensuing U.S.-China trade war. The company paused its buying during the week ending April 6. Its crypto stash is currently worth roughly $44.59 billion, and was acquired for $35.63 billion.

43297864,https://nulltx.com/?p=147963,1744568000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ondo ($ONDO) Secures Binance Listing as Investor Confidence Grows in Top RWA Protocol,https://nulltx.com/ondo-ondo-secures-binance-listing-as-investor-confidence-grows-in-top-rwa-protocol/,"In another big step forward for the quickly expanding Real World Asset sector, Ondo Finance’s native token, $ONDO , now stands on the world’s largest crypto exchange. Confirmed by Binance, the listing set to go live on April 11, 2025, has already sent market participants into a frenzy of excitement. Generally, in the crypto world, listings on prominent exchanges carry a kind of clout that can help raise a project’s profile and even pump up its price. The choice to have Binance list $ONDO comes on the heels of a prosperous round of community voting, which gives a further boost to the token’s burgeoning reputation in decentralized finance and among Wall Street players. Yet, it was not so long ago that Ondo Finance expressed its hope for 2019 to 2022 in a tweet and actually had its initial DAO governance proposal in 2019 rejected. $ONDO Gains Momentum as RWA Market Leader $ONDO is not simply caught up in the latest exchange buzz—it has clearly set itself up as the largest Real World Asset protocol in the DeFi space, with over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Ondo seems bent on fulfilling a legitimate, even noble, mission, with the stated goal of helping bridge traditional finance and decentralized systems. Its medium of choice, much to our collective space’s benefit, seems to be offering tokenized versions of safe, reliable real-world financial instruments, like U.S. Treasury bonds, other fixed-income products, and even, by extension, as we’ll see later, the Henley Ultimatum. As the weekend kicks off, the top trending tokens seeing an uptick from their usual discussion levels of social media are: Ethereum $ETH : Discussions have spiked revolving around Ethereum's performance compared to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Many users express… pic.twitter.com/IkdSpXET20 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 12, 2025 This model has become increasingly appealing in a market looking for yield and stability. While regulators scrutinize both crypto lending platforms and algorithmic stablecoins, projects like Ondo have carved out a niche by providing investors with a compliant and straightforward way to access traditional finance—all on-chain. Listing on Binance is huge. It’s a big deal. Binance (the largest crypto exchange, by the way) is going to offer crypto traders a chance to get their hands on ONDO in a way that’s very, very accessible. They (and nearly everyone they know) are already trading on Binance; in fact, it’s likely that when they chain themselves back to a centerpiece of our digital economy, they will also buy and hold $ONDO. A Trump-Endorsed Token? The story is made even more intriguing by the fact that $ONDO is reportedly part of a crypto portfolio connected to WLFI, a decentralized finance initiative that’s associated with the Trump family. Although the Trump connection hasn’t been fully clarified yet, the association has nevertheless served to amplify the attention being paid to $ONDO by politically minded investors in the crypto space. Some market players see the backing of such high-profile supporters as a sign that Ondo has a good shot at being around for the long haul. Others wonder if this is just another sign of how decentralized finance is getting ever more mixed up with politics. No matter what side of this issue one is on, it’s hard to deny that Ondo’s public profile has grown quite a bit in recent months. Community and Market Response The Binance listing has everyone excited, and it’s easy to understand why. There’s an enormous volume of trading that happens on the exchange, and with $ONDO being listed and therefore made available on Binance, the expectation is that $ONDO’s market cap will easily double or triple within a relatively short period of time as buying and trading activity ramp up. For those of us who hold $ONDO (myself included), all of this is exceptionally bullish. Analysts are providing a technical perspective that combines an increasing total value locked with interest from institutions and macro tailwinds in the real-world asset sector. They see these trending together as good news for the price of Ondo Finance’s token, ONDO. They like that traditional finance is now exploring blockchain solutions for asset tokenization and that Ondo is one of the few players already in that space. They see this resulting in a lead with the potential for sustained competitive advantages. Looking Ahead When $ONDO makes its debut on Binance, everyone will be watching to see how the token does in the first few days after being listed. With its total value locked up amounting to a billion dollars, a growing roster of prominent investors, and a strong use case in one of DeFi’s most viable sectors, Ondo is set up for sustained momentum. It remains to be seen whether the token can keep up its upward momentum and turn hype into lasting value. What is clear, though, is that $ONDO is no longer an under-the-radar thing. Its arrival on Binance is a whole new era, not just for the token but for the RWA thing, which is in the process of redefining how the world interacts with financial assets on-chain.
