Despite its loyal community and previous hype, the momentum appears to be shifting. Ethereum (ETH), trading at $1,476, is gaining fresh institutional interest ahead of the ETF momentum, while emerging DeFi performing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is capturing attention with its next-generation lending protocol. The presale is now in phase 4 after selling out the third one faster than expected. Over $6.5 million has been raised, attracting more than 8100 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.025 before the price jumps 20% to $0.03 in phase 5. Those buying today are set for a 140% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. ADA could be left behind as ETH and MUTM move into the spotlight, with analysts forecasting a reshuffling of the altcoin leaderboard. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending with its cutting-edge dual-lending model, which has driven rapid adoption. With over 8100 investors contributing $6.5 million during the presale, confidence in the project continues to grow. Currently trading at $0.025 in Phase 4, the price is set for a 20% jump in Phase 5, giving investors an opportunity for significant gains. Combining high market demand with unique lending mechanics, analysts see MUTM as one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi projects, with the potential to surpass $2 post-launch. In a recent update that’s generating serious buzz, Mutuum Finance launched an interactive dashboard with a real-time leaderboard, showcasing its top 50 token holders. These elite investors aren’t just getting recognition, they’ll also be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their position. Transforming DeFi with a Hybrid Lending Approach Mutuum Finance makes its lending platform stand out because it unites both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Users participating in P2C model liquidity pools can obtain passive income through smart contract-based automated USDT lending operations. Users who select P2P transactions handle their money directly through peer-to-peer deals which bypass financial institutions. Mutuum Finance combines P2C and P2P models to create features which improve protection along with efficiency and decentralization and thus aligns well with DeFi investors who want yield-bearing alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem As proof of its commitment to stability, Mutuum Finance is issuing a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins, which have been criticized for potentially leading to insolvency, this token will be over-collateralized to minimize risk and make it trustworthy in the long term. Combined with open financial architectures and audited smart contracts, this architecture increases investor trust while filling the biggest gaps seen in past DeFi projects. The company makes continuous community expansion possible through generous rewards programs. The giveaway provides 10 lucky winners with MUTM tokens worth $10,000 from a $100,000 fund and the referral program compensates users for referring new investors. Platform users who join at an early stage get premium staking pools alongside governance power along with exclusive updates while continuing their relationship with the platform. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Tokenomics mechanisms of the project create controlled distribution and maintain lasting value growth. The presale token distribution limitation together with deflationary mechanisms enables Mutuum Finance to maintain token scarcity that might fuel price elevation. Through its staking system the project offers valuable benefits which motivate constant user engagement while supporting the token’s continuous development throughout the system. Mutuum Finance is making waves with its next-gen lending platform. With over $6.5 million raised from more than 8,100 holders, and a presale price currently at $0.025 set to jump 20% in the next phase, MUTM offers early investors a potential 140% ROI at launch. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in decentralized finance.

While Cardano is a well known brand in blockchain, Ruvi AI’s presale model, VIP bonuses and leaderboard rewards are attracting early investors looking to get in and maximize their gains in the short term. Cardano’s Slow and Steady Growth Cardano has always been known for its academic rigor and scalability features. Currently trading at $0.63, ADA is expected to go to $0.84 by year end. That’s 33% ROI. Not bad but not life changing for early crypto investors. Even with Cardano’s progress in building dApps and improving smart contracts, its growth is minimal for risk takers looking for big gains. That’s where Ruvi AI comes in. Ruvi AI’s $0.01 Presale and the VIP 5 Advantage The presale got investors attention fast and reached its first milestone in just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. Ruvi AI is breaking the mold with a $0.01 presale that offers unmatched ROI. The platform combines AI and blockchain to provide practical solutions for dApps, content creation and analytics. But that’s not all. Ruvi AI’s VIP bonus tiers offer an opportunity to maximize returns like never before. Take the VIP 5 tier for example. With a $5,000 investment, you get 500,000 $RUVI tokens at $0.01 each. But here’s the game changing part: VIP 5 members get a 100% matching bonus, doubling their tokens to 1,000,000. At the public listing price of $0.07, those 1,000,000 tokens will be worth $70,000, that’s 1,300% initial ROI. Analysts predict Ruvi AI could go even higher, to $1 per token. That would make those 1,000,000 tokens worth $1,000,000, making Ruvi AI a wealth building opportunity like no other. Leaderboard Rewards Make Ruvi AI Irresistible Ruvi AI’s leaderboard rewards takes investment incentives to the next level. Designed to reward its most loyal community members, the program distributes fixed token rewards to the top holders based on their total holdings. This encourages investors to grow their $RUVI portfolio and gives tangible benefits to those who participate actively. Rewards are given to the top 1,000 holders, with the biggest bonuses for the top ranks. From generous rewards for the top 10 holders to incentives for the top 1,000, the program makes sure every achieved rank gets meaningful rewards. And these rewards are on top of the VIP bonuses, giving more token allocation to investors portfolios. For the top of the leaderboard, this is a golden opportunity to accumulate more wealth while solidifying their support for Ruvi AI’s long term goals. How Ruvi AI Will Outperform Cardano The main difference between Ruvi AI and Cardano is the scope of their ROI. Cardano’s stability and slow growth is good for long term but not enough for the exponential gains Ruvi AI offers. With the opportunity to get in at $0.01 per token and robust reward systems like VIP bonuses and leaderboard prizes, Ruvi AI gives investors a real shot at big returns. What sets Ruvi apart is its ability to tap into the growing demand for AI driven blockchain applications. This real world utility adds credibility to its growth projections, making it more than just a speculative play. Time to Act Ruvi AI’s presale is a rare chance to get in at $0.01 before the listing and the price surge. While Cardano will deliver stable gains in the coming months, Ruvi AI’s innovative approach and multi layered incentives makes it a once in a lifetime investment opportunity. With only 3 months until Ruvi AI’s full potential kicks in, the clock is ticking for investors to get in the presale. By October, Ruvi AI might not only outperform Cardano but redefine what’s possible in the crypto space. Get in now and be part of the story everyone will be talking about.

43265605,https://thecoinrise.com/blockchain-developer-activity-decline-by-40-sparks-concern/,1744495201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/43265605.jpeg,Blockchain Developer Activity Decline By 40% Sparks Concern,https://thecoinrise.com/blockchain-developer-activity-decline-by-40-sparks-concern/,"The blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is experiencing a sharp drop in developer activity. Developers are important in building and maintaining the decentralized applications (Dapps), platforms, and networks that run the crypto space. This decline in developer participation has raised concerns in the crypto community. Many are worried about whether the industry can keep growing and come up with new innovative ideas in the future. Blockchain Developer Activity Has Dropped Sharply Data from Artemis Terminal shows that the number of weekly active crypto developers has dropped to 40% in just one year. In April 2024, about 12,000 developers were working in the crypto space. However, by March 2025, developer activity had fallen to just 7,290. The situation became more concerning in December 2024, when the number dropped below 5,300 before experiencing a slight recovery in January. This decline suggests that fewer people are working on new ideas and updates. If this continues, it could lead to slower growth and more issues across the industry. What’s Causing the Drop? Binji Pande, who works on the Ethereum-based Optimism network, thinks the drop in developer activity shows that the crypto industry is changing its focus. He says developers are getting less support and fewer rewards. More people now care about making quick money instead of building useful tools that last. In a recent X post , Pande said that crypto projects are now based on popular trends rather than real needs. This approach leads to weak results and fails to support long-term growth. Pande also addressed the challenges faced by developers working on innovative applications. He noted that many developers working on real and useful applications are not getting enough attention or funding. On the flip side, capital flows into projects designed for quick gains. He argued that this imbalance has created an unhealthy system where short-term excitement is more valued than long-term development. This has made on-chain experiences less engaging. It has also reduced how much people use decentralized apps. Top Ethereum developer Eric Conner reportedly left the community in January to explore the AI sector. Conner said he lost interest in Ethereum because leaders and the community no longer share the same values. A Call for Renewed Focus and Support In Crypto Industry Pande believes that the industry needs to support and fund developers so that they can focus on building complete, end-to-end products. He believes real adoption comes from building products people need and use, not just new tech or market trends. The Optimism contributor warned that the next big growth in crypto will not come from market hype or another bull market. Instead, it will come from real and useful blockchain activity that keeps people involved.

Cardano is pushing toward the $1 mark but remains weighed down by resistance and investor caution. Solana, backed by ETF optimism and a tightening supply, is showing strength with eyes on $1,000. But then there’s BlockDAG , quietly shifting the narrative with its early airdrop, 600% bonus, and a presale ROI already hitting 2,380%. While ADA and SOL work to maintain their positions, BlockDAG is rewarding early adopters and offering what many investors are hunting for: access, timing, and a spot among the top crypto gainers. Cardano’s $1 Challenge Amid Lightchain AI’s Rise Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at approximately $0.63, maintaining a strong position with its scalable infrastructure and loyal community. However, it faces resistance at the $1 mark, with analysts viewing the $0.66 support line as critical; failure to maintain this level could lead to further declines. Furthermore, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties have also contributed to investor caution, inhibiting ADA’s upward momentum. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI, an AI-powered blockchain project, has raised $18.3 million during its presale, reflecting growing belief in its approach to decentralization. With that in mind, features designed to tackle transparency, governance, and scalability are helping Lightchain AI quickly become a serious player in the altcoin space. As a result, while ADA pushes upward, Lightchain AI is building momentum that could outpace expectations. Solana Targets $1,000 as ETF Optimism and Tariff Policy Shift Boost Momentum Solana (SOL) experienced a 15% rebound to $116 following former President Donald Trump’s announcement to roll back global tariffs, signaling potential economic shifts. Additionally, this policy change, coupled with the appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to the SEC, increased the likelihood of a Solana ETF approval to 81%, enhancing institutional interest. Moreover, on-chain data revealed that over 64% of SOL is staked, reducing circulating supply and alleviating sell pressure. At the same time, the slowdown in token unlocks further tightens supply dynamics. According to analysts, technical analysis by CryptoCurb suggests a parabolic trajectory for Solana, with historical patterns indicating a possible surge to $1,000, supported by strong accumulation zones between $100 and $115. Therefore, the combination of favorable regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and constrained supply positions Solana for a significant upward movement. Altogether, this confluence of factors contributes to the current Solana (SOL) price surge. BlockDAG’s Early Airdrop Gives Golden Ticket Holders a Head Start BlockDAG is giving new users a serious advantage with its “Golden Ticket” promo, offering a 600% bonus and early airdrop access for those who use the code BDAG1200. In practical terms, this means first-time buyers get six times the tokens during presale and receive them before the general public, even before the presale ends. This is especially beneficial if the token hits exchanges shortly after mainnet launch. Not surprisingly, this first-mover advantage is already gaining attention. With $213.5 million raised, 19.2 billion tokens sold, and a 2,380% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG’s presale ranks among the most successful in the space. Currently, Batch 27 is live at $0.0248, making timing critical for anyone eyeing potential gains. Looking ahead, an upcoming AMA on April 17 could bring key updates—mainnet launch details, testnet results, or international expansion news. In parallel, the project is kicking off its first global convention tour, bringing the community closer to the team and building long-term confidence. Ultimately, for those scanning the space for the top crypto opportunities, BlockDAG’s early airdrop isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a tactical edge. Getting tokens ahead of public distribution lets holders ride the momentum and potentially capitalize on post-listing demand, making it a smart play for those who act fast. BlockDAG’s Early Access Model Sets It Apart from ADA and SOL While Cardano wrestles with key resistance and Solana rides regulatory optimism, BlockDAG is offering something different—early access and real traction. Its 600% bonus and pre-distribution airdrop aren’t just promotions; they represent a head start that other projects aren’t offering right now. With over $213 million raised and a 2,380% ROI since batch one, BlockDAG is making timing matter. For those comparing top crypto plays, the edge goes to the one that rewards first movers. BlockDAG isn’t waiting for market approval—it’s already giving its community a reason to stay ahead of the curve.

The community-first approach, along with smart tech additions, gives Dogs a hybrid appeal that combines meme-driven hype with real-world utility. Analysts predict that projects like Dogs, which straddle culture and tech, could dominate the next wave of meme coin adoption. Why Dogs Made It to This List: Its combination of meme culture and real blockchain utility positions it as a future heavyweight. 7. Pudgy Penguins: Cool, Collectible, and Climbing While technically starting as an NFT project, Pudgy Penguins has evolved into a full-on meme ecosystem. With their adorable designs and viral marketing efforts, Pudgy Penguins have captured mainstream attention far beyond typical crypto circles. They’re branching into toys, media, and branding deals, showing how meme-driven projects can create real-world value. This pivot toward brand building rather than just relying on crypto hype is what sets Pudgy Penguins apart and keeps them relevant as both collectibles and tokens. Why Pudgy Penguins Made It to This List: Its successful transition from NFTs to broader cultural icons gives it an edge most meme coins envy. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Top Meme Coin Launches Set to explode in 2025 are Troller Cat, Book of Meme, Turbo, Memecoin, Baby Doge Coin, Dogs, and Pudgy Penguins.

Kang opened a 40x long position in Bitcoin worth $100 million on April 9, following US President Donald Trump’s statement that it was “a good time to buy.” Bitcoin has since risen and is trading above $85,000 at the time of writing. In today’s move, the trader doubled his position and now holds a $200 million BTC long position with 40x leverage. Kang’s current position has an average entry level of $82,076 and an unrealized gain of $7.7 million. Kang has paid $115,000 in funding fees to date. Kang will be liquidated if the Bitcoin price drops to $83,410. Kang's position at 0xBb876071A63Bc4D9bfCf46B012b4437Ea7Ff4281 can be tracked via this link. Related News: Prominent Analyst Makes Unbelievable Prediction For Bitcoin (BTC) Price In 2035 On Live Broadcast - ""It May Even Exceed This"" On the other hand, when Kang’s other positions on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Hyperliquid are examined, it is seen that he has a short position in Ethereum worth $6.7 million at 25x. Kang has lost $370,000 from this position so far and paid a funding fee of $24. The trader also has another position in Ethena (ENA). Kang has a $5.5 million long position in ENA at 10x and has made $118k in profits to date, paying $399 in funding fees. However, it is necessary to remember that leveraged trading is very risky, and when combined with the high risk of cryptocurrencies, losses, including the entire principal, are inevitable. *This is not investment advice.

Select electronics spared from reciprocal tariffs Select electronic products, including smartphones, processing chips, and computers are exempt from ‘reciprocal’ tariffs under President Trump’s sweeping tariff order, a relief to US tech companies and shareholders. According to a release from the US Customs and Border Protection, other consumer electronics such as internet modems, storage devices, and components such as semiconductors are also exempt from the additional reciprocal tariffs. Notice exempting select electronics from reciprocal trade tariffs. Source: US Customs and Border Protection The price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged by approximately 2.5% on the same day of the announcement and broke the $85,000 level. Bitcoin's price reaction could signal that at least some investors are entering the market again as risk appetite rebounds on positive macro headlines. CZ claps back against “baseless” US plea deal allegations Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, former CEO of Binance, has denied claims that he agreed to provide evidence against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). In an April 11 report , The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed sources alleging that CZ had agreed to testify against Sun under the terms of his settlement with US prosecutors. “As part of Zhao’s plea deal, he agreed to give evidence on Sun to prosecutors,” an “arrangement” that “hasn’t previously been reported,” the WSJ report stated, citing sources familiar with the matter. “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn't,” Zhao wrote in an April 12 X post . “People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.” Source: Changpeng Zhao CZ was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations. He walked free from federal prison on Sept. 27 as the wealthiest person to ever serve a US prison sentence, with a $60 billion net worth at the time. In a separate April 11 post , CZ claimed multiple individuals had warned him about the Journal’s intentions to publish what he described as a “hit piece.” US crypto industry needs band-aid now, “long-term solution” later — Uyeda A fast-tracked temporary crypto regulatory framework could bolster innovation within the US crypto industry while permanent regulations are still in the works, says acting US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Mark Uyeda. “A time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term,” Uyeda said at the SEC’s April 11 Crypto Task Force roundtable titled “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading.” Uyeda said this might be the short-term answer as the SEC works toward a “long-term solution,” at the roundtable with SEC members and crypto industry executives , including Uniswap Labs’ Katherine Minarik, Cumberland DRW’s Chelsea Pizzola, and Coinbase’s Gregory Tusar.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ZK|WLD|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-12 22:25:19

They command massive networks, institutional trust, and deep market presence.

Amidst a major downtrend, Martinez’s latest forecast reveals the altcoin could soon see a significant market rebound. Related Reading: Is It Time For Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance Rises To Major Rejection Zone Inverse Head-And-Shoulders Pattern Forms As NEAR Prepares For Rally In an X post on April 11, Ali Martinez shows a technical analysis of the NEAR 3-day chart revealing the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern which signals a potential price upswing. In financial markets, the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is a bullish formation that often acts as a reliable indicator of a trend reversal. As the name implies, it consists of three troughs in the form of the left shoulder, the deeper “head”, and the right shoulder as evidenced by the price action between April 7 and April 11 on the NEAR chart. Notably, a descending neckline connects the highs between these troughs and serves as a key resistance level. According to Ali Martinez, NEAR is gradually approaching this neckline, a decisive breakout above which would confirm the bullish reversal and initiate a price rally toward 2.40. Interestingly, NEAR’s relative strength index on its daily chart has recently left the oversold zone backing Martinez’s prediction of an impending price reversal. However, market bulls should still expect to face some resistance at the 1.000 and 1.272 Fibonacci extension levels at $2.10 and $2.34. On the other hand, if the NEAR bulls fail to break above the descending neckline, it could invalidate the current bullish setup and potentially force a price fall to support levels around the $1.96 and $1.82 price zones. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Symmetrical Triangle From 2017, A Repeat Could Send It as Flying To $30 NEAR Price Outlook At the time of writing, NEAR is trading at $2.09 following a price gain of 4.34% in the past day. On larger time frames, the altcoin is down by 16.12% on the weekly chart and 17.58% on the monthly chart showing short-term investors are holding significant losses. According to data from CoinCodex, the general sentiment in the NEAR market remains highly bearish. Meanwhile, the Fear & Greed Index stands at 25 reflecting an Extreme Fear among investors. Contrary to Martinez’s positive predictions, these analysts predict NEAR to maintain its current downtrend in the short term with predictions of $2.07 in five days and $1.90 in a month. In the long term, Coincodex still maintains a bearish outlook on the NEAR market projecting a market price of $1.58 in three months i.e. a potential 24% decline from current market prices.

Citing “people with knowledge on the matter” who asked not to be identified, Bloomberg reports that BlueCrest is up 20% on the year already, while taking into account fees and expenses. Platt reportedly used aggressive amounts of leverage to exploit the extreme volatility triggered by President Trump’s trade war, with BlueCrest now on track to complete a decade of consecutive returns. BlueCrest returned capital to outside investors, turning the firm into a privately owned and managed family office, so its exact assets under management (AUM) is unclear – though court documents show that BlueCrest held $3.9 billion in 2022. According to Forbes , Michael Platt is Britain’s richest hedge fund manager, worth about $18.8 billion as of December 2024, and currently stands with only a select few who have managed to profit in 2025 despite the global market sell-off induced by President Trump. Billionaire Warren Buffett also recorded billions of dollars in gains this year, upping his net worth over $11.5 billion this year alone, and his gains come despite this month’s sell off, which reduced Buffett’s 2025 winnings by $14.5 billion. Buffett, who is now ranked fourth among global billionaires, is one of only two in the top 20 that grew richer this year. He’s alongside L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has added $1.8 billion.

He cites growing institutional interest and a friendlier US regulatory landscape as key drivers for long-term growth. A Bold but Grounded Prediction Speaking on Fox Business Network’s The Claman Countdown , Garlinghouse remarked, “I think $200,000 is not unreasonable.” He clarified that he wouldn’t predict XRP’s price, adding, “It’s too close to home.” Bitcoin is currently trading around $83,500, a 3% daily increase, though still 23% below its January 20 peak. Despite short-term fluctuations, Garlinghouse believes long-term macroeconomic trends are far more important than day-to-day movements. Regulatory Shift Could Unlock Crypto Growth Garlinghouse emphasized the dramatic change in the US regulatory environment, noting the transition from “headwinds, hostility” to “tailwinds.” He believes this positive shift hasn’t yet been fully appreciated by the market. “The largest asset managers in the world go from relatively frozen out or hostile to now a friendly market. This has sensible regulation that is thinking about pro-innovation here at home,” he said. He also underscored crypto’s role as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. “The long-term value here is going to be very clear. It (crypto) is a hedge against inflation. It is a dynamic where the more utility we drive in the crypto markets, the more we’re going to see value accrete to that market,” Garlinghouse added. XRP ETF Momentum Grows New developments on the ETF front are also supporting the broader market. Teucrium recently launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the US—the 2x Long Daily XRP ETF—which saw strong debut volume of $5 million. Garlinghouse remains optimistic about XRP ETF approvals, predicting launches in the second half of the year. Analysts from JPMorgan and Standard Chartered estimate up to $8 billion in inflows during the first year if ETFs gain approval. Ripple’s Strategic Moves and Expansion Garlinghouse discussed Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road, which he said would not have occurred under the previous regulatory environment. The acquisition aims to help institutions like BlackRock enter the crypto market with the infrastructure they trust. “This allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that. It’s good for the whole industry,” he noted. Ripple’s headcount has also grown to around 1,100 employees, further signaling confidence in the company’s trajectory. Stablecoins and Legislation on the Horizon Garlinghouse highlighted growing momentum behind crypto regulation on Capitol Hill. Market structure bills and stablecoin legislation are gaining traction, with expectations that both could soon pass. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, launched under a New York trust license, has already surpassed $250 million in market cap and is nearing the $300 million mark. Garlinghouse believes these developments point to a maturing and increasingly integrated crypto ecosystem.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-12 22:46:39

With countless tokens launching and vanishing each year, knowing which ones truly offer long-term value can be tough. The real winners usually have strong use cases, engaged communities, and a development roadmap that extends well into the future. In this guide, we’ve gathered the top-performing cryptos of 2025. These aren’t just trending names—they’ve earned their place through resilience, innovation, and real network progress. Whether you’re building for the long run or rethinking your current portfolio, these projects stand out for a reason. 1. BlockDAG: Speed, Simplicity, & Real-World Scale BlockDAG is quickly gaining attention as one of the top-performing cryptos of the year, and its architecture is a big reason why. Instead of confirming one block at a time, its hybrid DAG and PoW structure processes multiple blocks simultaneously. The result? Faster speeds, lower costs, and serious scalability. Its beta testnet recently went live and already outpaces the alpha version, offering double the performance. Features like DeFi integration, NFT tools, and a token builder are built into its enhanced explorer. With mainnet set to launch later in 2025, BlockDAG is aiming for 15,000 TPS and will include core tools like swaps, staking, governance, and bridging. The numbers are impressive. Over $213.5 million raised, 19.1 billion BDAG coins sold, and a user base that includes 1 million X1 Miner app downloads. Global partnerships with Inter Milan and HackerEarth, plus dev-focused incentives like grants and bug bounties, show BlockDAG is serious about long-term growth. For those tracking top-performing cryptos in terms of innovation and adoption, BlockDAG leads the pack. 2. Solana: Fast, Efficient, and Backed by Institutions Solana keeps proving its place among the top-performing cryptos through speed, growth, and institutional interest. Currently priced at around $110, SOL recently unlocked over $213.5 million in tokens—but its price stayed strong, and some forecasts suggest a peak near $300 this year. Big players are noticing. Franklin Templeton just filed for a Solana ETF, showing growing interest beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin. After past struggles with downtime, Solana has rolled out updates to boost reliability. Its ecosystem—rich with NFTs, DeFi apps, and blockchain gaming—is thriving thanks to ultra-low fees and fast confirmations. Solana remains a key player for those seeking both performance and adoption. 3. Ethereum: The Core Network Still Building the Future Ethereum remains a go-to choice for investors focused on long-term fundamentals. Despite dropping below $1,500—levels not seen since 2013—Ethereum still powers most DeFi apps, NFTs, and smart contracts. A short-term dip doesn’t change the fact that it remains the backbone of Web3. CoinDCX projects ETH could reach over $5,500 by the end of 2025. This outlook is backed by ongoing upgrades, broad developer activity, and reliable integration across platforms. Even after a $105 million whale liquidation, Ethereum’s roadmap stays on course. Its efforts toward lower gas fees and improved scalability continue to support its standing among the top-performing cryptos heading into the next phase of the market cycle. 4. Cardano: Building Slowly, But With Long-Term Focus Cardano continues to attract attention from investors focused on steady growth. ADA is currently trading at $0.59, bouncing back with an 8% rise after nearly dropping below $0.50. While technicals showed a potential “Death Cross,” analysts at Benzinga still predict it could hit $0.94 or higher this year. What keeps Cardano among the top-performing cryptos is its methodical, research-driven approach. It skips hype and leans into academic peer review and slow-but-consistent updates. Its ecosystem is growing steadily, especially across Africa, with expanding DeFi support and real-world use cases. Cardano may not rise fast, but it also tends to hold up during downturns—making it a reliable option for patient investors. 5. TRON: Quiet Growth Backed by Real Usage TRON might not dominate headlines, but its consistent metrics show why it belongs on this list of top-performing cryptos. TRX trades near $0.23 and may climb to $0.26 in the near term—and as high as $0.73 by the end of 2025. TRON may not spike aggressively, but it also doesn’t crash—it moves steadily upward. TRON’s strength lies in utility. With high daily user counts and transaction volumes—driven by stablecoins like USDT—it continues to rank near the top for network activity. Its low fees and fast speeds make it especially attractive in cost-sensitive markets. While not flashy, TRON delivers consistent results, making it a solid pick for accumulation-focused strategies. Looking For the Top-Performing Crypto? If you’re thinking beyond the next trend, these top-performing cryptos deserve serious attention. Each one brings something distinct—whether it’s BlockDAG’s scalable tech and presale success, Ethereum’s smart contract dominance, Solana’s real-world usage, Cardano’s disciplined development, or TRON’s steady expansion. Together, they offer a mix of innovation, reliability, and community power. For anyone building a portfolio with lasting potential, these networks provide solid foundations. With strong fundamentals, active ecosystems, and big plans ahead, these top-performing cryptos are shaping up to be some of the smartest bets as the next crypto cycle unfolds.

Enthusiasts and traders alike are buzzing about promising choices, eyeing substantial growth. Delving into the spotlight are JasmyCoin , BONK , and PI , all showing potential to make significant strides. Find out which coins could lead the charge and why they are garnering attention. JasmyCoin: Recent Rally and Long-Term Dip Set the Stage JasmyCoin demonstrated significant volatility in recent periods, experiencing a strong weekly gain of 38.34% while achieving a modest monthly uptick of 6.24%. However, the coin faced a more considerable decline of 24.04% over the past six months. These fluctuations highlight a pattern of rapid short-term rallies intertwined with an overall long-term downtrend, attracting interest from traders looking for quick opportunities. Price actions range between $0.007 and $0.0175, with critical support around $0.0034 and resistance near $0.0244. Current indicators, including an RSI of 61.38 and a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator, suggest that bulls are trying to establish control. Traders may find potential opportunities to enter positions near the support level, aiming for profits at resistance. Bonk’s Mixed 1-Month Rally vs 6-Month Decline BONK price action recorded an 18.54% surge in one month, along with an 11.35% weekly gain, but a 39.87% drop over the past six months. The coin showed significant volatility, marked by a short-term upward movement countered by a long-term downtrend. Data indicates notable swings in performance, revealing an asset with rapid changes yet persistent overall weakness. Current levels show a key resistance at $0.00001872 and another at $0.00002552, with solid support at $0.00000515. The RSI at 54.90 and slight positive momentum reveal mild bullish pressure. Although no clear trend is established, traders might consider buying near support and taking profits at resistance as the market remains volatile. Pi Network Momentum: 6-Month Rally Meets Short-Term Correction Pi Network shows contrasting trends with a six-month surge of 567.3% and a sharp one-month drop of 62.78%. A one-week gain of 28.11% highlights swift market swings that add to recent volatility. The coin’s past performance reflects strong long-term expansion followed by notable short-term pullbacks, indicating varying investor sentiment and reaction to market forces. Current price moves between $0.15 and $1.82, with nearest resistance at $2.93 and a second barrier at $4.60. Technical indicators are mixed with a slightly bearish RSI at 43.32 and a negative moving average signal, though the positive oscillators show faint buying interest. Price action appears range-bound with bears holding near resistance but awaiting any breakout signals. Conclusion JASMY shows promise for its focus on data privacy and IoT integration. BONK offers an appealing meme coin vibe with a growing community. PI attracts attention due to its unique mining approach on mobile devices. These coins stand out this weekend as potential interests for those closely watching the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43267241,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63883,1744499611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Teucrium CEO: XRP ETF Was Our Most Successful Launch Day to Date,https://timestabloid.com/teucrium-ceo-xrp-etf-was-our-most-successful-launch-day-to-date/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) highlighted a recent interview clip featuring Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie, where he discussed the successful launch of the first XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. Speaking with Nate Geraci, Gilbertie described the fund’s debut as the most successful launch in Teucrium’s history. Gilbertie stated there was “overwhelming excitement” surrounding the ETF, noting that the firm had initially been overlooked despite being the only one to file with a ticker. “It kind of took people by surprise,” he said, pointing out that their filing was made immediately after changes at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). TEUCRIUM CEO: “THE XRP ETF WAS OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH DAY TO DATE FOR FUND WE’VE EVER DONE” “Terrific response” “Overwhelming excitement” Institutional investors are eager to acquire XRP through their preferred investment vehicles. Listen closely. https://t.co/W2n4f2OyjR pic.twitter.com/ypi5GQVAhr — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 11, 2025 In late 2024, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced he would on January 20, giving way to a crypto-friendly administration under Donald Trump and his new SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Teucrium filed for the ETF around this time, and according to Gilbertie, the effectiveness period concluded over the weekend, leading to seeding on Monday and the official launch on Tuesday, April 8. Details of the ETF Listing and Performance The new Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca). The fund is designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP, offering a leveraged investment vehicle aimed at institutional investors and experienced traders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Gilbertie indicated that nearly two hundred thousand shares traded on day one, calling it a “terrific” result and confirming it was their most successful ETF launch to date. Regulatory Position and Market Implications The ETF’s structure makes it operate without requiring direct approval from the SEC due to its leveraged commodity-style format. This structure enabled the product to come to market quicker than other applications awaiting ETF approval and potentially set a model for similar offerings tied to other digital assets. Teucrium has historically focused on commodity-based ETFs but is now expanding into cryptocurrency, signaling the maturing relationship between institutional finance and digital assets. The recent conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has also boosted the XRP’s legal clarity and removed the uncertainty that plagued the market for years. This legal clarity likely supported the product’s approval path and market appeal. SMQKE, who shared the interview excerpt, emphasized Gilbertie’s remarks about the fund’s performance, including his description of a “terrific response” and strong interest from institutions. While the ETF’s leveraged nature may not suit all investors, it represents a new avenue for those seeking amplified XRP exposure through regulated investment platforms.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs finally lit the fuse Wall Street had been tiptoeing around, and with TradFi scrambling to adapt, crypto’s grassroots are thriving once again. Meanwhile, with inflationary pressure squeezing emerging economies, particularly in South America, folks are looking to digital assets not just as a hedge, but as a legit alternative to traditional savings and business tools. Amid all this momentum, Qubetics has caught the crypto community’s eye. It’s not some recycled DeFi clone or anonymous chain. It’s the world’s first web3 aggregator, and it’s making serious waves in cross-border utility. The upside potential is drawing massive attention from folks looking for the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Qubetics: Cross-Border Simplicity with Big ROI Ambitions Qubetics isn’t just riding hype—it’s solving real-world problems. Right now, businesses across Latin America wrestle with slow, costly cross-border payments. Ever tried wiring cash from Colombia to Chile for a freelance gig? Banks choke it with delays and fees. Qubetics fixes that. By acting as the world’s first web3 aggregator, it’s streamlining cross-border crypto transactions for freelancers, merchants, even expats sending cash home. Imagine a tech startup in Buenos Aires paying a contractor in Mexico City. With Qubetics, they bypass bank queues and FX gouges. A Brazilian digital artist selling NFTs to clients in Canada? Instant settlement with transparent fees. It’s what the crypto scene’s been missing: something that makes Web3 work like Web2—but cheaper, faster, smarter. Sitting comfortably in its 29th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has already raked in over $16 million, moved more than 507 million $TICS, and attracted over 24,600 token holders. Priced at just $0.1573, the presale stats aren’t just a flex—they signal strong community traction. That’s why crypto analysts are quietly naming Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025—it’s early-stage, utility-packed, and backed by a hungry, growing community. What Happens If You Drop $500 on Qubetics Right Now? Let’s break it down. At the current presale price of $0.1573, a $500 investment would score you approximately 3,178 $TICS tokens. If the token hits $1, that’s $3,178—easy math. But let’s say $TICS climbs to $10 like some analysts are predicting. That same $500 would be worth $31,780. If it stretches to $15, you’re sitting on $47,670. That’s rent for a year, a motorcycle upgrade, or the seed cash to start a business. And the presale stats aren’t just a flex—they signal strong community traction. With $0.1573 per token and bullish predictions of $TICS hitting $1 to $15, we’re talking potential ROIs from 536% to a whopping 9,435%. That’s why crypto analysts are quietly naming Qubetics among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025—it’s early-stage, utility-packed, and backed by a hungry, growing community. Injective: Built for Builders, Backed by Giants Injective has carved out its niche among decentralized finance platforms by being fully interoperable and optimized for speed and low fees. Its native token, $INJ, is well-known for its lightning-fast throughput and custom-built layer-1 infrastructure designed specifically for DeFi apps. Binance, Pantera Capital, and Mark Cuban are just some of the high-profile names backing Injective, and that’s no coincidence. Whether you’re into derivatives, prediction markets, or launching your own dApp, Injective makes it seamless. It’s also taken smart strides in real-world asset tokenization, something that more buyers in South America are looking into as inflation dents fiat trust. With a limited supply of just 100 million $INJ, scarcity meets utility, and the community knows it. This is why it’s still one of the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Over the years, Injective has proven it’s not just another DeFi playground—it’s the go-to for builders who want scalability without giving up decentralization. If you’re looking for an altcoin, solid tech, and a growing list of use cases, $INJ still deserves a hard look. Bittensor (TAO): The AI-Powered OG Crypto Brains Trust Bittensor, or $TAO, has been riding a very different kind of wave: the AI and machine learning gold rush. But instead of just riding the hype, Bittensor built a decentralized neural network that rewards folks who contribute data, computation, or modeling power. Picture a system where anyone can plug in and train models, and get rewarded in $TAO tokens for it. This has led to a community that’s part-developer, part-AI researcher, and all in. It’s not for the faint of heart, but if you’ve ever looked at the future and seen AI stitched into everything—from logistics to entertainment—then Bittensor becomes more than just another coin. It’s infrastructure for a decentralized AI economy. Adopters love it because it pays out for effort and transparency. The tokenomics are tight, the use case is niche but powerful, and TAO’s been making consistent moves upward. It’s not your average buy-and-hold play—it’s more like betting on the future of how AI should work. And that’s why Bittensor is repeatedly ranked among the best altcoins to buy in April 2025. Why These Altcoins Matter Right Now Crypto’s no longer just a moonshot playground—it’s become a toolkit. And for South Americans dealing with inflation, weak currencies, and tight capital controls, the demand for these tools is climbing fast. Whether it’s Qubetics helping remote teams get paid across borders, Injective powering new DeFi ventures, or Bittensor enabling a fairer AI race—these aren’t just tokens, they’re working systems with real-world traction. For those scouring the scene for the best altcoins to buy in April 2025 , you’re not just looking for hype—you’re hunting for fundamentals, early access, and long-haul value. Qubetics is still in presale. Injective’s already proven. Bittensor is carving the next big trend. They serve different needs, but they’ve each earned their spot at the table. The presale window for Qubetics won’t stay open forever, and the numbers already point to rising momentum. Don’t wait until $TICS hits a centralized exchange to try and jump in—by then, the easy wins may be long gone. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics ideal for cross-border transactions?

Is Injective a good option for DeFi builders? Absolutely. Injective provides a scalable, low-fee environment for building decentralized apps, prediction markets, and financial tools without compromising on decentralization. Why is Bittensor (TAO) gaining attention in 2025? Bittensor stands out by merging blockchain with AI, rewarding users who contribute to a decentralized neural network. It’s the future of decentralized intelligence.

Key Insights into Their Price Movements,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/are-sui-and-sei-poised-for-another-breakout-rally-key-insights-into-their-price-movements,"Cryptocurrency markets are always buzzing with potential. Sui and Sei have recently drawn significant attention due to their price dynamics. Curious about which coins might see a surge next? This article dives into the latest trends and key insights, hinting at possible breakout rallies for these digital assets. Stay tuned for an in-depth look. SUI Coin Insights: Price Trends and Key Levels for Trading SUI price changes over recent timeframes show a steady decline with a one-week drop of 2.31%, a one-month loss of 3.63%, and a half-year fall of 5.95%. The downward movement reflects persistent selling pressure with gradual erosion in value. This trend indicates a bearish sentiment over the longer term without any sudden spikes, marking a period of consolidation and cautious market behavior. The coin currently trades between $1.74 and $3.03, with key support near $1.21 and first resistance around $3.78. Technical indicators show a slight bearish tilt, providing mixed signals from momentum measures. Trading opportunities may arise near the support level, while short sellers could consider the resistance area as a potential exit point. Sei Price Dynamics: Past Declines and Key Levels in Focus SEI recent performance shows a one-week gain of 2.8%, a one-month drop of 9.82%, and a six-month decline of 65.39% The price has faced strong downward pressure over the longer term, reflecting a challenging environment in the past half-year, while the last week has brought some slight easing. Current trading sees prices ranging from $0.135 to $0.242, with nearest support at $0.10 and resistance at $0.31. Bears appear to have the upper hand with a mixed trend. The setup invites trades within these levels, with caution needed near the second resistance at $0.42. Conclusion Both SUI and SEI show potential for another rally. Their price actions indicate possible upward movements. Strong support levels have been observed for both coins. Technical indicators also suggest positive momentum. Market conditions and investor interest will play a crucial role. Keeping an eye on trading volumes can provide further insights. Buyers might consider favourable entry points for both SUI and SEI. However, it's essential to monitor any market shifts closely. Future developments and news can impact their trajectories significantly.

43267982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709416,1744501291,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43267982.jpeg,Trump administration exempts smartphones and computers from 125% China tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/smartphones-computers-exempted-from-tariffs/,"The Trump administration has eased its trade stance by exempting smartphones, laptops, and other key consumer electronics from a proposed 125% tariff on Chinese imports. These products are also spared from a separate 10% global tariff, offering major relief to the tech industry and signaling a potential shift in the ongoing US-China trade war. The move represents a major softening of President Trump’s trade policies, which have subjected Beijing to escalating economic pressure. US Customs and Border Protection , the agency that issued the announcement, said the tariff exclusions would take effect retroactively from April 5. The exemption applies to most technology products, including consumer and enterprise-level technology, such as smartphones, laptop computers, memory chips, CPUs, GPUs, hard drives, and solid-state drives. Most of these items are at the heart of consumer markets and cutting-edge computing systems. Most of these devices are produced domestically. Instead, they are pieced together in Asia from key components made in tech powerhouses such as Taiwan, South Korea, China, and Mexico. As a result, the tariffs threatened global supply chains and higher consumer prices in the US — worries registered across the tech world and among analysts. And while the announcement does not resolve the trade dispute, it serves as a clear signal that the administration could be recalibrating its approach — at least concerning The tech industry scores a big win The exemption is a significant victory for the global technology industry, particularly American companies that depend on complicated global supply chains. Apple Inc. is one of the biggest winners. The company’s marquee products, like iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Airtags, are now protected from large tariff increases. One notable exception is AirPods, which are still subject to levies. Apple previously warned that such tariffs would not just hurt profits but also result in price increases for US consumers. After the tariff was first announced in March, Apple’s shares fell as investors worried. Nvidia Corp., whose chips dominate AI and graphics processing, also stands to gain. Most of Nvidia’s chips are made in Taiwan and Mexico and are essential for operating AI data centers and cloud infrastructure. The announcement also includes servers and AI chips, which are core to the growth of both artificial intelligence and cloud computing capabilities in the US. These products had been missing from initial exemption lists, raising alarm from tech industry executives. The exemptions also cover the equipment used to manufacture semiconductors — a key development for ASML Holding NV (Netherlands) and Tokyo Electron Ltd. (Japan). These companies make the specialized tools required to construct advanced chip factories. This action aligns with the wider US aim to increase US semiconductor output under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are investing majorly in building or expanding chip facilities in the United States. The tariff standstill will relieve near-term pressures on the companies as they ramp up their US operations — and may even hasten the pace of your innovation and infrastructure. Exemption raises hopes, but uncertainty remains The Trump administration’s latest move is a temporary win, and industry leaders caution that the situation is fluid. Those exceptions are attached to an older presidential order built to prevent the imposition of cumulative tariffs on a single product. That doesn’t mean existing levies have been removed; new tariffs could be imposed in another form. Some analysts forecast that the administration might also renounce the tariffs enframed into more specific duties collecting to critical sectors such as semiconductors and AI components. These are expected to be less severe than the initial 125% but could still impact pricing & production. Crucially, the exemptions do not apply to a different 20% tariff explicitly targeting China over the fentanyl crisis. That tariff and others that predate Trump’s current term are still in effect. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research report that was key to the decision. He opened with the comment that there was resistance in the White House to driving exemptions at first, but once the reality of the situation hit home within the Beltway, it was a different story. He also cautioned that China could take future steps that would change the dynamics again, mentioning that these negotiations still featured bald uncertainty and volatility. Some of the exempted products are critical to consumers, national security, and innovation. Exempting those from tariffs signals that the United States could move in a more strategic, selective direction on trade rather than across-the-board levies hitting broad portions of the economy. For now, consumers, manufacturers, and tech giants can relax. Devices will remain affordable, AI infrastructure can continue to grow, and the trade war might find a new phase involving targeted diplomacy instead of broad sanctions.

SHIBA turned a modest $100 into over $1.96 million , and DOGE ran from fractions of a cent to over $0.70 , printing millionaires seemingly overnight. Now, in Q2 of 2025 , traders are on the hunt for the next memecoin miracle — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a serious contender. Early investors are now able to scoop up 3.3 million MAGACOIN FINANCE tokens for just $1,000 — a volume that echoes the earliest stages of coins like PEPE and FLOKI, long before their mainstream breakouts. For those looking to maximize exposure at ground-floor prices, this kind of token-to-dollar ratio is a rarity in today’s maturing market. WHY EARLY DOGE AND SHIBA BUYERS ARE WATCHING MAGACOIN FINANCE PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW When DOGE first gained traction, it was trading at around $0.0002 — the kind of entry that turned everyday retail traders into whales once it reached $0.70 . That’s a staggering 35,000x ROI. Analysts are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE with similar excitement, pointing to the massive supply access early buyers receive with its current price of $0.0002908 . Buying 3.3 million tokens for $1,000 offers upside potential that’s increasingly hard to find, especially as many top coins have already run their course. The last time this kind of entry was possible, SHIBA INU jumped 2,900% in just under 60 days. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE be gearing up for a similar trajectory? ANALYSTS SAY “ROTATION SEASON” FAVORS NEW MEME PROJECTS JOIN OVER 12,500+ INVESTORS – SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW The sentiment around MAGACOIN FINANCE is heating up fast on YouTube and X (formerly Twitter). Someone who influences social media has called it, “major coins are keeping still, we have to turn to something new like MAGACOIN FINANCE — it’s too good an opportunity to pass up.” Despite the current turbulence in the market, the project is developing rapidly. There is even talk in communities that it may turn out to be a standout launch for 2025. Some forecasts call for a move of 30x to 70x once it hits centralized exchanges. Telegram communities are buzzing, Twitter threads are collapsing unintentionally and early whales from previous cycles are sipping their champagne. FINAL WORD: TOO EARLY TO IGNORE? GET 50% EXTRA TOKENS INSTANTLY — USE PROMO CODE: MAGA50X BEFORE IT EXPIRES In a market where even stable coins are facing volatility, the idea of securing 3.3 million tokens for $1,000 feels like a throwback to crypto’s golden age. It’s this kind of positioning that can multiply portfolios if the project reaches even a fraction of DOGE or SHIBA’s highs.

Analyst Identifies Pattern That Suggests So",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-return-to-74000-pattern-suggests-so/,"The Bitcoin price had a rollercoaster journey over the past week, falling to its lowest level in six months on Wednesday, April 9. The flagship cryptocurrency showed some resilience, recovering above the $80,000 level after United States President Donald Trump paused trade tariffs on all countries except China. BTC seems to be starting the weekend on a strong foot, returning to above $83,000 in the late hours of Friday. However, the price of BTC appears to be enjoying only a temporary relief, as a prominent crypto analyst has identified a pattern that could decide the coin’s trajectory over the next few weeks. BTC At Risk Of Another Correction Due To Double Top Pattern In an April 11 post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting outlook on the price of Bitcoin following its recent recovery rally. According to the online pundit, this latest surge could be a precursor to another Bitcoin price correction to around the $74,000 level. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Symmetrical Triangle From 2017, A Repeat Could Send It as Flying To $30 This bearish prediction is based on the potential formation of the “double top” pattern on the BTC hourly chart. The Double Top pattern is a technical analysis formation that looks like the letter “M”, consisting of two consecutive price tops. The double top pattern is typically a rare appearance on most charts, indicating that investors are looking to book their profits from an extended bullish trend. Hence, the “M” pattern can be a strong signal of trader exhaustion and bearish reversal. Interestingly, the above chart shows that the Bitcoin price just completed a “double bottom” pattern — the opposite iteration of the Double Top — on the hourly timeframe. The double top saw the premier cryptocurrency fall from above $83,000 to around $74,000 in the space of two days. With the price of BTC seemingly topping out around the $84,000 mark, a potential “M’ pattern appears to be forming on the hourly chart. If the Bitcoin price fails to break the resistance around the $84,000, the market leader could be gearing for another price breakdown. It is worth watching out for the support cushion around the $78,000 level, where the BTC price last bounced back to above $83,000. However, a confirmed close below this support region could imply a deeper correction toward $74,000 — a nearly 15% drop from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $83,800, reflecting an over 5% price jump in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction again thanks to its Pectra upgrade, which improves scalability and slashes gas fees. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also heating up, sitting just under a critical level at $0.0000134 — and a potential 20% rally could be in sight. But while these names are making headlines, one project is quietly pulling ahead: BlockDAG . The launch of Keynote 3 revealed that BlockDAG raised $200 million in just 10 months — all without VC support. Now in Batch 27, the presale has surged past $213.5 million. With bold projections placing its price at $1 in 2025, BlockDAG is becoming hard to ignore. Keynote 3 not only celebrated the team’s progress — it also gave the market a clear signal that BlockDAG isn’t just growing, it’s aiming to lead. Ethereum (ETH) Price Outlook: On the Rise After Pectra Launch The Ethereum (ETH) price outlook has improved following the successful deployment of the Pectra upgrade on the Hoodi testnet. The upgrade brings a major improvement — it lets users pay gas fees with tokens other than ETH, making Ethereum easier to use and more inclusive. As ETH moves closer to $2,500, strong fundamentals are backing the trend. Lower gas fees, growing institutional interest, and capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs all support the case for a longer-term climb. With the Pectra mainnet rollout set for April 25, and market sentiment gradually shifting, Ethereum’s trajectory looks more promising — assuming the upgrades deliver as planned. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Forecast: Can It Rally 20%? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is in a critical spot. It’s hovering just below key resistance at $0.0000134, and if it breaks past, analysts suggest a 20% rally could follow — that’s the current Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast. Momentum is building. The RSI recently rose to 54.10, showing increasing strength. At the same time, the MACD crossed above the signal line, which often suggests further upside. Still, the move won’t be confirmed until SHIB clearly clears and holds above that resistance level. If it does, the market could see SHIB take a meaningful leg higher. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Celebrates a Record-Breaking Presale BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 was more than an update — it was a showcase of progress. CEO Antony Turner highlighted that the team raised $200 million in under 10 months — all without any backing from venture capital. That number has since grown to $213.5 million in Batch 27 of the presale. “ This isn’t just capital — it’s fuel for innovation, expansion, and the next evolution of blockchain technology ,” Turner stated. The money raised is being used to push the core protocol forward, enhance the mainnet infrastructure, and scale global operations. It’s also helping fund outreach efforts, bolstered by high-profile partnerships with brands like UFC and Inter Milan — helping BlockDAG become a globally recognized name. The BDAG token has jumped from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in Batch 27, giving early supporters a 2,380% return. The forecasts are just as impressive — with a target of $1 by 2025, $20 by 2027, and even $30 by 2030. That vision is backed by a community of over 170,000 holders, all helping BlockDAG emerge as a major player among the top crypto coins 2025 . Summing Up! The Ethereum (ETH) price outlook remains strong as it heads toward a key upgrade, while the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price forecast hints at a possible 20% rally. But the real story might be unfolding elsewhere. With over $213.5 million raised — and no VC funding — BlockDAG is already breaking norms. Keynote 3 has only added fuel to the fire, reinforcing confidence in the project’s future and positioning it among the top crypto coins 2025. With a presale price of $0.0248 now and projections calling for $1 next year, BlockDAG’s path forward looks ambitious — but achievable. For those looking ahead to the next big breakout, the choice may no longer be just between ETH or SHIB. BlockDAG is emerging as a serious contender with real momentum — and that makes it a project worth watching very closely.

The memecoin has reset its bearish outlook and will break crucial price milestones in the coming days. For Shiba Inu, the death cross formation was confirmed on April 6 when the price dropped from $0.00001232 to a low of $0.00001030. Shiba Inu Price Golden Cross Confirmed Market data shows that the SHIB price is gradually disappearing from its earlier consolidation trend. At the time of writing, the coin’s price was changing hands for $0.00001249, up by 2.14% in 24 hours. SHIB recovered after trading at a low price of $0.00001205 to a daily high of $0.00001265 before settling at the current level. This price boost comes as the SHIB burn rate jumped 1000% in early trading, setting the memecoin on a possible revival path. SHIB/USDT 4H Chart. Source: TradingView The SHIB/USDT 4h chart confirms a golden cross pattern for the memecoin. This pattern is formed when the short-term Moving Average switches above the longer-term moving average. Although this pattern is fully formed on the 4-hour chart, it is yet to form on the daily chart. However, with the current momentum, a confirmed breakout is possible. Already, the token has displaced Hedera and now ranks as the 17th largest cryptocurrency. Shibarium Catalyst for Price Rebound Different ecosystem factors can boost the price of Shiba Inu in the long term. One of these factors is closely tied to the outlook of Shibarium and its associated Layer-2 scaling solution. As reported earlier by CoinGape, the Shibarium 200 million addresses milestone is near. If the network attains this landmark, it will show a clear sign of growing adoption, a move that might boost its token valuation. Already, Shibarium has broken the 1 billion total transaction milestone. Should the Shiba Inu network continue to record organic growth, its chances of outranking Dogecoin is higher. Amid the ongoing boost, the question remains how high the memecoin could soar. Drawing on this, a potential SHIB retest of its ATH of $0.00008844 is possible moving forward. While it will require as much as a 710% growth from current levels, SHIB can print this uptick, drawing on its historical trend.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the development team behind Helium ( HNT ) says that the regulatory agency has dropped its lawsuit against the crypto platform, which alleged that they violated securities laws. According to a press release, Helium developer Nova Labs agreed to pay the SEC $200,000 to settle the accusation without admitting to any wrongdoing. News of the dismissal caused HNT to rally as it went from a low of $2.62 on April 10th to a peak of $3.03 just a day later. It has since retraced and is trading for $2.96, a 9.9% increase during the last 24 hours. The SEC, which originally filed the lawsuit in January, had accused Nova Labs of distributing unregistered securities. “The SEC has agreed to dismiss its unregistered securities claims with prejudice. Helium Hotspots and the distribution of HNT, MOBILE, and IOT through the Helium Network are not securities. It also means that the SEC cannot bring these charges against Helium again.” In a recent blog post , Helium says the dismissal of the case is a “landmark outcome” for the digital assets industry and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) technology, which tokenizes real-world infrastructure. “This landmark outcome is a pivotal turning point for the Helium community and the entire crypto industry, removing legal uncertainty for DePIN projects that use crypto incentives to build real-world infrastructure. With the dismissal of the SEC’s unregistered securities claims with prejudice, the outcome establishes that selling hardware and distributing tokens for network growth does not automatically make them securities in the eyes of the SEC.” This marks another lawsuit dropped by the SEC against crypto giants this year after President Donald Trump took office. Other dissolved cases include ones against the crypto exchanges Kraken and Coinbase , retail trading giant Robinhood , non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea , and crypto wallet developer MetaMask .

According to Xaif, it marked the first time the two Ripple leaders shared the stage to speak on these topics directly. Have you ever seen Chris Larsen and David Schwartz share the stage? For the first time in history, they discuss $XRP and the Internet of Value — this is BIG! pic.twitter.com/ZsJkYCG1p5 — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 11, 2025 Incomplete Globalization and the Role of Interoperability Larsen opened by stating that globalization is not failing but remains incomplete. He argued that true globalization requires full interoperability in three key areas: data, goods, and money. While data and goods have achieved this through the internet and containerized shipping, respectively, money still lacks the infrastructure to move seamlessly across systems and borders. “Money networks don’t interoperate,” Larsen said. He described the lack of financial interoperability as a fundamental bottleneck in global economic integration. Traditional systems like SWIFT take days and charge high fees. Larsen asserted that addressing this issue would enable billions of people to participate in a fully functioning global economy through XRP’s advantages . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Foundational Ideas Behind the Internet of Value Schwartz pointed to Ripple’s early work on pathfinding and value exchange as part of what informed the concept of the Internet of Value. The premise, as explained by Larsen, is that “anything of value can be traded.” This concept, combined with protocols like the Interledger Protocol (ILP) and digital assets such as XRP, enables a low-cost, high-speed infrastructure for transferring value globally. Schwartz added that this system would allow international payments to become as seamless as loading a website—performed instantly, with no need to think about cost or intermediaries. He emphasized that such a capability would fundamentally transform how money is used globally. A Multi-Faceted Solution Larsen pointed to ongoing challenges in developing countries where, as he noted, sending even fifty cents is currently unfeasible due to high fees. He described sending $50 from the U.S. to Europe as impossible because of the high fees. The Internet of Value could eliminate those obstacles, making micro-payments accessible to everyone. Larsen was clear in stating that blockchains alone are not the full answer. The broader solution requires the combination of interoperable protocols, fast digital assets, and mechanisms to direct how value moves programmatically. He described the current system as an internet-driven world working with a pre-internet world of money, a mismatch that must be corrected to realize the vision fully. With experts already predicting that XRP will replace SWIFT , it can comfortably serve in this role. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With their institutional appeal and long-term track records, these names continue to dominate headlines. But in April 2025 , the most explosive ROI potential isn’t coming from the old favorites—it’s coming from MAGACOINFINANCE , a fast-growing altcoin project that’s stealing the spotlight with unmatched upside .

A Breakdown of Their Journey to a New Bull Circle,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/can-xrp-ada-rebound-explosively-a-breakdown-of-their-journey-to-a-new-bull-circle,"XRP and ADA are at a crossroads, teetering between stagnation and explosive growth. This article delves into their tumultuous paths, examining whether these digital currencies are on the verge of a significant resurgence. The potential for a new bull market looms, sparking curiosity about their future performance. Find out which of these coins might be poised for a breakout. XRP's 6-Month Rally and Recent Pullback Past month performance shows a notable pullback with an 8.29% decline, but over the last six months, XRP surged by an impressive 286.22%, marking a significant gain in long-term momentum. The market has witnessed extreme fluctuations during this period, reflecting the coin's volatile trading behavior, with bullish forces having powered the recent rally before encountering short-term corrections. Currently, XRP trades within a $1.66 to $2.77 range, testing immediate resistance near $3.45 and finding support around $1.23. The indicators such as an RSI of 46.17 and a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator at -0.24 point to a neutral stance with a hint of bearish pressure. With little evidence of a clear trend, traders might explore positions between these key support and resistance areas, monitoring for signs of renewed bullish activity. Cardano's Volatile Climb: Robust 6-Month Gains Amid Short-Term Setbacks Cardano experienced a notable decline of 13.86% over the past month, contrasting with a remarkable 82.18% increase over the last six months. The recent drop of 3.94% this week indicates short-term bearish pressure following a prolonged upward trend. Overall, the coin has displayed significant volatility, with strong long-term performance somewhat offset by recent price declines. The coin currently trades within a $0.47 to $1.02 range with primary resistance at $1.37 and support at $0.27. Oscillators and momentum indicators show a neutral position, hinting at a lack of clear direction. Traders might see purchasing opportunities around the $0.27 support level, while potential exits could be considered as prices approach the $1.37 resistance. A breakout past $1.92 may indicate renewed bullish momentum. Conclusion XRP and ADA have shown promising signs of potential growth. Both coins have strong backing from their communities and ongoing development projects. Their recent activities suggest that they are positioned for significant gains. However, predicting exact outcomes remains complex. Yet, their paths forward are imbued with opportunities that could lead to explosive rebounds. Keeping an eye on market movements and updates is essential for a clearer picture of their trajectories. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ripple (XRP), currently trading around $0.61, is gaining momentum amid renewed optimism surrounding its ongoing legal clarity. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi gem still in presale, is attracting serious attention from early movers looking for asymmetric upside. MUTM is currently available at an attractive presale. The project has managed to secure over $6.5 million from investors. Over 8100 holders have entered the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale during phase 4 due to the system plans to double its price from $0.025 to $0.03. Those starting to invest now during this phase will earn 140% return at the launch price of $0.06. For investors wondering how to deploy $3,000 in this market cycle, experts say these two could be the smartest bets this month. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized lending market through its revolutionary dual-lending technology which drives its exponential growth. Approximately 8100 investors partook in support of the project by investing $6.5 million after recognizing its value potential during its presale period. The current price of Mutuum Finance Token stands at $0.025 in Phase 4 but investors will experience additional value from the upcoming Phase 5 price increase of 20%. The team behind Mutuum Finance has rolled out a new dashboard equipped with a leaderboard that recognizes the top 50 token holders. Staying in these top ranks will grant participants additional bonus tokens as a reward. Reshaping DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance brings out the revolutionary change to DeFi by incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P provides passive income opportunities to customers by placing them in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract managed automatic lending capabilities. The P2P method enables direct lending relations that allow customers to operate deals without intermediaries while keeping their capital intact. The linkage of P2C and P2P models at Mutuum Finance creates an investment opportunity with enhanced safety alongside improved efficiency and decentralized features as a DeFi investment solution for maximum-yield seekers. Investor Incentives and Community Expansion The company builds its community base through rewarding investors with attractive benefits. The fund will send 10 fortunate participants $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens through its $100,000 token distribution campaign combined with its award-winning referral system that rewards users for acquiring new participants. The platform offers exclusive staking pools and governance rights and VIP update access to its early adopting community members as they develop long-term loyalty with Mutuum Finance. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term. Scarcity of tokens and deflationary mechanisms applied during presales lead Mutuum Finance (Mutuum Finance) to establish price appreciation potential in the long term. High incentive rewards and active token participation are possible through its staking feature which builds long-term functionality and maintains a healthy ecosystem. Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as top investment picks, with the crypto market poised for an April rebound.

Reports reveal that ETH has suffered a staggering 77% price crash against BTC — a decline likely fueled by a mix of technical, macro, and sentiment-driven factors. Notably, On-chain analytics platform, Santiment has now pinpointed and broken down the key reasons behind these price struggles. Ethereum Price Nosedives Against Bitcoin On April 11, Santiment released a detailed report on Ethereum, highlighting its almost four-year underperformance and the reasons behind it. Ethereum, once revered as the cryptocurrency most likely to dethrone Bitcoin, has recently suffered a brutal price decline when measured directly against BTC. Related Reading: Ethereum Pain Is Far From Over: Why A Massive Drop To $1,400 Could Rock The Underperformer According to Santiment’s on-chain data, Ethereum has crashed by approximately 77% against Bitcoin since December 2021. While the dollar value of ETH hasn’t completely collapsed, especially compared to other altcoins, the long-term BTC/ETH ratio still paints a gruesome picture for Ethereum holders. Notably, Ethereum has also failed to recover anywhere near its November 2021 all-time high of $4,760. In contrast, Bitcoin has surged ahead, reclaiming much of its market dominance and outpacing ETH across almost every timeframe. This disparity has led many traders and former maximalists to compare ETH to a “shitcoin.” Even worse, various mid to low-cap altcoins have already outperformed Ethereum over the short, mid, and long-term timeframes, causing further embarrassment for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Based on Santiment’s report, the ETH/BTC price ratio chart alone is enough to trigger doubt and uncertainty among long-term holders. Behind The Scenes Of Ethereum Price Struggles Beyond price action and market volatility, Santiment reveals that there are fundamental reasons for Ethereum’s sluggish performance over the years. Some of the major criticisms that analysts and traders have pinpointed include technical, sentimental, and regulatory issues. Related Reading: Ethereum Goes Head To Head With XRP: Analyst Says ETH Will Outperform For This Reason Ironically, Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions are one of the key drivers of its underperformance. L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync are reportedly cannibalizing activity on the mainnet, taking investments from ETH while spreading investor attention thin. Secondly, Ethereum seems to struggle with complex roadmaps and communication, which has led to investor confusion. Major updates like The Merge and Shanghai have been difficult for investors to comprehend, making ETH feel less accessible than BTC. Thirdly, users remain frustrated by Ethereum’s relatively high gas fees and the slow rollout of key upgrades. This has pushed them toward more affordable and faster alternatives, significantly reducing adoption. Another primary reason for Ethereum’s crash against Bitcoin is ongoing regulatory concerns. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a more established legal precedent, Ethereum faces constant uncertainty about whether it could be labeled a security. Other points include ETH’s lack of investment appeal. While Bitcoin maintains the title as a stable digital gold, Ethereum appears to be caught in between, having no clear or attractive investment narrative. Moreover, newer blockchains like Solana and Cardano are also attracting a significant number of users with cheaper and faster solutions, ultimately pulling investments away from ETH. The final reason Santiment has identified for Ethereum’s long-term price descent is rising selling pressure. Post-upgrade withdrawals of stakes ETHs have created steady sell-side pressure, limiting growth and momentum compared to Bitcoin.

Hidden Altcoin Aims for a 458% Run in 13 Days,https://thecoinrise.com/why-is-crypto-down-today-hidden-altcoin-aims-for-a-458-run-in-13-days/,"Amid a sharp decline in the crypto market, driven by massive liquidations, traders are turning their attention to a promising altcoin. The emerging RCO Finance stands out with its innovative features and a presale offering that hints at a potential 458% gain in just 13 days. Curious about what makes RCO Finance stand out?

Bitcoin led the decline, dropping sharply and causing about $361 million in losses, which triggered panic and rapid margin calls on major exchanges. The largest liquidation was a $7.08 million Bitcoin swap on OKX, impacting over 452,000 traders. Ethereum saw $320 million liquidated, while Solana lost $58 million. The total market cap dropped over 10% to $2.51 trillion due to significant declines in other crypto tokens. Volatility surged as traders adjusted positions, with a 24-hour trading volume of $181.97 billion. Analysts linked the crash to overheated sentiment, high leverage, and global economic issues. While some view the correction as stabilizing, sentiment remains fragile as Bitcoin lingers below $70,000. RCOF Presale Stuns The Crypto Market As investors seek high-growth opportunities amid crypto market struggles, attention is shifting to emerging low-cap altcoins like RCO Finance. Currently in its fifth presale stage, RCOF is priced at just $0.10 , making it an attractive entry point for early adopters. Here’s the exciting part: by using the promo code RCOF40, you can enjoy a 40% discount off the current price! Experts believe that once RCOF is listed on exchanges, the token price could surge to $0.60. This presents early investors with the potential for returns of up to 300%. Some experts even think RCOF could mirror the remarkable Bitcoin price rally in 2021. Even better, as the presale comes to an end, RCO Finance is preparing to launch a debit card for investors, marking an important step in its growing adoption. Don’t wait too long!

BlockDAG, XRP, Dogecoin & SHIB Are Breaking Out",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/best-crypto-coins-to-buy-in-2025-blockdag-xrp-dogecoin-shib-are-breaking-out/,"Q2 of 2025 is turning up the heat, and crypto traders are zoning in on a handful of breakout coins. Among them, XRP, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu , and BlockDAG are pulling ahead as the best crypto coins to buy this year. Each brings something unique—XRP’s institutional appeal, Dogecoin’s viral backing, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem growth, and BlockDAG’s massive presale. As digital assets evolve at breakneck speed, the traders keeping a close watch on these four may have front-row seats to the next wave of gains. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Surging Ahead With Speed, Tools, & Real Users BlockDAG has become a headline name in 2025—and it’s not by accident. The project raised a massive $213.5 million in presale across 27 batches, starting at $0.001 and climbing to $0.0248 , delivering a jaw-dropping 2,380% return for early participants. After Keynote 3, BlockDAG rolled out Beta Testnet V1, which doubles the speed of its alpha version. New tools like a no-code NFT and coin builder are already live, signaling that this isn’t a whitepaper project—it’s real, usable tech. With over 1 million users mining on its X1 App , adoption is off the charts. And with a mainnet launch locked in for 2025, BlockDAG’s focus on scalability, access, and speed puts it in a league of its own. It’s not just one of the best crypto coins to buy—it’s one of the most promising projects in motion right now. 2. XRP: Legal Wins & Institutional Focus Ignite Optimism XRP is riding high in 2025, trading at $2.06 as of April. Its rebound is backed by a crucial court victory against the SEC, which has revived confidence among institutional investors and fueled talks of an XRP ETF. The probability of ETF approval is sitting at 82%, which could skyrocket demand. With price forecasts between $1.82 and $4.48 this year, XRP is in a strong position. On-chain activity is healthy, and large holders continue to accumulate. With its real-time payments utility and expanding financial relevance, XRP is still one of the best crypto coins to buy for those betting on mass adoption. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Holding Its Ground With Social Power Dogecoin isn’t just surviving—it’s staying relevant. Now trading at $0.164, DOGE recently dropped 8.63%, but major holders are still loading up—220 million DOGE were scooped up in March alone. Support around $0.16 remains solid, and analysts eye $0.1945 and eventually $0.57 as next potential levels—a possible 250%+ upside. With daily mentions across social platforms and continued payment utility, DOGE may be volatile, but it still earns its spot among the best crypto coins to buy—especially for risk-tolerant traders watching social trends. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Scaling Fast With Real Transactions & Burn Rates Shiba Inu isn’t just a meme—it’s showing serious traction. Trading at $0.00001222 with a $7.18 billion market cap, SHIB is sitting comfortably in the top 15. Its ShibaSwap platform posted a 228% surge in 30-day trading volume, now reaching $17.18 billion in total activity. The Shibarium blockchain has processed over 1 billion transactions, and SHIB’s burn rate recently spiked 104,201%, with 115.89 million tokens burned in a single day. With that level of usage and deflationary pressure, Shiba Inu is shifting from meme to meaningful—and securing its place as a top performing crypto in 2025. Choosing the Best Crypto Coins to Buy in 2025 If you’re scouting for the best crypto coins to buy , these four should be on your radar. XRP has momentum from legal clarity and institutional interest. Dogecoin keeps trending thanks to community power and whale support. Shiba Inu is proving its value with major transaction volume and burn mechanics. But BlockDAG stands out the most. It’s already raised over $213.5 million, has a user base of over 1 million mobile miners, and has delivered a 2,380% presale ROI—with more upside ahead. With a mainnet launch, toolset, and exchange listings all ahead in 2025, BlockDAG is leading the pack—and could be the next big thing before the presale window closes.

It looks past the noise and zeroes in on what’s quietly growing beneath the surface. Most people chase pumps. But the biggest gains come from spotting the ones that are already proving their worth. This isn’t about guesswork—it’s about recognizing momentum before it explodes. If you’re serious about finding the best crypto to buy now , these four—BNB, BlockDAG, XRP, and Toncoin—should be on your radar. 1. BlockDAG: 2,380% Gains and It’s Still Early While other projects wait for attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already cashing in. With $213.5 million raised , 19.1 billion coins sold , and a 2,380% price surge since its earliest presale batch, BDAG didn’t wait for validation—it earned it. This isn’t hype—it’s progress. The testnet is live. Over 200+ dApps are in development. And more than 1 million users are already mining BDAG through the X1 app. The roadmap? Not just filled with dreams—but real features like account abstraction , smart contract autonomy , and self-sovereign identity already being rolled out. At $0.0248 in Batch 27 , with forecasts hitting $30 by 2030 , BDAG isn’t a guess. It’s a working system that’s already rewarding early adopters. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now , BlockDAG might be the one you’ll wish you grabbed sooner. 2. BNB: Powerful Utility, But Capped Potential Binance Coin (BNB) still leads the pack when it comes to exchange-backed tokens. It fuels the Binance Smart Chain , runs on one of the most active platforms in crypto, and follows a smart deflationary model that burns tokens every quarter to tighten supply. It’s strong on fundamentals. But don’t expect fireworks. Even Binance’s internal outlook pegs BNB between $605 and $610 by the end of 2025. That’s not liftoff—it’s a steady cruise. For investors looking for solid footing and utility-based tokens, BNB stays on the shortlist of top cryptos to buy now —just don’t count on moonshots. 3. XRP: A Legal Win, But Still Waiting on Liftoff XRP isn’t just a survivor—it’s one of the few coins with a real-world mission: to revolutionize cross-border payments. And with Ripple’s major court win over the SEC, it’s finally breathing easier on the legal front. But price-wise, XRP hasn’t taken off yet. Currently trading at $1.67 after a 25% drop over the past month, it’s feeling the weight of global uncertainty and liquidation pressure. Analysts predict a rally to $3–$27 by 2025 , but warn that dipping below support could send it down to $1 or lower . Still, for anyone banking on utility and regulatory clarity, XRP is one of the best crypto to buy now —especially at these levels. 4. Toncoin: A Speed Demon with Long-Term Firepower Toncoin (TON) came out of Telegram’s blockchain experiment and has turned into a high-speed Layer-1 player. It’s built for scalability, low-cost execution, and performance—a dream for developers. Right now, TON is in the middle of a market correction, but analysts forecast a price between $2.14 and $3.20 by 2025. Long-term, it could hit $10 to $12 by 2030 , assuming traction keeps building. But here’s the catch: you need good timing. Get in during this correction, and TON could be your next big win. If you’re playing for growth, TON could be the best crypto to buy now —but only if you know when to strike. Which is the Best Crypto to Buy Now? These four projects are all making waves—but they’re not all riding the same current. BNB brings stability, but the upside is capped. XRP has legal clarity and global relevance but needs fuel to move. TON is built for speed, but success hinges on catching it at the right moment. BlockDAG , though? It’s already moving. It’s already delivering. With a working network, community adoption, and real ROI already in play, BDAG isn’t speculating on success—it’s stacking it. So if you’re asking what the best crypto to buy now looks like—it’s probably not the coin you keep watching. It’s the one already working while the others wait for a reason to run.

In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a key support zone that continues to hold firm, reinforcing the possibility of a bottom formation. Notably, the analyst said the price action has “respected the long-standing blue support line”, originally established around the “Trump rally breakout.” Current structure suggests a “possible bottom formation near this zone, supported by volume and historical price behavior.” With volume backing the move and historical price behavior aligning, BTCEarth believes the current structure may mark the early signs of a bullish turnaround for Bitcoin. Impending Price Recovery For Bitcoin? BTCEarth pointed out that the blue horizontal support line on his chart aligns closely with Bitcoin’s early breakout in September 2024. This level has since acted as a crucial support zone, having been retested multiple times throughout the past months. Notably, the most recent price touches at $74,434 and $74,588 appear to have formed another significant bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For W-Bottom Reversal, Says Legendary Trader Bollinger According to BTCEarth, the repeated validation of this support suggests that Bitcoin is building a strong foundation. If this structure holds, it could pave the way for a bullish reversal, especially as momentum and historical price behavior support a potential breakout from this area. BTCEarth also emphasized that Bitcoin is currently trading within a falling wedge pattern. In his chart, Line D serves as the support base while Line E marks the descending resistance. The price action has continued to compress within this narrowing structure, signaling a breakout on the horizon. He noted that a confirmed move above Line E, especially one sustained over multiple daily candle closes, would validate the pattern and confirm a bullish reversal. Such a breakout could set the stage for a stronger upward trend as traders recognize the shift in market structure. Key Resistance And Buying Zones BTCEarth highlighted that the accumulation zone between $74,000 and $75,000 remains intact, offering a favorable risk-reward setup for long positions. The immediate resistance lies at $80,000. Further resistance is found between $86,000 and $88,000, an area of historical consolidation and heavy volume. A breakout above this zone would significantly strengthen Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Fate Hinges On These 2 Resistance Zones – Details Beyond that, he pointed out that the major horizontal resistance near $100,000 remains the ultimate target. This level represents a psychological milestone and a crucial technical threshold. If Bitcoin builds enough momentum to clear it, it could pave the way for a fresh leg up in the long-term bullish cycle. In conclusion, BTCEarth highlighted that Bitcoin is stabilizing above a critical support zone, with the price structure suggesting a potential bottom formation. A breakout above Line E could spark a powerful bullish move toward the $88,000–$100,000 range. However, until this breakout occurs, caution remains crucial, and maintaining a hold strategy is advised.

Crypto expert Olivia Vande Woude says Avalanche will change the landscape for traditional finance as we know it. Avalanche Will Modernize Legacy RTGS Systems According to an X post , business development expert Olivia Vande Woude remarks that Avalanche will improve current offerings for mainstream finance. Right out the bat, Woude notes that the lowest hanging fruit for AVAX will be changing outdated rails in legacy finance. Woude argues that rather than a wholesale replacement, an Avalanche integration will improve legacy RTGS systems like SWIFT and Fedwire. Perhaps, the biggest area of improvement will be in conventional post-trade infrastructure bogged down by fragmented reconciliation. Woude notes that the network can introduce real-time finality and liquidity efficiency for post-trade infrastructure. Large exchange infrastructure is tipped to record seismic changes following an Avalanche integration, says Woude. While CBOE and ICE grapple with execution latency, Woud was Avalanche’s decentralization can reduce slippage for legacy exchanges. “Avalanche does for finance what fiber optics did for telecom,” said Woude. “It’s replacing outdated rails with real-time, high-throughput, low-latency execution.” Woude points out in her statement that Avalanche’s tamper-proof infrastructure will improve the batch processing systems employed by traditional custodians. The derivatives markets will receive their fair share of changes, leaning on Avalanche’s collateral optimization and margin logic based on advanced smart contracts. Amid soaring regulatory changes in the US, traditional financial institutions can unlock new revenue streams in tokenization via blockchain-based integrations. Benefits Extend To Funding Markets Amid Soaring AVAX Price Woude highlights the benefits of an integration in short-term funding markets by leaning on its dynamic discounting. Furthermore, the blockchain offers programmable yield analytics designed to revolutionize the operations of repo settlements and liquidity management in funding markets. An EVM compatibility will allow institutions to still deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts, smoothening the curve for tokenized funds. As the US SEC approves options trading for Ethereum spot ETFs, Avalanche can offer financial institutions permission chains for compliance while offering on-chain derivatives mirroring ETF performance. “Avalanche isn’t just modernizing financial infrastructure, it’s reprogramming it,” said Woude. “Institutions adopting Avalanche in turn gain a meaningful edge in speed, efficiency, and transparency.” AVAX price has gained nearly 8% over the last day driven by a broader crypto market rebound and rising institutional adoption for Avalanche. AVAX is trading at $20 while daily trading volumes have spiked by 7% buoyed by bullish chatter around the network.

33767162,[object Object],1744515039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Whales Haven’t Made Their Exit Yet – Is The Bull Cycle Still Intact?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whales-havent-made-their-exit-yet-is-the-bull-cycle-still-intact/,"After suffering a steep 30% correction that took prices below $75,000, Bitcoin is showing signs of strength once again. The broader crypto market joined BTC in a sharp rebound following a key macro development: US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China, which now faces a 145% tariff. This easing of trade war fears brought some much-needed relief across risk assets. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin’s resilience is gaining attention. According to insights from CryptoQuant, whales—large holders excluding entities like exchanges and mining pools—have not exited their positions. In fact, current on-chain data shows accumulation activity similar to what was observed during the August–September 2023 sideways market phase. This pattern historically reflects long-term conviction and has often preceded major rallies. While short-term uncertainty remains , the continued presence of whale accumulation supports the idea that this correction is part of a broader bullish cycle rather than a structural breakdown. With prices stabilizing and sentiment slowly improving, Bitcoin now faces a critical test to reclaim higher levels and potentially resume its upward trajectory. Bitcoin Resilient As Key Accumulation Suggests Bull Cycle Intact Bitcoin remains strong after reclaiming the $80,000 level, and many analysts believe the worst part of the correction is over. However, global tensions—especially those tied to escalating U.S. tariffs—continue to pressure financial markets, with fears of a looming global recession growing. Despite this backdrop, Bitcoin has shown resilience and is now approaching a critical daily resistance near $88,700. The recent 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all nations except China, which still faces a 145% tariff, has provided some short-term relief. But lasting recovery depends on whether the US and China can reach a broader agreement. Meanwhile, on-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals a compelling trend: Bitcoin whales haven’t made their exit. These whales, excluding exchanges and mining pools, offer a clearer view of real trading behavior and accumulation patterns. Historically, their movements have closely mirrored price action. At the cycle peak last year, whale exits were marked by consistent profit-taking. This time, however, they are accumulating again, echoing patterns seen in the August–September 2023 sideways market. Unlike the 2020 COVID crash, which whales anticipated with early exits, they are holding firm during this correction. This suggests the current downturn is not a structural crisis but a sharp pullback in a broader bull cycle. If this manufactured crisis resolves, a new wave of liquidity—possibly driven by QE from both the Fed and China—could favor assets like gold and Bitcoin. For now, whale conviction remains a bullish signal. BTC Price Near Key Moving Averages Bitcoin is trading at $83,600, now just 5% away from the 200-day moving average (MA) around $87,100. This technical level is a crucial milestone for bulls aiming to confirm a reversal and reestablish a long-term uptrend. To build a solid bullish case, BTC must not only hold above the $81,000 support zone but also reclaim the $85,000 level, which aligns closely with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Reclaiming these moving averages would signal a potential shift in trend, helping reinforce short-term momentum and restoring confidence across the market. The price action over the past week has shown signs of strength, but technical validation through these averages is essential before a true breakout can unfold. However, downside risks remain. If Bitcoin fails to hold the $81,000–$80,000 range, selling pressure could escalate quickly. A breakdown below this region would likely open the door to a retest of the $75,000 level, where demand could be tested again. With macroeconomic tensions still weighing on investor sentiment, BTC is at a critical inflection point. The coming days will determine whether bulls can solidify control—or if another correction leg is on the horizon.

The parties have asked the judge overseeing the matter to keep the case on hold amid “productive discussions” between their lawyers. The motion seeks to extend Judge Amy Beerman Jackson of the US District Court of Columbia’s stay, which she granted in February following a similar motion. “Continuing The Stay is Appropriate and In the Interest of Judicial Economy” According to a joint filing submitted to the court on April 11, the securities agency asked that the current pause be extended “…In light of these continued discussions and the time required for the staff to seek authorization from the [SEC] as necessary to approve any resolution or changes to the scope of this litigation."" Lawyers for the exchange agreed that ""...continuing the stay is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy."" Judge Jackson granted the parties’ initial request to pause the matter for 60 days in February 2025 after they had filed a similar joint motion. The initial request was based on the SEC’s duties to the new crypto task force established under the Trump Administration. The SEC’s crypto force is tasked with developing a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US. The stay was granted based on the SEC’s responsibilities. The document details: “The work of this task force may impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case…Accordingly, the SEC proposed a brief stay to Defendants, and the Defendants agreed that a stay is appropriate.” The latest joint filing read as such: “Since the Court stayed this case, the Parties have been in productive discussions, including discussions concerning how the efforts of the crypto task force may impact the SEC’s claims. In light of these continued discussions and the time required for the staff to seek authorization from the Commission as necessary to approve any resolution or changes to the scope of this litigation, the SEC requested that the Defendants agree to continue the current stay for an additional 60 days, and the Defendants agreed that continuing the stay is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy. At the end of the 60-day stay period, the Parties propose that they will submit another joint status report. A proposed order is attached hereto. Accordingly, the Parties respectfully request that the Court grant this Joint Motion to Continue the Stay.” The Original June 2023 Complaint The SEC filed its initial complaint against Binance, Binance.US, and Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao , for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies. Binance was not the only exchange to be targeted by the SEC under Chairman Gary Gensler’s rule. The SEC’s infamous 2023 crackdown included similar lawsuits against several other cryptocurrency exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase .

CPW, or cost per wallet, is deemed a higher “quality” metric because it tracks the cost of website visitors with a crypto wallet already installed in their browser. “Higher churn” rate may be to blame Nadler previously told Cointelegraph that their analysis data showed that users with a wallet are more likely to convert to crypto products. CPW across different regions during the bull markets in Q1 an Q4 of 2024. Source: Asaf Nadler Nadler said the high cost-to-return ratio of crypto gaming and gambling might be due to “higher churn, speculative behavior, and intense competition.” He added: “If Web3 gaming is truly “inevitable,” we need to find a more powerful UA engine to make it as sustainable as in Web2.” However, Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin said in an April 11 post on X that periods of high CPW are a good time to experiment. “Create new games/product lines, consolidate our market share, and get ready for the next market expansion,” Zirlin said. “Know when it's a coiling phase. Know when it's time to explode,” he added. Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Centralized Finance (CeFi) campaigns have it a lot easier with attracting new crypto users. “DeFi/CeFi campaigns are the most cost-efficient, with a median CPW of $2.79 and a lower quartile of just $0.10,” Nadler said. The results are based on 200 programmatic campaigns run on Addressable by over 70 advertisers, claiming to target an estimated 9.5 million users globally.

Premium markets cost more to reach crypto users during downturns Nadler said that while premium markets experience low-cost conversions for existing crypto wallet holders during bull runs, attracting their attention becomes significantly more expensive during market downturns. Related: Trump kills DeFi broker rule in major crypto win: Finance Redefined He highlighted that in 2024, the US and Western Europe saw CPW increase by four times and 27 times, respectively, between Q1 and Q3, as the markets continued to consolidate and interest from crypto wallet holders waned. “While these markets provide scale and quality during bull runs, they become significantly more expensive when sentiment turns bearish, making them less sustainable during downturns,” Nadler said. Meanwhile, emerging markets like Latin America and Eastern Europe “offer exceptionally low CPW in favorable conditions but can experience extreme cost volatility.” Magazine: Bitcoin eyes $100K by June, Shaq to settle NFT lawsuit, and more: Hodler’s Digest, April 6 – 12",,EN,0,0,AXS|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-13 03:57:58

Traders take notice. The buzz around the Solana (SOL) technical analysis is heating up, especially with targets now locked in at $140. Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) price prediction is gaining steam after Trump’s trade delay helped lift sentiment and fuel a breakout attempt. But while both networks push for short-term gains, something bigger is playing out behind the scenes. BlockDAG just dropped its Keynote 3—and it’s turning heads across the market. The network has now raised $213.5 million without a single cent from venture capital. Backed entirely by over 170,000 early buyers, this isn’t just momentum—it’s infrastructure in motion. With 10,000 ASIC miners shipping, BlockDAG is building the backbone of a real crypto empire. It might just be the best crypto for 2025 before the crowd catches on. BlockDAG’s $213.5M Power Play: No VCs, Just Pure Momentum BlockDAG isn’t playing by the usual crypto playbook. While other networks lean on venture capital to stay afloat, BlockDAG has crossed $213.5 million in presale funding without a single VC involved. This milestone was confirmed in its Keynote 3 and signals something big—BlockDAG is being built from the ground up by over 170,000 individual buyers who see the potential before listings go live. Currently in batch 27, BDAG coins are selling at $0.0248, up from just $0.001 in batch 1. That’s a 2,380% increase in value so far. Over 19.2 billion coins have already been sold, and momentum hasn’t slowed. With a total supply of 50 billion, and just 10 billion allocated for presale, the window to grab a stake before listing is closing fast. The hype isn’t just about numbers—it’s about real infrastructure. BlockDAG has already started shipping 10,000 ASIC miners, which will power its upcoming decentralized network. Unlike cloud promises, this is hardware hitting the ground, backed by a hybrid DAG+PoW design. It’s not just a pitch—it’s a working plan, with miners, audits, and products already rolling out. For anyone searching for the best crypto for 2025, BlockDAG checks all the boxes: no VCs, real adoption, strong security, and one of the most active communities in crypto right now. The longer it stays under $0.03, the more it feels like a rare shot at pre-launch potential before the listings and hype fully kick in. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Bounce Signals 70% Upside Potential The recent rally in ADA has brought the spotlight back to the Cardano (ADA) price prediction after the coin jumped nearly 19% from $0.51 to $0.61. This move was triggered by a mix of factors—Trump’s 90-day tariff pause, easing inflation data, and a bullish technical setup. ADA is now testing a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, which typically signals a reversal. If it clears resistance around $0.70, the next target could be $0.74 and potentially $1.00. Technical indicators are also lining up. ADA recently hit oversold levels not seen in over a month and formed a bullish RSI divergence—both of which hint at continued upside. The last time it bounced from a similar level, the price surged over 53%. If that pattern repeats, the Cardano (ADA) price prediction could play out with a 70% upside from current levels. Key levels to watch are $0.65 as resistance and $0.46 as critical support. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis: Whale Move Triggers $140 Target Setup A major whale just bought 32,000 SOL worth $3.72 million—fueling a bounce that pushed the price from $95 to over $120. This return comes after a six-month break and has added serious momentum to the current move. The Solana (SOL) technical analysis shows a breakout from a falling wedge pattern that began in November 2024. If the price clears $125, targets at $132 and $140 are now on the radar. On the chart, $112 and $110 are the main support zones, with $105 acting as a line that could shift sentiment if broken. Despite SOL being down 33% since April 2024, buyers are stepping in at key levels. The RSI is still above 50, and a recent false breakdown below $112 has turned into a bullish setup. The Solana (SOL) technical analysis now leans toward a breakout continuation if resistance levels keep falling—and the whale’s conviction only adds to the case. Summing Up Cardano (ADA) price prediction is gaining traction again with a strong bounce and signs of a potential 70% rally if it breaks key resistance. Meanwhile, the Solana (SOL) technical analysis is pointing to a bullish setup backed by a whale’s $3.72M return and a breakout from a long wedge pattern. Both networks are showing strength, but the spotlight is shifting. BlockDAG just delivered one of the biggest updates in the space with its Keynote 3. It confirmed $213.5 million raised in its presale—all without VC funding. With 10,000 miners shipping, real infrastructure is going live, not just talked about. This kind of momentum from over 170,000 holders makes it a serious contender for the best crypto for 2025. For those looking to act before listings on major exchanges and prices move higher, BlockDAG’s current presale window might be the last low entry point for the best crypto for 2025 narrative.

The Wall Street Journal, in a report published on April 11, cited unnamed sources suggesting that Zhao had cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) by offering to provide evidence on Sun. Zhao, now free after serving a four-month sentence for anti-money laundering violations , wasted no time addressing the allegations publicly. “WSJ is really TRYING here,” he wrote on X the next day. “They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t. People who become government witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected.” In the same post , Zhao hinted at foul play behind the scenes, implying the Journal may have been incentivized to publish a “hit piece.” According to him, multiple people had already tipped him off that such a story was in the pipeline. Sun Still Calls CZ a Mentor Justin Sun, who’s been the subject of ongoing scrutiny himself, responded calmly to the uproar. “I am not aware of the circulation rumors,” he said in an April 11 post, referring to the allegations. He went on to describe CZ as both a “mentor and close friend,” suggesting no friction between the two on record. Zhao, for his part, appeared to take the situation in stride but warned that such reports may not be isolated incidents. “I also heard some rumors about some players ‘lobbying’ against us again in the US,” he added , alluding to past efforts by FTX to tighten regulatory pressure on Binance. Back in November 2023, Zhao had claimed that FTX actively lobbied for a regulatory clampdown on Binance to grab market share, referencing a Federal Newswire report as evidence. Crypto Lobbying Fuels Distrust in Washington The controversy also comes on the heels of growing concerns over crypto industry influence in U.S. politics. According to a March report by the Center for Political Accountability, crypto-related entities have poured more than $134 million into the 2024 U.S. elections. While intended to shape a favorable regulatory landscape, these political contributions are now raising alarms over transparency and public trust.

Instead, the expert revealed that the current indicators point to the flagship crypto being in a bear market. Bitcoin/VIX Points To A Bear Market: Analyst In an X post, Severino warned that the Bitcoin/VIX isn’t bullish as some crypto influencers might paint it out to be. He remarked that the technical analysis of it suggests that the current signals are what market participants tend to see during Bitcoin bear markets. However, the expert noted that the month isn’t over yet, which suggests that these indicators could still turn bullish. Severino previously highlighted several reasons why he is no longer bullish on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Back then, he alluded to BTC’s chart, which, based on the Elliott Wave theory and other technical indicators, showed that the flagship crypto has likely topped in this market cycle. Amid Severino’s warning, crypto analysts like Saeed have offered a more bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Saeed stated that this correction is simply a healthy retracement and that the flagship crypto’s broader trend is still bullish. The analyst highlighted $85,000 as the level Bitcoin needs to break above to reach new highs. The macro side also looks to be bullish for Bitcoin at the moment. The latest CPI and PPI inflation data, which were released, came in lower than expectations, raising hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut soon. According to a recent report, Boston Fed President Susan Collins also assured that the US central bank is ready to help stabilize the market if necessary. With US President Donald Trump’s tariffs persisting, the US Fed might have to step in soon, which is bullish for Bitcoin and other crypto assets, as more liquidity will flow into them. Bullish Technical Analysis For BTC In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto revealed that Bitcoin is forming an inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern, although it still looks like a clean retest for now. He remarked that if this pattern plays out, the flagship crypto could reach $125,000 this year, marking a new all-time high (ATH). Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin is developing another Higher Low on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) while forming Lower Lows on the price. He noted that throughout the cycle, BTC has formed bullish divergences like this on a few occasions. This is a positive for the flagship crypto, as each divergence has always preceded reversals to the upside, indicating that BTC could again rally to the upside soon.

The approval means the exchange may provide “ ETH staking services for spot ETFs.” HashKey Becomes One of the First Regulated HK Exchanges to Offer Security Services HashKey received approval on April 10, 2025, after receiving guidance on staking services to Licensed Virtual Asset Trading Platforms and authorized funds from the SFC.

It said: “…on April 10 that according to official news, virtual asset exchange HashKey Exchange announced that it had received approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission on April 10, becoming one of the first exchanges in Hong Kong to be approved to provide pledge services. Previously, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) had officially issued an announcement on April 7, issuing regulatory guidelines on the provision of pledge services to licensed virtual asset trading platforms, and providing guidance on their participation in pledge activities to SFC-approved funds (virtual asset funds) that invest in virtual assets.” The Hong Kong securities regulator said it granted the approval after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) learned of and recognized the potential benefits of staking services. In a statement quoted by PANews, the SFC said: “…the CSRC is aware of the potential benefits of staking in enhancing the security of blockchain networks and allowing investors to earn returns from virtual assets in a regulated market environment.” HashKey May Now Launch Ethereum ETF Staking Service HashKey’s managing director, Terence Pu, explained that the SFC approval means HashKey may now offer staking services for spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “This approval is a milestone practice in Hong Kong's virtual asset regulatory innovation. HashKey Exchange has built a staking service system that meets regulatory requirements, taking the lead in providing ETH staking services for spot ETFs, and is actively promoting the provision of staking services to all customers. This service relies on HashKey Cloud's excellent node operation capabilities to provide users with safe and compliant staking services. In the near future, investors will not only be able to hold Ethereum ETFs to obtain staking income, but also directly hold ETH and obtain additional income through our staking services. In the future, we will continue to rely on Hong Kong's unique policy advantages to expand this service to more types of digital assets and provide the market with more compliant and diversified investment products,"" said Terence Pu.

This breakout attempt comes amid a whirlwind of macro and policy developments pushing capital into BTC. China’s Tariff Hike Pushes BTC to $85K Markets were rattled this week after China retaliated against U.S. tariffs , raising duties on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, with threats to expand coverage to another $144 billion. The escalation sent equities sliding—but Bitcoin surged, hitting $85,000 as investors looked for a safe haven amid growing geopolitical tensions.

Florida is proposing a bill to allow public funds to invest in Bitcoin, and North Carolina is working to recognize it as legal tender. These moves come as Bitcoin’s hashrate surged past 120 TH/s, reflecting rising institutional mining interest. The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart shows BTC is still in the “HODL” to “Still Cheap” zone, reinforcing analyst predictions of a climb toward $91,500 as demand rises. Trump Repeals IRS DeFi Rule, Boosting Crypto Sentiment In a major win for the crypto industry, President Trump signed off on the repeal of the IRS DeFi Broker Rule—a regulation that would’ve required decentralized platforms to report user transactions to the IRS. Initially set for 2027, the rule faced backlash for its privacy risks and technical impracticality. JUST IN: Trump signs a bill overturning an IRS rule that expanded the definition of a broker to include decentralized crypto exchanges. The crypto industry argued DeFi platforms can’t comply because they don’t control user data. A huge win for privacy pic.twitter.com/JJ98k3s1q5 — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) April 11, 2025 The repeal—led by Rep. Mike Carey and supported across party lines—marks the first crypto-specific law ever repealed via Congressional Review. Trump’s pro-crypto stance continues to inject confidence into the market, especially for DeFi and institutional players. Bitcoin Gets an Education Boost in the UK Adding to the bullish sentiment, Lomond School in Scotland has become the first UK school to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments, starting Fall 2025. The initiative is part of a broader plan to educate students about “sound money” principles rooted in Austrian economics. JUST IN: Lomond School became the first UK school to accept #Bitcoin for payments. They will “look to build a Bitcoin reserve.” pic.twitter.com/xnBoDBJuip — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 11, 2025 While Bitcoin payments will be converted to fiat immediately, the school is open to starting a Bitcoin treasury in the future. The move mirrors efforts in the U.S., where universities like Wyoming and Austin are building BTC-focused academic programs and treasuries. This expansion into education strengthens Bitcoin’s long-term adoption story, especially among Gen Z. Bitcoin Technical Analysis – April 13, 2025 BTC/USD is holding strong at $84,700, just below resistance at $86,100—a level that marks the upper trendline of a long-term descending channel and a prior supply zone. Support: $82,900 and $80,700 Resistance: $86,100, followed by $88,600 and $90,900 50 EMA: Acting as dynamic support around $81,970 RSI: 61 — signaling strong momentum but nearing overbought levels If bulls can secure a daily close above $86,100 with convincing volume, Bitcoin could quickly target $92,800. On the flip side, a rejection may lead to a brief pullback, but the broader structure remains bullish. BTC Bull Presale: Earn Real Bitcoin with Every Price Milestone BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is gaining traction as one of the most exciting presales in crypto, combining meme culture with real utility. Designed for long-term holders, the token automatically rewards investors with real Bitcoin as BTC reaches major price thresholds—aligning community incentives with Bitcoin’s growth.

These top-tier cryptos continue to lead in adoption and price action—but the most exciting opportunity in the market right now isn’t one of the giants.

PRESALE SELLING OUT — TAP TO SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW! ETH, XRP, BTC, and MAGACOINFINANCE Market Outlook Ethereum (ETH) is holding firm at $1,590 , supported by L2 scalability and institutional interest.

DOGE and SHIBA INU have surged back into the spotlight with a combined weekly trading volume of over $3 billion , sparking renewed excitement across the crypto community. DOGE’s daily volume touched highs not seen since 2021 , while SHIBA is riding a new wave of momentum following ecosystem updates and increased social engagement. But as volume builds, the big question remains — can this momentum last , or are these meme giants peaking before the next wave of tokens takes over? SHIBA’S HISTORIC RUN: 60,000% FROM LOW TO HIGH For context, SHIBA’s rise from obscurity to the top ranks of the crypto market was nothing short of legendary. The token famously delivered a 60,000% ROI from its bottom to its all-time high — creating thousands of new millionaires during its 2021–2022 run. However, with SHIBA already up significantly and now trading billions in weekly volume, the window for massive exponential gains may be narrowing. The same applies to DOGE, whose growth has matured, making it less of a moonshot and more of a cultural mainstay. That’s why savvy investors are looking at the next breakout meme project with early-stage upside — and many believe they’ve found it. ENTER MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE NEW VIRAL MEMECOIN ON THE RISE As DOGE and SHIBA dominate headlines again, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves of its own — positioning itself as the next breakout meme project with real potential to mimic SHIBA’s iconic rise. Backed by a politically charged brand and a buzzing online community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is going viral fast across Telegram, YouTube, and Twitter/X. Unlike late-stage memecoins, this one is still in its early phase, giving investors a rare chance to get in under $0.0003 — a price point reminiscent of SHIBA’s early days. It’s already gaining traction, with crypto KOLs calling it “one of the most explosive early-stage meme tokens of 2025 ,” and its stage-based presale model is pushing engagement to new highs. COULD MAGACOIN FINANCE BE THE NEXT 60,000% WINNER? With SHIBA’s playbook in mind, some analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the one to deliver SHIBA-style returns in this cycle. Early entry, strong branding, and a socially driven ecosystem are all lining up to create a potential moonshot. Of course, nothing is guaranteed — but in a market where the big names are already deep into their cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of asymmetric opportunity that early SHIBA holders once had. FINAL THOUGHTS: TIME TO DIVERSIFY? ⚠️ FINAL HOURS: CLAIM 50% EXTRA BONUS — CODE MAGA50X DOGE and SHIBA are proving that meme season isn’t over — not by a long shot. But with weekly volumes now topping $3B , some traders are looking to reposition before the next meme frenzy begins. For those hunting the next SHIBA-style breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE might just be the alpha play. Early access, viral growth, and under-the-radar entry points under $0.0003 — the ingredients are there.

But while XRP commands attention as a legacy giant navigating regulatory waves, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fast-growing altcoin project — one that analysts are calling an early-stage opportunity with serious upside potential. XRP: STILL A CROWD FAVORITE, BUT GAINS ARE LIMITED XRP continues to draw heavy attention, thanks to its high-profile legal battle with the SEC and the promise of becoming a bridge currency for global payments. Its massive community and institutional exposure ensure it stays in the spotlight — but most analysts agree: the days of 25x or 50x returns are likely behind it. For XRP to deliver that kind of return today, it would need to exceed a multi-trillion-dollar market cap — a stretch even in the most bullish scenarios. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE TOP ALTC0IN TO WATCH IN 2025 While XRP rides on legacy hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as the top altcoin to watch in 2025. With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , the momentum is undeniable. What’s turning heads? A listing target of $0.007 A current presale price (for those tracking) of $0.0002908 That’s a built-in ROI potential of over 25x — or 2,300% gains from early entry to public launch This level of structured growth and anticipation is what’s fueling daily spikes in search interest, especially from retail traders scanning for the next breakout . ANALYST PREDICTIONS: MAGACOIN COULD OUTPERFORM While XRP remains a popular hold, several top analysts have shifted focus to emerging opportunities with higher ceilings. Many now include MAGACOIN FINANCE in their lists of next 30x–35x plays , citing its organic community growth, market timing, and strategic launch phases as key strengths. With Stage 7 moving quickly, and listings expected in the coming weeks, the project continues to climb Google’s trending charts — not just as a curiosity, but as a serious contender in the altcoin arena. FINAL THOUGHTS: MOMENTUM SPEAKS LOUDER THAN HYPE 🔓 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! It’s clear why XRP is still in the conversation.

The Dogecoin ETP will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, trading under the ticker DOGE. A Grand Display of the Growing Support for DOGE Asset manager 21Shares AG (“21Shares”) announced that it formed an “exclusive partnership” with the House of DOGE to create the only Dogecoin ETP endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation. In a press release, 21Shares said the ETP will trade under the ticker ‘DOGE’ and will list on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The partnership underscores the meme coin’s growing support. It marks the first significant milestone “in bringing institutional grade exposure to Dogecoin, one the most community driven and widely recognised digital assets.” The asset manager submitted an S-1 registration statement for its 21Shares Dogecoin ETF to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 9, 2025. If successful, the proposed fund would grant investors direct exposure to DOGE’s price movements without having to own the underlying asset. In its press announcement, 21Shares said, ""21Shares Dogecoin ETP is 100% physically backed, offering a transparent and seamless way for investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through traditional financial channels.” Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged in popularity since its launch in 2013 to become one of the “most widely recognised and accessible cryptocurrencies, known for its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and increasing merchant adoption.” Dogecoin (DOGE) Could Become a Global Currency The House of DOGE, the official corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, is reportedly committed to marketing the ETP when it launches to reinforce DOGE’s role in mainstream media. In the statement announcing the partnership, Jens Wiechers, Co-Executive Director of the Dogecoin Foundation, commented: “For Dogecoin to reach its full potential as a global currency, institutional support and corporate partnerships are essential. This initiative with 21Shares provides a regulated path for institutions to participate in and amplify the ‘Dogecoin is Money’ vision, while still honoring the community’s spirit. Global adoption is critical, and we’re excited to take this next step – ensuring Dogecoin stays fun, but gains the credibility and backing needed to thrive at scale.” Commitment to Expanding Investor Access to Innovative, Community-Driven Assets While DOGE’s technical advantages are commendable, Dogecoin has also successfully built a “highly engaged and socially impactful community” based on a guiding principle of “Do Only Good Everyday.” Duncan Moir, President at 21Shares, said: “Registered investment vehicles are essential for broadening access to digital assets, and Dogecoin’s growing adoption underscores its significance in the crypto ecosystem. By partnering with the House of Doge, we are taking a pivotal step in bringing transparent and institutional-grade investment options to the market. This move reflects our commitment to expanding investor access to innovative and community-driven assets while maintaining the highest regulatory and operational standards.” Sarosh Mistry, President and CEO of Sodexo North America and Director-Elect of House of Doge, also commented on the partnership. “Our partnership with 21Shares demonstrates the evolving maturity and legitimacy of Dogecoin in the financial world. Institutional products will empower new types of investors to participate in the Dogecoin ecosystem, reinforcing its role as a leader in the future of digital assets.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BTC price recovered and gained a hold above $84K following a crash to as low as $74K in the past 7 days. Simultaneously, other tokens like ETH, Solana, and XRP also illustrated a price rebound, keeping investors slightly hopeful about future movements amid macro uncertainty. Following immense macro heat fueled by Donald Trump’s tariffs saga, risk assets have recovered amid a halt on newly imposed tariffs and other developments. Mentioned below are some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Weekly Crypto Highlights: BTC & Altcoins Recover As of press time, BTC price exchanged hands considerably above $84K, up by nearly 1.5% in the past seven days. Further, ETH, SOL, and XRP prices gained roughly 2%-7% over the week. This recovery-like movement comes against the backdrop of a stockpile of optimistic developments. Notably, macro pressure on risk assets like crypto lessened slightly as the U.S. CPI came in cooler than Wall Street expectations this week. US CPI cooled to 2.4% in March, offering the crypto market some relief after turmoil caused by Trump’s Tariff policy. On the other hand, Donald Trump recently announced that tech products will be exempted from China tariffs . While an already ongoing halt on the newly imposed tariffs has offered the market some relief, this news has further garnered investor curiosity, lessening trade war tensions. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink rattled the broader market recently by warning of a looming U.S. recession soon. Given this happens, cryptocurrencies could leverage substantially as the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to inject more liquidity in order to stimulate the economy. Other Major Highlights This Week Additionally, whale activity across the broader crypto market soared remarkably in the past seven days, signaling renewed market interest amid price recovery. CoinGape reported that Ripple whales moved a staggering $414 million worth of XRP over the past week, sparking investor speculations. Simultaneously, Dogecoin whales were also recorded to have accumulated 1.83 billion DOGE coins over the past week. The massive buying by Dogecoin whales falls in line with 21Shares’ recent filing for a Dogecoin ETF, echoing market optimism. Another buzz-worthy update over the week includes Japan introducing new crypto regulations , underscoring support for the sector. Mentioned above were the top crypto highlights for this week, which appeared to have considerably impacted investor sentiment globally.
