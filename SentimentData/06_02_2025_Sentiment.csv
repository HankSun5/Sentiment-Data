MicroStrategy Founder Causes Speculation Amid Bitcoin Holdings Pause Saylor posted on X on February 5 , calling it a “Big strategy day.” The social media post prompted mass speculation from members of the cryptocurrency community, receiving over 3,900 reposts and 30,000 likes. “Rebrand from MicroStrategy to MacroStrategy?” one X user inquired . “What are you up to?” another replied . ₿ig Strategy Day — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 5, 2025 On Monday, the Virginia-based company announced that it had paused Bitcoin purchases under its at-the-market equity offering program, though it did not sell any of its class A common stock. A February 3 SEC filing revealed that MicroStrategy, led by CEO Phong Le, holds 471,107 BTC, acquired for $30.4 billion at an average price of $64,511 per coin. MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, spending over $20 billion to build its reserves. Last month, MicroStrategy shareholders approved two amendments related to Class A common stock and preferred stock options, potentially impacting the company’s capital structure. In October 2023, MicroStrategy introduced its “21/21 plan,” targeting $42 billion in equity and fixed-income securities to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions through 2027. Michael Saylor Signals Interest in Shaping Crypto Regulations Saylor, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, acknowledged the impact of President Donald Trump’s election on the cryptocurrency’s value after its sharp post-election rally. Trump has pledged to reduce federal enforcement actions against the digital asset sector, a stance Saylor has publicly supported. However, Trump’s recent tariff policies have introduced uncertainty in crypto markets, contributing to fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price after its postelection rally. While Saylor has not revealed specific details about his strategy, he stated in an interview with Bloomberg that he would be open to advising Trump on digital asset policies.

Analysts believe XRP and Remittix could usurp Ethereum and Solana as the best cryptos to buy now that the bull market has nearly begun. While XRP is an older-established coin with a high value in terms of market cap, Remittix is currently in presale. Nevertheless, it is a runner, and its price is forecasted to go up proportionately to PayFi’s development. It is also one of the best coins to buy at current times. While Remittix is still on presale and will launch on major exchanges over the next few weeks, XRP is a top ten cryptocurrency by market cap, currently trading at less than three dollars. XRP to Overtake Ethereum and Solana: Analysts The initial verdict from crypto analysts and spectators was that Ethereum and Solana would dominate this cycle. However, that sentiment has changed. Analysts now believe XRP and the new crypto, Remittix, will be the biggest drivers for the next crypto rally. If they are right, both altcoins could go on a massive price surge once the bull run begins. Venture capital companies such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck are currently in contention for an XRP ETF. If their proposals are approved, it could cause the XRP price to surge in the market. That’s why even though the XRP price is currently dipping in the market and has fallen below three dollars, analysts believe it will be the primary driver of this cycle alongside Remittix. The prominent Ripple price prediction is ten dollars by the end of the cycle. Remittix To Surge 100x After Launch: Analysts Crypto analysts speculate that Remittix could surge 100x after it launches on major exchanges. Remiitix, which is still on presale has impressed the crypto community over the past few weeks and has emerged as one of the best crypto to buy now. Remittix has already raised over $10.6 million in its presale and is on course to hit its $36 million target in the next few weeks. After that, the token will likely launch on popular crypto exchanges like Uniswap. Remittix could potentially become a category leader in the PayFi sector and the broader payments sector, which is valued at over a quadrillion dollars. It is poised to gain relevance due to its features, which combine centralized and decentralized payment methods to solve issues in the payments sector, such as speed, costs, and accessibility. Since RTX powers the Remittix ecosystem, its price could surge quickly once it gets listed due to the growing demand for crypto payment solutions, and that’s why many experts consider it the best crypto to buy now. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana were the biggest drivers of the last crypto rally. While many thought they would also drive this rally, analysts have speculated that it will be XRP and Remittix. The XRP price is in free fall but can begin to climb when an XRP ETF is approved by the SEC. On the other hand, Remittix has amazed everyone in its presale, and analysts have rated it the best crypto to buy now. Join the presale and community now!

Instead, they now anticipate that XRP and Remittix will take center stage. Analysts are betting on XRP and Remittix to potentially replace Ethereum and Solana as the top picks as the bull market is about to kick off. While XRP is a well-established cryptocurrency with a significant market cap, Remittix is still in its presale phase. Despite being new, it is gaining momentum, and its value is expected to rise alongside PayFi’s growth, making it an attractive investment right now. Although Remittix remains in presale and is set to debut on major exchanges in the coming weeks, XRP stands as a top-ten cryptocurrency by market cap, with its trading price under three dollars. Analysts Predict XRP Will Surpass Ethereum and Solana Initially, the consensus among crypto analysts and enthusiasts was that Ethereum and Solana would lead this cycle. However, opinions have shifted. Experts now assert that XRP, along with the new player Remittix, will be pivotal in driving the next wave of crypto growth. If correct, these altcoins could experience significant price increases once the bull market is in full swing. Venture capital firms like Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck are competing to launch an XRP ETF. If their initiatives get the green light, it might trigger a substantial uptick in the XRP price. Thus, even though the XRP price is currently seeing a downturn and has dropped below three dollars, analysts are confident it will be a major force in this cycle, alongside Remittix. The leading prediction for Ripple’s price is a rise to ten dollars by the cycle’s end. Analysts Predict Remittix to Skyrocket 100x Post-Launch Crypto analysts are forecasting that Remittix could increase by 100x once it starts trading on major exchanges. Remittix, which is still in its presale stage, has captured the attention of the crypto community and is considered one of the best crypto investments at present. Remittix has already garnered over $10.6 million during its presale and is on track to meet its $36 million goal in the coming weeks, paving the way for its launch on major platforms like Uniswap. Remittix is poised to become a leader in the PayFi industry and the larger payments sector, which is valued at over a quadrillion dollars. Its innovative features, which integrate centralized and decentralized payment methods, aim to address key challenges in the payments sector such as speed, cost, and accessibility. With RTX at the heart of the Remittix system, its price is likely to climb rapidly once listed, driven by the increasing demand for crypto payment solutions, making it a top recommendation among experts for investment now. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana were the main catalysts of the previous crypto surge. Though initially expected to lead again, analysts now suggest that XRP and Remittix will take the spotlight this time. Although the XRP price is currently experiencing a decline, it could begin to rise if an XRP ETF gains SEC approval. Meanwhile, Remittix has impressed during its presale, earning it the distinction of the best crypto to invest in now. Join the presale and community now!

Pham said the agency will gather experts for a roundtable meeting , probably next month, that can build a case for how the commission ought to approach regulation and oversight of firms that offer betting on event contracts. She noted that despite her continued objections in recent years to former Chairman Rostin Behnam's enforcement stance against prediction markets — including wagers made on sporting events and U.S. political outcomes — the agency moved too far on its path to easily reverse it. ""Unfortunately, the undue delay and anti-innovation policies of the past several years have severely restricted the CFTC’s ability to pivot to common-sense regulation of prediction markets,” Pham said. ""The current commission interpretations regarding event contracts are a sinkhole of legal uncertainty and an inappropriate constraint on the new administration."" Setting up the roundtable is a ""necessary first step in order to establish a holistic regulatory framework that will both foster thriving prediction markets and protect retail customers from binary options fraud such as deceptive and abusive marketing and sales practices,"" Pham said. The CFTC lost an initial court case against Kalshi when a U.S. federal judge ruled late last year that the agency couldn't stop the firm from listing election contracts. However, the agency pursued an appeal with a higher court, and Kalshi argued in that new legal dispute that only Congress can halt election betting . Read More: CFTC Fines Crypto Betting Service Polymarket $1.4M for Unregistered Swaps The CFTC had taken a position through rules, orders and enforcement work that such political betting isn't permitted under derivatives laws and that the agency doesn't have the ability to police manipulation of those markets — basically arguing that it would have to be an elections cop. With only days remaining in his chairmanship, Behnam's agency was seeking information about Polymarket's customers from crypto exchange Coinbase. In language that's a sharp contrast from Behnam's resistance, Pham called prediction markets ""an important new frontier in harnessing the power of markets to assess sentiment to determine probabilities that can bring truth to the Information Age."" She added the agency needs to ""break with its past hostility.""

So far, the president has only picked a head for its cousin regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

From the likes of Bonk to DogWifHat, these tokens have not only entertained but also enriched their investors. Today, we're diving deep into the memecoin market to explore which could be the next big memecoin to offer astronomical returns. Among the contenders, Panshibi stands out, promising to merge the charm of pandas with the power of community-driven crypto. DogWifHat: The memecoin That Keeps on Giving DogWifHat, or WIF, has been a fan favorite since its inception. It is known for its Shiba Inu wearing a pink knitted hat and consistent community support. In 2024, Ansem, a huge whale on X(formerly Twitter) tweeted about DogWifHat multiple times. However, 2025 has started with low volatility for DogWifHat. This token has simply continued its down trend which started as far back as November. This downturn is a sign for DogWifHat investors to diversify, perhaps towards newer and better options like Panshibi. Although DogWifHat has an established base and a potential for community-driven events, a significant price change will not happen in a long time due to the current market turbulence. Bonk: The Underdog with Potential Bonk, known as the first dog-themed memecoin on the Solana blockchain, initially made waves with its community-focused airdrops. However, recent analyses suggest a dip in whale activity and a lack of significant utility features, which might be pushing Bonk investors towards new horizons like Panshibi. Although Bonk has launched various community activities like BonkDragon, the effect of this is yet to be seen as its price is currently on a downtrend. Despite this, Bonk remains a popular choice among memecoin enthusiasts. Since its market behavior indicates a potential for either recovery or further decline, experts are saying Bonk is a memecoin to watch from the sidelines. The Next Big Memecoin: Where to Place Your Bets? The memecoin market is notoriously unpredictable, but certain attributes stand out when looking for the next big memecoin. Panshibi, with its strategic community engagement, secure tokenomics, and a clear growth path, might just be that rocket ship. Its integration of AI and social-fi not only adds layers of utility but also keeps the community engaged. While Bonk and DogWifHat have their merits, Panshibi's innovative approach and community-centric model make it a strong contender for the next 20,000% memecoin. With the value of the memecoin market skyrocketing $115 billion in January 2025, there is a robust investor interest in memecoins and what they have to offer.. The Rise of Panshibi: A memecoin with a Mission Panshibi is inspired by the beloved panda as it aims to unite three massive communities under one project. These communities include Asia, pandas, and memecoin enthusiasts. Panshibiintroduces a blend of social-fi and AI elements, where token holders can engage in quests and earn rewards and prizes. With its native token, $SHIBI, Panshibi offers governance rights which allows buyers to determine their future. Also, staking opportunities are available with up to 1,200% APY, and exclusive access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. The whitepaper of Panshibi outlines a clear roadmap, emphasizing security with a 10-year liquidity lock and a 2-year team token lock. Although the presale is capped at $10 million, there is still enough time for you to buy in before it runs out. The price of one SHIBI is now $0.004 as the token is in Stage 3 of the presale . Also, there is a structure in place to increase the token price by 1,200% during this period. With predictions of a 145,000% surge post-launch, this coin is set to change the market forever. The smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, ensuring transparency and trust. After the presale, the ownership of the token will be renounced, handing the reins over to the community. With its current presale price at $0.004 (Stage 3), and plans for listing on Uniswap and major CEXs, Panshibi is shaping up to be the memecoin to watch in 2025. Conclusion As we navigate through the memecoin landscape, Panshibi emerges as a serious contender for significant growth. With its strategic presale, community engagement, and secure tokenomics, it's positioned to possibly outshine established names like Bonk and DogWifHat. While the future of memecoins is always speculative, Panshibi's blend of fun, community, and financial strategy makes it a memecoin to watch and emphasizes its potential to lead the next big memecoin boom in 2025.

This makes it a top choice for DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, and NFT marketplaces that require fast, cheap transactions. With its low-cost transactions and growing institutional adoption, Polygon remains one of the top cryptos to buy this month for those looking for a strong Ethereum-based investment. Celestia (TIA): The Future of Modular Blockchain Networks Celestia (TIA) is currently trading at $0.1602 and is one of the most exciting projects in modular blockchain technology.

With the rising demand for modular blockchain frameworks, Celestia is positioned to be a leader in on-chain scalability. It’s a must-watch for anyone looking at long-term investments in blockchain infrastructure.

From Bonk to DogWifHat, these tokens have both amused and financially benefited their investors. Today, we delve into the memecoin market to pinpoint which one might be the next major memecoin poised for extraordinary gains. Among the promising candidates, Panshibi stands out by blending the appeal of pandas with the strength of a community-focused cryptocurrency. DogWifHat: The Memecoin That Continues to Deliver DogWifHat, often abbreviated as WIF, has been a popular choice since it was first introduced. Famous for its Shiba Inu mascot sporting a pink hat, it enjoys unwavering community support. In 2024, Ansem, a notable whale on X (formerly Twitter), frequently tweeted about DogWifHat. However, as 2025 begins, the token faces low volatility. This ongoing decline, which started back in November, signals investors to consider diversifying into other options like Panshibi. Despite having a loyal following and potential for community-led events, significant price shifts for DogWifHat might not be forthcoming due to the current market conditions. Bonk: A Dark Horse with Promise Bonk, recognized as the first dog-inspired memecoin on the Solana network, initially gained attention with its community-centric airdrops. However, recent evaluations point to a decrease in whale involvement and a lack of substantial utility features, potentially steering Bonk investors toward new opportunities like Panshibi. Though it has initiated community projects like BonkDragon, their impact is yet to be felt as its value continues to decline. Nonetheless, Bonk remains a beloved option for memecoin fans. Given the current market trends, which suggest either a potential rebound or further drop, experts recommend observing Bonk closely. Finding the Next Big Memecoin: Where Should You Invest? The memecoin market is famously volatile, yet some features are key when identifying the next big memecoin. Panshibi, with its focused community interaction, solid tokenomics, and a well-defined growth strategy, could be that next explosive opportunity. Its integration of AI and social-fi not only adds utility layers but also keeps the community actively involved. While Bonk and DogWifHat have their strengths, Panshibi's innovative tactics and community-focused approach make it a strong candidate for being the next 20,000% memecoin. With the memecoin market value soaring to $115 billion by January 2025, there is a growing investor interest in what memecoins can deliver. The Emergence of Panshibi: A Memecoin on a Mission Panshibi is inspired by the iconic panda, aiming to bring together three large communities: Asia, panda lovers, and memecoin enthusiasts. It combines social-fi with AI features, allowing token holders to participate in quests and earn prizes. Holding the $SHIBI token in Panshibi grants governance rights, empowering investors to shape its future. It also offers staking opportunities with up to 1,200% APY and access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. The whitepaper details a secure path with a 10-year liquidity lock and a 2-year team token lock. The presale is capped at $10 million, but there is still time to invest before it closes. Currently, one SHIBI is priced at $0.004 as the token is in Stage 3 of the presale . The price is set to rise by 1,200% during this phase, and with forecasts predicting a 145,000% increase post-launch, this coin is poised to make a lasting impact on the market. The smart contract has been thoroughly reviewed by Coinsult, guaranteeing transparency and reliability. Following the presale, the token's ownership will be relinquished, allowing the community to take control. Priced at $0.004 in its current presale stage (Stage 3), and with plans to list on Uniswap and major CEXs, Panshibi is emerging as the memecoin to watch in 2025. Conclusion As we explore the evolving memecoin scene, Panshibi stands out as a promising candidate for substantial growth. With its well-structured presale, active community involvement, and solid tokenomics, it is well-positioned to potentially surpass established names like Bonk and DogWifHat. Although the future of memecoins remains uncertain, Panshibi's mix of entertainment, community, and financial strategy makes it a memecoin worth monitoring and highlights its potential to lead the next big memecoin wave in 2025.

Will liquidity rotate back, or is the dream of another altseason fading for good? Table of Contents Altcoins under pressure Bitcoin’s growing dominance What needs to change for an altcoin rally? How on-chain speculation is disrupting the altcoin market Bitcoin’s repricing and Ethereum’s quiet accumulation Altcoins under pressure On Feb. 3, global financial markets suffered a sharp flash crash after Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, triggering a sell-off across global markets. Stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies reacted immediately, with altcoins taking the biggest hit. At the end of January, the total altcoin market cap stood at $1.46 trillion, but by Feb. 3, it had plunged to $1 trillion,marking a 31.5% decline and wiping out $460 billion in market value. Total crypto market cap chart excluding Bitcoin | Source: TradingView Since then, the market has shown some signs of recovery, climbing to $1.22 trillion as of this writing on Feb. 5. However, it remains nearly 16% below its January levels and 28% short of its all-time high of $1.71 trillion from November 2021. The overall sentiment in the altcoin market remains weak. One key indicator for measuring whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin is the CMC Altcoin Season Index, which tracks the performance of the top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. As of Feb. 5, the index sits at 36, a sharp drop from 87 in December 2024, when altcoins surged following Trump’s election victory. A reading above 50 suggests a mild altcoin rally, while above 75 signals a full-fledged altcoin season. At its current level, the index indicates that Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market, with altcoins struggling to gain traction. Price performance among major altcoins also reflects this sentiment. Ethereum ( ETH ) has declined over 18% year to date, currently trading at around $2,800. Solana ( SOL ) has seen modest growth, rising 5% since the start of the year to reach $205. Meanwhile, Ripple ( XRP ) has been one of the best-performing large-cap altcoins, gaining 21% year to date and surging 360% over the past three months. With institutional interest in Bitcoin continuing to rise, the question remains: Will altcoins see a strong rally in 2025, or will Bitcoin’s dominance persist? Let’s find out. Bitcoin’s growing dominance Bitcoin’s growing dominance in the market has created a bottleneck for altcoins, preventing capital from flowing into them as it did in previous cycles. As of Feb. 5, Bitcoin accounts for 61.5% of the total crypto market cap, its highest level since early 2021. This means that for every dollar invested in crypto, over 61 cents go into Bitcoin, leaving around 39 cents for the thousands of other coins combined. Just two months ago, in December 2024, when altcoins found some footing, this number was 54%, highlighting how quickly Bitcoin has regained its hold over the market. To understand why this is happening, it helps to look at historical trends. Bitcoin dominance tends to rise during uncertain times. The collapse of FTX ( FTT ) in November 2022 is a prime example. When trust in the broader crypto market weakened, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at just 40%. In the following months, however, investors increasingly moved their capital into Bitcoin, pushing its market share past 64% recently. A similar pattern played out between 2018 and early 2021. During that period, Bitcoin’s dominance climbed from 35% to 63% before gradually declining as altcoins began outperforming. But this time, there is a key difference — institutions. Since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, Bitcoin has been absorbing an unprecedented amount of liquidity. As of this writing, spot BTC ETFs hold over $120 billion in assets under management, with large financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the charge. At the same time, discussions about a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. have been gaining traction. If governments start viewing Bitcoin as a hedge, the capital rotation cycle that previously fueled altcoin rallies could take much longer to materialize. Unlike previous cycles, where capital eventually rotated into altcoins, institutions are now accumulating Bitcoin, keeping liquidity concentrated and limiting capital flow into altcoins. What needs to change for an altcoin rally? Historically, capital in crypto markets has moved in phases. Bitcoin absorbs liquidity first, leading market rallies. Once BTC stabilizes, funds rotate into altcoins, triggering an altcoin season. This pattern was evident in 2017 when Bitcoin’s dominance peaked at 70%, paving the way for ETH and XRP to surge in early 2018. A similar trend played out in 2021 when Bitcoin reached $69,000 before altcoins gained traction. Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong, forming higher highs and higher lows—signs that liquidity is still concentrated in BTC. For altcoins to gain momentum, Bitcoin needs a prolonged stabilization period, allowing capital to rotate. A drop in Bitcoin dominance below key support levels would indicate investors shifting funds. Additionally, catalysts such as Ethereum upgrades, regulatory clarity, or broader adoption could accelerate this transition. Another factor slowing capital rotation is the growing presence of institutional investors. Unlike retail traders, institutions tend to make calculated, long-term investments, meaning they are less likely to chase short-term trends in altcoins as seen in past cycles. However, if Bitcoin dominance does start to decline, the rotation process will likely follow the established sequence: large-cap altcoins move first, followed by mid-caps, and then smaller, speculative projects. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern. How on-chain speculation is disrupting the altcoin market The way speculative capital moves in the crypto market has changed, and that shift could be one of the biggest reasons why a traditional altcoin season has yet to materialize. Analyst Miles Deutscher highlights the role of Pump.fun , a platform he says has “directly correlated to the destruction of the altcoin market vs BTC.” The launch of Pump Fun is directly correlated to the destruction of the altcoin market vs $BTC . 👇 The reason we've seen no major ""alt season"" across majors, is because the speculative capital that would've once poured into top 200 assets, instead decided to jump the gun and… pic.twitter.com/g04L2SCar2 — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) February 4, 2025 He explains that in previous cycles, speculative capital would have flowed into top 200 altcoins on centralized exchanges. Instead, much of that liquidity is now flooding into on-chain, low-cap tokens, many of which lack proper liquidity. This new trend has created an uneven market dynamic. “The early birds & insiders got insanely rich from this,” Deutscher notes, but he adds that most retail investors who entered late lost money — just as they did in previous altcoin cycles. However, unlike 2022, when retail losses were mostly limited to relatively liquid altcoins listed on centralized exchanges, this time, capital is locked in illiquid meme tokens, many of which have already retraced 70–80%. According to Deutscher, this shift has made the wealth destruction event even worse than what was seen in early 2022, despite Bitcoin and a few major altcoins remaining in a macro bull trend. Deutscher attributes this shift partly to regulatory uncertainty, stating that traders have been forced to look for alternative ways to speculate due to restrictions on fair project launches. “I don’t blame Pump Fun, as its launch is in direct response to the brash crypto regulation that has made it impossible to fair-launch projects.” He adds that the industry has struggled to find a fair model for new projects since 2017, with airdrops being the closest alternative. Bitcoin’s repricing and Ethereum’s quiet accumulation While altcoins struggle with liquidity, analyst The Bitcoin Therapist believes that Bitcoin’s current price does not reflect its true value. “Something is terribly wrong with the market’s pricing of Bitcoin. We are easily $50K–$100K undervalued,” he states, suggesting that a violent repricing event could be imminent. Something is terribly wrong with the market’s pricing of Bitcoin. We are easily $50K-$100K undervalued. There is far too much to be bullish about. There is going to be a violent repricing. — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) February 5, 2025 If this is the case, Bitcoin’s dominance may remain elevated for much longer than expected. Historically, Bitcoin has gone through rapid repricing phases when institutional demand outpaces supply, which may be happening now. However, as Matthew Hyland points out, the recent crash was also the largest liquidation event in crypto history, meaning a quick recovery should not be expected. “In 2020 & 2022, it took over two months for the full recovery to take place,” he notes. Considering this was the largest liquidation event in #Crypto history it likely means the low is in however in 2020 & 2022 it took over 2 months for the full recovery to take place You likely wont see those December highs on most #Alts for a minimum of 2 months if not longer so… pic.twitter.com/t5Zah7SN6s — Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) February 4, 2025 Hyland cautions investors against expecting an immediate return to prior highs, particularly for altcoins. Even during the rapid rebound of 2020, there were multiple dips along the way. “You likely won’t see those December highs on most alts for a minimum of two months, if not longer,” he says, adding that previous high-volatility events — such as the COVID crash, LUNA collapse, and FTX fallout — all took months to recover from. Ethereum, meanwhile, is quietly seeing large accumulation from major players. Analyst Naiive highlights that Donald Trump, through his project World Liberty Financial, has reportedly purchased $200 million in ETH, while Fidelity and BlackRock have accumulated $49.75 million and $300 million in ETH, respectively. Donald Trump bought $200M ETH Fidelity bought $49.75M ETH yesterday BlackRock bought $300M ETH today naiive bought $69 in ETH today Whales are shaking weak hands out — naiive (@naiivememe) February 5, 2025 This pattern suggests that whales are strategically shaking out weak hands, taking advantage of market uncertainty to accumulate at lower prices. If institutional ETH accumulation continues, Ethereum could act as a leading indicator for broader altcoin demand. When Ethereum starts gaining against Bitcoin, it often signals early capital rotation into large-cap altcoins, which can eventually trickle down to mid-caps and smaller assets. But until Bitcoin’s dominance shows signs of weakening, the altcoin recovery remains in a waiting phase. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Remittix is the altcoin project that analysts say could mirror the gains of Dogecoin, Cardano, and Toncoin, some of the top players in the space. Remittix (RTX) is the PayFi project that is on investors’ must-have list because of its tangible solutions to the limitations of the finance space. Its native RTX altcoin has raised over $10.6 million in its ongoing presale, and because of its distinct crypto-to-FIAT model, Remittix has been dubbed the XRP 2.0. Find out why! Dogecoin’s Downturn Continues As Analyst Predicts Continued Correction Grayscale, a prominent asset manager, released a Dogecoin Trust , and because the firm is known for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, experts believe that DOGE could scale to more than just a meme coin. Shortly after the launch of the Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale also filled out a form to convert the trust into an ETF. This development has caused a stir among DOGE holders who look forward to Dogecoin’s mainstream debut as more than a meme coin. However, top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared that DOGE may face a steep price correction because of its bearish crossover. DOGE has declined over 18% within the last seven days, and its price sits at $0.258 due to bearish sentiment. That’s why RTX outpaces it in its contributions to cross-border space. Analyst Says Cardano Could Reach $14 Cardano’s historical trends have caught the attention of investors who believe ADA could replicate its results. Javon Marks, a popular crypto analyst, identified ADA’s key resistance and shared that the project could surge past $7. Lucky , another popular crypto commentator, shared that ADA was a long-term project and a solid bet for those who want to boost their portfolios. ADA trades at $0.71, declining over 19% within the last seven days, yet many experts remain optimistic about Cardano’s future prospects. However, ADA holders turn to RTX’s token presale to get their hands on its bullish potential. Can TON Reach $6? Analyst Studies Its Movement Toncoin’s partnership with Telegram has increased the project’s adoption and contributions to blockchain integration. Neucaster recently shared in a post on X that TON could see a significant price increase in the coming weeks. The analysts stated that Toncoin could witness a massive rally that could push its price to $6; hence, the project’s partnership with Telegram has drawn more investors to the platform. TON trades at about $3.95, declining over 18% within the last seven days, but analysts say that it could reach $14.9 by March. Yet, Toncoin investors look to RTX as one of the best coins to buy now for massive returns this year. Remittix’s Presale Nears The $15 Million Mark Due To Its Unique Appeal Remittix’s token presale has gained significant momentum due to its cross-border technology. The Remittix presale has raised over $10.6 million, with each RTX token priced at $0.0539.

Given the firm's reputation for handling Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, many believe DOGE could evolve beyond its meme coin status. Following the introduction of the Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale also filed to transform the trust into an ETF. This announcement has created excitement among DOGE investors who are eager to see Dogecoin's journey into mainstream finance. Nonetheless, leading analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that DOGE might encounter a significant price dip due to its bearish trend. DOGE has fallen by over 18% in the past week, with its value currently at $0.258, hindered by negative market sentiment. This is one reason why RTX surpasses it in terms of contributions to the cross-border financial sector.

Dogecoin whales purchase up to 560 million Doge in a week Recent analysis from experts suggest Dogecoin’s biggest investors are back in the game.

Transactions higher than $100,000 have increased recently, indicating a strategic gobbling up of the asset amongst investors. Popular analyst, Ali Martinez, spoke about Dogecoin’s price on his X account on January 31st. He disclosed that whale investors have gathered 560 million DOGE tokens in seven days. This marked increase in whales activity occurred after the crypto market saw a prolonged reduction in price. The increase in whales activity also points to the fact that many investors are choosing to liquidate their tokens to make profit - all due to bearish movement of Dogecoin’s price. The bearish momentum and unprecedented reduction in price has caused Dogecoin’s market to experience a significant sell off. With whale investors getting back in action, experts predict some positive changes in the long run. Experts predict Dogecoin price to experience significant rally With the recent increase in whales’ activity, experts suggest the drop in Dogecoin price is in preparation for a significant rally. Popular crypto analyst and trader, Tardigrade, recently shared a price chart, showing previous trends when Dogecoin increased to new marks. Experts believe the coin’s recent price trend is similar to these previous trends, so investors could be experiencing significant gains in the near future. Like in 2017, when Dogecoin’s price went to its highest level, Tardigrade believes the same thing could happen in 2025. Experts also predict an imminent increase of ATH to $3.80. Dogecoin whales and the new panda meme, Panshibi Without any doubt, Dogecoin continues to dominate the meme coin section of the crypto world.

Dogecoin Whales Acquire 560 Million DOGE in One Week New insights from experts indicate that Dogecoin's top investors are re-engaging actively. Various analysts have reported that these major players are expanding their Dogecoin portfolios. The frequency of transactions exceeding $100,000 has risen lately, reflecting a deliberate accumulation strategy among investors. Well-known analyst Ali Martinez discussed Dogecoin’s price on his X account on January 31st. He revealed that whale investors gathered 560 million DOGE tokens over the course of a week. This significant uptick in whales activity followed a prolonged decline in the crypto market. The surge in whales activity also suggests that many investors are offloading their tokens to capitalize on profits amid Dogecoin's bearish price trends. The prevailing downward trend and drastic price drop has led to a notable sell-off in Dogecoin’s market. With whale investors returning, experts foresee potential positive shifts in the future. Experts Anticipate a Major Dogecoin Price Rally The recent uptick in whale activity has led experts to believe that the dip in Dogecoin price is a precursor to a major rally. Renowned crypto analyst and trader, Tardigrade, recently shared a price chart highlighting past trends when Dogecoin hit new highs. Experts see the current price movement as reminiscent of previous trends, suggesting investors might soon see substantial returns. Just as in 2017, when Dogecoin’s price peaked, Tardigrade anticipates a similar occurrence by 2025. Experts are also predicting a near-term all-time high increase to $3.80.

39969876,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=669318,1738798184,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39969876.jpeg,Treasury Secretary Bessent says Trump is “not calling for the Fed to lower interest rates”,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/treasury-secretary-bessent-says-trump-is-not-calling-for-the-fed-to-lower-interest-rates/,"Scott Bessent, president Donald Trump’s handpicked Treasury Secretary, put an end to the speculation during a Wednesday interview on Fox Business. The president is not pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, Scott said. Instead, he claims that the administration’s focus is laser-locked on long-term borrowing costs, specifically the 10-year Treasury yield. “He and I are focused on the 10-year Treasury,” Scott said. “He is not calling for the Fed to lower rates.” Scott’s claims are a bit odd since as Cryptopolitan reported on Jan. 24, Trump did say “I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us all over.” Tariff tactics and manufacturing goals Scott then laid out exactly why long-term yields are more important to Trump’s economic strategy, explaining that expanding the US energy supply will help curb inflation. With inflation strangling consumers and businesses, the administration is betting that lower energy costs will have a knock-on effect, making goods cheaper and long-term borrowing more manageable. But not everyone is clapping for these guys. Democrats are seething after Scott gave Elon Musk’s controversial D.O.G.E department access to federal Treasury data, a decision that triggered accusations of recklessness and even protests outside the Hill. In the interview, Scott defended the decision head-on, saying, “The US has a serious spending problem, which is fast becoming a detrimental economic problem. My focus is on the national debt and the budget deficit. I want to bring it down and increase the GDP. D.O.G.E is exactly what we need.” Scott also went full steam ahead on Trump’s trade policy, explaining how the administration is using tariffs as a weapon to revive domestic industries. Medical supplies and shipbuilding are high on the list of targeted sectors. Tariff threats against Colombia, Mexico, and Canada, he said, were designed to pressure them into cooperating on immigration and trade-related issues. But the ultimate objective, according adding Scott, is to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US “We’re aiming for long-term growth,” he said, hinting that once American factories are up and running, the revenue generated by tariffs will naturally drop off. Trump’s team is playing the long game — squeeze trading partners now to create a self-sufficient industrial base later, said Scott. Despite criticizing former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s strategy before taking office, Scott is keeping much of her framework in place for now. Next week, the Treasury will auction $125 billion in long-term debt, with sales broken down into 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year maturities. The auctions include $58 billion in 3-year notes, $42 billion in 10-year notes, and $25 billion in 30-year bonds. These auctions are designed to raise $18.8 billion in new cash, and for now, Scott isn’t making any drastic changes to the way Treasury handles long-term borrowing. But why stick with Yellen’s plan when he previously criticized it? Simple—Scott is playing it cool, letting the dust settle before shaking things up. And while Treasury insiders are itching for tweaks, especially to long-term issuance, Scott is choosing stability over chaos. Debt ceiling constraints and Fed quantitative tightening The federal debt ceiling, reinstated after a suspension in mid-2023, has forced Scott’s department into “extraordinary measures” to avoid breaching the limit. Treasury officials warned that these debt ceiling constraints could make Treasury bill issuance more volatile than usual. The department also announced it would rely heavily on short-term cash management bills to navigate the crisis until Congress either raises or suspends the cap. Another complication comes from the Federal Reserve’s ongoing quantitative tightening program, which is sucking $25 billion worth of Treasuries out of circulation each month. With fewer buyers in the market, the Treasury is being forced to rethink its borrowing strategy. In his interview, Scott said he is keeping a close eye on when the Fed might slow—or fully stop—this policy. Dealers now expect QT to end sometime in the summer, slightly later than the original spring estimate, creating additional pressure on Treasury’s borrowing needs by 2025. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), a group of Wall Street players and economists, has urged the department to modify its forward guidance to reflect market unpredictability. Some members of the panel want the language scrapped altogether, but others prefer more cautious adjustments. Scott isn’t letting them call the shots. Responding to TBAC’s recommendations, he reminded everyone that their advice is just that—advice. “The Treasury decides.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-05 23:29:44

South Korean Police Arrest 90; More to Come? The Busan Metropolitan Police Agency arrested the group on suspicion of violating the Narcotics Control Act. Officers remanded 18 suspects in custody. Police released photos of instant coffee mix containers the group allegedly used to smuggle drugs into South Korea. (Source: Busan Metropolitan Police Agency) Officers said they had started monitoring the suspects “from September last year.” Their investigation comes as a result of a “drugs crackdown” centered on nine Vietnamese-run bars and clubs in the cities of Sejong, Daegu, Cheonan, Asan, and Jincheon. The police said that the gang “systematically smuggled drugs” into South Korea. The group then allegedly “distributed them” in the bars and other clubs. A spokesperson said the gang members “smuggled drugs into the country,” disguising their illegal cargo “as packets of coffee and vitamins.” Officers claim the gang entered South Korea “on education, employment, or marriage visas.” However, police officials added that “some of the suspects” are “illegal residents.” The police think that the gang brought 1.04 billion won ($721,000) worth of narcotics into the country. Officers think that the group succeeded in selling 710 million won (almost half a million USD) worth of this amount to club and bar patrons. Police investigators raid a nightclub associated with the drug raid. (Source: Busan Metropolitan Police Agency) Crypto Was Gang’s ‘Payment Tool’ Police said the gang used cryptoassets as a payment tool to sell, smuggle, and source the drugs. Officers added that the gang sold synthetic marijuana, ketamine, and MDMA (ecstasy) to club- and bar-goers. They also think the gang helped organize private parties to boost interest in their illegal wares. The police force said it had “relayed the details of this crackdown” to several local government bodies. Despite the political upheaval and its negative effects on the economy of South Korea last year, Suwon Mayor Lee Jae-joon is content with his city's progress. https://t.co/F8LP9lKM7e — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 5, 2025 Officers also said they would take action against “buyers who took drugs” at the bars and clubs in question. A police spokesperson said investigators “plan to identify and arrest” more “intermediaries” by conducting a “digital analysis of the suspects’ cell phones.” The spokesperson said that the police force now “plans to conduct regular crackdowns” on clubs and entertainment venues frequently visited by foreign nationals.” The spokesperson added: “Our crackdown will help prevent the spread of drugs and drug abuse.” South Korean police officers throughout the country have been fighting what they and prosecutors have called a worsening epidemic of crypto-powered drug crime. South Korea’s consumer inflation accelerated on the back of higher energy and food prices, adding to concerns for policymakers https://t.co/5Ek0pEyeoT — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 4, 2025 Cryptonews.com has seen recent Korean-language posts on the social media networks X and Telegram from what appears to be drug dealers offering “nationwide” drugs “delivery.” One post, from February 3, made mention of Bitcoin (BTC) . This appears to suggest the dealer would only accept advance BTC payment for dead-dropped narcotics “deliveries.” South Korean media outlets have claimed that crypto-powered drug gangs have turned Korean-language Telegram channels into “drugs department stores.” They say the online spaces have become an illicit “playground” for young South Koreans.

33767162,[object Object],1738798234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Faces Weak Retail Demand As Addresses Holding 0-1 BTC Decline – Expert Reports,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-faces-weak-retail-demand-as-addresses-holding-0-1-btc-decline-expert-reports/,"Bitcoin has experienced massive price swings since the weekend, dropping to $91K before staging a strong recovery above $100K. However, BTC now sits around $98K, struggling to maintain momentum amid ongoing trade war fears that have shaken global markets. The uncertainty surrounding these geopolitical developments has played a significant role in Bitcoin’s volatile performance, and it looks like this trend may continue in the coming weeks. Despite Bitcoin’s strong recovery from the $91K low, retail investors don’t seem eager to buy BTC yet. Key on-chain data from Santiment reveals that the number of BTC addresses holding 0 to 1 BTC continues to decline, suggesting that smaller investors are either hesitant to re-enter the market or taking profits amid the recent price swings. Historically, retail participation has been a significant catalyst for Bitcoin’s bull cycles , as increased adoption and buying pressure often fuel higher prices. The current decline in small-holder addresses raises questions about whether Bitcoin’s rally can sustain itself without broader retail support. Analysts are now watching closely to see if BTC can reclaim key resistance levels or if further downside is on the horizon. Bitcoin Consolidates As Retail Remains Off The Market Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase below its all-time high (ATH), driven by volatility, uncertainty, and speculation. The price has been ranging between ATH at $109K and the $90K level, creating fear among investors who suspect that the bull cycle top may already be in. With Bitcoin failing to reclaim ATH in recent days, some traders believe a deeper correction is coming. However, key on-chain data from Santiment, shared by Ali Martinez on X , suggests that retail investors are still on the sidelines. The number of BTC addresses holding between 0 to 1 BTC continues to decline, showing that smaller investors have not been accumulating BTC during this phase. Historically, retail participation tends to surge when BTC prices begin their parabolic moves, meaning that Bitcoin may still have room for growth before reaching its final peak. The current lack of retail interest contrasts with previous bull cycles, where smaller investors rushed in at higher prices, often marking the later stages of a rally. If retail demand picks up, BTC could see strong buying pressure that might fuel another leg up into price discovery. For now, Bitcoin’s consolidation below ATH remains a crucial phase, with key levels defining the market’s next move. Bitcoin Price Holds Above $98K: Bulls Eye $100K Break Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,200, maintaining its position above the crucial $98K level for the past few days. This support zone is key for sustaining bullish momentum, as holding above it signals short-term strength and increases the likelihood of a move above all-time highs (ATH). For bulls to take control, reclaiming the $100K level is the most important objective at the moment. A successful push above $100K and holding it as support would likely trigger a strong rally into price discovery, setting BTC up for a run toward new highs. However, failure to break and hold $100K could signal weakness and open the door for another correction. In this case, BTC could retest lower demand zones between $95K and $90K, where buyers must step in to prevent further downside. Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, but the next major move will depend on Bitcoin’s ability to solidify support above $100K. If bulls successfully reclaim this level, a breakout into new highs becomes increasingly likely. For now, all eyes remain on BTC’s price action as it tests key levels in this critical consolidation phase.

These 5 Bitcoin-Friendly Cryptos Could Skyrocket Next!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrps-rise-to-50-these-5-bitcoin-friendly-cryptos-could-skyrocket-next/,"From Bitcoin’s Ascent to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Breakthrough THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing attention as the next big win in the crypto market, even as Bitcoin (BTC) celebrates its historic milestone of crossing $100,000. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

Officially, the State’s legislature has welcomed Senate Bill 57 (SB57), which will see New Mexico invest 5% of public funds in Bitcoin. The Bill was introduced to the New Mexico Senate by Senator Ant Thornton. New Mexico Bitcoin Reserve Bill The Bill, as shared on X , dubbed the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” focuses on establishing an alternative treasury for the state. The proposed 5% allocation would diversify the state’s funds in Bitcoin and allow it to benefit from its long-term price appreciation. The Bill also proposed that the State Investment Officer manage this Bitcoin reserve. Notably, the manager will operate under the oversight of the State Investment Council. The Bill also spelled out the need for cold storage as a viable means to safeguard the State’s Bitcoin. As Senator Thornton defines it, this BTC reserve will diversify New Mexico’s investments away from stocks and bonds. It will also position the state at the forefront of innovation in the growing cryptocurrency industry. Thornton also emphasized the economic benefits of a Bitcoin pivot, which could attract crypto companies and benefit the local economy. Conditions like transparent reporting and public awareness were also spelled out to make the bill more appealing. More US States Pushing for a Bitcoin Reserve Besides New Mexico, other top US States are also exploring the Bitcoin reserve move. As reported earlier by Coingape, Indiana seeks Bitcoin ETF exposure for the state’s retirement funds. The Indiana BTC Bill was filed in late January by Rep Jake Teshka. Lawmakers in other US States like Utah have also introduced a Bitcoin Bill to benefit the region in the long term. While about 15 states in the US have introduced a Bitcoin Bill, it underscores the growing adoption of the coin. The move aligns with the Federal Government’s national digital asset stockpile plan. In a recent press conference, Crypto &AI Czar David Sacks confirmed that the government is evaluating a proposal to establish a Bitcoin reserve. However, the timeline of events or whether the presidential crypto working group will recommend BTC purchases remains unknown. BTC Price to Benefit Amid the growing clamor for BTC in state portfolios, analysts have projected the overall impact will be felt in the coin’s price. At the moment, BTC was changing hands for $96,679, up by 1.1% at the time of writing. It has recorded a 24-hour low and high of $96,301.67 and $99,113.20 respectively. If proposals from Utah and other states get approved and public funds are injected into the coin, its market cap will soar. This will not only push prices upward but ultimately help in curtailing the volatility of the growing asset class.

While Ampere looks primed for a takeover, it is also exploring its strategic options, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. The same people also urged caution as talks could still fall apart. It’s also possible the chipmaker is snapped up by another potential buyer. SoftBank has made several strategic acquisitions in recent years, including stakes in companies like Arm Holdings and WeWork. Ampere primed for takeover Ampere designs semiconductors that use Arm’s technology. It was valued at $8 billion in a proposed minority investment by Japan’s SoftBank in 2021. The company’s current valuation, as far as Arm and Ampere are concerned, is still being discussed. While representatives for all parties involved have not commented publicly, we know that Ampere has been working with a financial adviser to help field takeover interest according to a Bloomberg News report from September. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s interest in a deal with a larger player in the industry reportedly implies that there was no clear path to an initial public offering. An announcement regarding the transaction is expected in the coming weeks, highlighting the urgency and significance of the deal. The deal involves SoftBank Group Corp. and Ampere Computing LLC, which is backed by Oracle Corp., showcasing a collaboration between major players in the tech industry. Chip companies cashing in on the AI spending boom The interest in Ampere, whose early backers also include Carlyle Group Inc., is strategic as it comes at a time when chip companies are looking to leverage the growing demand for artificial intelligence technologies. Last year, Oracle confirmed that it owns 29% of the startup and can exercise future investment options that would give it control of the chipmaker. There is a huge interest to control key components as the data center industry gets ready for the AI age, but Ampere, like its larger rivals Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., finds itself having to deal with consumer interest gravitating towards Nvidia Corp’s accelerator chips from CPUs. Ampere makes processors for data center machinery using Arm’s technology. Meanwhile, Arm is increasingly moving from being a licensor of fundamental standards and basic blueprints to more of a complete chipmaker. Ampere’s engineers, many of whom used to work for Intel’s former industry-leading server chip unit, have also been hired. Their addition is expected to provide momentum to Arm’s CEO Rene Haas’ efforts to expand into the server chip market, leveraging their experience and knowledge. Founder and CEO Renee James, a former Intel executive, had eyes on taking Ampere public. In April 2022, the company revealed it had filed confidentially for a US IPO at a time when demand for chips was on the increase. If a takeover of Ampere is successful, a run of semiconductor deals would continue at a time when global deals involving chips are surging. Just last year, Bloomberg reported that deals involving chip companies more than doubled to over $31 billion.

As stablecoins continue to play a growing role in the cryptocurrency and financial sectors, the administration aims to ensure that they operate within a regulated environment that aligns with traditional monetary policies. A senior official stated that the administration is “closely monitoring the development of stablecoins” and recognizes their potential to enhance financial transactions and global commerce. The push for regulation comes amid increasing concerns about the stability and oversight of digital assets, particularly as the stablecoin market has expanded rapidly in recent years. Many stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies, providing a level of stability that other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, often lack. However, without clear regulations, policymakers worry that stablecoins could pose risks to financial markets, consumer protection, and even national security. The administration is reportedly considering a regulatory framework that would ensure stablecoins maintain a one-to-one backing with U.S. dollar reserves and comply with existing financial rules. “We believe that stablecoins, when properly regulated, can serve as a valuable tool for the U.S. financial system and the global economy,” the official said. The move aligns with broader efforts to establish the United States as a leader in digital currency innovation while maintaining the integrity of its financial system. Stablecoins have increasingly been used in payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, making them an integral part of the evolving digital asset landscape. The administration’s stance on stablecoin regulation also comes as political figures and regulatory bodies debate the future of cryptocurrency oversight in the U.S. Donald Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto advocate, with his campaign receiving significant financial backing from the digital asset industry. Industry leaders have called for clear regulations to prevent uncertainty and encourage mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. While some officials view stablecoins as a potential asset for enhancing payment efficiency, others warn that improper regulation could undermine the dollar’s dominance or introduce systemic risks. One of the key concerns surrounding stablecoins is ensuring they have sufficient reserves to back their issuance, preventing situations where issuers fail to meet redemption demands. The administration is expected to collaborate with financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, to establish guidelines for stablecoin issuers. Market participants believe that regulatory clarity could help increase trust in stablecoins and encourage their adoption by traditional financial institutions. As the U.S. moves toward shaping its approach to stablecoin oversight, the cryptocurrency industry will closely monitor how the administration balances innovation with financial stability. With regulatory discussions gaining momentum, the coming months could prove crucial in determining the role stablecoins will play in the future of digital finance.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-05 23:36:00

On Wednesday, the Canadian blockchain entity announced that this acquisition increases its total Bitcoin and Bitcoin-equivalent holdings to 68.14 units, further confirming its commitment to Bitcoin as a key treasury asset. Strengthening Financial Stability With Bitcoin The company stated that the new Bitcoin was bought at an average price of USD$99,580 per coin, including fees and expenses. Notably, Matador remains debt-free, holding all its Bitcoin outright. In addition to Bitcoin, the company holds CAD$1.8 million in cash reserves and 2 kilograms of physical gold, valued at roughly CAD$287,000. According to Matador, these assets reveal its prudent financial strategy focused on long-term stability and capital preservation. Consequently, the company continues integrating Bitcoin into its treasury operations, further reinforcing its position as a digital asset leader. Expanding Digital Gold Strategy It’s worth noting that in January, the company announced the development of a digital gold platform, set to launch in the first quarter of 2025. This platform will leverage blockchain technology to strengthen its investment strategy. Matador CEO Deven Soni stated that the company has been working on “making gold great again” since 2021 and is excited to bring this concept to market. This idea fits Matador’s broader goal of merging traditional finance with digital tools, as seen in its recent decision to add Bitcoin as a core asset. Technology Giants Continue to Bet Big on Bitcoin Meanwhile, last month, Metaplanet announced its strategic initiative to acquire 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and 21,000 Bitcoin by 2026, positioning itself among the most significant corporate holders of the cryptocurrency globally. Semler Scientific, a healthcare technology company, recently purchased 871 Bitcoin for $88.5 million, seeing impressive returns with a paper gain of over 150%. Likewise, MicroStrategy, a software firm, is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy .

Governments argue that privacy coins are untraceable, posing a significant risk to financial security and accountability. However, financial privacy is a standard expectation in traditional systems—we don’t allow anyone to track our bank account just because we bought an ice cream. Zano , the L1 blockchain for confidential assets and private dApps, has partnered with Cake Wallet , one of the biggest non-custodial wallets among privacy enthusiasts, to make privacy features more accessible and user-friendly for the web3 community. Zano was founded by Andrey Sabelnikov , the lead developer behind CryptoNote – a privacy coin protocol used by Monero and hundreds of other projects. Zano Partners with Cake Wallet to Improve User-accessibility Zano’s partnership with Cake Wallet is pivotal in making privacy coins more accessible to mainstream users. The collaboration brings Zano’s advanced privacy tools into Cake Wallet’s application, providing an enhanced experience for users seeking to safeguard their assets. The partnership empowers Cake Wallet users to hold, manage, and transact with Zano coins, giving them access to a privacy-first cryptocurrency within a non-custodial wallet. As part of the integration, Cake Wallet will support Zano’s confidential assets, which include private stablecoins and wrapped versions of major cryptocurrencies like zBTC and zETH. According to Vikrant Sharma, the co-founder and CEO of Cake wallet: “Cake Wallet is dedicated to pushing privacy forward, and our partnership with Zano is a natural stepping stone in bringing robust privacy tools to the cryptocurrency community and beyond,” Similar thoughts were shared by Quenten van Welzen, the head of marketing and growth at Zano: ‘The values of Zano and Cake Wallet overlap quite a bit. Therefore, integrating the Zano blockchain into Cake Wallet seems like a natural fit, and we are very excited to be onboarded to such a wonderful privacy-friendly wallet,” Why Users Love Zano: Privacy, Security, and Full Control Over Their Assets Zano’s integration with Cake Wallet is already winning over users who prioritise financial privacy, security, and ease of use. In an era of increasing financial surveillance and data breaches, the ability to transact securely without exposing sensitive information is more important than ever. With its seamless, privacy-first approach, Zano empowers individuals to take full control of their digital assets while maintaining complete confidentiality. “For me, financial privacy is a fundamental right. With Zano and Cake Wallet, I finally have a simple, secure way to manage my assets without worrying about surveillance or data leaks. It’s reassuring to know I can transact freely while keeping my financial data private,” said Alex M., a longtime cryptocurrency user and privacy advocate. By combining Zano’s advanced privacy features with Cake Wallet’s intuitive design, the partnership ensures that users can easily store, send, and receive confidential assets without technical complexity. This collaboration reinforces the importance of privacy in the digital economy, giving users the tools they need to protect their financial freedom. A Step Closer to Institutional Adoption While blockchain’s transparency is often seen as an advantage, it presents a major obstacle for financial institutions looking to adopt the technology. Contrary to popular belief, complete transparency is not always beneficial—especially in financial systems where confidentiality is crucial. Traditional banking and corporate finance operate on the principle that certain data, such as transaction details, client identities, and proprietary trading strategies, must remain private to protect competitive advantages and comply with regulations on data security. For institutions, the challenge is striking a balance between trust and privacy. They need to verify the integrity of transactions, ensure compliance, and prevent fraud without exposing proprietary information to the public. This requirement creates friction when integrating with public blockchains, where transactions are permanently recorded and fully visible to anyone. To drive institutional adoption, blockchain technology must evolve to provide mechanisms that offer cryptographic proof of validity without revealing the underlying data itself. By addressing these concerns, privacy-focused blockchain solutions like Zano bring the industry a step closer to real-world adoption in regulated financial sectors, bridging the gap between decentralisation and institutional needs.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|FIAT|XMR,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-05 23:39:00

Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, announced the filing on social media, emphasizing that customer assets should not be absorbed into a custodian’s bankruptcy proceedings. Coinbase Urges Court to Uphold Customer Asset Rights In a recent post on X , Paul Grewal stated that Coinbase filed an amicus brief in the Prime Trust bankruptcy case. The company is advocating for the enforcement of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 8, which ensures that assets held by custodians belong to customers and not the custodians themselves. Coinbase argues that both its user agreement and Prime Trust’s user agreement explicitly state that assets remain customer property. The company asserts that bankruptcy should not alter these agreements or reclassify assets as part of the custodian’s estate. The legal filing will prevent customer funds from being included in Prime Trust’s bankruptcy estate. Coinbase maintains that upholding UCC Article 8 is essential to maintaining trust in custodians, both in digital and traditional finance. In other legal developments, the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 hearing is drawing industry-wide attention. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal will testify alongside other key figures, pushing back against alleged unfair banking restrictions on crypto. Legal Protections Under UCC Article 8 UCC Article 8 is a fundamental part of commercial law that protects customer assets held by custodians. It applies to both digital and traditional financial institutions, ensuring that customer funds remain separate from a custodian’s bankruptcy proceedings. Coinbase emphasized that this legal framework applies to major financial institutions, including Bank of New York (BNY) and Depository Trust Company (DTC). The company stated that courts have historically upheld these protections to ensure market stability and customer security. The amicus brief argues that disregarding UCC Article 8 could set a negative precedent for customer asset protections. Coinbase believes that recognizing customer ownership of assets is critical for preserving market confidence and protecting investor funds. Trust and Security in Financial Markets Coinbase has positioned itself as a strong advocate for customer asset protection in financial markets. The company stated that ensuring customer funds remain secure is essential for maintaining trust in custodians and financial institutions. Paul Grewal expressed confidence in the legal precedent supporting customer asset protections. He urged the court to reinforce these protections in the Prime Trust bankruptcy case, aligning with past court rulings that have upheld UCC Article 8. The company emphasized that its filing is not about crypto only but about broader financial principles that impact digital and traditional finance. In addition, the top crypto exchange continues to strengthen its global footprint with regulatory approvals in key markets. Coinbase recently secured a VASP license in the UK, allowing it to offer expanded crypto and fiat services. This move aligns with its broader international strategy, ensuring compliance while driving digital asset adoption.

But instead of holding, many are selling their coins to buy a new altcoin that’s gaining attention—Remittix (RTX) . While Dogecoin stays strong and Shiba Inu struggles, whales are shifting to RTX because it offers real-world use and big growth potential. What’s making Remittix so special? Let’s find out! Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars, But Price Struggles Amid Market Sell-Off, Remittix Gains Momentum Recently, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) experienced a significant burn incident whereby over one billion SHIB tokens—worth $18,832.80—were transferred to a ""dead address."" Since it helps lower the token supply and maybe enhance the price, this burn generated enthusiasm in the Shiba Inu community. Still, Shiba Inu's price suffers even with the burn. Pricing at $0.00001757 , SHIB is currently down 6.6% in the last 24 hours and has fallen 12.11% in the last week. With $539 million taken off from crypto assets in liquidations, this drop fits a larger market sell-off. Remittix (RTX) is fast becoming popular as Shiba Inu struggles. Using cryptocurrencies, this creative PayFi concept provides underbanked people with a means of sending and receiving money anywhere. Remittix is fulfilling its promise with $10.6 million raised in a few weeks. Its Pay API helps companies to accept crypto payments and quickly translate them into FIAT currencies, therefore lowering the price-related risks. Remittix is presenting itself as a game-changer in the global payments industry, giving financial freedom to those outside the conventional banking system, while SHIB battles with pricing volatility. Dogecoin Faces Struggles While Remittix Gains Investor Interest Price swings in Dogecoin (DOGE) have lately been somewhat noticeable. It lost 27.27% in December 2024, then recovered by 21.87% in early January; nevertheless, by January 28 it dropped once more to $0.33, with the present price at $0.2957 . Notwithstanding this instability, experts such as Ali Martinez hope that the introduction of a Dogecoin ETF will cause a price surge, thereby guiding DOGE to $15 in the next months. However, many investors are looking for other opportunities, and Remittix ( RTX ) has caught their attention. This innovative project aims to solve long-standing issues in global payments, offering financial services to those who don’t have access to traditional banks. With over $10.6 million raised in just a few weeks, Remittix is becoming a strong alternative to meme coins like Dogecoin. While Dogecoin’s future remains uncertain, Remittix’s utility-focused approach makes it an appealing option for those seeking a new, promising crypto project. Remittix: A Game-Changer in Global Payments An exciting new cryptocurrency causing ripples in the financial scene is Remittix (RTX) . Unlike many cryptocurrencies, which are just for trade or speculation, Remittix is all about addressing practical issues. Its goal is to use blockchain technology to enable faster, less expensive, more accessible money transfers, transforming the $190 trillion worldwide money transfer market. Remittix's $RTX token, used for staking, platform incentives, and governance, forms its central component. With just 1.5 billion coins in circulation, the coin is a limited supply desirable item as the network expands. With no hidden costs, users may quickly convert over forty cryptocurrencies into FIAT currencies and send money to any bank account anywhere in the globe. This makes it far less expensive than banks and standard money transfer companies. Businesses are also getting on board with Remittix, thanks to its Remittix Pay API. This allows merchants to accept crypto payments and automatically convert them to FIAT currencies, removing the risk of price fluctuations. With over 30 FIAT currencies and 50 altcoins supported, Remittix is revolutionizing international payments and positioning itself as a game-changer in the industry. At just $0.0539 per token during its presale, Remittix offers a unique opportunity for investors looking to get in early on this transformative platform.

What exactly makes Remittix stand out? Let’s explore! Shiba Inu's Burn Rate Increases, But Price Declines Amid Market Downturn, Remittix Gains Traction Recently, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) underwent a massive burn event, with over a billion SHIB tokens—worth $18,832.80—being sent to an inactive address. This action sparked excitement within the Shiba Inu community as it reduces token supply and could potentially boost prices. Despite this, Shiba Inu's value continues to dip. With a current price of $0.00001757 , SHIB has dropped by 6.6% in the past 24 hours and 12.11% over the last week. The decline is part of a broader market sell-off, with $539 million disappearing from crypto assets due to liquidations. As Shiba Inu struggles, Remittix (RTX) is gaining traction. This innovative PayFi solution uses cryptocurrencies to provide underbanked individuals with a method to send and receive money globally. Remittix is delivering on its promises, raising $10.6 million in a matter of weeks. Its Pay API enables companies to accept crypto payments and swiftly convert them into FIAT currencies, minimizing price-related risks. As SHIB grapples with price volatility, Remittix is positioning itself as a transformative force in international payments, offering financial independence to those outside the traditional banking system. Dogecoin Faces Challenges as Remittix Captures Investor Attention Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently experienced notable price fluctuations. After dropping 27.27% in December 2024 and rebounding by 21.87% in early January, it fell again, reaching $0.33 by January 28, with the current price at $0.2957 . Despite this volatility, experts like Ali Martinez believe that a Dogecoin ETF launch could trigger a price increase, potentially driving DOGE to $15 in the coming months. Nevertheless, many investors are seeking alternatives, and Remittix ( RTX ) has caught their eye. Aiming to address long-standing global payment challenges, this innovative project offers financial services to those without access to traditional banking. With over $10.6 million raised in a few weeks, Remittix is emerging as a compelling alternative to meme coins like Dogecoin.

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the nation’s largest union organization, filed a lawsuit in a Washington, DC, federal court on February 3. “Unlawful” Data Sharing with Musk-Led Task Force The court document revealed that AFL-CIO sought to halt what it describes as an “ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure” of confidential data. It argued that individuals required to share financial details with the government should not have their information exposed to Musk and D.O.G.E while stressing the scale of the privacy breach. The lawsuit follows reports that DOGE, a Trump administration task force led by Musk responsible with reducing federal workforce and regulations, gained access to crucial Treasury databases, including Social Security and Medicare payment systems. According to reports , D.O.G.E’s ability to retrieve taxpayer data raises concerns over potential misuse, particularly regarding politically motivated interference in federal payments. Senate Finance Committee Democrat Ron Wyden expressed alarm over the situation in a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, warning that unauthorized access could lead to disruptions in essential payment systems. Wyden stated that any politically driven tampering with these systems could have severe repercussions for the economy. The controversy has already led to significant fallout within the Treasury Department. Meanwhile, Acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his post after more than three decades of service, reportedly in response to D.O.G.E’s request for access to the department’s financial infrastructure. In a farewell letter to Treasury employees, Lebryk spoke about the critical role of the Fiscal Service in maintaining the stability of government operations and added that while much of its work goes unnoticed by the public, it remains crucial to the country’s functioning. D.O.G.E The D.O.G.E was established to reduce wasteful spending and eliminate unnecessary regulations, though its formal mission, as outlined in the executive order, is to modernize federal technology and software to improve government efficiency and productivity. Announced by Donald Trump in November 2024 for his second term, the organization was initially set to be co-led by Vivek Ramaswamy alongside Musk, but Ramaswamy left before the task force’s launch.

As utility-driven meme coins gain popularity, Panshibi is becoming a disruptive force with both fun and practical applications. As the best new meme coin investors are already monitoring it, and there are rumors that its value may increase. Dogecoin: The Pioneer Still Holding Strong Originally developed as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the original meme coin and is now a mainstay in the cryptocurrency space. A fervent community, social media buzz, and well-known endorsements from people like Elon Musk propelled it to stardom. DOGE continues to prosper despite criticism of its inflationary token concept, especially in tipping and payments. Even while Dogecoin news frequently emphasizes how widely adopted it is, it lacks the technological innovations found in more recent initiatives. Its long-term viability and capacity to compete with cutting-edge meme coins that provide more than simply branding are questions. Shiba Inu: The Evolution of Meme Coins By creating a whole ecosystem, Shiba Inu (SHIB) advanced the meme coin idea. In contrast to DOGE, SHIB brought staking opportunities, ShibaSwap, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution. Because of these developments, it has lasted beyond the hoopla and is regarded by many as one of the greatest new meme coin initiatives of the past few years. SHIB has demonstrated that meme coins can provide more than simply amusement, but Panshibi wants to further reshape the market by resolving important problems that have kept cryptocurrencies from becoming widely accepted. Panshibi: The Next-Generation Meme Coin with 100X Potential Panshibi is a revolution in the making, not simply another meme. By fusing panda crypto 100xpotential with practical applications, it seeks to close the gap between AI-driven innovation, Social-Fi, and meme culture. Due to its solid foundations, Panshibi is a desirable investment for both novice and seasoned traders, in contrast to DOGE and SHIB, which mostly rely on community hype. In order to solve this, Panshibi adds staking, governance, and exclusivity incentives for token owners, transforming them from speculative assets into something more. Early investors have a rare chance to purchase before the anticipated 1,200% price increase, as the presale stage aims to generate $10 million in 60 days. With a 10-year liquidity lock guaranteeing sustainability and confidence, the project's tokenomics are built for long-term stability. Panshibi is designed to last, with a meticulously planned ecosystem that promotes holding rather than short-term trading, in contrast to earlier meme coins that suffered from pump-and-dump scams. Panshibi is resolving a significant adoption issue in the cryptocurrency field in addition to its business approach. For popular consumers, many meme currencies fall short in offering genuine incentives. By combining community-driven incentives with blockchain technology, it guarantees that users will stay involved and profit from the coin's expansion. Why Panshibi Could Be the Best New Meme Coin of 2025 Investors should keep a close eye on Panshibi if they're searching for the best new meme coin. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have already established the path, but Panshibi elevates meme coins by providing useful benefits. The panda crypto 100x potential is supported by a strong plan and is not merely conjecture.

As meme coins with real-world uses gain traction, Panshibi is emerging as a game-changer by combining entertainment with practical utility. Recognized as the best new meme coin, investors are already keeping a close watch, with whispers of a potential surge in its value. Dogecoin: The Original Still Going Strong First launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) holds the title of the original meme coin and has become a staple in the crypto world. It gained fame thanks to a passionate community, social media buzz, and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Despite facing criticism for its inflationary token model, DOGE thrives, especially in tipping and payments. Dogecoin news often highlights its widespread use, yet it lacks the advanced technology found in newer projects. Questions about its long-term sustainability and ability to compete with modern meme coins that offer more than just clever branding persist. Shiba Inu: Revolutionizing the Meme Coin Concept Shiba Inu (SHIB) took the meme coin concept further by developing an entire ecosystem. Unlike DOGE, SHIB introduced staking features, ShibaSwap, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution. These innovations have allowed it to thrive beyond the initial hype, earning recognition as one of the greatest new meme coin projects in recent years. SHIB proved that meme coins can deliver more than just fun, while Panshibi aims to further revolutionize the market by addressing key issues that hinder widespread cryptocurrency adoption. Panshibi: A Cutting-Edge Meme Coin with 100X Potential Panshibi is more than just another meme coin; it's a revolution in progress. By blending panda crypto 100x potential with practical uses, it bridges the gap between AI-driven innovation, Social-Fi, and meme culture. With robust foundations, Panshibi is an attractive investment for both beginners and experienced traders, unlike DOGE and SHIB, which rely heavily on community hype. To address this, Panshibi offers staking, governance, and exclusive rewards for token holders, transforming them from speculative assets to something more substantial. Early investors have a unique chance to get in before the expected 1,200% price surge, as the presale aims to raise $10 million in 60 days. With a 10-year liquidity lock ensuring sustainability and trust, the project's tokenomics are designed for long-term growth. Panshibi is built to endure, with a carefully structured ecosystem that encourages holding rather than short-term trading, unlike earlier meme coins that fell victim to pump-and-dump schemes. Panshibi not only addresses a significant adoption challenge in the crypto space but also uses its business model to do so. Many meme coins lack real incentives for mainstream users. By merging community-driven incentives with blockchain technology, it ensures users remain engaged and benefit from the coin's growth. Could Panshibi Be the Top Meme Coin of 2025? Investors seeking the Panshibi opportunity should pay close attention to this coin. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way, Panshibi takes meme coins to the next level by offering practical advantages. The panda crypto 100x potential is backed by a solid strategy and is far more than speculation. Panshibi is poised to attract a large audience due to its innovative integrations, vibrant community, and plans to list on major exchanges. Panshibi stands as a strong contender in a market where investors are on the lookout for the next big thing. Is Panshibi the Next Significant Meme Coin? Panshibi represents the next phase in the evolution of meme coins. While updates on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin news continue to capture media attention, neither project adequately addresses the practical challenges hindering mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, Panshibi does. It distinguishes itself as a serious contender in the market with its innovative blend of AI, Social-Fi, and cutting-edge tokenomics. For investors eyeing the next panda crypto 100x potential, this presale offers a promising opportunity, and the excitement for its launch is mounting.

Despite its dominant market position, XRP faces a number of challenges that make a $32 target in this cycle ridiculous. Remittix , an up-and-coming player, is becoming well-known as the next big cryptocurrency due to its innovative approach to financial accessibility and usefulness. Could a rival to XRP outperform Ripple with a whopping 50,000% increase? Ripple Price Prediction: Why XRP Might Not Hit $32 This Cycle For years, Ripple price predictions have mostly been driven by speculation and hope. Despite being a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, XRP's potential for rapid expansion in the current cycle is constrained by several issues. Uncertainties brought about by regulatory obstacles, continuous legal disputes with the SEC, and its centralized structure discourage both institutional and individual investors. The price of XRP has not increased to the extent that some fans anticipate, even though it has seen substantial acceptance in cross-border payments. While the market is shifting its focus from financial speculation to useful cryptocurrencies, the wider macroeconomic environment is also putting pressure on riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, even though discussions about Ripple price prediction still dominate the cryptocurrency industry. Speculative assets like XRP are strongly opposed due to stricter monetary policy and concerns about global inflation. Although it has the technology and partnerships to sustain modest growth, a rise above $35 in the current cycle appears highly improbable. Remittix: Solving Real-World Problems with Crypto While it may seem improbable that Remittix might expand by 50,000%, such spikes have previously occurred for early-stage cryptocurrencies with strong real-world uses. Before becoming widely used and experiencing exponential value gains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, for instance, were very cheap at first. The demand for and value of Remittix may increase dramatically if it is widely adopted and forms strategic alliances. Think about a society in which more than 1.7 billion people lack access to conventional financial services, but many of them can still profit from cryptocurrencies. The unbanked, who frequently reside in underserved or rural areas, are unable to acquire credit, open bank accounts, or use contemporary financial technologies. However, these people might use cryptocurrencies to get around these financial obstacles with Remittix. Through Remittix, users can transfer digital assets straight to a wallet, where they can be withdrawn through Western Union, utilized for regular expenses, or exchanged for cash. People no longer need a bank account to access money and financial services thanks to this straightforward yet revolutionary technique. The anonymity and ownership of your money are what cryptocurrencies were initially intended to provide, and they can circumvent the conventional banking system while still keeping control over their assets. Investors are now concentrating on cryptocurrencies that have practical uses rather than just being speculative. Projects like Remittix , which tackle real financial issues, are becoming more and more popular in the market, even though Ripple price prediction models indicate XRP will have difficulty surpassing specific price thresholds. Fast, inexpensive cross-border transactions are in high demand, particularly in areas with prohibitively high remittance rates. This new coin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because it is capable of satisfying a critical demand in the modern global economy while preserving the fundamental principles of cryptography, which include total control over assets and privacy. As Ripple price prediction analyses indicate that practical use cases are driving investor interest, Remittix positions itself at the forefront of crypto adoption. Unlike traditional banks—often slow, centralized, and subject to restrictions. It ensures decentralization, financial sovereignty, and global accessibility. It’s more than just another digital asset; it’s a bridge between crypto and the real-world economy. Conclusion Regulatory and market factors make it extremely impossible that XRP will reach $32 this cycle, even while discussions about the Ripple price prediction continue. Meanwhile, Remittix is emerging as a real-world solution that is bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. It addresses major adoption issues by providing money to the unbanked and facilitating smooth international transactions.

Despite holding a strong position in the market, XRP encounters several obstacles that render a $32 target for this cycle unrealistic. Remittix , an emerging contender, is gaining traction as a major cryptocurrency player due to its innovative solutions for financial inclusion and practical use. Could this rival to XRP potentially outshine Ripple with an extraordinary 50,000% rise? Ripple Price Forecast: Reasons XRP Might Not Reach $32 This Cycle Over time, predictions about Ripple's price have largely been fueled by speculation and optimism. Even though it plays a substantial role in the crypto sphere, XRP's potential for significant growth this cycle is limited by a variety of problems. Regulatory hurdles, ongoing legal battles with the SEC, and its centralized framework deter both institutional and retail investors. Although XRP has achieved significant traction in cross-border payment systems, its price hasn't surged as much as some supporters hope. As the market shifts focus from speculative trading to cryptocurrencies with tangible benefits, the broader macroeconomic landscape is also weighing on riskier assets like crypto, even though discussions around Ripple's price forecast remain prevalent in the crypto community. Speculative investments such as XRP face strong opposition due to tighter monetary policies and worldwide inflation worries. Despite having the technology and partnerships to enable steady growth, surpassing $35 in this cycle seems highly unlikely. Remittix: Tackling Real-World Challenges with Cryptocurrency While the notion that Remittix might grow by 50,000% seems far-fetched, such dramatic increases have happened before with early-stage cryptocurrencies that offer robust real-world applications. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum were once very affordable before they gained widespread use and saw exponential value growth. If Remittix achieves broad acceptance and establishes key partnerships, its demand and value could soar. Consider a world where over 1.7 billion people lack access to traditional financial services, yet many can still benefit from cryptocurrencies. The unbanked, often living in underserved or remote regions, face challenges in obtaining credit, opening bank accounts, or utilizing modern financial tools. However, through Remittix, these individuals can overcome financial barriers. With Remittix, users can send digital assets directly to a wallet, where they can be withdrawn via Western Union, used for everyday expenses, or converted to cash. This simple yet groundbreaking approach allows people to access funds and financial services without needing a bank account. Cryptocurrencies were originally designed to ensure anonymity and ownership of money, enabling users to bypass the traditional banking system while maintaining control over their assets. Investors are now zeroing in on cryptocurrencies with real-world applications rather than those driven purely by speculation. Projects like Remittix , which address genuine financial challenges, are gaining increasing popularity in the market, even as Ripple's price forecast suggests that XRP may struggle to break certain price barriers. There is high demand for fast, low-cost cross-border transactions, especially in regions where remittance fees are prohibitively high. This new cryptocurrency differentiates itself by meeting a vital demand in today's global economy while maintaining core cryptographic principles such as full asset control and privacy. As Ripple's price forecasts highlight that practical applications are attracting investor interest, Remittix is positioning itself at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike traditional banks, which are often slow, centralized, and subject to regulation, Remittix promotes decentralization, financial independence, and global accessibility. It's more than just another digital currency; it's a bridge that connects the crypto world with the real-world economy. Conclusion Given the regulatory and market conditions, it's highly unlikely that XRP will reach $32 this cycle, even as conversations about the Ripple price forecast persist. In the meantime, Remittix is emerging as a practical solution that bridges the gap between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies. It addresses significant adoption challenges by providing financial access to the unbanked and making international transactions seamless.

Get the Latest Cardano Price Updates,https://thecoinrise.com/massive-interest-in-web3bay-as-presale-hits-1m-will-tron-maintain-its-uptrend-get-the-latest-cardano-price-updates/,"The cryptocurrency market is vibrant with projects aiming to excel in their fields. Tron (TRX) is attempting to maintain its momentum following a 145% increase in trading volume, though it struggles to reach the $1 level again. Cardano (ADA), however, is capturing attention with a sharp rise in activity and the upcoming Plomin mainnet hard fork, potentially heralding substantial gains. Web3Bay, however, is making a significant mark, not merely adapting to trends but transforming e-commerce. Having raised over $1 million and sold 285 million tokens at $0.004562 each, Web3Bay transcends a typical investment—it’s pioneering a new way of commerce. Unlike Tron and Cardano, Web3Bay addresses concrete issues like enhancing transparency, reducing fees, and improving data ownership via blockchain. Its expected 6,430% ROI and innovative features such as NFT integration and DAO governance make it an optimal choice for investors aiming to influence the future of commerce. Will Tron Maintain Its Rise and Overcome Major Resistance? Tron (TRX) has seen a remarkable increase in trading volume, up 145% to $1.26 billion in the last 24 hours. This spike in activity comes after a notable decrease earlier in the week, with TRX’s price dropping around 10% to a low of $0.8565. Currently, TRX is priced at $0.921, a 7.03% decrease from the previous day. Technical analysis suggests that TRX needs to break above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $0.985 to hit the $1 mark again. Steady trading volume and positive sentiment may help it achieve this goal. If TRX can hold above $1, it might aim for the $1.16 resistance level next. However, if it cannot maintain its support, prices could fall to $0.76. Explore Cardano’s Price Targets Cardano has experienced a significant boost in trading volume, increasing by 145% to $1.26 billion within the last 24 hours following a major market downturn, which saw prices drop by 10% to $0.8565. Currently, ADA is priced at $0.921 and is aiming for the $1 threshold. For the Cardano price to surpass $1, it needs to overcome the 50-day SMA at $0.985. Maintaining this momentum could see ADA reaching $1.16, with the potential to climb to $1.33. However, if it fails to hold at these levels, the price might decrease to $0.76. With its trading volumes on the rise and the Plomin mainnet hard fork scheduled for January 29, 2025, ADA is at a critical point. Investors should closely monitor Cardano’s movements as it seeks potential gains in a recovering market. Web3Bay’s Recent Hot News: Presale Crossed $1M! Envision a marketplace free from the grip of large corporations that impose hefty fees, collect extensive personal data, and outpace small businesses. Web3Bay steps in as the Amazon of Decentralized Shopping, revolutionizing the sector with blockchain technology. This platform guarantees full transparency, grants data ownership, and facilitates direct interactions between buyers and sellers, thus eliminating expensive middlemen. Key highlight: Web3Bay’s presale has swiftly attracted significant interest, with over $1 million raised and more than 285 million tokens sold at just $0.004562 each. Early backers are eager to join as the token price is set to jump to $0.1959 at launch, suggesting a remarkable potential ROI of 6,430%. This opportunity represents more than just an investment; it’s a chance to partake in the future of e-commerce. Web3Bay’s development plan features innovative elements such as NFT integration, cross-chain compatibility, and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where token holders wield decision-making power. The platform’s scope extends beyond mere shopping—it aims to redefine global commercial interactions. Wrapping Up While Tron and Cardano offer promising growth with robust trading volumes and technological enhancements, Web3Bay excels with unmatched innovation. Though Tron is aiming for a $1 value and Cardano’s price is poised to regain its peak, neither can rival Web3Bay’s potential to overhaul global commerce. Web3Bay’s blockchain-based marketplace not only enhances user empowerment but also reshapes online shopping dynamics. The success of its crypto presale , its scalable strategy, and the potential for a 6,430% ROI establish it as the foremost investment of 2025.

There's Still Time to Get In!",https://bitzo.com/2025/02/have-solana-tron-whales-been-privy-to-inside-information-on-a-new-meme-coin-launch-promising-10000-gains-theres-still-time-to-get-in,"In recent weeks, the crypto market has been bustling with activity. Concerns have arisen over unusual trading patterns involving Solana and TRON, two of the most renowned blockchain networks, due to significant whale transactions. But what if this isn't just typical institutional maneuvering? Some analysts speculate that insiders might have caught wind of a groundbreaking meme coin launch with the potential for substantial gains. The buzz is all about the new meme coin Panshibi ($SHIBI), which is already attracting significant attention during its presale. This could be a golden opportunity for investors, as this cryptocurrency might soar by 10,000%. Latest Updates on Shiba Inu Before diving into Panshibi, it's important to understand the legacy of Shiba Inu (SHIB). Launched in 2020 as a decentralized meme experiment, SHIB quickly gained a cult following, earning the nickname ""Dogecoin killer."" At its peak, the coin surged by nearly 1,200,000%, turning early adopters into billionaires overnight. Shiba Inu's rise was driven by its passionate community and strategic moves, such as venturing into DeFi, NFTs, and the upcoming layer-2 blockchain Shibarium. Despite these efforts, SHIB has struggled to maintain its previous momentum. According to the latest news on Shiba Inu, with renewed interest in meme coins leading to a 500% market cap increase in 2024, investors are scouting beyond SHIB and Dogecoin for the next big sensation. This is where Panshibi comes into play. Panshibi ($SHIBI): Is This the Next Meme Coin to Skyrocket? Panshibi is not just another meme coin launch; it’s poised to become a cultural phenomenon. By combining three powerful elements: Asia, pandas, and meme culture, Panshibi has set the stage for viral success. Unlike previous meme coins relying solely on hype, Panshibi integrates SocialFi and AI-driven features, transforming it into more than just a speculative asset. Token holders can engage in competitive missions, earn rewards, and even participate in governance decisions to shape the ecosystem's future. Staking $SHIBI tokens allows holders to earn annual yields up to 1,200%, far surpassing typical DeFi opportunities. Moreover, unlike many meme coins that eventually lose steam, Panshibi guarantees long-term viability by locking liquidity for a decade. Currently available at $0.004, the token's price is projected to climb through 15 presale stages, culminating in an anticipated 145,000% surge post-launch. Security is of utmost importance. Panshibi’s smart contract has been thoroughly audited by the blockchain security firm Coinsult, and ownership will be relinquished post-presale, ensuring complete decentralization. With 60% of the total supply earmarked for the presale, this is a unique chance to invest early before exchange listings boost demand. Panshibi will be available on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap, ensuring global reach. It seems whales are catching on, as on-chain activity indicates substantial transactions moving into early-stage meme coins. If history is any guide, those who adopt viral tokens early stand to gain the most. Is It the Right Time to Invest? The latest news on Shina Inu highlights that meme coins have progressed well beyond their initial concept, now playing a crucial role in the growth of the crypto market. With Solana and TRON whales making notable moves and meme coin adoption reaching unprecedented heights, the opportunity for early investors is evident. Panshibi is set to spearhead the next wave of meme coin excitement. With its viral potential, robust tokenomics, and attractive staking incentives, $SHIBI distinguishes itself in a crowded field.

There Is Still Time!",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/have-solana-tron-whales-had-inside-info-on-new-meme-coin-launch-expected-to-hit-10000-gains-there-is-still-time,"Over the past several weeks, the cryptocurrency market has seen a lot of activity. Concerns over strange trading patterns in Solana and TRON, two of the most well-known blockchain networks, have been raised by massive whale transactions. What if this isn't just another instance of institutional scheming, though? The latest changes, according to some experts, suggest that insiders may have learned of a revolutionary meme coin launch that might yield enormous profits. The new meme coin Panshibi ($SHIBI) has been in the news and is already garnering a lot of interest in its presale. This might be the next major chance for investors to profit because this cryptocurrency has the potential to increase by 10,000%. Shiba Inu Latest News Understanding Shiba Inu's (SHIB) legacy is crucial before delving into Panshibi. As a decentralized meme experiment, SHIB was introduced in 2020 and soon developed a cult-like following, dubbed the ""Dogecoin killer."" The coin experienced increases of almost 1,200,000% at its height, making early adopters instant billionaires. Shiba Inu's strong community and strategic advancements, such as its entry into DeFi, NFTs and the future layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, were key factors in the company's ascent. SHIB has had trouble sustaining the tremendous velocity it previously possessed in spite of these developments. Shiba Inu latest news reports that with meme coin interest surging in 2024, seeing a 500% market cap increase, investors are looking beyond SHIB and Dogecoin for the next big thing. And that’s where Panshibi enters the scene. Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Next Meme Coin to Explode? Panshibi isn’t just another meme coin launch, it’s a cultural phenomenon in the making. Merging three major forces; Asia, pandas and meme culture, Panshibi has created a perfect storm for viral adoption. With the integration of SocialFi and AI-powered features, Panshibi is becoming more than just a speculative asset, in contrast to earlier meme coins that just depended on hype. Holders of tokens can participate in competitive missions, get prizes and even vote on governance to affect the ecosystem's evolution. Holders who stake their $SHIBI tokens can earn annual yields up to 1,200%, far exceeding traditional DeFi opportunities. Also unlike many meme coins that fizzle out, Panshibi ensures long-term sustainability by locking liquidity for 10 years. Currently priced at $0.004, the token price is set to increase over 15 presale stages, culminating in a projected 145,000% post-launch surge. Security remains a top priority. Panshibi’s smart contract has been fully audited by blockchain security firm Coinsult and ownership will be renounced post-presale, ensuring full decentralization. With 60% of the total supply allocated to the presale, this is a rare opportunity to get in early before exchange listings drive up demand. Panshibi will debut on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap, offering global accessibility. Whales seem to be catching on and on-chain activity suggests large-scale transactions flowing into early-stage meme coins. If history has taught us anything, it’s that early adopters of viral tokens reap the biggest rewards. Is Now the Time to Act? Shina Inu latest news shows that meme coins have evolved far beyond their origins, they’re now a major force in crypto market growth. With Solana and TRON whales making significant moves and meme coin adoption at an all-time high, the opportunity for early investors is clear. Panshibi is positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin mania. Combining viral appeal, strong tokenomics and lucrative staking rewards, $SHIBI stands out in a crowded market. The presale is still open, but not for long. With each stage pushing prices higher, waiting could mean missing out on the biggest gains. If 10,000% returns sound appealing, this might be the moment to make a move.

The strategy entails “investing heavily into AI Agents, as the race for AI continues to gain traction among tech giants and startups in the sector. Other tech giants like Amazon, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI have also expressed their goals of also building agentic AI. Google released three products under the 2.0 suite Late last year, Google granted access to developers and some trusted testers while it also wrapped some features into its products. However, according to the company, this is a “general release.” Now, under this program, the suite of models includes 2.0 Flash, which is said to be a “workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale.” Also included in that suite is the 2.0 Pro Experimental for coding performance as well as the 2.0 Flash Lite, which Google dubs its “most cost-effective model yet.” “Today we’re making te updated Gemini 2.0 Flash generally available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Developers can now build production applications with 2.0 Flash,” Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO, Google DeepMind wrote in blog post. “We’re also releasing an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Pro, our best model yet for coding performance and complex prompts. It is available in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and in the Gemini app for Gemini Advanced users.” Kavukcuoglu. According to a CNBC article , the cost of Gemini Flash to developers is 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash Lite costs 0.75 of a cent for the same. Google consolidating its position on the market Google’s initiative is reportedly part of efforts to stay ahead in the industry as the race for AI supremacy is escalating to another level among the tech giants and startups. Peers, Amazon, Anthropic, Meta and OpenAI have also revealed their intentions to move into agentic AI, or models capable of handling complex tasks on behalf of users. As for Google, the tech giant has been busy for some time now to stay ahead of the competition. The company has over the past year been working towards more agentic models in line with obtaining trends. “Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Google wrote in a December blog post . Google added that Gemini 2.0 has “new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use.” Additionally, the family of models “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.” This comes as there has been intense competition with the Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic being a key contender in the race to build AI agents. In October last year, Anthropic indicated its AI agents could use computers the same way humans do to tackle tasks. According to Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan, the tool can “use computers basically the same way that we do.” Competitors OpenAI recently released a similar feature known as Operator to automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations, and ordering groceries. The ChatGPT make described this as “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.” Earlier in the week, OpenAI also unveiled Deep Research which allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports as well as analyze questions and topics as per user’s choice, while Google launched a similar tool with a similar name.

Known for his deep ties to crypto and Wall Street, Howard’s new job comes with a lot of moving pieces: the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act, and all regulatory power over tech infrastructure. His confirmation is a massive win for President Trump’s administration, which is pushing to bring crypto innovation back to the US and create a national Bitcoin reserve. Anti-crypto Elizabeth Warren demands answers over Lutnick’s Tether connections Senator Elizabeth Warren wasted no time tearing into Howard’s crypto ties. On January 28, she sent a letter demanding details about how much Cantor Fitzgerald has invested in Tether and whether the firm conducted proper due diligence before getting involved with the stablecoin issuer. She wanted to know if Cantor verified Tether’s compliance with US anti-money laundering laws, sanctions, and “know your customer” (KYC) rules. Warren framed this as a national security threat, telling Howard that: “Your deep entanglements with Tether raise significant questions about your personal judgment and whether you can serve without bias.” Cantor earned tens of millions from managing Tether’s reserves and even bought a minority stake in the company. Plus Howard didn’t list Tether or any other crypto holdings in the financial disclosure form he submitted to the Senate, even though the form detailed his assets worth over $806 million and involvement in 800 legal entities. Warren wanted an explanation for that omission too. Howard had promised to divest from Cantor when confirmed, but Warren and others aren’t buying it. Critics, including watchdog group Accountable.US, were calling for Howard to recuse himself from any crypto-related task forces once he officially takes office. It’s unclear to us if he ever actually did. Ted Cruz says it’s time to reverse Biden’s “lawless” tech policies Senator Ted Cruz, one of Howard’s biggest backers, couldn’t be happier about the confirmation. After the committee vote, Cruz told Broadband Breakfast that he expects Howard to shake up the BEAD program, which was originally designed to expand fiber-optic broadband access across the country. Cruz called the Biden administration’s preference for fiber “wasteful” and said it ignored cheaper, faster options like satellite internet and fixed wireless. “Let’s use satellites, let’s use fixed wireless, let’s use fiber—let’s do it the cheapest, most efficient way we can,” Howard said during his confirmation hearing. Cruz also brought up the CHIPS and Science Act, accusing the Biden administration of attaching “lawless conditions” to the funding. He cited the requirement for semiconductor companies to provide child care as an example, saying it was never part of the bipartisan deal Congress approved. Howard is expected to roll back many of these conditions and refocus the funding on core tech and semiconductor development. Not everyone is on board with Howard’s plans. Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, voted against his confirmation, saying Howard didn’t give strong enough assurances that BEAD and CHIPS funding would continue to flow as intended. “I was looking for a stronger commitment,” Cantwell said. “You didn’t provide it. My vote is ‘no.’” Does Lutnick have any crypto plans? At the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Howard called crypto “the future of financial sovereignty,” making it clear he’s fully on board. He’s also pushing for mandatory audits of stablecoins like Tether. During his confirmation hearing, he proposed that stablecoin issuers should back their tokens with US Treasuries and undergo third-party audits to ensure transparency. But given Tether’s long history of failing to provide a full audit since 2014, enforcing this policy won’t be easy, and we’re betting Howard knows that. The SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, will be working closely with Howard. Their goal is to develop a clear regulatory framework that defines the jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and the CFTC, regulates stablecoin issuers as financial institutions, and explores the “feasibility” of a national Bitcoin reserve.

Here’s What The Charts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-10-target-in-play/,"Dogecoin is still reeling in losses after a crazy 40% decline at the start of the week. Although it has since recovered a bit, Dogecoin is still on a 20% loss in a seven-day timeframe at the time of writing. However, technical analysis suggests that Dogecoin’s bull run might still be in play, and the meme coin could still reach the $10 price target this cycle. This analysis is based on the time taken for Dogecoin to reach new all-time highs and market peaks in the previous cycles. Dogecoin’s Historical Cycles and Price Peaks Dogecoin’s price movements have historically followed well-defined cycles, and multiple analysts have observed a consistent pattern across the cycles. Notably, Dogecoin is now in its third market cycle, and price dynamics in the current cycle have already shown different repetition signs from the two previous cycles. Related Reading: Can The Dogecoin Price Rally For 3 Months Straight? 2021 Bull Market Performance Says Yes According to crypto analyst ÐOGECAPITAL (@DimaPotts36), Dogecoin’s price history has a striking cycle pattern that repeats approximately every 1,442 days. This pattern of 1,442 days is the average time taken for the Dogecoin price to reach its final peak of each cycle when counting from the bear market low. The first cycle, which spanned between 2013 and 2018, saw DOGE rally by 21,821% from its cycle low to its peak. Back then, Dogecoin was trading for a minuscule price around $0.00009, but it eventually surged to break above $0.01 for the first time. At that time, Dogecoin was still regarded as little more than a joke coin, with only speculative trading from early investors driving its price action. The bear market low was recorded at $0.00125, but as the crypto market entered a euphoric bull phase in 2021, Dogecoin became one of the biggest winners of the meme coin craze, as it went on a 54,890% increase from its cycle low. The meme coin craze allowed Dogecoin to gain prominence among retail traders during this period, which eventually pushed its price to the current all-time high of $0.7316. With the third cycle now in motion, crypto analyst ÐOGECAPITAL noted that it might take the same 1,422 days for Dogecoin to reach a new peak. Timeline For New Dogecoin Price Peak Dogecoin’s current market cycle began immediately after its all-time high in 2021, after which the meme coin entered a prolonged bear market. The price low for this cycle was registered sometime in 2022 when Dogecoin corrected to as low as $0.055. Related Reading: Dogecoin Still In Play As Price Gears Up For Another 600% Run Above $2 A repeat of the 1442-day cycle means that Dogecoin will reach its market peak on April 14, 2025. In terms of a price target, the predicted target is around $10, which would translate to an 18,000% increase from the 2022 bear market low. Although this percentage gain is notably smaller than the 54,890% rally seen during Dogecoin’s 2021 cycle, the capital required to create such an increase is significantly higher due to the cryptocurrency’s market cap. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2669 and is up by 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

As of writing, the combined crypto market cap is down 1.56% to $3.16 trillion, proving that headwinds remain. Ethereum Open Interest Turns Bullish As the frontline altcoin, Ethereum’s price has decoupled from that of Bitcoin (BTC). As of writing, the coin was changing hands for $2,789.12, up by 2.21% in 24 hours. In contrast, BTC’s price is still down 1.36% to $96,634. Amid this decoupling, there is evidence of a growing positive sentiment from the Ethereum futures traders. Open Interest data from Coinglass shows this metric is up marginally by 1.33% in 24 hours. With this outlook, a total of 8.57 million ETH, valued at $23.94 billion, has been committed by futures traders. This open in Open Interest might signal the start of a solo ride for ETH price. Amid a positive shift in the future market, the potential for ETH price to reclaim $3000 remains optimal. Having dropped as low as $2,500 in earlier trading, this rebound confirms the proponent’s forecast for a sustained revival. XRP Bears In Spotlight, SUI and AVAX Drags Spot While Ethereum has managed to hold the forte, XRP has continued to nosedive as of writing. Trading for XRP $2,397 has shed more than 5% in 24 hours. For a coin named a candidate to displace ETH, the odds are currently not in its favor. The SUI and Avalanche rivalry has continued to deepen, with the former making moves to overtake the latter in ranking. Currently, both coins are down by 6.66% to 1.72% and changing hands for $3.349 and $25.98, respectively. With this price outlook, SUI is trailing behind AVAX with a $340 million margin, a valuation that is easy to flip. Thus far, in this bull run, SUI has hit multiple all-time highs, while Avalanche has not in over 3 years. On occasions, SUI hovers new ATH , a sign that if bearish conditions thin out, it may overtake AVAX soon. ETH and XRP to Lead Altcoin Rebound As the most capitalized altcoins in the market, Ethereum and XRP are likely positioned to lead the sector’s recovery. Moreover, XRP remains in the spotlight, considering it has more fundamentals that may trigger a positive market reaction when activated. The push for XRP ETF in the United States may fuel a long-term bullish run for the coin. With firms like CoinShars, 21Shares, and Grayscale pushing for the ETF tracking XRP , analysts are convinced the current drawdown is temporary.
