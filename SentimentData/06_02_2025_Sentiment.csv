MicroStrategy Founder Causes Speculation Amid Bitcoin Holdings Pause Saylor posted on X on February 5 , calling it a “Big strategy day.” The social media post prompted mass speculation from members of the cryptocurrency community, receiving over 3,900 reposts and 30,000 likes. “Rebrand from MicroStrategy to MacroStrategy?” one X user inquired . “What are you up to?” another replied . ₿ig Strategy Day — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 5, 2025 On Monday, the Virginia-based company announced that it had paused Bitcoin purchases under its at-the-market equity offering program, though it did not sell any of its class A common stock. A February 3 SEC filing revealed that MicroStrategy, led by CEO Phong Le, holds 471,107 BTC, acquired for $30.4 billion at an average price of $64,511 per coin. MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, spending over $20 billion to build its reserves. Last month, MicroStrategy shareholders approved two amendments related to Class A common stock and preferred stock options, potentially impacting the company’s capital structure. In October 2023, MicroStrategy introduced its “21/21 plan,” targeting $42 billion in equity and fixed-income securities to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions through 2027. Michael Saylor Signals Interest in Shaping Crypto Regulations Saylor, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, acknowledged the impact of President Donald Trump’s election on the cryptocurrency’s value after its sharp post-election rally. Trump has pledged to reduce federal enforcement actions against the digital asset sector, a stance Saylor has publicly supported. However, Trump’s recent tariff policies have introduced uncertainty in crypto markets, contributing to fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price after its postelection rally. While Saylor has not revealed specific details about his strategy, he stated in an interview with Bloomberg that he would be open to advising Trump on digital asset policies.

Analysts believe XRP and Remittix could usurp Ethereum and Solana as the best cryptos to buy now that the bull market has nearly begun. While XRP is an older-established coin with a high value in terms of market cap, Remittix is currently in presale. Nevertheless, it is a runner, and its price is forecasted to go up proportionately to PayFi’s development. It is also one of the best coins to buy at current times. While Remittix is still on presale and will launch on major exchanges over the next few weeks, XRP is a top ten cryptocurrency by market cap, currently trading at less than three dollars. XRP to Overtake Ethereum and Solana: Analysts The initial verdict from crypto analysts and spectators was that Ethereum and Solana would dominate this cycle. However, that sentiment has changed. Analysts now believe XRP and the new crypto, Remittix, will be the biggest drivers for the next crypto rally. If they are right, both altcoins could go on a massive price surge once the bull run begins. Venture capital companies such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck are currently in contention for an XRP ETF. If their proposals are approved, it could cause the XRP price to surge in the market. That’s why even though the XRP price is currently dipping in the market and has fallen below three dollars, analysts believe it will be the primary driver of this cycle alongside Remittix. The prominent Ripple price prediction is ten dollars by the end of the cycle. Remittix To Surge 100x After Launch: Analysts Crypto analysts speculate that Remittix could surge 100x after it launches on major exchanges. Remiitix, which is still on presale has impressed the crypto community over the past few weeks and has emerged as one of the best crypto to buy now. Remittix has already raised over $10.6 million in its presale and is on course to hit its $36 million target in the next few weeks. After that, the token will likely launch on popular crypto exchanges like Uniswap. Remittix could potentially become a category leader in the PayFi sector and the broader payments sector, which is valued at over a quadrillion dollars. It is poised to gain relevance due to its features, which combine centralized and decentralized payment methods to solve issues in the payments sector, such as speed, costs, and accessibility. Since RTX powers the Remittix ecosystem, its price could surge quickly once it gets listed due to the growing demand for crypto payment solutions, and that’s why many experts consider it the best crypto to buy now. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana were the biggest drivers of the last crypto rally. While many thought they would also drive this rally, analysts have speculated that it will be XRP and Remittix. The XRP price is in free fall but can begin to climb when an XRP ETF is approved by the SEC. On the other hand, Remittix has amazed everyone in its presale, and analysts have rated it the best crypto to buy now. Join the presale and community now!

Instead, they now anticipate that XRP and Remittix will take center stage. Analysts are betting on XRP and Remittix to potentially replace Ethereum and Solana as the top picks as the bull market is about to kick off. While XRP is a well-established cryptocurrency with a significant market cap, Remittix is still in its presale phase. Despite being new, it is gaining momentum, and its value is expected to rise alongside PayFi’s growth, making it an attractive investment right now. Although Remittix remains in presale and is set to debut on major exchanges in the coming weeks, XRP stands as a top-ten cryptocurrency by market cap, with its trading price under three dollars. Analysts Predict XRP Will Surpass Ethereum and Solana Initially, the consensus among crypto analysts and enthusiasts was that Ethereum and Solana would lead this cycle. However, opinions have shifted. Experts now assert that XRP, along with the new player Remittix, will be pivotal in driving the next wave of crypto growth. If correct, these altcoins could experience significant price increases once the bull market is in full swing. Venture capital firms like Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck are competing to launch an XRP ETF. If their initiatives get the green light, it might trigger a substantial uptick in the XRP price. Thus, even though the XRP price is currently seeing a downturn and has dropped below three dollars, analysts are confident it will be a major force in this cycle, alongside Remittix. The leading prediction for Ripple’s price is a rise to ten dollars by the cycle’s end. Analysts Predict Remittix to Skyrocket 100x Post-Launch Crypto analysts are forecasting that Remittix could increase by 100x once it starts trading on major exchanges. Remittix, which is still in its presale stage, has captured the attention of the crypto community and is considered one of the best crypto investments at present. Remittix has already garnered over $10.6 million during its presale and is on track to meet its $36 million goal in the coming weeks, paving the way for its launch on major platforms like Uniswap. Remittix is poised to become a leader in the PayFi industry and the larger payments sector, which is valued at over a quadrillion dollars. Its innovative features, which integrate centralized and decentralized payment methods, aim to address key challenges in the payments sector such as speed, cost, and accessibility. With RTX at the heart of the Remittix system, its price is likely to climb rapidly once listed, driven by the increasing demand for crypto payment solutions, making it a top recommendation among experts for investment now. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana were the main catalysts of the previous crypto surge. Though initially expected to lead again, analysts now suggest that XRP and Remittix will take the spotlight this time. Although the XRP price is currently experiencing a decline, it could begin to rise if an XRP ETF gains SEC approval. Meanwhile, Remittix has impressed during its presale, earning it the distinction of the best crypto to invest in now. Join the presale and community now!

Pham said the agency will gather experts for a roundtable meeting , probably next month, that can build a case for how the commission ought to approach regulation and oversight of firms that offer betting on event contracts. She noted that despite her continued objections in recent years to former Chairman Rostin Behnam's enforcement stance against prediction markets — including wagers made on sporting events and U.S. political outcomes — the agency moved too far on its path to easily reverse it. ""Unfortunately, the undue delay and anti-innovation policies of the past several years have severely restricted the CFTC’s ability to pivot to common-sense regulation of prediction markets,” Pham said. ""The current commission interpretations regarding event contracts are a sinkhole of legal uncertainty and an inappropriate constraint on the new administration."" Setting up the roundtable is a ""necessary first step in order to establish a holistic regulatory framework that will both foster thriving prediction markets and protect retail customers from binary options fraud such as deceptive and abusive marketing and sales practices,"" Pham said. The CFTC lost an initial court case against Kalshi when a U.S. federal judge ruled late last year that the agency couldn't stop the firm from listing election contracts. However, the agency pursued an appeal with a higher court, and Kalshi argued in that new legal dispute that only Congress can halt election betting . Read More: CFTC Fines Crypto Betting Service Polymarket $1.4M for Unregistered Swaps The CFTC had taken a position through rules, orders and enforcement work that such political betting isn't permitted under derivatives laws and that the agency doesn't have the ability to police manipulation of those markets — basically arguing that it would have to be an elections cop. With only days remaining in his chairmanship, Behnam's agency was seeking information about Polymarket's customers from crypto exchange Coinbase. In language that's a sharp contrast from Behnam's resistance, Pham called prediction markets ""an important new frontier in harnessing the power of markets to assess sentiment to determine probabilities that can bring truth to the Information Age."" She added the agency needs to ""break with its past hostility.""

So far, the president has only picked a head for its cousin regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

From the likes of Bonk to DogWifHat, these tokens have not only entertained but also enriched their investors. Today, we're diving deep into the memecoin market to explore which could be the next big memecoin to offer astronomical returns. Among the contenders, Panshibi stands out, promising to merge the charm of pandas with the power of community-driven crypto. DogWifHat: The memecoin That Keeps on Giving DogWifHat, or WIF, has been a fan favorite since its inception. It is known for its Shiba Inu wearing a pink knitted hat and consistent community support. In 2024, Ansem, a huge whale on X(formerly Twitter) tweeted about DogWifHat multiple times. However, 2025 has started with low volatility for DogWifHat. This token has simply continued its down trend which started as far back as November. This downturn is a sign for DogWifHat investors to diversify, perhaps towards newer and better options like Panshibi. Although DogWifHat has an established base and a potential for community-driven events, a significant price change will not happen in a long time due to the current market turbulence. Bonk: The Underdog with Potential Bonk, known as the first dog-themed memecoin on the Solana blockchain, initially made waves with its community-focused airdrops. However, recent analyses suggest a dip in whale activity and a lack of significant utility features, which might be pushing Bonk investors towards new horizons like Panshibi. Although Bonk has launched various community activities like BonkDragon, the effect of this is yet to be seen as its price is currently on a downtrend. Despite this, Bonk remains a popular choice among memecoin enthusiasts. Since its market behavior indicates a potential for either recovery or further decline, experts are saying Bonk is a memecoin to watch from the sidelines. The Next Big Memecoin: Where to Place Your Bets? The memecoin market is notoriously unpredictable, but certain attributes stand out when looking for the next big memecoin. Panshibi, with its strategic community engagement, secure tokenomics, and a clear growth path, might just be that rocket ship. Its integration of AI and social-fi not only adds layers of utility but also keeps the community engaged. While Bonk and DogWifHat have their merits, Panshibi's innovative approach and community-centric model make it a strong contender for the next 20,000% memecoin. With the value of the memecoin market skyrocketing $115 billion in January 2025, there is a robust investor interest in memecoins and what they have to offer.. The Rise of Panshibi: A memecoin with a Mission Panshibi is inspired by the beloved panda as it aims to unite three massive communities under one project. These communities include Asia, pandas, and memecoin enthusiasts. Panshibiintroduces a blend of social-fi and AI elements, where token holders can engage in quests and earn rewards and prizes. With its native token, $SHIBI, Panshibi offers governance rights which allows buyers to determine their future. Also, staking opportunities are available with up to 1,200% APY, and exclusive access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. The whitepaper of Panshibi outlines a clear roadmap, emphasizing security with a 10-year liquidity lock and a 2-year team token lock. Although the presale is capped at $10 million, there is still enough time for you to buy in before it runs out. The price of one SHIBI is now $0.004 as the token is in Stage 3 of the presale . Also, there is a structure in place to increase the token price by 1,200% during this period. With predictions of a 145,000% surge post-launch, this coin is set to change the market forever. The smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, ensuring transparency and trust. After the presale, the ownership of the token will be renounced, handing the reins over to the community. With its current presale price at $0.004 (Stage 3), and plans for listing on Uniswap and major CEXs, Panshibi is shaping up to be the memecoin to watch in 2025. Conclusion As we navigate through the memecoin landscape, Panshibi emerges as a serious contender for significant growth. With its strategic presale, community engagement, and secure tokenomics, it's positioned to possibly outshine established names like Bonk and DogWifHat. While the future of memecoins is always speculative, Panshibi's blend of fun, community, and financial strategy makes it a memecoin to watch and emphasizes its potential to lead the next big memecoin boom in 2025.

This makes it a top choice for DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, and NFT marketplaces that require fast, cheap transactions. With its low-cost transactions and growing institutional adoption, Polygon remains one of the top cryptos to buy this month for those looking for a strong Ethereum-based investment. Celestia (TIA): The Future of Modular Blockchain Networks Celestia (TIA) is currently trading at $0.1602 and is one of the most exciting projects in modular blockchain technology.

With the rising demand for modular blockchain frameworks, Celestia is positioned to be a leader in on-chain scalability. It’s a must-watch for anyone looking at long-term investments in blockchain infrastructure.

From Bonk to DogWifHat, these tokens have both amused and financially benefited their investors. Today, we delve into the memecoin market to pinpoint which one might be the next major memecoin poised for extraordinary gains. Among the promising candidates, Panshibi stands out by blending the appeal of pandas with the strength of a community-focused cryptocurrency. DogWifHat: The Memecoin That Continues to Deliver DogWifHat, often abbreviated as WIF, has been a popular choice since it was first introduced. Famous for its Shiba Inu mascot sporting a pink hat, it enjoys unwavering community support. In 2024, Ansem, a notable whale on X (formerly Twitter), frequently tweeted about DogWifHat. However, as 2025 begins, the token faces low volatility. This ongoing decline, which started back in November, signals investors to consider diversifying into other options like Panshibi. Despite having a loyal following and potential for community-led events, significant price shifts for DogWifHat might not be forthcoming due to the current market conditions. Bonk: A Dark Horse with Promise Bonk, recognized as the first dog-inspired memecoin on the Solana network, initially gained attention with its community-centric airdrops. However, recent evaluations point to a decrease in whale involvement and a lack of substantial utility features, potentially steering Bonk investors toward new opportunities like Panshibi. Though it has initiated community projects like BonkDragon, their impact is yet to be felt as its value continues to decline. Nonetheless, Bonk remains a beloved option for memecoin fans. Given the current market trends, which suggest either a potential rebound or further drop, experts recommend observing Bonk closely. Finding the Next Big Memecoin: Where Should You Invest? The memecoin market is famously volatile, yet some features are key when identifying the next big memecoin. Panshibi, with its focused community interaction, solid tokenomics, and a well-defined growth strategy, could be that next explosive opportunity. Its integration of AI and social-fi not only adds utility layers but also keeps the community actively involved. While Bonk and DogWifHat have their strengths, Panshibi's innovative tactics and community-focused approach make it a strong candidate for being the next 20,000% memecoin. With the memecoin market value soaring to $115 billion by January 2025, there is a growing investor interest in what memecoins can deliver. The Emergence of Panshibi: A Memecoin on a Mission Panshibi is inspired by the iconic panda, aiming to bring together three large communities: Asia, panda lovers, and memecoin enthusiasts. It combines social-fi with AI features, allowing token holders to participate in quests and earn prizes. Holding the $SHIBI token in Panshibi grants governance rights, empowering investors to shape its future. It also offers staking opportunities with up to 1,200% APY and access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. The whitepaper details a secure path with a 10-year liquidity lock and a 2-year team token lock. The presale is capped at $10 million, but there is still time to invest before it closes. Currently, one SHIBI is priced at $0.004 as the token is in Stage 3 of the presale . The price is set to rise by 1,200% during this phase, and with forecasts predicting a 145,000% increase post-launch, this coin is poised to make a lasting impact on the market. The smart contract has been thoroughly reviewed by Coinsult, guaranteeing transparency and reliability. Following the presale, the token's ownership will be relinquished, allowing the community to take control. Priced at $0.004 in its current presale stage (Stage 3), and with plans to list on Uniswap and major CEXs, Panshibi is emerging as the memecoin to watch in 2025. Conclusion As we explore the evolving memecoin scene, Panshibi stands out as a promising candidate for substantial growth. With its well-structured presale, active community involvement, and solid tokenomics, it is well-positioned to potentially surpass established names like Bonk and DogWifHat. Although the future of memecoins remains uncertain, Panshibi's mix of entertainment, community, and financial strategy makes it a memecoin worth monitoring and highlights its potential to lead the next big memecoin wave in 2025.

Will liquidity rotate back, or is the dream of another altseason fading for good? Table of Contents Altcoins under pressure Bitcoin’s growing dominance What needs to change for an altcoin rally? How on-chain speculation is disrupting the altcoin market Bitcoin’s repricing and Ethereum’s quiet accumulation Altcoins under pressure On Feb. 3, global financial markets suffered a sharp flash crash after Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, triggering a sell-off across global markets. Stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies reacted immediately, with altcoins taking the biggest hit. At the end of January, the total altcoin market cap stood at $1.46 trillion, but by Feb. 3, it had plunged to $1 trillion,marking a 31.5% decline and wiping out $460 billion in market value. Total crypto market cap chart excluding Bitcoin | Source: TradingView Since then, the market has shown some signs of recovery, climbing to $1.22 trillion as of this writing on Feb. 5. However, it remains nearly 16% below its January levels and 28% short of its all-time high of $1.71 trillion from November 2021. The overall sentiment in the altcoin market remains weak. One key indicator for measuring whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin is the CMC Altcoin Season Index, which tracks the performance of the top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. As of Feb. 5, the index sits at 36, a sharp drop from 87 in December 2024, when altcoins surged following Trump’s election victory. A reading above 50 suggests a mild altcoin rally, while above 75 signals a full-fledged altcoin season. At its current level, the index indicates that Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market, with altcoins struggling to gain traction. Price performance among major altcoins also reflects this sentiment. Ethereum ( ETH ) has declined over 18% year to date, currently trading at around $2,800. Solana ( SOL ) has seen modest growth, rising 5% since the start of the year to reach $205. Meanwhile, Ripple ( XRP ) has been one of the best-performing large-cap altcoins, gaining 21% year to date and surging 360% over the past three months. With institutional interest in Bitcoin continuing to rise, the question remains: Will altcoins see a strong rally in 2025, or will Bitcoin’s dominance persist? Let’s find out. Bitcoin’s growing dominance Bitcoin’s growing dominance in the market has created a bottleneck for altcoins, preventing capital from flowing into them as it did in previous cycles. As of Feb. 5, Bitcoin accounts for 61.5% of the total crypto market cap, its highest level since early 2021. This means that for every dollar invested in crypto, over 61 cents go into Bitcoin, leaving around 39 cents for the thousands of other coins combined. Just two months ago, in December 2024, when altcoins found some footing, this number was 54%, highlighting how quickly Bitcoin has regained its hold over the market. To understand why this is happening, it helps to look at historical trends. Bitcoin dominance tends to rise during uncertain times. The collapse of FTX ( FTT ) in November 2022 is a prime example. When trust in the broader crypto market weakened, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at just 40%. In the following months, however, investors increasingly moved their capital into Bitcoin, pushing its market share past 64% recently. A similar pattern played out between 2018 and early 2021. During that period, Bitcoin’s dominance climbed from 35% to 63% before gradually declining as altcoins began outperforming. But this time, there is a key difference — institutions. Since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, Bitcoin has been absorbing an unprecedented amount of liquidity. As of this writing, spot BTC ETFs hold over $120 billion in assets under management, with large financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the charge. At the same time, discussions about a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. have been gaining traction. If governments start viewing Bitcoin as a hedge, the capital rotation cycle that previously fueled altcoin rallies could take much longer to materialize. Unlike previous cycles, where capital eventually rotated into altcoins, institutions are now accumulating Bitcoin, keeping liquidity concentrated and limiting capital flow into altcoins. What needs to change for an altcoin rally? Historically, capital in crypto markets has moved in phases. Bitcoin absorbs liquidity first, leading market rallies. Once BTC stabilizes, funds rotate into altcoins, triggering an altcoin season. This pattern was evident in 2017 when Bitcoin’s dominance peaked at 70%, paving the way for ETH and XRP to surge in early 2018. A similar trend played out in 2021 when Bitcoin reached $69,000 before altcoins gained traction. Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong, forming higher highs and higher lows—signs that liquidity is still concentrated in BTC. For altcoins to gain momentum, Bitcoin needs a prolonged stabilization period, allowing capital to rotate. A drop in Bitcoin dominance below key support levels would indicate investors shifting funds. Additionally, catalysts such as Ethereum upgrades, regulatory clarity, or broader adoption could accelerate this transition. Another factor slowing capital rotation is the growing presence of institutional investors. Unlike retail traders, institutions tend to make calculated, long-term investments, meaning they are less likely to chase short-term trends in altcoins as seen in past cycles. However, if Bitcoin dominance does start to decline, the rotation process will likely follow the established sequence: large-cap altcoins move first, followed by mid-caps, and then smaller, speculative projects. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern. How on-chain speculation is disrupting the altcoin market The way speculative capital moves in the crypto market has changed, and that shift could be one of the biggest reasons why a traditional altcoin season has yet to materialize. Analyst Miles Deutscher highlights the role of Pump.fun , a platform he says has “directly correlated to the destruction of the altcoin market vs BTC.” The launch of Pump Fun is directly correlated to the destruction of the altcoin market vs $BTC . 👇 The reason we've seen no major ""alt season"" across majors, is because the speculative capital that would've once poured into top 200 assets, instead decided to jump the gun and… pic.twitter.com/g04L2SCar2 — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) February 4, 2025 He explains that in previous cycles, speculative capital would have flowed into top 200 altcoins on centralized exchanges. Instead, much of that liquidity is now flooding into on-chain, low-cap tokens, many of which lack proper liquidity. This new trend has created an uneven market dynamic. “The early birds & insiders got insanely rich from this,” Deutscher notes, but he adds that most retail investors who entered late lost money — just as they did in previous altcoin cycles. However, unlike 2022, when retail losses were mostly limited to relatively liquid altcoins listed on centralized exchanges, this time, capital is locked in illiquid meme tokens, many of which have already retraced 70–80%. According to Deutscher, this shift has made the wealth destruction event even worse than what was seen in early 2022, despite Bitcoin and a few major altcoins remaining in a macro bull trend. Deutscher attributes this shift partly to regulatory uncertainty, stating that traders have been forced to look for alternative ways to speculate due to restrictions on fair project launches. “I don’t blame Pump Fun, as its launch is in direct response to the brash crypto regulation that has made it impossible to fair-launch projects.” He adds that the industry has struggled to find a fair model for new projects since 2017, with airdrops being the closest alternative. Bitcoin’s repricing and Ethereum’s quiet accumulation While altcoins struggle with liquidity, analyst The Bitcoin Therapist believes that Bitcoin’s current price does not reflect its true value. “Something is terribly wrong with the market’s pricing of Bitcoin. We are easily $50K–$100K undervalued,” he states, suggesting that a violent repricing event could be imminent. Something is terribly wrong with the market’s pricing of Bitcoin. We are easily $50K-$100K undervalued. There is far too much to be bullish about. There is going to be a violent repricing. — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) February 5, 2025 If this is the case, Bitcoin’s dominance may remain elevated for much longer than expected. Historically, Bitcoin has gone through rapid repricing phases when institutional demand outpaces supply, which may be happening now. However, as Matthew Hyland points out, the recent crash was also the largest liquidation event in crypto history, meaning a quick recovery should not be expected. “In 2020 & 2022, it took over two months for the full recovery to take place,” he notes. Considering this was the largest liquidation event in #Crypto history it likely means the low is in however in 2020 & 2022 it took over 2 months for the full recovery to take place You likely wont see those December highs on most #Alts for a minimum of 2 months if not longer so… pic.twitter.com/t5Zah7SN6s — Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) February 4, 2025 Hyland cautions investors against expecting an immediate return to prior highs, particularly for altcoins. Even during the rapid rebound of 2020, there were multiple dips along the way. “You likely won’t see those December highs on most alts for a minimum of two months, if not longer,” he says, adding that previous high-volatility events — such as the COVID crash, LUNA collapse, and FTX fallout — all took months to recover from. Ethereum, meanwhile, is quietly seeing large accumulation from major players. Analyst Naiive highlights that Donald Trump, through his project World Liberty Financial, has reportedly purchased $200 million in ETH, while Fidelity and BlackRock have accumulated $49.75 million and $300 million in ETH, respectively. Donald Trump bought $200M ETH Fidelity bought $49.75M ETH yesterday BlackRock bought $300M ETH today naiive bought $69 in ETH today Whales are shaking weak hands out — naiive (@naiivememe) February 5, 2025 This pattern suggests that whales are strategically shaking out weak hands, taking advantage of market uncertainty to accumulate at lower prices. If institutional ETH accumulation continues, Ethereum could act as a leading indicator for broader altcoin demand. When Ethereum starts gaining against Bitcoin, it often signals early capital rotation into large-cap altcoins, which can eventually trickle down to mid-caps and smaller assets. But until Bitcoin’s dominance shows signs of weakening, the altcoin recovery remains in a waiting phase. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Remittix is the altcoin project that analysts say could mirror the gains of Dogecoin, Cardano, and Toncoin, some of the top players in the space. Remittix (RTX) is the PayFi project that is on investors’ must-have list because of its tangible solutions to the limitations of the finance space. Its native RTX altcoin has raised over $10.6 million in its ongoing presale, and because of its distinct crypto-to-FIAT model, Remittix has been dubbed the XRP 2.0. Find out why! Dogecoin’s Downturn Continues As Analyst Predicts Continued Correction Grayscale, a prominent asset manager, released a Dogecoin Trust , and because the firm is known for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, experts believe that DOGE could scale to more than just a meme coin. Shortly after the launch of the Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale also filled out a form to convert the trust into an ETF. This development has caused a stir among DOGE holders who look forward to Dogecoin’s mainstream debut as more than a meme coin. However, top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared that DOGE may face a steep price correction because of its bearish crossover. DOGE has declined over 18% within the last seven days, and its price sits at $0.258 due to bearish sentiment. That’s why RTX outpaces it in its contributions to cross-border space. Analyst Says Cardano Could Reach $14 Cardano’s historical trends have caught the attention of investors who believe ADA could replicate its results. Javon Marks, a popular crypto analyst, identified ADA’s key resistance and shared that the project could surge past $7. Lucky , another popular crypto commentator, shared that ADA was a long-term project and a solid bet for those who want to boost their portfolios. ADA trades at $0.71, declining over 19% within the last seven days, yet many experts remain optimistic about Cardano’s future prospects. However, ADA holders turn to RTX’s token presale to get their hands on its bullish potential. Can TON Reach $6? Analyst Studies Its Movement Toncoin’s partnership with Telegram has increased the project’s adoption and contributions to blockchain integration. Neucaster recently shared in a post on X that TON could see a significant price increase in the coming weeks. The analysts stated that Toncoin could witness a massive rally that could push its price to $6; hence, the project’s partnership with Telegram has drawn more investors to the platform. TON trades at about $3.95, declining over 18% within the last seven days, but analysts say that it could reach $14.9 by March. Yet, Toncoin investors look to RTX as one of the best coins to buy now for massive returns this year. Remittix’s Presale Nears The $15 Million Mark Due To Its Unique Appeal Remittix’s token presale has gained significant momentum due to its cross-border technology. The Remittix presale has raised over $10.6 million, with each RTX token priced at $0.0539.

Given the firm's reputation for handling Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, many believe DOGE could evolve beyond its meme coin status. Following the introduction of the Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale also filed to transform the trust into an ETF. This announcement has created excitement among DOGE investors who are eager to see Dogecoin's journey into mainstream finance. Nonetheless, leading analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that DOGE might encounter a significant price dip due to its bearish trend. DOGE has fallen by over 18% in the past week, with its value currently at $0.258, hindered by negative market sentiment. This is one reason why RTX surpasses it in terms of contributions to the cross-border financial sector.

Dogecoin whales purchase up to 560 million Doge in a week Recent analysis from experts suggest Dogecoin’s biggest investors are back in the game.

Transactions higher than $100,000 have increased recently, indicating a strategic gobbling up of the asset amongst investors. Popular analyst, Ali Martinez, spoke about Dogecoin’s price on his X account on January 31st. He disclosed that whale investors have gathered 560 million DOGE tokens in seven days. This marked increase in whales activity occurred after the crypto market saw a prolonged reduction in price. The increase in whales activity also points to the fact that many investors are choosing to liquidate their tokens to make profit - all due to bearish movement of Dogecoin’s price. The bearish momentum and unprecedented reduction in price has caused Dogecoin’s market to experience a significant sell off. With whale investors getting back in action, experts predict some positive changes in the long run. Experts predict Dogecoin price to experience significant rally With the recent increase in whales’ activity, experts suggest the drop in Dogecoin price is in preparation for a significant rally. Popular crypto analyst and trader, Tardigrade, recently shared a price chart, showing previous trends when Dogecoin increased to new marks. Experts believe the coin’s recent price trend is similar to these previous trends, so investors could be experiencing significant gains in the near future. Like in 2017, when Dogecoin’s price went to its highest level, Tardigrade believes the same thing could happen in 2025. Experts also predict an imminent increase of ATH to $3.80. Dogecoin whales and the new panda meme, Panshibi Without any doubt, Dogecoin continues to dominate the meme coin section of the crypto world.

Dogecoin Whales Acquire 560 Million DOGE in One Week New insights from experts indicate that Dogecoin's top investors are re-engaging actively. Various analysts have reported that these major players are expanding their Dogecoin portfolios. The frequency of transactions exceeding $100,000 has risen lately, reflecting a deliberate accumulation strategy among investors. Well-known analyst Ali Martinez discussed Dogecoin’s price on his X account on January 31st. He revealed that whale investors gathered 560 million DOGE tokens over the course of a week. This significant uptick in whales activity followed a prolonged decline in the crypto market. The surge in whales activity also suggests that many investors are offloading their tokens to capitalize on profits amid Dogecoin's bearish price trends. The prevailing downward trend and drastic price drop has led to a notable sell-off in Dogecoin’s market. With whale investors returning, experts foresee potential positive shifts in the future. Experts Anticipate a Major Dogecoin Price Rally The recent uptick in whale activity has led experts to believe that the dip in Dogecoin price is a precursor to a major rally. Renowned crypto analyst and trader, Tardigrade, recently shared a price chart highlighting past trends when Dogecoin hit new highs. Experts see the current price movement as reminiscent of previous trends, suggesting investors might soon see substantial returns. Just as in 2017, when Dogecoin’s price peaked, Tardigrade anticipates a similar occurrence by 2025. Experts are also predicting a near-term all-time high increase to $3.80.

39969876,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=669318,1738798184,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39969876.jpeg,Treasury Secretary Bessent says Trump is “not calling for the Fed to lower interest rates”,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/treasury-secretary-bessent-says-trump-is-not-calling-for-the-fed-to-lower-interest-rates/,"Scott Bessent, president Donald Trump’s handpicked Treasury Secretary, put an end to the speculation during a Wednesday interview on Fox Business. The president is not pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, Scott said. Instead, he claims that the administration’s focus is laser-locked on long-term borrowing costs, specifically the 10-year Treasury yield. “He and I are focused on the 10-year Treasury,” Scott said. “He is not calling for the Fed to lower rates.” Scott’s claims are a bit odd since as Cryptopolitan reported on Jan. 24, Trump did say “I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us all over.” Tariff tactics and manufacturing goals Scott then laid out exactly why long-term yields are more important to Trump’s economic strategy, explaining that expanding the US energy supply will help curb inflation. With inflation strangling consumers and businesses, the administration is betting that lower energy costs will have a knock-on effect, making goods cheaper and long-term borrowing more manageable. But not everyone is clapping for these guys. Democrats are seething after Scott gave Elon Musk’s controversial D.O.G.E department access to federal Treasury data, a decision that triggered accusations of recklessness and even protests outside the Hill. In the interview, Scott defended the decision head-on, saying, “The US has a serious spending problem, which is fast becoming a detrimental economic problem. My focus is on the national debt and the budget deficit. I want to bring it down and increase the GDP. D.O.G.E is exactly what we need.” Scott also went full steam ahead on Trump’s trade policy, explaining how the administration is using tariffs as a weapon to revive domestic industries. Medical supplies and shipbuilding are high on the list of targeted sectors. Tariff threats against Colombia, Mexico, and Canada, he said, were designed to pressure them into cooperating on immigration and trade-related issues. But the ultimate objective, according adding Scott, is to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US “We’re aiming for long-term growth,” he said, hinting that once American factories are up and running, the revenue generated by tariffs will naturally drop off. Trump’s team is playing the long game — squeeze trading partners now to create a self-sufficient industrial base later, said Scott. Despite criticizing former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s strategy before taking office, Scott is keeping much of her framework in place for now. Next week, the Treasury will auction $125 billion in long-term debt, with sales broken down into 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year maturities. The auctions include $58 billion in 3-year notes, $42 billion in 10-year notes, and $25 billion in 30-year bonds. These auctions are designed to raise $18.8 billion in new cash, and for now, Scott isn’t making any drastic changes to the way Treasury handles long-term borrowing. But why stick with Yellen’s plan when he previously criticized it? Simple—Scott is playing it cool, letting the dust settle before shaking things up. And while Treasury insiders are itching for tweaks, especially to long-term issuance, Scott is choosing stability over chaos. Debt ceiling constraints and Fed quantitative tightening The federal debt ceiling, reinstated after a suspension in mid-2023, has forced Scott’s department into “extraordinary measures” to avoid breaching the limit. Treasury officials warned that these debt ceiling constraints could make Treasury bill issuance more volatile than usual. The department also announced it would rely heavily on short-term cash management bills to navigate the crisis until Congress either raises or suspends the cap. Another complication comes from the Federal Reserve’s ongoing quantitative tightening program, which is sucking $25 billion worth of Treasuries out of circulation each month. With fewer buyers in the market, the Treasury is being forced to rethink its borrowing strategy. In his interview, Scott said he is keeping a close eye on when the Fed might slow—or fully stop—this policy. Dealers now expect QT to end sometime in the summer, slightly later than the original spring estimate, creating additional pressure on Treasury’s borrowing needs by 2025. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), a group of Wall Street players and economists, has urged the department to modify its forward guidance to reflect market unpredictability. Some members of the panel want the language scrapped altogether, but others prefer more cautious adjustments. Scott isn’t letting them call the shots. Responding to TBAC’s recommendations, he reminded everyone that their advice is just that—advice. “The Treasury decides.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-05 23:29:44

South Korean Police Arrest 90; More to Come? The Busan Metropolitan Police Agency arrested the group on suspicion of violating the Narcotics Control Act. Officers remanded 18 suspects in custody. Police released photos of instant coffee mix containers the group allegedly used to smuggle drugs into South Korea. (Source: Busan Metropolitan Police Agency) Officers said they had started monitoring the suspects “from September last year.” Their investigation comes as a result of a “drugs crackdown” centered on nine Vietnamese-run bars and clubs in the cities of Sejong, Daegu, Cheonan, Asan, and Jincheon. The police said that the gang “systematically smuggled drugs” into South Korea. The group then allegedly “distributed them” in the bars and other clubs. A spokesperson said the gang members “smuggled drugs into the country,” disguising their illegal cargo “as packets of coffee and vitamins.” Officers claim the gang entered South Korea “on education, employment, or marriage visas.” However, police officials added that “some of the suspects” are “illegal residents.” The police think that the gang brought 1.04 billion won ($721,000) worth of narcotics into the country. Officers think that the group succeeded in selling 710 million won (almost half a million USD) worth of this amount to club and bar patrons. Police investigators raid a nightclub associated with the drug raid. (Source: Busan Metropolitan Police Agency) Crypto Was Gang’s ‘Payment Tool’ Police said the gang used cryptoassets as a payment tool to sell, smuggle, and source the drugs. Officers added that the gang sold synthetic marijuana, ketamine, and MDMA (ecstasy) to club- and bar-goers. They also think the gang helped organize private parties to boost interest in their illegal wares. The police force said it had “relayed the details of this crackdown” to several local government bodies. Despite the political upheaval and its negative effects on the economy of South Korea last year, Suwon Mayor Lee Jae-joon is content with his city's progress. https://t.co/F8LP9lKM7e — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 5, 2025 Officers also said they would take action against “buyers who took drugs” at the bars and clubs in question. A police spokesperson said investigators “plan to identify and arrest” more “intermediaries” by conducting a “digital analysis of the suspects’ cell phones.” The spokesperson said that the police force now “plans to conduct regular crackdowns” on clubs and entertainment venues frequently visited by foreign nationals.” The spokesperson added: “Our crackdown will help prevent the spread of drugs and drug abuse.” South Korean police officers throughout the country have been fighting what they and prosecutors have called a worsening epidemic of crypto-powered drug crime. South Korea’s consumer inflation accelerated on the back of higher energy and food prices, adding to concerns for policymakers https://t.co/5Ek0pEyeoT — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 4, 2025 Cryptonews.com has seen recent Korean-language posts on the social media networks X and Telegram from what appears to be drug dealers offering “nationwide” drugs “delivery.” One post, from February 3, made mention of Bitcoin (BTC) . This appears to suggest the dealer would only accept advance BTC payment for dead-dropped narcotics “deliveries.” South Korean media outlets have claimed that crypto-powered drug gangs have turned Korean-language Telegram channels into “drugs department stores.” They say the online spaces have become an illicit “playground” for young South Koreans.

These 5 Bitcoin-Friendly Cryptos Could Skyrocket Next!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrps-rise-to-50-these-5-bitcoin-friendly-cryptos-could-skyrocket-next/,"From Bitcoin’s Ascent to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Breakthrough THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing attention as the next big win in the crypto market, even as Bitcoin (BTC) celebrates its historic milestone of crossing $100,000. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value.

Officially, the State’s legislature has welcomed Senate Bill 57 (SB57), which will see New Mexico invest 5% of public funds in Bitcoin. The Bill was introduced to the New Mexico Senate by Senator Ant Thornton. New Mexico Bitcoin Reserve Bill The Bill, as shared on X , dubbed the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” focuses on establishing an alternative treasury for the state. The proposed 5% allocation would diversify the state’s funds in Bitcoin and allow it to benefit from its long-term price appreciation. The Bill also proposed that the State Investment Officer manage this Bitcoin reserve. Notably, the manager will operate under the oversight of the State Investment Council. The Bill also spelled out the need for cold storage as a viable means to safeguard the State’s Bitcoin. As Senator Thornton defines it, this BTC reserve will diversify New Mexico’s investments away from stocks and bonds. It will also position the state at the forefront of innovation in the growing cryptocurrency industry. Thornton also emphasized the economic benefits of a Bitcoin pivot, which could attract crypto companies and benefit the local economy. Conditions like transparent reporting and public awareness were also spelled out to make the bill more appealing. More US States Pushing for a Bitcoin Reserve Besides New Mexico, other top US States are also exploring the Bitcoin reserve move. As reported earlier by Coingape, Indiana seeks Bitcoin ETF exposure for the state’s retirement funds. The Indiana BTC Bill was filed in late January by Rep Jake Teshka. Lawmakers in other US States like Utah have also introduced a Bitcoin Bill to benefit the region in the long term. While about 15 states in the US have introduced a Bitcoin Bill, it underscores the growing adoption of the coin. The move aligns with the Federal Government’s national digital asset stockpile plan. In a recent press conference, Crypto &AI Czar David Sacks confirmed that the government is evaluating a proposal to establish a Bitcoin reserve. However, the timeline of events or whether the presidential crypto working group will recommend BTC purchases remains unknown. BTC Price to Benefit Amid the growing clamor for BTC in state portfolios, analysts have projected the overall impact will be felt in the coin’s price. At the moment, BTC was changing hands for $96,679, up by 1.1% at the time of writing. It has recorded a 24-hour low and high of $96,301.67 and $99,113.20 respectively. If proposals from Utah and other states get approved and public funds are injected into the coin, its market cap will soar. This will not only push prices upward but ultimately help in curtailing the volatility of the growing asset class.

While Ampere looks primed for a takeover, it is also exploring its strategic options, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. The same people also urged caution as talks could still fall apart. It’s also possible the chipmaker is snapped up by another potential buyer. SoftBank has made several strategic acquisitions in recent years, including stakes in companies like Arm Holdings and WeWork. Ampere primed for takeover Ampere designs semiconductors that use Arm’s technology. It was valued at $8 billion in a proposed minority investment by Japan’s SoftBank in 2021. The company’s current valuation, as far as Arm and Ampere are concerned, is still being discussed. While representatives for all parties involved have not commented publicly, we know that Ampere has been working with a financial adviser to help field takeover interest according to a Bloomberg News report from September. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s interest in a deal with a larger player in the industry reportedly implies that there was no clear path to an initial public offering. An announcement regarding the transaction is expected in the coming weeks, highlighting the urgency and significance of the deal. The deal involves SoftBank Group Corp. and Ampere Computing LLC, which is backed by Oracle Corp., showcasing a collaboration between major players in the tech industry. Chip companies cashing in on the AI spending boom The interest in Ampere, whose early backers also include Carlyle Group Inc., is strategic as it comes at a time when chip companies are looking to leverage the growing demand for artificial intelligence technologies. Last year, Oracle confirmed that it owns 29% of the startup and can exercise future investment options that would give it control of the chipmaker. There is a huge interest to control key components as the data center industry gets ready for the AI age, but Ampere, like its larger rivals Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., finds itself having to deal with consumer interest gravitating towards Nvidia Corp’s accelerator chips from CPUs. Ampere makes processors for data center machinery using Arm’s technology. Meanwhile, Arm is increasingly moving from being a licensor of fundamental standards and basic blueprints to more of a complete chipmaker. Ampere’s engineers, many of whom used to work for Intel’s former industry-leading server chip unit, have also been hired. Their addition is expected to provide momentum to Arm’s CEO Rene Haas’ efforts to expand into the server chip market, leveraging their experience and knowledge. Founder and CEO Renee James, a former Intel executive, had eyes on taking Ampere public. In April 2022, the company revealed it had filed confidentially for a US IPO at a time when demand for chips was on the increase. If a takeover of Ampere is successful, a run of semiconductor deals would continue at a time when global deals involving chips are surging. Just last year, Bloomberg reported that deals involving chip companies more than doubled to over $31 billion.

As stablecoins continue to play a growing role in the cryptocurrency and financial sectors, the administration aims to ensure that they operate within a regulated environment that aligns with traditional monetary policies. A senior official stated that the administration is “closely monitoring the development of stablecoins” and recognizes their potential to enhance financial transactions and global commerce. The push for regulation comes amid increasing concerns about the stability and oversight of digital assets, particularly as the stablecoin market has expanded rapidly in recent years. Many stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies, providing a level of stability that other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, often lack. However, without clear regulations, policymakers worry that stablecoins could pose risks to financial markets, consumer protection, and even national security. The administration is reportedly considering a regulatory framework that would ensure stablecoins maintain a one-to-one backing with U.S. dollar reserves and comply with existing financial rules. “We believe that stablecoins, when properly regulated, can serve as a valuable tool for the U.S. financial system and the global economy,” the official said. The move aligns with broader efforts to establish the United States as a leader in digital currency innovation while maintaining the integrity of its financial system. Stablecoins have increasingly been used in payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, making them an integral part of the evolving digital asset landscape. The administration’s stance on stablecoin regulation also comes as political figures and regulatory bodies debate the future of cryptocurrency oversight in the U.S. Donald Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto advocate, with his campaign receiving significant financial backing from the digital asset industry. Industry leaders have called for clear regulations to prevent uncertainty and encourage mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. While some officials view stablecoins as a potential asset for enhancing payment efficiency, others warn that improper regulation could undermine the dollar’s dominance or introduce systemic risks. One of the key concerns surrounding stablecoins is ensuring they have sufficient reserves to back their issuance, preventing situations where issuers fail to meet redemption demands. The administration is expected to collaborate with financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, to establish guidelines for stablecoin issuers. Market participants believe that regulatory clarity could help increase trust in stablecoins and encourage their adoption by traditional financial institutions. As the U.S. moves toward shaping its approach to stablecoin oversight, the cryptocurrency industry will closely monitor how the administration balances innovation with financial stability. With regulatory discussions gaining momentum, the coming months could prove crucial in determining the role stablecoins will play in the future of digital finance.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-05 23:36:00

On Wednesday, the Canadian blockchain entity announced that this acquisition increases its total Bitcoin and Bitcoin-equivalent holdings to 68.14 units, further confirming its commitment to Bitcoin as a key treasury asset. Strengthening Financial Stability With Bitcoin The company stated that the new Bitcoin was bought at an average price of USD$99,580 per coin, including fees and expenses. Notably, Matador remains debt-free, holding all its Bitcoin outright. In addition to Bitcoin, the company holds CAD$1.8 million in cash reserves and 2 kilograms of physical gold, valued at roughly CAD$287,000. According to Matador, these assets reveal its prudent financial strategy focused on long-term stability and capital preservation. Consequently, the company continues integrating Bitcoin into its treasury operations, further reinforcing its position as a digital asset leader. Expanding Digital Gold Strategy It’s worth noting that in January, the company announced the development of a digital gold platform, set to launch in the first quarter of 2025. This platform will leverage blockchain technology to strengthen its investment strategy. Matador CEO Deven Soni stated that the company has been working on “making gold great again” since 2021 and is excited to bring this concept to market. This idea fits Matador’s broader goal of merging traditional finance with digital tools, as seen in its recent decision to add Bitcoin as a core asset. Technology Giants Continue to Bet Big on Bitcoin Meanwhile, last month, Metaplanet announced its strategic initiative to acquire 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and 21,000 Bitcoin by 2026, positioning itself among the most significant corporate holders of the cryptocurrency globally. Semler Scientific, a healthcare technology company, recently purchased 871 Bitcoin for $88.5 million, seeing impressive returns with a paper gain of over 150%. Likewise, MicroStrategy, a software firm, is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy . The company plans to raise $563 million through a Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) offering, solidifying its leadership in corporate cryptocurrency investments.

Governments argue that privacy coins are untraceable, posing a significant risk to financial security and accountability. However, financial privacy is a standard expectation in traditional systems—we don’t allow anyone to track our bank account just because we bought an ice cream. Zano , the L1 blockchain for confidential assets and private dApps, has partnered with Cake Wallet , one of the biggest non-custodial wallets among privacy enthusiasts, to make privacy features more accessible and user-friendly for the web3 community. Zano was founded by Andrey Sabelnikov , the lead developer behind CryptoNote – a privacy coin protocol used by Monero and hundreds of other projects. Zano Partners with Cake Wallet to Improve User-accessibility Zano’s partnership with Cake Wallet is pivotal in making privacy coins more accessible to mainstream users. The collaboration brings Zano’s advanced privacy tools into Cake Wallet’s application, providing an enhanced experience for users seeking to safeguard their assets. The partnership empowers Cake Wallet users to hold, manage, and transact with Zano coins, giving them access to a privacy-first cryptocurrency within a non-custodial wallet. As part of the integration, Cake Wallet will support Zano’s confidential assets, which include private stablecoins and wrapped versions of major cryptocurrencies like zBTC and zETH. According to Vikrant Sharma, the co-founder and CEO of Cake wallet: “Cake Wallet is dedicated to pushing privacy forward, and our partnership with Zano is a natural stepping stone in bringing robust privacy tools to the cryptocurrency community and beyond,” Similar thoughts were shared by Quenten van Welzen, the head of marketing and growth at Zano: ‘The values of Zano and Cake Wallet overlap quite a bit. Therefore, integrating the Zano blockchain into Cake Wallet seems like a natural fit, and we are very excited to be onboarded to such a wonderful privacy-friendly wallet,” Why Users Love Zano: Privacy, Security, and Full Control Over Their Assets Zano’s integration with Cake Wallet is already winning over users who prioritise financial privacy, security, and ease of use. In an era of increasing financial surveillance and data breaches, the ability to transact securely without exposing sensitive information is more important than ever. With its seamless, privacy-first approach, Zano empowers individuals to take full control of their digital assets while maintaining complete confidentiality. “For me, financial privacy is a fundamental right. With Zano and Cake Wallet, I finally have a simple, secure way to manage my assets without worrying about surveillance or data leaks. It’s reassuring to know I can transact freely while keeping my financial data private,” said Alex M., a longtime cryptocurrency user and privacy advocate. By combining Zano’s advanced privacy features with Cake Wallet’s intuitive design, the partnership ensures that users can easily store, send, and receive confidential assets without technical complexity. This collaboration reinforces the importance of privacy in the digital economy, giving users the tools they need to protect their financial freedom. A Step Closer to Institutional Adoption While blockchain’s transparency is often seen as an advantage, it presents a major obstacle for financial institutions looking to adopt the technology. Contrary to popular belief, complete transparency is not always beneficial—especially in financial systems where confidentiality is crucial. Traditional banking and corporate finance operate on the principle that certain data, such as transaction details, client identities, and proprietary trading strategies, must remain private to protect competitive advantages and comply with regulations on data security. For institutions, the challenge is striking a balance between trust and privacy. They need to verify the integrity of transactions, ensure compliance, and prevent fraud without exposing proprietary information to the public. This requirement creates friction when integrating with public blockchains, where transactions are permanently recorded and fully visible to anyone. To drive institutional adoption, blockchain technology must evolve to provide mechanisms that offer cryptographic proof of validity without revealing the underlying data itself.

Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, announced the filing on social media, emphasizing that customer assets should not be absorbed into a custodian’s bankruptcy proceedings. Coinbase Urges Court to Uphold Customer Asset Rights In a recent post on X , Paul Grewal stated that Coinbase filed an amicus brief in the Prime Trust bankruptcy case. The company is advocating for the enforcement of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 8, which ensures that assets held by custodians belong to customers and not the custodians themselves. Coinbase argues that both its user agreement and Prime Trust’s user agreement explicitly state that assets remain customer property. The company asserts that bankruptcy should not alter these agreements or reclassify assets as part of the custodian’s estate. The legal filing will prevent customer funds from being included in Prime Trust’s bankruptcy estate. Coinbase maintains that upholding UCC Article 8 is essential to maintaining trust in custodians, both in digital and traditional finance. In other legal developments, the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 hearing is drawing industry-wide attention. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal will testify alongside other key figures, pushing back against alleged unfair banking restrictions on crypto. Legal Protections Under UCC Article 8 UCC Article 8 is a fundamental part of commercial law that protects customer assets held by custodians. It applies to both digital and traditional financial institutions, ensuring that customer funds remain separate from a custodian’s bankruptcy proceedings. Coinbase emphasized that this legal framework applies to major financial institutions, including Bank of New York (BNY) and Depository Trust Company (DTC). The company stated that courts have historically upheld these protections to ensure market stability and customer security. The amicus brief argues that disregarding UCC Article 8 could set a negative precedent for customer asset protections. Coinbase believes that recognizing customer ownership of assets is critical for preserving market confidence and protecting investor funds. Trust and Security in Financial Markets Coinbase has positioned itself as a strong advocate for customer asset protection in financial markets. The company stated that ensuring customer funds remain secure is essential for maintaining trust in custodians and financial institutions. Paul Grewal expressed confidence in the legal precedent supporting customer asset protections. He urged the court to reinforce these protections in the Prime Trust bankruptcy case, aligning with past court rulings that have upheld UCC Article 8. The company emphasized that its filing is not about crypto only but about broader financial principles that impact digital and traditional finance. In addition, the top crypto exchange continues to strengthen its global footprint with regulatory approvals in key markets. Coinbase recently secured a VASP license in the UK, allowing it to offer expanded crypto and fiat services. This move aligns with its broader international strategy, ensuring compliance while driving digital asset adoption.

But instead of holding, many are selling their coins to buy a new altcoin that’s gaining attention—Remittix (RTX) . While Dogecoin stays strong and Shiba Inu struggles, whales are shifting to RTX because it offers real-world use and big growth potential. What’s making Remittix so special? Let’s find out! Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars, But Price Struggles Amid Market Sell-Off, Remittix Gains Momentum Recently, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) experienced a significant burn incident whereby over one billion SHIB tokens—worth $18,832.80—were transferred to a ""dead address."" Since it helps lower the token supply and maybe enhance the price, this burn generated enthusiasm in the Shiba Inu community. Still, Shiba Inu's price suffers even with the burn. Pricing at $0.00001757 , SHIB is currently down 6.6% in the last 24 hours and has fallen 12.11% in the last week. With $539 million taken off from crypto assets in liquidations, this drop fits a larger market sell-off. Remittix (RTX) is fast becoming popular as Shiba Inu struggles. Using cryptocurrencies, this creative PayFi concept provides underbanked people with a means of sending and receiving money anywhere. Remittix is fulfilling its promise with $10.6 million raised in a few weeks. Its Pay API helps companies to accept crypto payments and quickly translate them into FIAT currencies, therefore lowering the price-related risks. Remittix is presenting itself as a game-changer in the global payments industry, giving financial freedom to those outside the conventional banking system, while SHIB battles with pricing volatility. Dogecoin Faces Struggles While Remittix Gains Investor Interest Price swings in Dogecoin (DOGE) have lately been somewhat noticeable. It lost 27.27% in December 2024, then recovered by 21.87% in early January; nevertheless, by January 28 it dropped once more to $0.33, with the present price at $0.2957 . Notwithstanding this instability, experts such as Ali Martinez hope that the introduction of a Dogecoin ETF will cause a price surge, thereby guiding DOGE to $15 in the next months. However, many investors are looking for other opportunities, and Remittix ( RTX ) has caught their attention. This innovative project aims to solve long-standing issues in global payments, offering financial services to those who don’t have access to traditional banks. With over $10.6 million raised in just a few weeks, Remittix is becoming a strong alternative to meme coins like Dogecoin. While Dogecoin’s future remains uncertain, Remittix’s utility-focused approach makes it an appealing option for those seeking a new, promising crypto project. Remittix: A Game-Changer in Global Payments An exciting new cryptocurrency causing ripples in the financial scene is Remittix (RTX) . Unlike many cryptocurrencies, which are just for trade or speculation, Remittix is all about addressing practical issues. Its goal is to use blockchain technology to enable faster, less expensive, more accessible money transfers, transforming the $190 trillion worldwide money transfer market. Remittix's $RTX token, used for staking, platform incentives, and governance, forms its central component. With just 1.5 billion coins in circulation, the coin is a limited supply desirable item as the network expands. With no hidden costs, users may quickly convert over forty cryptocurrencies into FIAT currencies and send money to any bank account anywhere in the globe. This makes it far less expensive than banks and standard money transfer companies. Businesses are also getting on board with Remittix, thanks to its Remittix Pay API. This allows merchants to accept crypto payments and automatically convert them to FIAT currencies, removing the risk of price fluctuations. With over 30 FIAT currencies and 50 altcoins supported, Remittix is revolutionizing international payments and positioning itself as a game-changer in the industry. At just $0.0539 per token during its presale, Remittix offers a unique opportunity for investors looking to get in early on this transformative platform.

However, instead of holding onto these coins, a significant number are opting to sell in favor of acquiring a promising new altcoin—Remittix (RTX) . While Dogecoin maintains its strength and Shiba Inu faces challenges, whales are gravitating towards RTX due to its practical applications and potential for substantial growth. What exactly makes Remittix stand out? Let’s explore! Shiba Inu's Burn Rate Increases, But Price Declines Amid Market Downturn, Remittix Gains Traction Recently, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) underwent a massive burn event, with over a billion SHIB tokens—worth $18,832.80—being sent to an inactive address. This action sparked excitement within the Shiba Inu community as it reduces token supply and could potentially boost prices. Despite this, Shiba Inu's value continues to dip. With a current price of $0.00001757 , SHIB has dropped by 6.6% in the past 24 hours and 12.11% over the last week. The decline is part of a broader market sell-off, with $539 million disappearing from crypto assets due to liquidations. As Shiba Inu struggles, Remittix (RTX) is gaining traction. This innovative PayFi solution uses cryptocurrencies to provide underbanked individuals with a method to send and receive money globally. Remittix is delivering on its promises, raising $10.6 million in a matter of weeks. Its Pay API enables companies to accept crypto payments and swiftly convert them into FIAT currencies, minimizing price-related risks. As SHIB grapples with price volatility, Remittix is positioning itself as a transformative force in international payments, offering financial independence to those outside the traditional banking system. Dogecoin Faces Challenges as Remittix Captures Investor Attention Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently experienced notable price fluctuations. After dropping 27.27% in December 2024 and rebounding by 21.87% in early January, it fell again, reaching $0.33 by January 28, with the current price at $0.2957 . Despite this volatility, experts like Ali Martinez believe that a Dogecoin ETF launch could trigger a price increase, potentially driving DOGE to $15 in the coming months. Nevertheless, many investors are seeking alternatives, and Remittix ( RTX ) has caught their eye. Aiming to address long-standing global payment challenges, this innovative project offers financial services to those without access to traditional banking. With over $10.6 million raised in a few weeks, Remittix is emerging as a compelling alternative to meme coins like Dogecoin. While the future of Dogecoin remains uncertain, Remittix’s focus on utility provides an appealing option for investors interested in a promising new crypto venture. Remittix: Revolutionizing Global Payments Remittix (RTX) is an exciting new cryptocurrency making waves in the financial world. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that focus on trading or speculation, Remittix addresses real-world issues. It aims to revolutionize the $190 trillion global money transfer market by offering faster, cheaper, and more accessible transfers using blockchain technology.

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the nation’s largest union organization, filed a lawsuit in a Washington, DC, federal court on February 3. “Unlawful” Data Sharing with Musk-Led Task Force The court document revealed that AFL-CIO sought to halt what it describes as an “ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure” of confidential data. It argued that individuals required to share financial details with the government should not have their information exposed to Musk and D.O.G.E while stressing the scale of the privacy breach. The lawsuit follows reports that DOGE, a Trump administration task force led by Musk responsible with reducing federal workforce and regulations, gained access to crucial Treasury databases, including Social Security and Medicare payment systems. According to reports , D.O.G.E’s ability to retrieve taxpayer data raises concerns over potential misuse, particularly regarding politically motivated interference in federal payments. Senate Finance Committee Democrat Ron Wyden expressed alarm over the situation in a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, warning that unauthorized access could lead to disruptions in essential payment systems. Wyden stated that any politically driven tampering with these systems could have severe repercussions for the economy. The controversy has already led to significant fallout within the Treasury Department. Meanwhile, Acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his post after more than three decades of service, reportedly in response to D.O.G.E’s request for access to the department’s financial infrastructure. In a farewell letter to Treasury employees, Lebryk spoke about the critical role of the Fiscal Service in maintaining the stability of government operations and added that while much of its work goes unnoticed by the public, it remains crucial to the country’s functioning. D.O.G.E The D.O.G.E was established to reduce wasteful spending and eliminate unnecessary regulations, though its formal mission, as outlined in the executive order, is to modernize federal technology and software to improve government efficiency and productivity. Announced by Donald Trump in November 2024 for his second term, the organization was initially set to be co-led by Vivek Ramaswamy alongside Musk, but Ramaswamy left before the task force’s launch.

As utility-driven meme coins gain popularity, Panshibi is becoming a disruptive force with both fun and practical applications. As the best new meme coin investors are already monitoring it, and there are rumors that its value may increase. Dogecoin: The Pioneer Still Holding Strong Originally developed as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the original meme coin and is now a mainstay in the cryptocurrency space. A fervent community, social media buzz, and well-known endorsements from people like Elon Musk propelled it to stardom. DOGE continues to prosper despite criticism of its inflationary token concept, especially in tipping and payments. Even while Dogecoin news frequently emphasizes how widely adopted it is, it lacks the technological innovations found in more recent initiatives. Its long-term viability and capacity to compete with cutting-edge meme coins that provide more than simply branding are questions. Shiba Inu: The Evolution of Meme Coins By creating a whole ecosystem, Shiba Inu (SHIB) advanced the meme coin idea. In contrast to DOGE, SHIB brought staking opportunities, ShibaSwap, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution. Because of these developments, it has lasted beyond the hoopla and is regarded by many as one of the greatest new meme coin initiatives of the past few years. SHIB has demonstrated that meme coins can provide more than simply amusement, but Panshibi wants to further reshape the market by resolving important problems that have kept cryptocurrencies from becoming widely accepted. Panshibi: The Next-Generation Meme Coin with 100X Potential Panshibi is a revolution in the making, not simply another meme. By fusing panda crypto 100xpotential with practical applications, it seeks to close the gap between AI-driven innovation, Social-Fi, and meme culture. Due to its solid foundations, Panshibi is a desirable investment for both novice and seasoned traders, in contrast to DOGE and SHIB, which mostly rely on community hype. In order to solve this, Panshibi adds staking, governance, and exclusivity incentives for token owners, transforming them from speculative assets into something more. Early investors have a rare chance to purchase before the anticipated 1,200% price increase, as the presale stage aims to generate $10 million in 60 days. With a 10-year liquidity lock guaranteeing sustainability and confidence, the project's tokenomics are built for long-term stability. Panshibi is designed to last, with a meticulously planned ecosystem that promotes holding rather than short-term trading, in contrast to earlier meme coins that suffered from pump-and-dump scams. Panshibi is resolving a significant adoption issue in the cryptocurrency field in addition to its business approach. For popular consumers, many meme currencies fall short in offering genuine incentives. By combining community-driven incentives with blockchain technology, it guarantees that users will stay involved and profit from the coin's expansion. Why Panshibi Could Be the Best New Meme Coin of 2025 Investors should keep a close eye on Panshibi if they're searching for the best new meme coin. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have already established the path, but Panshibi elevates meme coins by providing useful benefits. The panda crypto 100x potential is supported by a strong plan and is not merely conjecture. Panshibi is well-positioned to draw in a sizable audience because of its innovative integrations, active community, and aspirations to list on significant exchanges. Panshibi is a strong challenger in a market where investors are searching for the next great thing. Is Panshibi the Next Big Meme Coin? The next stage of the evolution of meme coins is represented by Panshibi. Although Shiba Inu updates and Dogecoin news continue to garner media attention, neither project adequately tackles the practical obstacles impeding the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, Panshibidoes. It stands out as a serious contender in the market with its unique combination of AI, Social-Fi, and cutting-edge tokenomics. For investors looking for the next panda crypto 100x potential, this might be a great chance as the presale is already underway and anticipation for its launch is growing.

As meme coins with real-world uses gain traction, Panshibi is emerging as a game-changer by combining entertainment with practical utility. Recognized as the best new meme coin, investors are already keeping a close watch, with whispers of a potential surge in its value. Dogecoin: The Original Still Going Strong First launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) holds the title of the original meme coin and has become a staple in the crypto world. It gained fame thanks to a passionate community, social media buzz, and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Despite facing criticism for its inflationary token model, DOGE thrives, especially in tipping and payments. Dogecoin news often highlights its widespread use, yet it lacks the advanced technology found in newer projects. Questions about its long-term sustainability and ability to compete with modern meme coins that offer more than just clever branding persist. Shiba Inu: Revolutionizing the Meme Coin Concept Shiba Inu (SHIB) took the meme coin concept further by developing an entire ecosystem. Unlike DOGE, SHIB introduced staking features, ShibaSwap, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution. These innovations have allowed it to thrive beyond the initial hype, earning recognition as one of the greatest new meme coin projects in recent years. SHIB proved that meme coins can deliver more than just fun, while Panshibi aims to further revolutionize the market by addressing key issues that hinder widespread cryptocurrency adoption. Panshibi: A Cutting-Edge Meme Coin with 100X Potential Panshibi is more than just another meme coin; it's a revolution in progress. By blending panda crypto 100x potential with practical uses, it bridges the gap between AI-driven innovation, Social-Fi, and meme culture. With robust foundations, Panshibi is an attractive investment for both beginners and experienced traders, unlike DOGE and SHIB, which rely heavily on community hype. To address this, Panshibi offers staking, governance, and exclusive rewards for token holders, transforming them from speculative assets to something more substantial. Early investors have a unique chance to get in before the expected 1,200% price surge, as the presale aims to raise $10 million in 60 days. With a 10-year liquidity lock ensuring sustainability and trust, the project's tokenomics are designed for long-term growth. Panshibi is built to endure, with a carefully structured ecosystem that encourages holding rather than short-term trading, unlike earlier meme coins that fell victim to pump-and-dump schemes. Panshibi not only addresses a significant adoption challenge in the crypto space but also uses its business model to do so. Many meme coins lack real incentives for mainstream users. By merging community-driven incentives with blockchain technology, it ensures users remain engaged and benefit from the coin's growth. Could Panshibi Be the Top Meme Coin of 2025? Investors seeking the Panshibi opportunity should pay close attention to this coin. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way, Panshibi takes meme coins to the next level by offering practical advantages. The panda crypto 100x potential is backed by a solid strategy and is far more than speculation. Panshibi is poised to attract a large audience due to its innovative integrations, vibrant community, and plans to list on major exchanges. Panshibi stands as a strong contender in a market where investors are on the lookout for the next big thing. Is Panshibi the Next Significant Meme Coin? Panshibi represents the next phase in the evolution of meme coins. While updates on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin news continue to capture media attention, neither project adequately addresses the practical challenges hindering mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, Panshibi does. It distinguishes itself as a serious contender in the market with its innovative blend of AI, Social-Fi, and cutting-edge tokenomics. For investors eyeing the next panda crypto 100x potential, this presale offers a promising opportunity, and the excitement for its launch is mounting.

Despite its dominant market position, XRP faces a number of challenges that make a $32 target in this cycle ridiculous. Remittix , an up-and-coming player, is becoming well-known as the next big cryptocurrency due to its innovative approach to financial accessibility and usefulness. Could a rival to XRP outperform Ripple with a whopping 50,000% increase? Ripple Price Prediction: Why XRP Might Not Hit $32 This Cycle For years, Ripple price predictions have mostly been driven by speculation and hope. Despite being a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, XRP's potential for rapid expansion in the current cycle is constrained by several issues. Uncertainties brought about by regulatory obstacles, continuous legal disputes with the SEC, and its centralized structure discourage both institutional and individual investors. The price of XRP has not increased to the extent that some fans anticipate, even though it has seen substantial acceptance in cross-border payments. While the market is shifting its focus from financial speculation to useful cryptocurrencies, the wider macroeconomic environment is also putting pressure on riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, even though discussions about Ripple price prediction still dominate the cryptocurrency industry. Speculative assets like XRP are strongly opposed due to stricter monetary policy and concerns about global inflation. Although it has the technology and partnerships to sustain modest growth, a rise above $35 in the current cycle appears highly improbable. Remittix: Solving Real-World Problems with Crypto While it may seem improbable that Remittix might expand by 50,000%, such spikes have previously occurred for early-stage cryptocurrencies with strong real-world uses. Before becoming widely used and experiencing exponential value gains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, for instance, were very cheap at first. The demand for and value of Remittix may increase dramatically if it is widely adopted and forms strategic alliances. Think about a society in which more than 1.7 billion people lack access to conventional financial services, but many of them can still profit from cryptocurrencies. The unbanked, who frequently reside in underserved or rural areas, are unable to acquire credit, open bank accounts, or use contemporary financial technologies. However, these people might use cryptocurrencies to get around these financial obstacles with Remittix. Through Remittix, users can transfer digital assets straight to a wallet, where they can be withdrawn through Western Union, utilized for regular expenses, or exchanged for cash. People no longer need a bank account to access money and financial services thanks to this straightforward yet revolutionary technique. The anonymity and ownership of your money are what cryptocurrencies were initially intended to provide, and they can circumvent the conventional banking system while still keeping control over their assets. Investors are now concentrating on cryptocurrencies that have practical uses rather than just being speculative. Projects like Remittix , which tackle real financial issues, are becoming more and more popular in the market, even though Ripple price prediction models indicate XRP will have difficulty surpassing specific price thresholds. Fast, inexpensive cross-border transactions are in high demand, particularly in areas with prohibitively high remittance rates. This new coin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because it is capable of satisfying a critical demand in the modern global economy while preserving the fundamental principles of cryptography, which include total control over assets and privacy. As Ripple price prediction analyses indicate that practical use cases are driving investor interest, Remittix positions itself at the forefront of crypto adoption. Unlike traditional banks—often slow, centralized, and subject to restrictions. It ensures decentralization, financial sovereignty, and global accessibility. It’s more than just another digital asset; it’s a bridge between crypto and the real-world economy. Conclusion Regulatory and market factors make it extremely impossible that XRP will reach $32 this cycle, even while discussions about the Ripple price prediction continue. Meanwhile, Remittix is emerging as a real-world solution that is bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. It addresses major adoption issues by providing money to the unbanked and facilitating smooth international transactions.

Despite holding a strong position in the market, XRP encounters several obstacles that render a $32 target for this cycle unrealistic. Remittix , an emerging contender, is gaining traction as a major cryptocurrency player due to its innovative solutions for financial inclusion and practical use. Could this rival to XRP potentially outshine Ripple with an extraordinary 50,000% rise? Ripple Price Forecast: Reasons XRP Might Not Reach $32 This Cycle Over time, predictions about Ripple's price have largely been fueled by speculation and optimism. Even though it plays a substantial role in the crypto sphere, XRP's potential for significant growth this cycle is limited by a variety of problems. Regulatory hurdles, ongoing legal battles with the SEC, and its centralized framework deter both institutional and retail investors. Although XRP has achieved significant traction in cross-border payment systems, its price hasn't surged as much as some supporters hope. As the market shifts focus from speculative trading to cryptocurrencies with tangible benefits, the broader macroeconomic landscape is also weighing on riskier assets like crypto, even though discussions around Ripple's price forecast remain prevalent in the crypto community. Speculative investments such as XRP face strong opposition due to tighter monetary policies and worldwide inflation worries. Despite having the technology and partnerships to enable steady growth, surpassing $35 in this cycle seems highly unlikely. Remittix: Tackling Real-World Challenges with Cryptocurrency While the notion that Remittix might grow by 50,000% seems far-fetched, such dramatic increases have happened before with early-stage cryptocurrencies that offer robust real-world applications. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum were once very affordable before they gained widespread use and saw exponential value growth. If Remittix achieves broad acceptance and establishes key partnerships, its demand and value could soar. Consider a world where over 1.7 billion people lack access to traditional financial services, yet many can still benefit from cryptocurrencies. The unbanked, often living in underserved or remote regions, face challenges in obtaining credit, opening bank accounts, or utilizing modern financial tools. However, through Remittix, these individuals can overcome financial barriers. With Remittix, users can send digital assets directly to a wallet, where they can be withdrawn via Western Union, used for everyday expenses, or converted to cash. This simple yet groundbreaking approach allows people to access funds and financial services without needing a bank account. Cryptocurrencies were originally designed to ensure anonymity and ownership of money, enabling users to bypass the traditional banking system while maintaining control over their assets. Investors are now zeroing in on cryptocurrencies with real-world applications rather than those driven purely by speculation. Projects like Remittix , which address genuine financial challenges, are gaining increasing popularity in the market, even as Ripple's price forecast suggests that XRP may struggle to break certain price barriers. There is high demand for fast, low-cost cross-border transactions, especially in regions where remittance fees are prohibitively high. This new cryptocurrency differentiates itself by meeting a vital demand in today's global economy while maintaining core cryptographic principles such as full asset control and privacy. As Ripple's price forecasts highlight that practical applications are attracting investor interest, Remittix is positioning itself at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike traditional banks, which are often slow, centralized, and subject to regulation, Remittix promotes decentralization, financial independence, and global accessibility. It's more than just another digital currency; it's a bridge that connects the crypto world with the real-world economy. Conclusion Given the regulatory and market conditions, it's highly unlikely that XRP will reach $32 this cycle, even as conversations about the Ripple price forecast persist. In the meantime, Remittix is emerging as a practical solution that bridges the gap between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies. It addresses significant adoption challenges by providing financial access to the unbanked and making international transactions seamless.

Get the Latest Cardano Price Updates,https://thecoinrise.com/massive-interest-in-web3bay-as-presale-hits-1m-will-tron-maintain-its-uptrend-get-the-latest-cardano-price-updates/,"The cryptocurrency market is vibrant with projects aiming to excel in their fields. Tron (TRX) is attempting to maintain its momentum following a 145% increase in trading volume, though it struggles to reach the $1 level again. Cardano (ADA), however, is capturing attention with a sharp rise in activity and the upcoming Plomin mainnet hard fork, potentially heralding substantial gains. Web3Bay, however, is making a significant mark, not merely adapting to trends but transforming e-commerce. Having raised over $1 million and sold 285 million tokens at $0.004562 each, Web3Bay transcends a typical investment—it’s pioneering a new way of commerce. Unlike Tron and Cardano, Web3Bay addresses concrete issues like enhancing transparency, reducing fees, and improving data ownership via blockchain. Its expected 6,430% ROI and innovative features such as NFT integration and DAO governance make it an optimal choice for investors aiming to influence the future of commerce. Will Tron Maintain Its Rise and Overcome Major Resistance? Tron (TRX) has seen a remarkable increase in trading volume, up 145% to $1.26 billion in the last 24 hours. This spike in activity comes after a notable decrease earlier in the week, with TRX’s price dropping around 10% to a low of $0.8565. Currently, TRX is priced at $0.921, a 7.03% decrease from the previous day. Technical analysis suggests that TRX needs to break above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $0.985 to hit the $1 mark again. Steady trading volume and positive sentiment may help it achieve this goal. If TRX can hold above $1, it might aim for the $1.16 resistance level next. However, if it cannot maintain its support, prices could fall to $0.76. Explore Cardano’s Price Targets Cardano has experienced a significant boost in trading volume, increasing by 145% to $1.26 billion within the last 24 hours following a major market downturn, which saw prices drop by 10% to $0.8565. Currently, ADA is priced at $0.921 and is aiming for the $1 threshold. For the Cardano price to surpass $1, it needs to overcome the 50-day SMA at $0.985. Maintaining this momentum could see ADA reaching $1.16, with the potential to climb to $1.33. However, if it fails to hold at these levels, the price might decrease to $0.76. With its trading volumes on the rise and the Plomin mainnet hard fork scheduled for January 29, 2025, ADA is at a critical point. Investors should closely monitor Cardano’s movements as it seeks potential gains in a recovering market. Web3Bay’s Recent Hot News: Presale Crossed $1M! Envision a marketplace free from the grip of large corporations that impose hefty fees, collect extensive personal data, and outpace small businesses. Web3Bay steps in as the Amazon of Decentralized Shopping, revolutionizing the sector with blockchain technology.

Key highlight: Web3Bay’s presale has swiftly attracted significant interest, with over $1 million raised and more than 285 million tokens sold at just $0.004562 each.

The platform’s scope extends beyond mere shopping—it aims to redefine global commercial interactions. Wrapping Up While Tron and Cardano offer promising growth with robust trading volumes and technological enhancements, Web3Bay excels with unmatched innovation. Though Tron is aiming for a $1 value and Cardano’s price is poised to regain its peak, neither can rival Web3Bay’s potential to overhaul global commerce.

Concerns over strange trading patterns in Solana and TRON, two of the most well-known blockchain networks, have been raised by massive whale transactions. What if this isn't just another instance of institutional scheming, though? The latest changes, according to some experts, suggest that insiders may have learned of a revolutionary meme coin launch that might yield enormous profits. The new meme coin Panshibi ($SHIBI) has been in the news and is already garnering a lot of interest in its presale. This might be the next major chance for investors to profit because this cryptocurrency has the potential to increase by 10,000%. Shiba Inu Latest News Understanding Shiba Inu's (SHIB) legacy is crucial before delving into Panshibi. As a decentralized meme experiment, SHIB was introduced in 2020 and soon developed a cult-like following, dubbed the ""Dogecoin killer."" The coin experienced increases of almost 1,200,000% at its height, making early adopters instant billionaires. Shiba Inu's strong community and strategic advancements, such as its entry into DeFi, NFTs and the future layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, were key factors in the company's ascent. SHIB has had trouble sustaining the tremendous velocity it previously possessed in spite of these developments. Shiba Inu latest news reports that with meme coin interest surging in 2024, seeing a 500% market cap increase, investors are looking beyond SHIB and Dogecoin for the next big thing. And that’s where Panshibi enters the scene. Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Next Meme Coin to Explode? Panshibi isn’t just another meme coin launch, it’s a cultural phenomenon in the making. Merging three major forces; Asia, pandas and meme culture, Panshibi has created a perfect storm for viral adoption. With the integration of SocialFi and AI-powered features, Panshibi is becoming more than just a speculative asset, in contrast to earlier meme coins that just depended on hype. Holders of tokens can participate in competitive missions, get prizes and even vote on governance to affect the ecosystem's evolution. Holders who stake their $SHIBI tokens can earn annual yields up to 1,200%, far exceeding traditional DeFi opportunities. Also unlike many meme coins that fizzle out, Panshibi ensures long-term sustainability by locking liquidity for 10 years. Currently priced at $0.004, the token price is set to increase over 15 presale stages, culminating in a projected 145,000% post-launch surge. Security remains a top priority. Panshibi’s smart contract has been fully audited by blockchain security firm Coinsult and ownership will be renounced post-presale, ensuring full decentralization. With 60% of the total supply allocated to the presale, this is a rare opportunity to get in early before exchange listings drive up demand. Panshibi will debut on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap, offering global accessibility. Whales seem to be catching on and on-chain activity suggests large-scale transactions flowing into early-stage meme coins. If history has taught us anything, it’s that early adopters of viral tokens reap the biggest rewards. Is Now the Time to Act? Shina Inu latest news shows that meme coins have evolved far beyond their origins, they’re now a major force in crypto market growth. With Solana and TRON whales making significant moves and meme coin adoption at an all-time high, the opportunity for early investors is clear. Panshibi is positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin mania. Combining viral appeal, strong tokenomics and lucrative staking rewards, $SHIBI stands out in a crowded market. The presale is still open, but not for long. With each stage pushing prices higher, waiting could mean missing out on the biggest gains. If 10,000% returns sound appealing, this might be the moment to make a move.

Concerns have arisen over unusual trading patterns involving Solana and TRON, two of the most renowned blockchain networks, due to significant whale transactions. But what if this isn't just typical institutional maneuvering? Some analysts speculate that insiders might have caught wind of a groundbreaking meme coin launch with the potential for substantial gains. The buzz is all about the new meme coin Panshibi ($SHIBI), which is already attracting significant attention during its presale. This could be a golden opportunity for investors, as this cryptocurrency might soar by 10,000%. Latest Updates on Shiba Inu Before diving into Panshibi, it's important to understand the legacy of Shiba Inu (SHIB). Launched in 2020 as a decentralized meme experiment, SHIB quickly gained a cult following, earning the nickname ""Dogecoin killer."" At its peak, the coin surged by nearly 1,200,000%, turning early adopters into billionaires overnight. Shiba Inu's rise was driven by its passionate community and strategic moves, such as venturing into DeFi, NFTs, and the upcoming layer-2 blockchain Shibarium. Despite these efforts, SHIB has struggled to maintain its previous momentum. According to the latest news on Shiba Inu, with renewed interest in meme coins leading to a 500% market cap increase in 2024, investors are scouting beyond SHIB and Dogecoin for the next big sensation. This is where Panshibi comes into play. Panshibi ($SHIBI): Is This the Next Meme Coin to Skyrocket? Panshibi is not just another meme coin launch; it’s poised to become a cultural phenomenon. By combining three powerful elements: Asia, pandas, and meme culture, Panshibi has set the stage for viral success. Unlike previous meme coins relying solely on hype, Panshibi integrates SocialFi and AI-driven features, transforming it into more than just a speculative asset. Token holders can engage in competitive missions, earn rewards, and even participate in governance decisions to shape the ecosystem's future. Staking $SHIBI tokens allows holders to earn annual yields up to 1,200%, far surpassing typical DeFi opportunities. Moreover, unlike many meme coins that eventually lose steam, Panshibi guarantees long-term viability by locking liquidity for a decade. Currently available at $0.004, the token's price is projected to climb through 15 presale stages, culminating in an anticipated 145,000% surge post-launch. Security is of utmost importance. Panshibi’s smart contract has been thoroughly audited by the blockchain security firm Coinsult, and ownership will be relinquished post-presale, ensuring complete decentralization. With 60% of the total supply earmarked for the presale, this is a unique chance to invest early before exchange listings boost demand. Panshibi will be available on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap, ensuring global reach. It seems whales are catching on, as on-chain activity indicates substantial transactions moving into early-stage meme coins. If history is any guide, those who adopt viral tokens early stand to gain the most. Is It the Right Time to Invest?

The strategy entails “investing heavily into AI Agents, as the race for AI continues to gain traction among tech giants and startups in the sector. Other tech giants like Amazon, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI have also expressed their goals of also building agentic AI. Google released three products under the 2.0 suite Late last year, Google granted access to developers and some trusted testers while it also wrapped some features into its products. However, according to the company, this is a “general release.” Now, under this program, the suite of models includes 2.0 Flash, which is said to be a “workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale.” Also included in that suite is the 2.0 Pro Experimental for coding performance as well as the 2.0 Flash Lite, which Google dubs its “most cost-effective model yet.” “Today we’re making te updated Gemini 2.0 Flash generally available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Developers can now build production applications with 2.0 Flash,” Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO, Google DeepMind wrote in blog post. “We’re also releasing an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Pro, our best model yet for coding performance and complex prompts. It is available in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and in the Gemini app for Gemini Advanced users.” Kavukcuoglu. According to a CNBC article , the cost of Gemini Flash to developers is 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash Lite costs 0.75 of a cent for the same. Google consolidating its position on the market Google’s initiative is reportedly part of efforts to stay ahead in the industry as the race for AI supremacy is escalating to another level among the tech giants and startups. Peers, Amazon, Anthropic, Meta and OpenAI have also revealed their intentions to move into agentic AI, or models capable of handling complex tasks on behalf of users. As for Google, the tech giant has been busy for some time now to stay ahead of the competition. The company has over the past year been working towards more agentic models in line with obtaining trends. “Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Google wrote in a December blog post . Google added that Gemini 2.0 has “new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use.” Additionally, the family of models “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.” This comes as there has been intense competition with the Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic being a key contender in the race to build AI agents. In October last year, Anthropic indicated its AI agents could use computers the same way humans do to tackle tasks. According to Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan, the tool can “use computers basically the same way that we do.” Competitors OpenAI recently released a similar feature known as Operator to automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations, and ordering groceries. The ChatGPT make described this as “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.” Earlier in the week, OpenAI also unveiled Deep Research which allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports as well as analyze questions and topics as per user’s choice, while Google launched a similar tool with a similar name.

Known for his deep ties to crypto and Wall Street, Howard’s new job comes with a lot of moving pieces: the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act, and all regulatory power over tech infrastructure. His confirmation is a massive win for President Trump’s administration, which is pushing to bring crypto innovation back to the US and create a national Bitcoin reserve. Anti-crypto Elizabeth Warren demands answers over Lutnick’s Tether connections Senator Elizabeth Warren wasted no time tearing into Howard’s crypto ties. On January 28, she sent a letter demanding details about how much Cantor Fitzgerald has invested in Tether and whether the firm conducted proper due diligence before getting involved with the stablecoin issuer. She wanted to know if Cantor verified Tether’s compliance with US anti-money laundering laws, sanctions, and “know your customer” (KYC) rules. Warren framed this as a national security threat, telling Howard that: “Your deep entanglements with Tether raise significant questions about your personal judgment and whether you can serve without bias.” Cantor earned tens of millions from managing Tether’s reserves and even bought a minority stake in the company. Plus Howard didn’t list Tether or any other crypto holdings in the financial disclosure form he submitted to the Senate, even though the form detailed his assets worth over $806 million and involvement in 800 legal entities. Warren wanted an explanation for that omission too. Howard had promised to divest from Cantor when confirmed, but Warren and others aren’t buying it. Critics, including watchdog group Accountable.US, were calling for Howard to recuse himself from any crypto-related task forces once he officially takes office. It’s unclear to us if he ever actually did. Ted Cruz says it’s time to reverse Biden’s “lawless” tech policies Senator Ted Cruz, one of Howard’s biggest backers, couldn’t be happier about the confirmation. After the committee vote, Cruz told Broadband Breakfast that he expects Howard to shake up the BEAD program, which was originally designed to expand fiber-optic broadband access across the country. Cruz called the Biden administration’s preference for fiber “wasteful” and said it ignored cheaper, faster options like satellite internet and fixed wireless. “Let’s use satellites, let’s use fixed wireless, let’s use fiber—let’s do it the cheapest, most efficient way we can,” Howard said during his confirmation hearing. Cruz also brought up the CHIPS and Science Act, accusing the Biden administration of attaching “lawless conditions” to the funding. He cited the requirement for semiconductor companies to provide child care as an example, saying it was never part of the bipartisan deal Congress approved. Howard is expected to roll back many of these conditions and refocus the funding on core tech and semiconductor development. Not everyone is on board with Howard’s plans. Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, voted against his confirmation, saying Howard didn’t give strong enough assurances that BEAD and CHIPS funding would continue to flow as intended. “I was looking for a stronger commitment,” Cantwell said. “You didn’t provide it. My vote is ‘no.’” Does Lutnick have any crypto plans? At the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Howard called crypto “the future of financial sovereignty,” making it clear he’s fully on board. He’s also pushing for mandatory audits of stablecoins like Tether. During his confirmation hearing, he proposed that stablecoin issuers should back their tokens with US Treasuries and undergo third-party audits to ensure transparency. But given Tether’s long history of failing to provide a full audit since 2014, enforcing this policy won’t be easy, and we’re betting Howard knows that. The SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, will be working closely with Howard. Their goal is to develop a clear regulatory framework that defines the jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and the CFTC, regulates stablecoin issuers as financial institutions, and explores the “feasibility” of a national Bitcoin reserve.

Here’s What The Charts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-10-target-in-play/,"Dogecoin is still reeling in losses after a crazy 40% decline at the start of the week. Although it has since recovered a bit, Dogecoin is still on a 20% loss in a seven-day timeframe at the time of writing. However, technical analysis suggests that Dogecoin’s bull run might still be in play, and the meme coin could still reach the $10 price target this cycle. This analysis is based on the time taken for Dogecoin to reach new all-time highs and market peaks in the previous cycles. Dogecoin’s Historical Cycles and Price Peaks Dogecoin’s price movements have historically followed well-defined cycles, and multiple analysts have observed a consistent pattern across the cycles. Notably, Dogecoin is now in its third market cycle, and price dynamics in the current cycle have already shown different repetition signs from the two previous cycles. Related Reading: Can The Dogecoin Price Rally For 3 Months Straight? 2021 Bull Market Performance Says Yes According to crypto analyst ÐOGECAPITAL (@DimaPotts36), Dogecoin’s price history has a striking cycle pattern that repeats approximately every 1,442 days. This pattern of 1,442 days is the average time taken for the Dogecoin price to reach its final peak of each cycle when counting from the bear market low. The first cycle, which spanned between 2013 and 2018, saw DOGE rally by 21,821% from its cycle low to its peak. Back then, Dogecoin was trading for a minuscule price around $0.00009, but it eventually surged to break above $0.01 for the first time. At that time, Dogecoin was still regarded as little more than a joke coin, with only speculative trading from early investors driving its price action. The bear market low was recorded at $0.00125, but as the crypto market entered a euphoric bull phase in 2021, Dogecoin became one of the biggest winners of the meme coin craze, as it went on a 54,890% increase from its cycle low. The meme coin craze allowed Dogecoin to gain prominence among retail traders during this period, which eventually pushed its price to the current all-time high of $0.7316. With the third cycle now in motion, crypto analyst ÐOGECAPITAL noted that it might take the same 1,422 days for Dogecoin to reach a new peak. Timeline For New Dogecoin Price Peak Dogecoin’s current market cycle began immediately after its all-time high in 2021, after which the meme coin entered a prolonged bear market. The price low for this cycle was registered sometime in 2022 when Dogecoin corrected to as low as $0.055. Related Reading: Dogecoin Still In Play As Price Gears Up For Another 600% Run Above $2 A repeat of the 1442-day cycle means that Dogecoin will reach its market peak on April 14, 2025. In terms of a price target, the predicted target is around $10, which would translate to an 18,000% increase from the 2022 bear market low. Although this percentage gain is notably smaller than the 54,890% rally seen during Dogecoin’s 2021 cycle, the capital required to create such an increase is significantly higher due to the cryptocurrency’s market cap. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2669 and is up by 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

As of writing, the combined crypto market cap is down 1.56% to $3.16 trillion, proving that headwinds remain. Ethereum Open Interest Turns Bullish As the frontline altcoin, Ethereum’s price has decoupled from that of Bitcoin (BTC). As of writing, the coin was changing hands for $2,789.12, up by 2.21% in 24 hours. In contrast, BTC’s price is still down 1.36% to $96,634. Amid this decoupling, there is evidence of a growing positive sentiment from the Ethereum futures traders. Open Interest data from Coinglass shows this metric is up marginally by 1.33% in 24 hours. With this outlook, a total of 8.57 million ETH, valued at $23.94 billion, has been committed by futures traders. This open in Open Interest might signal the start of a solo ride for ETH price. Amid a positive shift in the future market, the potential for ETH price to reclaim $3000 remains optimal. Having dropped as low as $2,500 in earlier trading, this rebound confirms the proponent’s forecast for a sustained revival. XRP Bears In Spotlight, SUI and AVAX Drags Spot While Ethereum has managed to hold the forte, XRP has continued to nosedive as of writing. Trading for XRP $2,397 has shed more than 5% in 24 hours. For a coin named a candidate to displace ETH, the odds are currently not in its favor. The SUI and Avalanche rivalry has continued to deepen, with the former making moves to overtake the latter in ranking. Currently, both coins are down by 6.66% to 1.72% and changing hands for $3.349 and $25.98, respectively. With this price outlook, SUI is trailing behind AVAX with a $340 million margin, a valuation that is easy to flip. Thus far, in this bull run, SUI has hit multiple all-time highs, while Avalanche has not in over 3 years. On occasions, SUI hovers new ATH , a sign that if bearish conditions thin out, it may overtake AVAX soon. ETH and XRP to Lead Altcoin Rebound As the most capitalized altcoins in the market, Ethereum and XRP are likely positioned to lead the sector’s recovery. Moreover, XRP remains in the spotlight, considering it has more fundamentals that may trigger a positive market reaction when activated. The push for XRP ETF in the United States may fuel a long-term bullish run for the coin. With firms like CoinShars, 21Shares, and Grayscale pushing for the ETF tracking XRP , analysts are convinced the current drawdown is temporary.

Despite reporting a $670 million net loss for Q4, the company, led by CEO Phong Le, shared that they’ve acquired 447,470 bitcoins to date. Strategy said in the earnings report that the recent pause in new Bitcoin purchases has little to do with their commitment to the OG crypto. Le explained the company’s transformation during the earnings announcement, saying, “We are now Strategy—a name that speaks to our global mission. Bitcoin and AI are the two most transformative technologies of the 21st century, and we are leading that charge.” In Q4 alone, Strategy bought 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, setting a company record for quarterly acquisitions. On August 7, 2024, Strategy executed a 10-for-1 stock split for both Class A and Class B shares, which expanded the pool of potential investors by lowering the entry price. According to the earnings report, Strategy issued over 42.3 million shares of Class A stock between October and December 2024 for $15.1 billion, then 6.5 million more shares were sold between January 1 and February 2 for $2.4 billion. Even after these, Strategy still had $4.3 billion in Class A stock available for future offerings. CFO Andrew Kang said that Strategy’s capital plan is firing on all cylinders. “We’ve raised $20 billion out of our $42 billion target—well ahead of schedule,” he confirmed. The company also launched its first convertible preferred stock offering, backed by both institutional and retail investors. This raised $584 million early in 2025. But that’s not all. In November 2024, Strategy issued $3 billion in 0% Convertible Senior Notes, maturing in 2029. Investors agreed to a conversion price of $672.40 per share, locking in future stock at what they bet will be a bargain. After underwriting fees and commissions, Strategy pocketed $2.97 billion from the issuance. In January, the company introduced another financial tool: Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock. These 7.3 million shares, priced at $80 each, brought in $563.4 million after expenses. They carry an 8% annual dividend and a $100 liquidation preference. Clearly, Strategy knows how to work the capital markets. Strategy’s Bitcoin profits hit $10 billion Strategy’s BTC Yield—the rate of return on their Bitcoin holdings—hit 74.3% in 2024. For 2025, they’ve set a lower target of 15%, likely due to a move toward more measured growth, according to the earnings report. The company also reported a BTC Gain of 140,538 for 2024, with a $10 billion BTC $ Gain target lined up for this year. In line with their long-term mission, Strategy announced they would adopt fair value accounting for Bitcoin starting in 2025. This means quarterly financials will now reflect the real-time market value of their holdings. Bitcoin price fluctuations will directly affect reported earnings, both positively and negatively. The new accounting rule, ASU 2023-08, requires Strategy to apply a $12.745 billion increase to retained earnings as a cumulative adjustment. As of December 31, 2024, Strategy’s digital assets carried a book value of $23.9 billion, based on an average purchase price of $62,503 per bitcoin. But the market value stood at a whopping $41.8 billion, driven by Bitcoin’s $93,390 price at year-end. Convertible notes redemption and share increases Another important decision in Strategy’s restructuring is the redemption of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027. On January 24, Strategy reported that it issued a notice to redeem all $1.05 billion of these notes by February 24. Holders have until February 20 to convert their notes into Class A shares at a rate of 7.0234 shares per $1,000 of principal. That works out to a conversion price of $142.38 per share. If any noteholders choose to convert, Strategy says it will pay cash for fractional shares but issue stock for the bulk of the obligation. In anticipation, Strategy’s shareholders approved amendments to the company’s charter in January 2025. They increased the authorized number of Class A shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and preferred stock authorization also saw a massive jump, from 5 million to 1.005 billion shares, according to the earnings report.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 315,000 followers on the social media platform X that meme token Floki ( FLOKI ) is printing a bullish divergence signal on the daily chart. A bullish divergence is traditionally seen as a bullish reversal signal as it suggests that an asset is gaining momentum even if the price drops lower or moves sideways. Says Bluntz, “There is monster FLOKI bullish divergence printing here after it swept a MAJOR level, could print today or tomorrow. Love it or hate it, the meme meta is probably staging a comeback here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.000098. Looking at fellow memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Bluntz believes that the crypto asset has completed an ABC corrective wave against the US dollar and Bitcoin (DOGE/ BTC ). Bluntz mostly relies on the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a fresh five-wave rally after completing an ABC pullback. According to the analyst, Dogecoin could potentially pull off a 200% surge. “Memes largely out of favor here and getting dunked on big time but with the big dog DOGE looking like this, it may be time. HUGE ABC down on the [daily chart] on the USD and BTC pair. Potential 2-3x coming up.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.264. Bluntz also says he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. Traders use TOTAL3 to gauge the performance of the altcoin market. According to the analyst, TOTAL3 appears to have completed an ABC correction and is now poised to ignite rallies to a fresh all-time high of $1.3 trillion. “This bounce seemingly turning into a full-blown V reversal. TOTAL3 completely reclaimed the breakdown and looks like a… clean ABC. Very hard to not be bullish here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, TOTAL3 is trading at $889.814 billion.

Arctic Pablo Coin is the Next Big Opportunity for New Meme Coins with Exponential Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-pudgy-penguins-early-days-arctic-pablo-coin-is-the-next-big-opportunity-for-new-meme-coins-with-exponential-returns/,"In the world of cryptocurrency, timing is everything. The early adopters of Pudgy Penguins are now sitting on massive gains, while those who dismissed it in its infancy can only look back and wonder, What if? This scenario is all too common in crypto—what seems like a quirky, speculative project at launch often turns into a multimillion-dollar powerhouse. But every missed opportunity paves the way for another, and this time, the Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) presale is turning heads. For those searching for new meme coins with exponential returns, Arctic Pablo Coin presents a golden chance to get in early before it takes off. The Pudgy Penguins Phenomenon: From Underrated to Unstoppable Few could have predicted its meteoric rise when Pudgy Penguins first launched as an NFT project. Initially, the floor price of a Pudgy Penguin NFT was as low as 0.03 ETH in its early days—practically pocket change compared to today’s market. Those who saw the potential and bought in early have since witnessed astonishing returns, as the brand expanded beyond NFTs into merchandise, licensing deals, and a thriving Web3 ecosystem. Pudgy Penguins’ recent token launch, PENGU, cemented its dominance, listing at $0.10 and surging to a multi-billion-dollar market cap. Early believers turned a few hundred dollars into life-changing profits, while those who hesitated missed a golden window of opportunity. Now, history is on the verge of repeating itself—with Arctic Pablo Coin offering a second chance for investors seeking new meme coins with exponential returns. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Presale That’s Capturing Attention For those who regret missing Pudgy Penguins’ early days, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is a can’t-miss opportunity. APC is redefining meme coin presales with its location-based structure, where Arctic Pablo “travels” to different destinations, unlocking new phases instead of traditional pricing stages. The current presale price is $0.000054, with over $950,000 already raised. The project is currently in the Frostburg location, and the launch price is set at $0.008. Early investors have the potential to see a staggering 14,725.93 percent return on investment from the ninth stage to the launch price. These numbers alone put Arctic Pablo Coin among the hottest new meme coins for exponential returns , but the project goes even deeper than just promising numbers. Why Arctic Pablo Coin is More Than Just Hype Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme coin banking on a catchy theme—it comes with built-in incentives, rewards, and a deflationary model that can drive long-term value. High-Yield Staking and Rewards Meme coin projects often rely on hype, but Arctic Pablo Coin offers actual financial incentives for holders. Investors can stake their APC tokens during the meme coin presale and earn an impressive 66 percent APY, making it one of the most rewarding new meme coins for exponential returns. The project also features a referral incentive program where investors can spread the word and earn more APC. Community competitions offer another avenue to win APC or USD, further enhancing the project’s appeal. Deflationary Tokenomics – Weekly Token Burns Scarcity fuels value, and Arctic Pablo Coin has a powerful burn mechanism that ensures supply decreases over time. Unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation weekly during the presale. Any remaining tokens after the presale will also be burned. These burns are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain, ensuring transparency and long-term value growth. With a constantly reducing supply and growing demand, Arctic Pablo Coin aligns perfectly with the new meme coins for exponential returns narrative. How to Get in Before the Price Surges Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin is still at a low entry price, but with the presale progressing rapidly, each new location brings higher pricing tiers. Those who enter at Frostburg are in a prime position to capitalize before Arctic Pablo’s next destination brings another price jump. Looking at the numbers, the upside potential is undeniable. Entering at $0.000054 compared to the launch price of $0.008 presents an opportunity for massive returns. The combination of staking rewards and a deflationary token model ensures increased scarcity and demand, further adding to its investment appeal. For those who missed Pudgy Penguins’ early days, Arctic Pablo Coin is presenting a second chance at exponential meme coin gains—but only for those who act early. Final Thoughts: A New Meme Coin Presale with Unmatched Potential The crypto market has proven time and again that early movers reap the greatest rewards. Pudgy Penguins transformed from an underrated NFT project into a Web3 sensation, leaving those who hesitated in the dust. Now, Arctic Pablo Coin is writing its own success story, with an innovative presale, high staking rewards, and a deflationary structure that makes it one of the most promising new meme coins for exponential returns. Early investors have the chance to see over 14,725.93 percent ROI before launch. Token burns will increase scarcity, driving long-term value. The presale is still at Frostburg—but not for long. For those who missed the last big meme coin boom, Arctic Pablo Coin is the second chance many have been waiting for.

The announcement comes a month after the company gave gamers a look at the Switch 2 new hardware. Among the games revealed in the snippet included Peach and Mario Kart. Nintendo announced the time its Switch 2 Direct would go live worldwide on its platforms. The company revealed that the Switch successor’s Direct would go live on the 2nd of April. Nintendo confirms Switch 2 Direct presentation time and date Nintendo revealed on Wednesday the Nintendo Direct launch will take place on April 2 at 2 pm UK time and 6 am PST. The company is yet to announce further details on how long the event will take and which platforms it will air on. Gamers have presumed the live launch will air simultaneously on the company’s Twitch and Youtube channels. Nintendo commented that the upcoming showcase will offer a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2. Gamers revealed they anticipated the Nintendo Direct, which would provide a closer look at the system’s software, price point, and launch date. They also noted the company could reveal more about the Joy-Con’s rumored mouse functionality. Players identified a C-button on the Joy-Cons in last month’s trailer and anticipate more information about it in the upcoming Direct. Gamers also expect to know more about the games on Switch 2 after the Mario Kart title and Donkey Kong confirmation last month. In the official trailer, Nintendo revealed that Nintendo Switch 2 plays both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games. Nintendo also warned users that certain Switch games may not be supported or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. The gaming company added that more details would be shared on the Nintendo website at a later date. Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa commented that even as the company prepared to launch Switch 2, more original Switch games would be made. However, he insisted on the need for the importance of Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives. Furukawa confirmed that titles such as Pokemon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond would be available for Nintendo Switch in 2025. He added the company aimed to ensure a smooth transition between the two platforms before Switch’s successor launched. Nintendo also announced that Switch 2 would be available to play on April 11 to 13 in London and May 10 to 11 in Melbourne. The company also announced a worldwide, hands-on tour to allow the public to try the new console ahead of the launch. It added that the dates would run from early April, shortly after Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, to early June. Nintendo reveals timelines for Switch 2 hands-on experience Nintendo revealed that players could access the Nintendo Switch 2 experience website to get hands-on experience with the hardware once tickets go live. The company announced the tickets would be made available through a free-to-enter randomly selected draw. Nintendo encouraged gamers to enter the draw at any time during the registration period for a chance to attend. Registrations for the London event were open from January 17 to January 26 at 11:59 UK time. The company also issued limitations, including requiring all ticket holders to possess a Nintendo account and that groups have a Nintendo account linked to the same family group. It added that gamers can register on their own or as a group of six. Nintendo added that gamers must be at least 18 years old to participate in the draw, and if a sixteen-year-old wants to participate, a parent or guardian can create a Nintendo account for a child. After Nintendo’s timeline announcement, EA CEO Andrew Wilson discussed the company’s plans for Switch 2. The CEO named franchises the company expected to find on the new console. He noted that products such as EA Sports FC and Madden had found energy on Switch. He added that he anticipated the products would receive similar interest after the console launches. Wilson added that the console presented a new opportunity for the company, given the success titles such as The Sims and MySims: Cozy Bundle have experienced in the past.

These Bulls represent different investor personalities, adding a whole new level of engagement to the BTFD Coin movement.

Solana, a powerhouse in the blockchain arena, is attracting significant institutional attention. Analysts predict Solana could reach a staggering $600 this year, a testament to its groundbreaking advancements. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is poised to revolutionize e-commerce with its decentralized marketplace, having already secured over $1 million in its presale. This article explores the exciting growth trajectories of these two dynamic platforms and examines why they’re generating so much buzz. Solana’s $600 Target: A Realistic Possibility? Solana (SOL) is experiencing a surge in popularity within the crypto community, fueled by growing institutional interest and remarkable technological breakthroughs. Its cutting-edge features, including the Fire Dancer validator, which boasts an incredible 80,000 transactions per second (TPS), are redefining the boundaries of blockchain scalability and efficiency. This momentum has led to ambitious Solana price predictions, with analysts suggesting the token could reach $600 in 2025. Currently trading at $241.22 as of January 2025, Solana has demonstrated a 4.7% increase in value over the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization of $117.36 billion is supported by a thriving ecosystem of developers and strong institutional backing. Industry giants like VanEck and 21Shares are paving the way with their applications for Solana-based ETFs, further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain solution. Solana’s global Hacker Houses, among other events, underscore its increasing appeal among developers, creating a fertile environment for the development of decentralized applications (dApps). Web3Bay’s $1 Million+ Presale: A Sign of Things to Come? While Solana is pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology, Web3Bay is disrupting the e-commerce sector by integrating blockchain with decentralized governance. Its ongoing presale has already raised over $1 million, with 280 million tokens sold at $0.004562 each. Web3Bay is establishing itself as a true game-changer. The platform eliminates intermediaries, ensuring secure and transparent transactions within a community-driven ecosystem. Web3Bay’s roadmap includes an NFT marketplace, staking rewards, and Layer-2 rollups, guaranteeing scalability for its growing user base. For investors looking for diversified opportunities, Solana’s robust infrastructure and Web3Bay’s disruptive e-commerce platform offer compelling prospects. While Solana price predictions point towards a $600 milestone, Web3Bay offers significant potential for early investors, demonstrating how innovation continues to reshape the crypto landscape. Solana and Web3Bay: A Look Ahead As 2025 progresses, Solana and Web3Bay exemplify the transformative power of blockchain technology across various industries. Solana’s institutional appeal and technological achievements position it as a premier blockchain network, with analysts’ $600 price target highlighting its potential for long-term growth. Web3Bay’s successful presale, which raised over $1 million, and its vision for a decentralized e-commerce platform demonstrate its ability to disrupt traditional markets. With features like NFT integration and staking rewards, Web3Bay offers early investors a chance to be part of something big. For those seeking portfolio diversification, Solana represents a solid infrastructure investment, while Web3Bay offers high-growth potential within a massive, multi-trillion-dollar industry. Both projects embody the spirit of innovation, making them two of the most exciting ventures to watch in 2025 .

Raising $192.5 million with more than 18.3 billion BDAG coins distributed, early participants have seen a 2,380% increase in value. The next phase is crucial. BlockDAG (BDAG) is poised to debut on 10 significant exchanges, potentially sparking another price surge. Cryptocurrencies often experience significant value increases upon being listed on exchanges, as it opens up access to millions of new participants. With BDAG in its final presale phase, those who act now could find themselves well-placed for when the broader market takes notice. Listings improve visibility, enhance liquidity, and often lead to price increases—experiences from past successful presales support this pattern. The opportunity to buy BDAG at the current price is quickly diminishing. The Impressive Presale Success of BlockDAG Indicates Huge Growth Potential BlockDAG’s presale performance has been impressive, vastly surpassing initial projections. Starting at just $0.001, the demand drove prices up, reaching $0.0248, a gain of 2,380%. This rapid price increase demonstrates the strong position early buyers are in. The significant figures—$192.5 million raised from the sale of 18.3 billion coins—underscore the high confidence levels in BlockDAG’s potential. Unlike other presales that often falter, BlockDAG has consistently sold out its batches, reflecting robust demand. These gains set the stage even before BDAG hits the exchanges, with a major development on the horizon. How Exchange Listings Could Transform BDAG’s Market Dynamics The debut of BDAG on 10 major exchanges represents a pivotal shift. It will introduce BDAG to a broader base of participants, significantly enhancing its visibility and trading activity. This exposure is vital—it brings BDAG to potential buyers who missed the presale, thereby boosting its trading volume significantly. Historically, cryptos that start strong in presales see substantial price jumps on exchange debuts. These listings tend to attract a flood of new buyers, quickly surpassing the initial supply and driving up prices. Holders of BDAG from the presale have a distinct advantage—they can leverage the anticipated demand surge without competing in a frenzied market. The Buzz Around BDAG—What Drives the Frenzy? The excitement around crypto often spikes with new exchange listings. These announcements attract everyone from casual traders to influencers and automated trading systems, sparking a rush to purchase that can send prices soaring. Promotions by exchanges, like trading contests and reduced fees, add fuel to the fire, boosting demand even further. This heightened visibility, combined with easier access to the market, typically benefits those who joined early. The presale period is a crucial time to get BDAG at a steady price before market forces start to influence its value significantly. What’s Next for BDAG—Looking Beyond Exchange Listings Listings are just the beginning for BlockDAG, which aims to stand out through genuine technological advancements. Unlike fleeting trends powered by social media buzz, BlockDAG’s technology—based on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure—is designed for fast, scalable transactions, offering an alternative to older systems like those used by Bitcoin or Ethereum. A standout feature is the X1 Miner App , which lets users mine BDAG on their smartphones, growing the network even before it hits exchanges. These strong fundamentals suggest that BDAG is set up for more than just short-term success; it has the potential for sustained growth and utility as more users adopt it. Fasten Your Seatbelts—BDAG’s Big Leap BlockDAG’s crypto presale has already seen gains of 2,380%, but the journey is far from over. With 10 upcoming exchange listings, BDAG is set to reach millions more potential participants who missed the initial sale. Exposure at this scale can lead to a quick uptick in price as demand outstrips the limited presale supply. For now, BDAG can still be purchased at the presale rate, but this window is closing quickly. Once listed, the price will respond to real-time market dynamics. Cryptos that launch under the spotlight typically see rapid price movements. To avoid missing out, securing BDAG now might be wise as the market braces for its public trading debut and the excitement it brings.

39972875,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=691008,1738807231,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Ethereum Is Testing Key Support on the ETH/BTC Chart – A Parabolic Move Could Be Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-is-testing-key-support-on-the-eth-btc-chart-a-parabolic-move-could-be-next/,"Ethereum experienced one of the most chaotic trading days in its history last Monday, as it plunged over 30% in less than 24 hours amid escalating U.S. trade war fears. However, the market quickly rebounded after President Trump announced negotiations with Canada and Mexico, leading to a sharp recovery across crypto assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Looks Stronger Compared To Altcoins – Demand Remains Strong As Price Consolidates In A Range Despite this rebound, Ethereum remains significantly weaker than other altcoins, raising concerns about how long this underperformance will last. Investors are closely watching price action, as ETH continues to trade at historically low levels relative to Bitcoin and other altcoins. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Ethereum is holding onto a key horizontal support level on the ETHBTC chart. This suggests that ETH could be at a turning point, with a potential opportunity for recovery if bulls step in. However, failure to hold this level could indicate further downside ahead. With Ethereum lagging behind its peers, sentiment remains mixed, and market participants are waiting for a clear confirmation of trend direction. Will ETH finally start catching up, or is another leg down still on the table? The next few weeks will be crucial. Ethereum Faces Uncertainty After Record Liquidations Ethereum has struggled after one of the most brutal liquidation events in crypto history, with over $8 billion wiped out from the market between Sunday night and Monday. ETH was one of the hardest-hit assets, with price action looking weak and uncertain compared to Bitcoin. This has sparked concerns among analysts, who fear Ethereum’s underperformance could continue. However, top analyst Carl Runefelt remains optimistic. He shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Ethereum is holding a crucial horizontal support level on the ETHBTC chart around 0.028. Runefelt believes that if ETH bounces from this level, it could trigger a massive parabolic move, marking the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. Ethereum has lagged behind BTC since late 2021, failing to reclaim its dominance despite multiple market rallies. While Bitcoin continues to flirt with all-time highs, ETH remains far from its previous peak, and many traders are now questioning whether Ethereum can regain its strength. Related Reading: ‘Solana Breakdown Fails’ – Holding $205 Is Crucial To Trigger a Push Higher For now, Ethereum remains at a make-or-break level, with key support holding but pressure building. If ETH manages to surge from this zone, it could lead to a strong recovery and shift market sentiment. However, failure to hold support could mean further downside ahead. Can Bulls Reclaim Momentum? Ethereum is trading at $2,780 after testing two critical moving averages—the 200-day moving average at $2,482 and the 200-day exponential moving average at $2,288. These indicators have been key long-term support levels since July 2020, confirming that Ethereum’s macro trend remains intact despite recent volatility. For Ethereum to reverse the short-term bearish trend, bulls must reclaim the $2,800 mark and hold it as support. This level is a psychological and technical barrier that would signal renewed strength. A push above $3,000 is the next critical step, as breaking this resistance would shift sentiment from bearish to bullish and trigger a move into key supply zones. If Ethereum fails to reclaim these levels, the market could see another wave of selling pressure, pushing ETH back toward lower demand areas. However, historical trends suggest that when ETH holds above these moving averages, it often leads to strong rallies.

A breakout above $3,000 would set the stage for a push toward higher resistance levels, potentially leading to a major rally in the coming months.

Investors on the lookout for the best crypto under a penny often find themselves drawn to projects that are innovative and have high growth potential. Among them, Qubetics, Tezos, and Gala have emerged as top contenders, each offering something unique to crypto enthusiasts. In this article, we’ll dive deep into these three coins, exploring what makes them stand out and why they may be the best low-cost cryptos to watch in 2025. Qubetics , in particular, is making waves with its innovative decentralized VPN offering, perfect for businesses, professionals, and everyday users who value privacy and security. With the presale currently in its 20th stage, having raised over $11.9 million, Qubetics has garnered a lot of attention. Not only does the project promise to revolutionize digital finance, but it also integrates seamlessly with the 1inch Network, ensuring traders have optimized access to decentralized exchanges (DEXs). But how do Tezos and Gala compare? Both Tezos and Gala are well-known in the crypto space, with unique use cases and strong communities behind them. Yet, when you compare them to the rising star that is Qubetics, it’s clear that there’s a new player in town that addresses crucial needs, like enhanced privacy, security, and blockchain interoperability. Let’s break down each of these projects and explore what makes Qubetics stand out as a potential game-changer in the crypto space. Qubetics: A New Era in Decentralized Finance with a Decentralized VPN Qubetics is pushing the envelope in decentralized finance with its cutting-edge solution: the Decentralized VPN (dVPN). With the increasing importance of online privacy and security, Qubetics’ dVPN is designed to provide a secure, encrypted, and privacy-focused internet connection, which is perfect for businesses, professionals, and individuals who want to keep their data safe in a digital world filled with cyber threats. What sets Qubetics apart is that its dVPN operates on a decentralized network, ensuring that no central authority has control over users’ data. This approach empowers users to take control of their own online security, eliminating the need to trust third-party service providers. Unlike traditional VPN services that might store logs or share user data with advertisers, Qubetics offers a true privacy solution that protects users while they browse, work, or engage in online transactions. But it’s not just about privacy. Qubetics is also a powerful tool for anyone looking to optimize their cryptocurrency trading experience. Through its partnership with the 1inch Network, Qubetics offers unparalleled access to decentralized exchanges. The integration brings users the best rates, unmatched liquidity, and optimized pricing across hundreds of DEXs. Right now, Qubetics is in the midst of its 20th presale stage, having raised over $11.9 million with more than 461 million tokens sold to 18,400+ holders. The price of $TICS tokens is currently $0.0667, and analysts are predicting substantial ROI once the mainnet launches, with $TICS potentially reaching $15 per token. For anyone looking for the best crypto under a penny with high growth potential, Qubetics is undeniably a standout. Tezos: A Blockchain Built for Smart Contracts and Staking Tezos has long been known as a blockchain that is both highly scalable and secure. It focuses on offering a platform for smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and the ability for stakeholders to participate in the governance process. Unlike many other blockchains, Tezos has a unique self-amending protocol, meaning it can evolve over time without the need for hard forks. One of the biggest draws of Tezos is its staking model. Tezos operates on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, allowing token holders to stake their XTZ tokens and earn rewards. This makes Tezos an attractive option for those interested in generating passive income from their investments. Moreover, because Tezos doesn’t require extensive computational power for mining, it’s considered a more environmentally-friendly alternative to other blockchains like Bitcoin. Despite its impressive technology, Tezos still struggles to break into the mainstream adoption levels that other blockchains have achieved. However, for those in search of the best crypto under a penny that combines staking with the power of smart contracts, Tezos remains a solid choice. Its consistent growth, innovative features, and energy-efficient consensus model make it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. Gala: Bringing Blockchain to Gaming and Entertainment Gala is a blockchain project focused on revolutionizing the gaming and entertainment industry. Gala’s mission is to give players control over their in-game assets by creating a decentralized gaming ecosystem. Through its platform, players can own, buy, and sell assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), giving them true ownership of their virtual items. What makes Gala unique is its community-driven approach. The project places a strong emphasis on empowering players by giving them a say in the direction of the games being developed. Gala Games has also partnered with various developers to create fun, engaging, and rewarding games that leverage the power of blockchain technology. However, Gala’s focus is somewhat niche, primarily targeting the gaming and entertainment sector. While the gaming world is certainly a booming industry, Gala’s long-term success will depend on the mass adoption of blockchain-based games and NFTs. Despite these challenges, Gala remains a compelling option for anyone interested in the intersection of gaming and blockchain. What Is a Decentralized VPN? How Qubetics Is Paving the Way A Decentralized VPN (dVPN) is a cutting-edge technology designed to enhance online privacy by utilizing a decentralized network of nodes rather than relying on a centralized service provider. This ensures that users’ data is not stored or controlled by a single entity, making it far more secure and private than traditional VPN services. With a dVPN, you can browse the web, access content, and engage in transactions with complete privacy, making it the perfect solution for anyone concerned about data privacy and security. Qubetics is taking the lead with its dVPN solution. By integrating this feature with its overall platform, Qubetics is empowering businesses, professionals, and individuals to navigate the online world with full confidence in their security. Whether you’re trading crypto or working on confidential business projects, Qubetics provides the privacy and freedom that centralized VPN services just can’t offer. Conclusion: As you can see, Qubetics, Tezos, and Gala each bring something unique to the table, but when it comes to the best crypto under a penny, Qubetics stands out as the most innovative and forward-thinking option. With its decentralized VPN, seamless integration with 1inch for decentralized trading, and strong presale performance, Qubetics is shaping the future of digital finance and privacy. For anyone looking to dive into the world of low-cost cryptos with long-term potential, Qubetics is the project to watch. Its innovative technology, growing community, and commitment to solving real-world problems make it a clear contender for future success. Don’t miss out on this opportunity – get involved in the Qubetics presale today and be part of the future of blockchain and decentralized finance!

A Decentralized VPN (dVPN) is an innovative technology designed to offer superior online privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralized servers controlled by a single entity, a dVPN operates on a decentralized network of nodes. Can I make money from staking Tezos tokens? Yes, you can make money from staking Tezos tokens (XTZ). Tezos uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model, which allows users to “stake” their tokens and earn rewards for helping secure the network. Why is Qubetics considered the best crypto under a penny? Qubetics is considered one of the best cryptos under a penny because of its innovative approach to digital finance and online security.

33767162,[object Object],1738809036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Remains Bullish: Net Realized Profit/Loss Signals End Of Consolidation Phase Is Near,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-remains-bullish-net-realized-profit-loss-signals-end-of-consolidation-phase-is-near/,"Bitcoin is currently in consolidation mode, trading below its all-time high (ATH) of $109K, as volatility, uncertainty, and speculation dominate the market. The price has been ranging between ATH and the $90K level, creating fear and hesitation among investors who suspect that the bull cycle top may already be in. However, on-chain data suggests otherwise. Key metrics from CryptoQuant shared by Axel Adler reveal that the BTC market remains bullish, and the current consolidation phase is not necessarily a sign of weakness. According to Net Realized Profit/Loss [USD] 7DMA, Bitcoin’s consolidation could end when this metric approaches zero or turns negative. Historically, such shifts indicate that most profit-taking has been exhausted, paving the way for renewed upward momentum. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain support above key levels will determine whether it can break out into new highs or continue consolidating in this range. While some investors remain cautious, others see this as an opportunity to accumulate before the next leg up. As BTC holds below ATH, all eyes are on market signals to determine when the next move will unfold. Bitcoin Faces Continued Volatility – But Market Remains Bullish Bitcoin has been on a wild ride since the weekend, experiencing massive price swings that have kept traders on edge. The price plummeted to $91K, then surged above $100K, and now sits around $98K as uncertainty grips the market. Trade war fears have fueled much of this volatility, and analysts predict this trend will persist in the coming weeks. Despite the turbulence, on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin remains in a bullish phase. Key metrics and an analysis shared by Axel Adler on X reveal the current state of network profitability. Average realized profit currently stands at $911 million, while the net average realized profit, also known as Net Realized Profit/Loss, is at $653 million. Meanwhile, average realized losses total $258 million. The data indicates that BTC holders are still in profit, and long-term investors remain confident. Adler points out that the end of this consolidation phase can be expected when Net Realized Profit/Loss [USD] 7DMA approaches zero or turns negative. Historically, such shifts signal that most sellers have already exited, leaving behind mainly panic-driven selling, which is typical in the final stage of a correction before Bitcoin resumes its uptrend. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key demand levels will be crucial in determining its next move. If history repeats itself, this period of uncertainty could soon give way to a massive rally. Bitcoin Struggles for Direction Amid Volatility Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,500 after days of intense volatility and uncertainty. The market remains in a state of indecision as bulls struggle to push BTC above the critical $100K mark, while bears have failed to drive the price toward lower demand levels. The lack of clear direction has created a choppy trading environment, with investors closely watching key price levels to determine the next move. Holding above $98K is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum. If BTC stays above this level, it could build enough strength for a breakout above $100K, a move that would likely trigger a rally into new all-time highs. On the other hand, if BTC fails to hold $98K, it risks dropping into lower demand zones. A breakdown could take the price toward $95K, and if selling pressure intensifies, BTC might even test the $92K level.

However, investors are now looking beyond past trends for the next big opportunity. Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain-AI hybrid, is positioning itself as a potential game-changer. With $14 million raised in its presale at a token price of $0.005625, this project has captured the attention of analysts and whales alike, signaling that it could surpass previous market leaders in growth potential. Why Traditional Bull Runs No Longer Define the Market The crypto landscape has evolved dramatically. Early bull runs were driven by speculation, with assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing exponential growth as new technologies were introduced. However, recent trends show a shift in investor sentiment. Instead of chasing purely speculative assets, traders are now prioritizing projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications. Regulatory scrutiny, institutional adoption, and shifting market conditions have also changed how bull runs unfold. While past cycles were fueled by hype, the next wave of winners will likely be projects that solve tangible problems—making innovation-focused tokens like Lightchain AI prime candidates for explosive growth. Lightchain AI – New Standard for Growth Lightchain AI is redefining blockchain technology by integrating artificial intelligence to create scalable and developer-friendly applications. The platform’s ability to provide efficient and secure AI-powered blockchain solutions makes it a standout project in an increasingly competitive market. Unlike traditional cryptos that rely solely on transactional value, Lightchain AI is built for practical, high-performance use cases, ensuring long-term relevance. The success of its presale reflects strong investor confidence. Lightchain AI’s focus on AI-driven decentralized applications and its growing network of early adopters position it as a top contender for massive growth. As institutional interest in AI-powered blockchain projects rises, Lightchain AI is well-poised to capitalize on this momentum. Why Analysts Predict 10x Potential for Lightchain AI The next wave of high-performing cryptos will be those that offer both scalability and innovation—two core strengths of Lightchain AI . Analysts predict that as blockchain adoption expands across industries, projects that seamlessly integrate AI will experience unparalleled demand. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s long-term sustainability model ensures that its ecosystem remains attractive to developers, enterprises, and investors. Its ability to adapt and evolve with emerging AI advancements places it ahead of legacy blockchain projects that struggle with scalability and efficiency. This adaptability is a key factor driving speculation that Lightchain AI could outperform past bull run leaders in the coming years. Also the price prediction is 3$ to 6$ in the next six months and 10$ to 15$ in the next year. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|ZRX,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-06 03:00:00

Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1.5 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory.

Although these two bring most news, Remittix (RTX) is rapidly becoming a rival. RTX is positioned as a major rival in the fight for top crypto rankings with modern blockchain technology and a potent payment system. Can it, however, genuinely challenge Solana and BNB? Allow me to dissect it here. Solana’s Price Is Making a Strong Comeback Solana’s price has been causing waves and showing an amazing comeback. It dipped momentarily to $295 last week, then sank to $270, but it is currently rebounding really powerfully. Analyzers see a positive trend in this comeback that would indicate more gains. Driven by increasing investor optimism and Bitcoin’s climb above $109,000, Solana has jumped about 58% over the past seven days. Solana’s price seems reasonable. It started a positive trend by breaking through a crucial resistance level. Measuring price momentum and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is entering an overbought zone and indicates strong demand. Furthermore, the moving averages for 50 days and 20 days have crossed positively, usually suggesting more price rises. Nowadays, experts are looking at targets of $286 and $317; the $300 level is a significant benchmark. Still, there are certain hazards. The $244 support level is crucial; should Solana’s price fall below it, a more significant adjustment might follow. For now, though, the attitude is still positive and Solana is among the most promising candidates on the crypto scene. BNB Struggles But Could Be Ready for a Rebound While Solana’s price has been climbing, BNB has had more difficulties. BNB lost 2.6% over 24 hours, moving from $700 to $675. Some investors are also uneasy since trading volume dropped by 23.4%. Though there is a temporary drop, BNB is maintaining a constant at about $680; analysts think a rebound is likely. Tracking active trading, BNB’s open interest has slipped below $1 billion. Although this may appear alarming, some analysts believe it may prepare the ground for a price comeback. The main level to keep an eye on is $685; if BNB rises over it, prices can swiftly revert below $700. If it comes below $670, though, investor trust in the crypto market might wain. Forecasts for BNB show further excellent results forward. Strong foundations and growing demand, according to experts, might force BNB’s price to $809 by early 2025. Although brief declines are inevitable, BNB stays in top five among cryptocurrencies. Solana’s price has been more consistent meantime, drawing interest from investors. Should BNB exhibit a similar recovery pattern, it may rebuild strength and keep on its increasing trajectory. Why Remittix Could Overtake Solana and BNB Though Solana and BNB rule the headlines, Remittix (RTX) is quietly turning out to be one of the most interesting new cryptocurrencies. RTX is made to address practical financial issues unlike many other altcoins. To provide quick, cheap cross-border payments, it mixes blockchain technology with conventional banking. This makes it a serious rival to big financial sites like Stripe and Wise. RTX is a link between traditional banking and distributed finance since it supports over forty cryptocurrencies and thirty fiat currencies. Right now, it is at just $0.0539 per token in the presale phase. Already raised over $10.8 million, investors are flooding in. Given RTX’s enormous growth potential, many experts think it’s the greatest coin to purchase right now. RTX distinguishes itself for what? Its sealed liquidity pool, lack of hidden fees, and passing of a smart contract audit guarantee security and openness. Remittix is positioned to seize a sizable chunk of the $190 trillion worldwide payments sector. Following launch, crypto experts estimate a 4,500% price increase and a 50x multiplier during the presale. RTX is still under observation when compared to Solana’s price swings, hence it is the best coin to invest now before the price skyrockets. Remittix is a financial revolution not only another cryptocurrency. Its “PayFi” approach rivals businesses like Coinbase and Wise by combining blockchain innovation with conventional financing. RTX is quite flexible unlike many altcoins that struggle to find useful applications. Although Solana and BNB prices are still high, the emergence of Remittix indicates how changing the crypto industry is. Faster, less expensive, more safe payments are becoming more and more important, and Remittix is filling in just at the right moment.

According to a Reuters report , the VC mentioned that the current policy is restrictive despite cutting rates by 100 basis points in late 2024. The Federal Reserve wants to stay on hold for now and assess the “net effect” of Trump’s policies on immigration, taxes, deregulation, and tariffs before making any further moves. He said, “We can be patient and wait to see the net effect of any policy changes by the current administration.” Earlier, after the FOMC meeting on January 28th, the Fed decided to stick with the 4.25%-4.50% funds rate. In a press release following the meeting, the Fed stated, “The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.

The complaint, submitted to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), claims that Trump may have violated federal laws prohibiting the solicitation of gifts from the public. The TRUMP token, which is primarily owned (80%) by CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, has raised concerns due to its potential to facilitate untraceable foreign payments. Public Citizen argues that Trump’s involvement in the promotion of the meme token could constitute an unlawful gift solicitation, which is prohibited under 18 U.S.C. § 201 and federal regulations (5 C.F.R. § 2635). The complaint brought to attention a January 2024 tweet by Trump promoting the meme token, stating, “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! Get YOUR $TRUMP NOW.” Public Citizen’s legal team points out that although the president can accept gifts, he is prohibited from soliciting them for personal gain. They said that Trump’s tweet, and subsequent promotion through his Truth Social platform, crosses this line by requesting funds for a digital receipt that does not offer a tangible product. The token is reportedly not intended as an investment opportunity, yet experts have criticized it as lacking intrinsic value. “Accordingly, a person sending money for a Trump meme is not purchasing a tangible product. Instead, the person receives only a digital receipt (in a blockchain), which is similar to a donor sending a check and receiving digital confirmation that the check was received,” they wrote. The complaint also raises concerns about potential foreign influence, given the global nature of cryptocurrencies and the difficulty in tracking transactions. Public Citizen is calling for an investigation to ensure that Trump’s actions do not violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which restricts government officials from accepting gifts from foreign entities. The nonprofit urges the DOJ and OGE to assess whether Trump’s promotion of the TRUMP token constitutes an illegal solicitation and to take appropriate action if necessary.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 03:08:01

ETH is showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $2,880 resistance. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,650 zone. The price is trading below $2,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $2,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,880 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Gains Pace Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it dropped heavily below $2,500, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH tested the $2,120 zone and recently started a decent upward move. The price was able to surpass the $2,550 and $2,650 resistance levels. It even climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. There was also a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $2,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,840 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,880 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,920 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,120 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,840 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,700 level. The first major support sits near the $2,640 zone. A clear move below the $2,640 support might push the price toward the $2,550 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,500. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Two days later, WLFI bolstered its portfolio with an additional 10.81 million TRX, elevating the token to one of WLFI’s top five holdings, surpassing its USDT reserves. Source: https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/worldlibertyfi These strategic moves underscore the deeper collaboration between Justin Sun, founder of TRON, Global Advisor to HTX and Advisor to WBTC, and the Trump family. Sun’s expanding influence now bridges digital assets, politics, economics, and global markets, driven by his visionary strategies and executional prowess. A New Crypto Identity: Justin Sun as WLFI Advisor On November 26, 2024, Sun added another title to his repertoire: Advisor to WLFI. The Trump family hailed his appointment, stating, “Justin’s insights and experience will be instrumental as we continue to innovate and grow.” This followed Sun’s$30 million investment in WLFI, making him its largest investor. By January 19, 2025, his total commitment reached $75 million after an additional $45 million infusion. The Trump family’s growing TRX holdings signal their confidence in TRON DAO’s technological infrastructure and long-term market potential. This partnership exemplifies how crypto-industry leaders and political figures can collaborate to accelerate blockchain adoption, unlocking shared opportunities in the crypto market. Justin Sun’s Crypto Empire As the first cryptocurrency friendly U.S. president, Trump swiftly enacted policies easing digital asset regulations. On January 21, 2025, Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey revealed that Trump’s first 200 executive orders included multiple pro-crypto measures. The following day, Trump authorized the SEC to form a “Crypto Task Force,” led by Commissioner Hester Peirce (“Crypto Mom”), tasked with developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework. With a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Justin Sun’s strategic planning and innovation capabilities will be fully unleashed. As WLFI’s advisor, he will provide the Trump family with market expertise to shape a more robust crypto ecosystem, further solidifying his industry leadership. Mastering the “Trump Effect”: HTX’s Meme Coin Frenzy Donald Trump’s dual role as president and global influencer has birthed the “Trump Effect”—a phenomenon where his endorsements trigger market surges. HTX has adeptly harnessed this momentum. HTX was among the first major exchanges to list the official meme coins of Trump and his wife, Melania Trump ($TRUMP and $MELANIA), upon their launch. Its agility in capitalizing on these trends highlights its market acumen. The exchange amplified investor opportunities through promotional campaigns, including airdrops of TRUMP and WLFI tokens, further energizing the market. Beyond meme coins, HTX anticipated the “Trump Effect” in AI. On January 21, Trump unveiled Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure project partnering SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle. The announcement ignited rallies over the next three days in AI-focused tokens like ARC (+110%), PIPPIN (+121%), GRIFT (+90%), and SWARMS (+60%), all tradable on HTX. HTX has consistently identified high-potential AI assets. Sun’s January 17 tweet, “Trade new cryptos only on HTX!”, underscored this edge. Image sourced from the internet, as of January 22, 2025 The platform’s momentum attracted over 180,000 new users in a single day, a record underscoring its industry dominance. Backed by technical excellence, strategic agility, and brand strength, HTX continues to cement its status as a global blockchain leader. The Chosen One in the Crypto World Despite his monumental success, Sun remains relentlessly focused on advancing crypto adoption. Leveraging TRON DAO’s tech, HTX’s market prowess, and collaboration with the Trump family, he is poised to propel the crypto industry to new heights. “Believe in yourself, you will definitely achieve great results!” Sun tweeted ahead of Trump’s inauguration. While his “great results” remain undefined, Sun’s trajectory suggests a defining role in shaping the future of global finance.

He dropped this bombshell in the part 2 of his tryptic essay series The Genie , where he shredded the fantasy of a federal BTC stockpile as misguided and dangerous. “What can be bought can be sold,” Arthur said , adding that politicians would turn BTC into a political football, destabilizing its price for short-term gains. Arthur also went after Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), calling it an empty spectacle designed to distract voters. “Is D.O.G.E prepared to cut healthcare benefits for seniors and veterans, defense spending, and default on debt interest payments? Will any Republicans win re-election if you do that? All these expenses are growing faster than the economy. Good luck brah!” Arthur said . President Trump is the ‘Genie’ he is referring to by the way. Source: Arthur Hayes Bitcoin strategic reserve is a political weapon in the making The crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis was who first suggested the US government should buy one million Bitcoins to create a digital gold reserve. But Arthur says it wouldn’t benefit BTC or the US economy. He explained that BTC’s value wouldn’t keep rising simply because the government bought it. Once the buying spree ended, so would the bull run. “The price will spike,” Arthur said, “but then it’s over. The government stops buying, and the market collapses.” Arthur also warned that Bitcoin would be weaponized the second it entered government hands. He predicted that: “Fast-forward two to four years. By 2026, the Democrats could ride to victory on voter dissatisfaction that Trump failed to quell inflation, stop any of the forever wars, fix the food supply, drain the swamp, etc. What if they got a veto-proof majority in the House of Representatives? By 2028, what if a Democrat won the election … Gavin Newsom could rise like a phoenix, and little boys would be allowed to chop off their dicks again without parental consent. Huzzah!” If a new president needed funding for social programs, defense budgets, or infrastructure projects, they could liquidate the BTC stockpile. “Just a signature on a piece of paper,” Arthur said. “One million Bitcoins dumped on the market. Panic everywhere.” Arthur also questioned how seriously the US government would take its role as a BTC custodian. Would they run nodes? Sponsor core developers? Or would they treat BTC like a trophy asset and forget about it? “It’s a set-it-and-forget-it exercise,” he said. Politicians would brag about the rising price when it suited them, but the minute things got tough, they’d sell. Arthur then accused the Trump administration of using Bitcoin’s price surges to score political wins, then cashing out when things went south. “Don’t hate the playa, hate the game,” he wrote, pointing out how the BSR could become a campaign donation machine for politicians attending $10,000-a-plate galas. Frankenstein Crypto Bill: The Death of Decentralization Arthur then turned his attention to crypto regulation, tearing into what he called the “Frankenstein crypto bill.” In his view, the current regulatory path wasn’t designed to support builders of decentralized applications. Instead, it catered to major centralized players like Coinbase and BlackRock. “Who benefits from these laws?” Arthur asked. “The ones with the fattest wallets and the best lawyers.” “Is that what the broader crypto community actually desired from the genie? Was this all an exercise to make Brian Armstrong and Larry Fink wealthier? I’m not a hater; they are doing their jobs … maximizing shareholder value by creating a monopolistic structure that uniquely benefits their business. Maybe those readers who are shareholders of Coinbase and Blackrock want a Frankenstein crypto bill. But I believe this type of regulation does nothing to alter the status quo, and while it’s not directly negative to crypto, it ain’t positive either.” The developers building decentralized protocols don’t have the financial resources to lobby for favorable regulations, leaving them out in the cold. Meanwhile, centralized exchanges, brokers, and lenders can afford to hire corporate lawyers charging $2,000 an hour to navigate complex legal frameworks. Arthur’s alternative: Devalue Treasuries and let BTC shine Arthur didn’t just criticize, though, no he actually came strapped with an alternative. He proposed gradually devaluing US Treasuries and shifting to BTC as a global reserve asset. His plan revolved around the crypto-loving Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent progressively buying BTC at prices higher than the market rate. Arthur predicted this would push Bitcoin’s price toward $1.8 million, making it large enough to serve as a legitimate reserve. Under Arthur’s proposal, the US Treasury would issue 100-year zero-coupon bonds and use the profits from rising BTC prices to retire short-term debt. This would help reduce the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio and stabilize the financial system. “The market will front-run the Treasury,” Arthur said, “pushing Bitcoin prices higher and creating arbitrage opportunities for traders. ” The BitMEX founder said, “Holders of treasuries will not be disadvantaged because they know Bessent will use trading profits to purchase off-the-run treasury bonds. This is crucial because it keeps TradFi institutions that use treasuries as collateral and pricing mechanisms for loan solvency.” America’s mining advantage: Cheap energy and ASICs Arthur also pointed out America’s natural advantages in BTC mining. With vast untapped energy reserves in states like Alaska, the US could power mining farms without expensive energy transport. Cold climates would further reduce costs by naturally cooling mining rigs. “When it comes to the production of energy, America has two things going for it. The first is that vast deposits of untapped hydrocarbons are enclosed within the imaginary squiggly lines that humanity calls America. All that is needed is the capital and approvals to drill. The best part about drilling for energy that ultimately will power Bitcoin mining farms is that it doesn’t matter where the energy is located,” said Arthur. On top of that, the US is ramping up domestic semiconductor production, with Taiwan Semiconductor and other foundries building chip plants in Arizona. This would provide a steady supply of mining equipment, giving the US a strategic edge over other countries. “Combine cheap energy, cutting-edge ASICs, and pro-capitalist policies,” Arthur said, “and you have the recipe for dominance.” But there’s a catch. Arthur warned that America’s legal framework still treats BTC like a second-class asset. He called for legislation that protects public blockchains as free speech. “We need a bill that guarantees the right to participate in decentralized networks without government interference,” he said. Social media and stablecoins: The dollar’s digital lifeline Arthur proposed integrating US dollar-backed stablecoins into social media platforms like Facebook and X. He suggested using Tether (USDT) and Ethena’s synthetic USDe for digital transactions globally. This would make it nearly impossible for countries to de-dollarize without facing massive public backlash. If executed correctly, Arthur said, the US could embed the dollar into global commerce while gradually shifting reserves into Bitcoin. “Let the people use digital dollars,” he said, “but let the government hold Bitcoin as the ultimate reserve.” Arthur closed with a warning: “If you’re waiting for politicians to save crypto, you’re screwed.” He urged builders to fight for better regulations and real understanding of the tech behind crypto and to stop relying on political favors. His advice was: “There is hope, get off your ass if you are an American crypto hodler and let your elected representative know you will not stand for politics as usual. Send them an email, write them a letter, or visit their local office. If you think a BTC Strategic Reserve is necessary, raise fucking hell right now, don’t just like a comment on X.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-06 03:25:46

In an interview with CNBC, Alderoty expressed his satisfaction with the changes brought about by the new administration. He explained that the previous administration had essentially waged a “war” on crypto, pushing the industry out of the U.S. in favor of restrictive policies. However, since the inauguration, Alderoty praised the new administration for embracing cryptocurrency and clearing obstacles that had been stifling innovation. Ripple’s Onshore Hiring Surge Amid SEC Case Alderoty revealed that Ripple, which has been based in the U.S. for over 12 years, is benefiting from these shifts. He said that following the election, 75% of Ripple’s hiring efforts, which were previously offshore, are now being brought back onshore in the U.S. The company is eager to build and expand its operations domestically, with the belief that the U.S. can once again become the global leader in cryptocurrency technology. These changes come amid the ongoing SEC case, which has been dragging on for four years. The updates have left many wondering if the case might be coming to an end soon. Ripple’s Response to U.S. Crypto Reform When discussing U.S. crypto reform, Alderoty outlined three major forces shaping the landscape: President Trump’s executive order, changes in federal regulation, and legislative action from Congress. He stressed the importance of the executive order, which reaffirms the U.S.’s goal of becoming the “crypto capital of the world.” The order has sparked a series of positive regulatory developments, including the appointment of David Sachs as the “crypto czar,” who is leading a task force to review and update crypto regulations. Additionally, Alderoty praised the actions of the SEC’s acting chair, Mark Uyeda, who recently acknowledged the regulatory confusion of the past few years. Alderoty is optimistic that these changes will make it easier for banks to engage with crypto, further positioning the U.S. as a favorable environment for crypto innovation.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|ALTCOIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 03:26:47

The executive attributed BTC’s potential extraordinary price rise to two major factors. Factors Propelling BTC Price While 2024 was a landmark year for the world’s largest cryptocurrency – seeing it reach multiple all-time highs (ATH) and surpass $100,000 for the first time – 2025 has seen more moderate price action. Since January 1, BTC has climbed from around $94,000 to $98,486 as of February 5.

He forecasts BTC reaching $200,000 by the end of 2025, $300,000 by the end of 2026, $400,000 by the end of 2027, and ultimately $500,000 by the end of 2028. Kendrick attributes this ambitious price trajectory to two key factors: improved investor access and decreasing volatility. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 significantly simplified investor access to BTC. Additionally, as Bitcoin’s price and market capitalization grow, its volatility has been decreasing. A larger market cap makes it more difficult for any single trader or entity to manipulate BTC’s price. Kendrick expects this trend to continue as ETF markets mature and supporting financial infrastructure within the crypto market strengthens. Kendrick added: The ETFs have attracted a net $39 billion of inflows so far, supporting the theory of pent-up demand being unleashed by increased access. Donald Trump’s January 23 order that the administration evaluate a potential national digital assets stockpile is also important, as this could encourage other central banks to consider Bitcoin investments. If Trump’s administration moves forward with establishing a national digital assets reserve, Bitcoin’s volatility could decline even further. This could attract traditionally risk-averse investors who were previously hesitant due to BTC’s price swings. Bitcoin Price Forecasts Have Bullish Undertones Over the past few days, BTC has faced increased volatility, briefly plummeting to $91,000 amid concerns over US trade tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. However, analysts remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Withstands DeepSeek Dip And FOMC Volatility – How Close Is A New ATH? For instance, seasoned crypto trader Alex Becker recently stated that a $150,000 price target for BTC is too conservative. Likewise, a report by CryptoQuant predicts BTC could reach anywhere between $145,000 and $249,000 under a Trump administration. On-chain data also suggests that Bitcoin ‘whales’ – investors controlling crypto wallets with large BTC holdings – are positioning themselves for a bullish price trajectory, signaling confidence in BTC’s long-term growth under the Trump regime. At press time, BTC trades at $98,486, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

Therefore, the Consumer advocacy group is calling for a federal investigation into the matter. Per a letter sent to John Keller, Chief of the US Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section, and David Huitema, Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), Public Citizen accused Trump of violating legal restrictions on soliciting gifts while serving as president. The organization urged officials to probe into the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin and whether foreign state actors may be involved in purchasing the token. Trump’s meme coin promotion raises legal questions over gift solicitation A 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service explains that while the President is exempt from many restrictions on receiving gifts, he cannot solicit or coerce gifts from sources nor accept gifts in return for official acts. The report clarifies that the President may accept gifts from the general public, even from prohibited sources, as long as these conditions are not violated. Just days before taking the oath of office on January 20, Trump announced to his more than 8 million followers on TruthSocial that he was releasing his own crypto meme coin. The token, called Trump, featured an image of him captured shortly after a failed assassination attempt last year: In it, he’s raising his right fist and looking defiant. Shortly after that, his wife, Melania, released her own token. Public Citizen has alleged that Trump violated federal laws by continuing to use his social media platform, Truth Social, to encourage his followers to purchase the meme coin after assuming the presidency: “It appears Trump is not soliciting money in exchange for an investment or tangible product but soliciting money in exchange for nothing — that is, asking for a gift that will benefit him personally.” – Public Citizen Legal and ethical uncertainty looms over Trump’s meme coin investigation Pam Bondi currently leads the Justice Department, having been appointed as U.S. Attorney General by former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, former President Joe Biden nominated David Huitema to head the Office of Government Ethics. The investigation into the meme coin is still ongoing, and there is no known outcome after a 2024 US Supreme Court decision that gives the president almost immunity from prosecution of official acts. This ruling implies that if the Justice Department concludes that Trump has violated the law, he can do the same again without fear of prosecution. But then, if the meme coin promotion is ruled to have been an unofficial act during his time in office, there could be legal consequences. Bartlett Naylor, Public Citizen’s Financial Policy Advocate, said the meme website has no link to any government office. He also noted that the organization is looking at possible legal ways of suing since there is almost no hope that the Department of Justice or the Office of Government Ethics will act independently. Public Citizen called for measures such as halting the meme sale and refunding all individuals who purchased the TRUMP coin. Following its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP’s market capitalization surged past $15 billion within 48 hours but has since dropped to approximately $3.7 billion at the time of publication. Several US lawmakers and industry insiders have raised concerns that the US president could still orchestrate a rug pull, as the token’s team retains control over 80% of the total supply.
