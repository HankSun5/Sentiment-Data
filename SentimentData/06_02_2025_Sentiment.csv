MicroStrategy Founder Causes Speculation Amid Bitcoin Holdings Pause Saylor posted on X on February 5 , calling it a “Big strategy day.” The social media post prompted mass speculation from members of the cryptocurrency community, receiving over 3,900 reposts and 30,000 likes. “Rebrand from MicroStrategy to MacroStrategy?” one X user inquired . “What are you up to?” another replied . ₿ig Strategy Day — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 5, 2025 On Monday, the Virginia-based company announced that it had paused Bitcoin purchases under its at-the-market equity offering program, though it did not sell any of its class A common stock. A February 3 SEC filing revealed that MicroStrategy, led by CEO Phong Le, holds 471,107 BTC, acquired for $30.4 billion at an average price of $64,511 per coin. MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, spending over $20 billion to build its reserves. Last month, MicroStrategy shareholders approved two amendments related to Class A common stock and preferred stock options, potentially impacting the company’s capital structure. In October 2023, MicroStrategy introduced its “21/21 plan,” targeting $42 billion in equity and fixed-income securities to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions through 2027. Michael Saylor Signals Interest in Shaping Crypto Regulations Saylor, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, acknowledged the impact of President Donald Trump’s election on the cryptocurrency’s value after its sharp post-election rally. Trump has pledged to reduce federal enforcement actions against the digital asset sector, a stance Saylor has publicly supported. However, Trump’s recent tariff policies have introduced uncertainty in crypto markets, contributing to fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price after its postelection rally. While Saylor has not revealed specific details about his strategy, he stated in an interview with Bloomberg that he would be open to advising Trump on digital asset policies.

Analysts believe XRP and Remittix could usurp Ethereum and Solana as the best cryptos to buy now that the bull market has nearly begun. While XRP is an older-established coin with a high value in terms of market cap, Remittix is currently in presale. Nevertheless, it is a runner, and its price is forecasted to go up proportionately to PayFi’s development. It is also one of the best coins to buy at current times. While Remittix is still on presale and will launch on major exchanges over the next few weeks, XRP is a top ten cryptocurrency by market cap, currently trading at less than three dollars. XRP to Overtake Ethereum and Solana: Analysts The initial verdict from crypto analysts and spectators was that Ethereum and Solana would dominate this cycle. However, that sentiment has changed. Analysts now believe XRP and the new crypto, Remittix, will be the biggest drivers for the next crypto rally. If they are right, both altcoins could go on a massive price surge once the bull run begins. Venture capital companies such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck are currently in contention for an XRP ETF. If their proposals are approved, it could cause the XRP price to surge in the market. That’s why even though the XRP price is currently dipping in the market and has fallen below three dollars, analysts believe it will be the primary driver of this cycle alongside Remittix. The prominent Ripple price prediction is ten dollars by the end of the cycle. Remittix To Surge 100x After Launch: Analysts Crypto analysts speculate that Remittix could surge 100x after it launches on major exchanges. Remiitix, which is still on presale has impressed the crypto community over the past few weeks and has emerged as one of the best crypto to buy now. Remittix has already raised over $10.6 million in its presale and is on course to hit its $36 million target in the next few weeks. After that, the token will likely launch on popular crypto exchanges like Uniswap. Remittix could potentially become a category leader in the PayFi sector and the broader payments sector, which is valued at over a quadrillion dollars. It is poised to gain relevance due to its features, which combine centralized and decentralized payment methods to solve issues in the payments sector, such as speed, costs, and accessibility. Since RTX powers the Remittix ecosystem, its price could surge quickly once it gets listed due to the growing demand for crypto payment solutions, and that’s why many experts consider it the best crypto to buy now. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana were the biggest drivers of the last crypto rally. While many thought they would also drive this rally, analysts have speculated that it will be XRP and Remittix. The XRP price is in free fall but can begin to climb when an XRP ETF is approved by the SEC. On the other hand, Remittix has amazed everyone in its presale, and analysts have rated it the best crypto to buy now. Join the presale and community now!

Instead, they now anticipate that XRP and Remittix will take center stage. Analysts are betting on XRP and Remittix to potentially replace Ethereum and Solana as the top picks as the bull market is about to kick off. While XRP is a well-established cryptocurrency with a significant market cap, Remittix is still in its presale phase. Despite being new, it is gaining momentum, and its value is expected to rise alongside PayFi’s growth, making it an attractive investment right now. Although Remittix remains in presale and is set to debut on major exchanges in the coming weeks, XRP stands as a top-ten cryptocurrency by market cap, with its trading price under three dollars. Analysts Predict XRP Will Surpass Ethereum and Solana Initially, the consensus among crypto analysts and enthusiasts was that Ethereum and Solana would lead this cycle. However, opinions have shifted. Experts now assert that XRP, along with the new player Remittix, will be pivotal in driving the next wave of crypto growth. If correct, these altcoins could experience significant price increases once the bull market is in full swing. Venture capital firms like Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck are competing to launch an XRP ETF. If their initiatives get the green light, it might trigger a substantial uptick in the XRP price. Thus, even though the XRP price is currently seeing a downturn and has dropped below three dollars, analysts are confident it will be a major force in this cycle, alongside Remittix. The leading prediction for Ripple’s price is a rise to ten dollars by the cycle’s end. Analysts Predict Remittix to Skyrocket 100x Post-Launch Crypto analysts are forecasting that Remittix could increase by 100x once it starts trading on major exchanges. Remittix, which is still in its presale stage, has captured the attention of the crypto community and is considered one of the best crypto investments at present. Remittix has already garnered over $10.6 million during its presale and is on track to meet its $36 million goal in the coming weeks, paving the way for its launch on major platforms like Uniswap. Remittix is poised to become a leader in the PayFi industry and the larger payments sector, which is valued at over a quadrillion dollars. Its innovative features, which integrate centralized and decentralized payment methods, aim to address key challenges in the payments sector such as speed, cost, and accessibility. With RTX at the heart of the Remittix system, its price is likely to climb rapidly once listed, driven by the increasing demand for crypto payment solutions, making it a top recommendation among experts for investment now. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana were the main catalysts of the previous crypto surge. Though initially expected to lead again, analysts now suggest that XRP and Remittix will take the spotlight this time. Although the XRP price is currently experiencing a decline, it could begin to rise if an XRP ETF gains SEC approval. Meanwhile, Remittix has impressed during its presale, earning it the distinction of the best crypto to invest in now. Join the presale and community now!

Pham said the agency will gather experts for a roundtable meeting , probably next month, that can build a case for how the commission ought to approach regulation and oversight of firms that offer betting on event contracts. She noted that despite her continued objections in recent years to former Chairman Rostin Behnam's enforcement stance against prediction markets — including wagers made on sporting events and U.S. political outcomes — the agency moved too far on its path to easily reverse it. ""Unfortunately, the undue delay and anti-innovation policies of the past several years have severely restricted the CFTC’s ability to pivot to common-sense regulation of prediction markets,” Pham said. ""The current commission interpretations regarding event contracts are a sinkhole of legal uncertainty and an inappropriate constraint on the new administration."" Setting up the roundtable is a ""necessary first step in order to establish a holistic regulatory framework that will both foster thriving prediction markets and protect retail customers from binary options fraud such as deceptive and abusive marketing and sales practices,"" Pham said. The CFTC lost an initial court case against Kalshi when a U.S. federal judge ruled late last year that the agency couldn't stop the firm from listing election contracts. However, the agency pursued an appeal with a higher court, and Kalshi argued in that new legal dispute that only Congress can halt election betting . Read More: CFTC Fines Crypto Betting Service Polymarket $1.4M for Unregistered Swaps The CFTC had taken a position through rules, orders and enforcement work that such political betting isn't permitted under derivatives laws and that the agency doesn't have the ability to police manipulation of those markets — basically arguing that it would have to be an elections cop. With only days remaining in his chairmanship, Behnam's agency was seeking information about Polymarket's customers from crypto exchange Coinbase. In language that's a sharp contrast from Behnam's resistance, Pham called prediction markets ""an important new frontier in harnessing the power of markets to assess sentiment to determine probabilities that can bring truth to the Information Age."" She added the agency needs to ""break with its past hostility.""

So far, the president has only picked a head for its cousin regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

From the likes of Bonk to DogWifHat, these tokens have not only entertained but also enriched their investors. Today, we're diving deep into the memecoin market to explore which could be the next big memecoin to offer astronomical returns. Among the contenders, Panshibi stands out, promising to merge the charm of pandas with the power of community-driven crypto. DogWifHat: The memecoin That Keeps on Giving DogWifHat, or WIF, has been a fan favorite since its inception. It is known for its Shiba Inu wearing a pink knitted hat and consistent community support. In 2024, Ansem, a huge whale on X(formerly Twitter) tweeted about DogWifHat multiple times. However, 2025 has started with low volatility for DogWifHat. This token has simply continued its down trend which started as far back as November. This downturn is a sign for DogWifHat investors to diversify, perhaps towards newer and better options like Panshibi. Although DogWifHat has an established base and a potential for community-driven events, a significant price change will not happen in a long time due to the current market turbulence. Bonk: The Underdog with Potential Bonk, known as the first dog-themed memecoin on the Solana blockchain, initially made waves with its community-focused airdrops. However, recent analyses suggest a dip in whale activity and a lack of significant utility features, which might be pushing Bonk investors towards new horizons like Panshibi. Although Bonk has launched various community activities like BonkDragon, the effect of this is yet to be seen as its price is currently on a downtrend. Despite this, Bonk remains a popular choice among memecoin enthusiasts. Since its market behavior indicates a potential for either recovery or further decline, experts are saying Bonk is a memecoin to watch from the sidelines. The Next Big Memecoin: Where to Place Your Bets? The memecoin market is notoriously unpredictable, but certain attributes stand out when looking for the next big memecoin. Panshibi, with its strategic community engagement, secure tokenomics, and a clear growth path, might just be that rocket ship. Its integration of AI and social-fi not only adds layers of utility but also keeps the community engaged. While Bonk and DogWifHat have their merits, Panshibi's innovative approach and community-centric model make it a strong contender for the next 20,000% memecoin. With the value of the memecoin market skyrocketing $115 billion in January 2025, there is a robust investor interest in memecoins and what they have to offer.. The Rise of Panshibi: A memecoin with a Mission Panshibi is inspired by the beloved panda as it aims to unite three massive communities under one project. These communities include Asia, pandas, and memecoin enthusiasts. Panshibiintroduces a blend of social-fi and AI elements, where token holders can engage in quests and earn rewards and prizes. With its native token, $SHIBI, Panshibi offers governance rights which allows buyers to determine their future. Also, staking opportunities are available with up to 1,200% APY, and exclusive access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. The whitepaper of Panshibi outlines a clear roadmap, emphasizing security with a 10-year liquidity lock and a 2-year team token lock. Although the presale is capped at $10 million, there is still enough time for you to buy in before it runs out. The price of one SHIBI is now $0.004 as the token is in Stage 3 of the presale . Also, there is a structure in place to increase the token price by 1,200% during this period. With predictions of a 145,000% surge post-launch, this coin is set to change the market forever. The smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, ensuring transparency and trust. After the presale, the ownership of the token will be renounced, handing the reins over to the community. With its current presale price at $0.004 (Stage 3), and plans for listing on Uniswap and major CEXs, Panshibi is shaping up to be the memecoin to watch in 2025. Conclusion As we navigate through the memecoin landscape, Panshibi emerges as a serious contender for significant growth. With its strategic presale, community engagement, and secure tokenomics, it's positioned to possibly outshine established names like Bonk and DogWifHat. While the future of memecoins is always speculative, Panshibi's blend of fun, community, and financial strategy makes it a memecoin to watch and emphasizes its potential to lead the next big memecoin boom in 2025.

This makes it a top choice for DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, and NFT marketplaces that require fast, cheap transactions. With its low-cost transactions and growing institutional adoption, Polygon remains one of the top cryptos to buy this month for those looking for a strong Ethereum-based investment. Celestia (TIA): The Future of Modular Blockchain Networks Celestia (TIA) is currently trading at $0.1602 and is one of the most exciting projects in modular blockchain technology.

With the rising demand for modular blockchain frameworks, Celestia is positioned to be a leader in on-chain scalability. It’s a must-watch for anyone looking at long-term investments in blockchain infrastructure.

From Bonk to DogWifHat, these tokens have both amused and financially benefited their investors. Today, we delve into the memecoin market to pinpoint which one might be the next major memecoin poised for extraordinary gains. Among the promising candidates, Panshibi stands out by blending the appeal of pandas with the strength of a community-focused cryptocurrency. DogWifHat: The Memecoin That Continues to Deliver DogWifHat, often abbreviated as WIF, has been a popular choice since it was first introduced. Famous for its Shiba Inu mascot sporting a pink hat, it enjoys unwavering community support. In 2024, Ansem, a notable whale on X (formerly Twitter), frequently tweeted about DogWifHat. However, as 2025 begins, the token faces low volatility. This ongoing decline, which started back in November, signals investors to consider diversifying into other options like Panshibi. Despite having a loyal following and potential for community-led events, significant price shifts for DogWifHat might not be forthcoming due to the current market conditions. Bonk: A Dark Horse with Promise Bonk, recognized as the first dog-inspired memecoin on the Solana network, initially gained attention with its community-centric airdrops. However, recent evaluations point to a decrease in whale involvement and a lack of substantial utility features, potentially steering Bonk investors toward new opportunities like Panshibi. Though it has initiated community projects like BonkDragon, their impact is yet to be felt as its value continues to decline. Nonetheless, Bonk remains a beloved option for memecoin fans. Given the current market trends, which suggest either a potential rebound or further drop, experts recommend observing Bonk closely. Finding the Next Big Memecoin: Where Should You Invest? The memecoin market is famously volatile, yet some features are key when identifying the next big memecoin. Panshibi, with its focused community interaction, solid tokenomics, and a well-defined growth strategy, could be that next explosive opportunity. Its integration of AI and social-fi not only adds utility layers but also keeps the community actively involved. While Bonk and DogWifHat have their strengths, Panshibi's innovative tactics and community-focused approach make it a strong candidate for being the next 20,000% memecoin. With the memecoin market value soaring to $115 billion by January 2025, there is a growing investor interest in what memecoins can deliver. The Emergence of Panshibi: A Memecoin on a Mission Panshibi is inspired by the iconic panda, aiming to bring together three large communities: Asia, panda lovers, and memecoin enthusiasts. It combines social-fi with AI features, allowing token holders to participate in quests and earn prizes. Holding the $SHIBI token in Panshibi grants governance rights, empowering investors to shape its future. It also offers staking opportunities with up to 1,200% APY and access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. The whitepaper details a secure path with a 10-year liquidity lock and a 2-year team token lock. The presale is capped at $10 million, but there is still time to invest before it closes. Currently, one SHIBI is priced at $0.004 as the token is in Stage 3 of the presale . The price is set to rise by 1,200% during this phase, and with forecasts predicting a 145,000% increase post-launch, this coin is poised to make a lasting impact on the market. The smart contract has been thoroughly reviewed by Coinsult, guaranteeing transparency and reliability. Following the presale, the token's ownership will be relinquished, allowing the community to take control. Priced at $0.004 in its current presale stage (Stage 3), and with plans to list on Uniswap and major CEXs, Panshibi is emerging as the memecoin to watch in 2025. Conclusion As we explore the evolving memecoin scene, Panshibi stands out as a promising candidate for substantial growth. With its well-structured presale, active community involvement, and solid tokenomics, it is well-positioned to potentially surpass established names like Bonk and DogWifHat. Although the future of memecoins remains uncertain, Panshibi's mix of entertainment, community, and financial strategy makes it a memecoin worth monitoring and highlights its potential to lead the next big memecoin wave in 2025.

Will liquidity rotate back, or is the dream of another altseason fading for good? Table of Contents Altcoins under pressure Bitcoin’s growing dominance What needs to change for an altcoin rally? How on-chain speculation is disrupting the altcoin market Bitcoin’s repricing and Ethereum’s quiet accumulation Altcoins under pressure On Feb. 3, global financial markets suffered a sharp flash crash after Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, triggering a sell-off across global markets. Stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies reacted immediately, with altcoins taking the biggest hit. At the end of January, the total altcoin market cap stood at $1.46 trillion, but by Feb. 3, it had plunged to $1 trillion,marking a 31.5% decline and wiping out $460 billion in market value. Total crypto market cap chart excluding Bitcoin | Source: TradingView Since then, the market has shown some signs of recovery, climbing to $1.22 trillion as of this writing on Feb. 5. However, it remains nearly 16% below its January levels and 28% short of its all-time high of $1.71 trillion from November 2021. The overall sentiment in the altcoin market remains weak. One key indicator for measuring whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin is the CMC Altcoin Season Index, which tracks the performance of the top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. As of Feb. 5, the index sits at 36, a sharp drop from 87 in December 2024, when altcoins surged following Trump’s election victory. A reading above 50 suggests a mild altcoin rally, while above 75 signals a full-fledged altcoin season. At its current level, the index indicates that Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market, with altcoins struggling to gain traction. Price performance among major altcoins also reflects this sentiment. Ethereum ( ETH ) has declined over 18% year to date, currently trading at around $2,800. Solana ( SOL ) has seen modest growth, rising 5% since the start of the year to reach $205. Meanwhile, Ripple ( XRP ) has been one of the best-performing large-cap altcoins, gaining 21% year to date and surging 360% over the past three months. With institutional interest in Bitcoin continuing to rise, the question remains: Will altcoins see a strong rally in 2025, or will Bitcoin’s dominance persist? Let’s find out. Bitcoin’s growing dominance Bitcoin’s growing dominance in the market has created a bottleneck for altcoins, preventing capital from flowing into them as it did in previous cycles. As of Feb. 5, Bitcoin accounts for 61.5% of the total crypto market cap, its highest level since early 2021. This means that for every dollar invested in crypto, over 61 cents go into Bitcoin, leaving around 39 cents for the thousands of other coins combined. Just two months ago, in December 2024, when altcoins found some footing, this number was 54%, highlighting how quickly Bitcoin has regained its hold over the market. To understand why this is happening, it helps to look at historical trends. Bitcoin dominance tends to rise during uncertain times. The collapse of FTX ( FTT ) in November 2022 is a prime example. When trust in the broader crypto market weakened, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at just 40%. In the following months, however, investors increasingly moved their capital into Bitcoin, pushing its market share past 64% recently. A similar pattern played out between 2018 and early 2021. During that period, Bitcoin’s dominance climbed from 35% to 63% before gradually declining as altcoins began outperforming. But this time, there is a key difference — institutions. Since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, Bitcoin has been absorbing an unprecedented amount of liquidity. As of this writing, spot BTC ETFs hold over $120 billion in assets under management, with large financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the charge. At the same time, discussions about a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. have been gaining traction. If governments start viewing Bitcoin as a hedge, the capital rotation cycle that previously fueled altcoin rallies could take much longer to materialize. Unlike previous cycles, where capital eventually rotated into altcoins, institutions are now accumulating Bitcoin, keeping liquidity concentrated and limiting capital flow into altcoins. What needs to change for an altcoin rally? Historically, capital in crypto markets has moved in phases. Bitcoin absorbs liquidity first, leading market rallies. Once BTC stabilizes, funds rotate into altcoins, triggering an altcoin season. This pattern was evident in 2017 when Bitcoin’s dominance peaked at 70%, paving the way for ETH and XRP to surge in early 2018. A similar trend played out in 2021 when Bitcoin reached $69,000 before altcoins gained traction. Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong, forming higher highs and higher lows—signs that liquidity is still concentrated in BTC. For altcoins to gain momentum, Bitcoin needs a prolonged stabilization period, allowing capital to rotate. A drop in Bitcoin dominance below key support levels would indicate investors shifting funds. Additionally, catalysts such as Ethereum upgrades, regulatory clarity, or broader adoption could accelerate this transition. Another factor slowing capital rotation is the growing presence of institutional investors. Unlike retail traders, institutions tend to make calculated, long-term investments, meaning they are less likely to chase short-term trends in altcoins as seen in past cycles. However, if Bitcoin dominance does start to decline, the rotation process will likely follow the established sequence: large-cap altcoins move first, followed by mid-caps, and then smaller, speculative projects. For now, the market remains in a holding pattern. How on-chain speculation is disrupting the altcoin market The way speculative capital moves in the crypto market has changed, and that shift could be one of the biggest reasons why a traditional altcoin season has yet to materialize. Analyst Miles Deutscher highlights the role of Pump.fun , a platform he says has “directly correlated to the destruction of the altcoin market vs BTC.” The launch of Pump Fun is directly correlated to the destruction of the altcoin market vs $BTC . 👇 The reason we've seen no major ""alt season"" across majors, is because the speculative capital that would've once poured into top 200 assets, instead decided to jump the gun and… pic.twitter.com/g04L2SCar2 — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) February 4, 2025 He explains that in previous cycles, speculative capital would have flowed into top 200 altcoins on centralized exchanges. Instead, much of that liquidity is now flooding into on-chain, low-cap tokens, many of which lack proper liquidity. This new trend has created an uneven market dynamic. “The early birds & insiders got insanely rich from this,” Deutscher notes, but he adds that most retail investors who entered late lost money — just as they did in previous altcoin cycles. However, unlike 2022, when retail losses were mostly limited to relatively liquid altcoins listed on centralized exchanges, this time, capital is locked in illiquid meme tokens, many of which have already retraced 70–80%. According to Deutscher, this shift has made the wealth destruction event even worse than what was seen in early 2022, despite Bitcoin and a few major altcoins remaining in a macro bull trend. Deutscher attributes this shift partly to regulatory uncertainty, stating that traders have been forced to look for alternative ways to speculate due to restrictions on fair project launches. “I don’t blame Pump Fun, as its launch is in direct response to the brash crypto regulation that has made it impossible to fair-launch projects.” He adds that the industry has struggled to find a fair model for new projects since 2017, with airdrops being the closest alternative. Bitcoin’s repricing and Ethereum’s quiet accumulation While altcoins struggle with liquidity, analyst The Bitcoin Therapist believes that Bitcoin’s current price does not reflect its true value. “Something is terribly wrong with the market’s pricing of Bitcoin. We are easily $50K–$100K undervalued,” he states, suggesting that a violent repricing event could be imminent. Something is terribly wrong with the market’s pricing of Bitcoin. We are easily $50K-$100K undervalued. There is far too much to be bullish about. There is going to be a violent repricing. — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) February 5, 2025 If this is the case, Bitcoin’s dominance may remain elevated for much longer than expected. Historically, Bitcoin has gone through rapid repricing phases when institutional demand outpaces supply, which may be happening now. However, as Matthew Hyland points out, the recent crash was also the largest liquidation event in crypto history, meaning a quick recovery should not be expected. “In 2020 & 2022, it took over two months for the full recovery to take place,” he notes. Considering this was the largest liquidation event in #Crypto history it likely means the low is in however in 2020 & 2022 it took over 2 months for the full recovery to take place You likely wont see those December highs on most #Alts for a minimum of 2 months if not longer so… pic.twitter.com/t5Zah7SN6s — Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) February 4, 2025 Hyland cautions investors against expecting an immediate return to prior highs, particularly for altcoins. Even during the rapid rebound of 2020, there were multiple dips along the way. “You likely won’t see those December highs on most alts for a minimum of two months, if not longer,” he says, adding that previous high-volatility events — such as the COVID crash, LUNA collapse, and FTX fallout — all took months to recover from. Ethereum, meanwhile, is quietly seeing large accumulation from major players. Analyst Naiive highlights that Donald Trump, through his project World Liberty Financial, has reportedly purchased $200 million in ETH, while Fidelity and BlackRock have accumulated $49.75 million and $300 million in ETH, respectively. Donald Trump bought $200M ETH Fidelity bought $49.75M ETH yesterday BlackRock bought $300M ETH today naiive bought $69 in ETH today Whales are shaking weak hands out — naiive (@naiivememe) February 5, 2025 This pattern suggests that whales are strategically shaking out weak hands, taking advantage of market uncertainty to accumulate at lower prices. If institutional ETH accumulation continues, Ethereum could act as a leading indicator for broader altcoin demand. When Ethereum starts gaining against Bitcoin, it often signals early capital rotation into large-cap altcoins, which can eventually trickle down to mid-caps and smaller assets. But until Bitcoin’s dominance shows signs of weakening, the altcoin recovery remains in a waiting phase. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Remittix is the altcoin project that analysts say could mirror the gains of Dogecoin, Cardano, and Toncoin, some of the top players in the space. Remittix (RTX) is the PayFi project that is on investors’ must-have list because of its tangible solutions to the limitations of the finance space. Its native RTX altcoin has raised over $10.6 million in its ongoing presale, and because of its distinct crypto-to-FIAT model, Remittix has been dubbed the XRP 2.0. Find out why! Dogecoin’s Downturn Continues As Analyst Predicts Continued Correction Grayscale, a prominent asset manager, released a Dogecoin Trust , and because the firm is known for its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, experts believe that DOGE could scale to more than just a meme coin. Shortly after the launch of the Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale also filled out a form to convert the trust into an ETF. This development has caused a stir among DOGE holders who look forward to Dogecoin’s mainstream debut as more than a meme coin. However, top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared that DOGE may face a steep price correction because of its bearish crossover. DOGE has declined over 18% within the last seven days, and its price sits at $0.258 due to bearish sentiment. That’s why RTX outpaces it in its contributions to cross-border space. Analyst Says Cardano Could Reach $14 Cardano’s historical trends have caught the attention of investors who believe ADA could replicate its results. Javon Marks, a popular crypto analyst, identified ADA’s key resistance and shared that the project could surge past $7. Lucky , another popular crypto commentator, shared that ADA was a long-term project and a solid bet for those who want to boost their portfolios. ADA trades at $0.71, declining over 19% within the last seven days, yet many experts remain optimistic about Cardano’s future prospects. However, ADA holders turn to RTX’s token presale to get their hands on its bullish potential. Can TON Reach $6? Analyst Studies Its Movement Toncoin’s partnership with Telegram has increased the project’s adoption and contributions to blockchain integration. Neucaster recently shared in a post on X that TON could see a significant price increase in the coming weeks. The analysts stated that Toncoin could witness a massive rally that could push its price to $6; hence, the project’s partnership with Telegram has drawn more investors to the platform. TON trades at about $3.95, declining over 18% within the last seven days, but analysts say that it could reach $14.9 by March. Yet, Toncoin investors look to RTX as one of the best coins to buy now for massive returns this year. Remittix’s Presale Nears The $15 Million Mark Due To Its Unique Appeal Remittix’s token presale has gained significant momentum due to its cross-border technology. The Remittix presale has raised over $10.6 million, with each RTX token priced at $0.0539.

Given the firm's reputation for handling Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, many believe DOGE could evolve beyond its meme coin status. Following the introduction of the Dogecoin Trust, Grayscale also filed to transform the trust into an ETF. This announcement has created excitement among DOGE investors who are eager to see Dogecoin's journey into mainstream finance. Nonetheless, leading analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that DOGE might encounter a significant price dip due to its bearish trend. DOGE has fallen by over 18% in the past week, with its value currently at $0.258, hindered by negative market sentiment. This is one reason why RTX surpasses it in terms of contributions to the cross-border financial sector.

Dogecoin whales purchase up to 560 million Doge in a week Recent analysis from experts suggest Dogecoin’s biggest investors are back in the game.

Transactions higher than $100,000 have increased recently, indicating a strategic gobbling up of the asset amongst investors. Popular analyst, Ali Martinez, spoke about Dogecoin’s price on his X account on January 31st. He disclosed that whale investors have gathered 560 million DOGE tokens in seven days. This marked increase in whales activity occurred after the crypto market saw a prolonged reduction in price. The increase in whales activity also points to the fact that many investors are choosing to liquidate their tokens to make profit - all due to bearish movement of Dogecoin’s price. The bearish momentum and unprecedented reduction in price has caused Dogecoin’s market to experience a significant sell off. With whale investors getting back in action, experts predict some positive changes in the long run. Experts predict Dogecoin price to experience significant rally With the recent increase in whales’ activity, experts suggest the drop in Dogecoin price is in preparation for a significant rally. Popular crypto analyst and trader, Tardigrade, recently shared a price chart, showing previous trends when Dogecoin increased to new marks. Experts believe the coin’s recent price trend is similar to these previous trends, so investors could be experiencing significant gains in the near future. Like in 2017, when Dogecoin’s price went to its highest level, Tardigrade believes the same thing could happen in 2025. Experts also predict an imminent increase of ATH to $3.80. Dogecoin whales and the new panda meme, Panshibi Without any doubt, Dogecoin continues to dominate the meme coin section of the crypto world.

Dogecoin Whales Acquire 560 Million DOGE in One Week New insights from experts indicate that Dogecoin's top investors are re-engaging actively. Various analysts have reported that these major players are expanding their Dogecoin portfolios. The frequency of transactions exceeding $100,000 has risen lately, reflecting a deliberate accumulation strategy among investors. Well-known analyst Ali Martinez discussed Dogecoin’s price on his X account on January 31st. He revealed that whale investors gathered 560 million DOGE tokens over the course of a week. This significant uptick in whales activity followed a prolonged decline in the crypto market. The surge in whales activity also suggests that many investors are offloading their tokens to capitalize on profits amid Dogecoin's bearish price trends. The prevailing downward trend and drastic price drop has led to a notable sell-off in Dogecoin’s market. With whale investors returning, experts foresee potential positive shifts in the future. Experts Anticipate a Major Dogecoin Price Rally The recent uptick in whale activity has led experts to believe that the dip in Dogecoin price is a precursor to a major rally. Renowned crypto analyst and trader, Tardigrade, recently shared a price chart highlighting past trends when Dogecoin hit new highs. Experts see the current price movement as reminiscent of previous trends, suggesting investors might soon see substantial returns. Just as in 2017, when Dogecoin’s price peaked, Tardigrade anticipates a similar occurrence by 2025. Experts are also predicting a near-term all-time high increase to $3.80.

39969876,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=669318,1738798184,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39969876.jpeg,Treasury Secretary Bessent says Trump is “not calling for the Fed to lower interest rates”,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/treasury-secretary-bessent-says-trump-is-not-calling-for-the-fed-to-lower-interest-rates/,"Scott Bessent, president Donald Trump’s handpicked Treasury Secretary, put an end to the speculation during a Wednesday interview on Fox Business. The president is not pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, Scott said. Instead, he claims that the administration’s focus is laser-locked on long-term borrowing costs, specifically the 10-year Treasury yield. “He and I are focused on the 10-year Treasury,” Scott said. “He is not calling for the Fed to lower rates.” Scott’s claims are a bit odd since as Cryptopolitan reported on Jan. 24, Trump did say “I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us all over.” Tariff tactics and manufacturing goals Scott then laid out exactly why long-term yields are more important to Trump’s economic strategy, explaining that expanding the US energy supply will help curb inflation. With inflation strangling consumers and businesses, the administration is betting that lower energy costs will have a knock-on effect, making goods cheaper and long-term borrowing more manageable. But not everyone is clapping for these guys. Democrats are seething after Scott gave Elon Musk’s controversial D.O.G.E department access to federal Treasury data, a decision that triggered accusations of recklessness and even protests outside the Hill. In the interview, Scott defended the decision head-on, saying, “The US has a serious spending problem, which is fast becoming a detrimental economic problem. My focus is on the national debt and the budget deficit. I want to bring it down and increase the GDP. D.O.G.E is exactly what we need.” Scott also went full steam ahead on Trump’s trade policy, explaining how the administration is using tariffs as a weapon to revive domestic industries. Medical supplies and shipbuilding are high on the list of targeted sectors. Tariff threats against Colombia, Mexico, and Canada, he said, were designed to pressure them into cooperating on immigration and trade-related issues. But the ultimate objective, according adding Scott, is to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US “We’re aiming for long-term growth,” he said, hinting that once American factories are up and running, the revenue generated by tariffs will naturally drop off. Trump’s team is playing the long game — squeeze trading partners now to create a self-sufficient industrial base later, said Scott. Despite criticizing former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s strategy before taking office, Scott is keeping much of her framework in place for now. Next week, the Treasury will auction $125 billion in long-term debt, with sales broken down into 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year maturities. The auctions include $58 billion in 3-year notes, $42 billion in 10-year notes, and $25 billion in 30-year bonds. These auctions are designed to raise $18.8 billion in new cash, and for now, Scott isn’t making any drastic changes to the way Treasury handles long-term borrowing. But why stick with Yellen’s plan when he previously criticized it? Simple—Scott is playing it cool, letting the dust settle before shaking things up. And while Treasury insiders are itching for tweaks, especially to long-term issuance, Scott is choosing stability over chaos. Debt ceiling constraints and Fed quantitative tightening The federal debt ceiling, reinstated after a suspension in mid-2023, has forced Scott’s department into “extraordinary measures” to avoid breaching the limit. Treasury officials warned that these debt ceiling constraints could make Treasury bill issuance more volatile than usual. The department also announced it would rely heavily on short-term cash management bills to navigate the crisis until Congress either raises or suspends the cap. Another complication comes from the Federal Reserve’s ongoing quantitative tightening program, which is sucking $25 billion worth of Treasuries out of circulation each month. With fewer buyers in the market, the Treasury is being forced to rethink its borrowing strategy. In his interview, Scott said he is keeping a close eye on when the Fed might slow—or fully stop—this policy. Dealers now expect QT to end sometime in the summer, slightly later than the original spring estimate, creating additional pressure on Treasury’s borrowing needs by 2025. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), a group of Wall Street players and economists, has urged the department to modify its forward guidance to reflect market unpredictability. Some members of the panel want the language scrapped altogether, but others prefer more cautious adjustments. Scott isn’t letting them call the shots. Responding to TBAC’s recommendations, he reminded everyone that their advice is just that—advice. “The Treasury decides.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-05 23:29:44

South Korean Police Arrest 90; More to Come? The Busan Metropolitan Police Agency arrested the group on suspicion of violating the Narcotics Control Act. Officers remanded 18 suspects in custody. Police released photos of instant coffee mix containers the group allegedly used to smuggle drugs into South Korea. (Source: Busan Metropolitan Police Agency) Officers said they had started monitoring the suspects “from September last year.” Their investigation comes as a result of a “drugs crackdown” centered on nine Vietnamese-run bars and clubs in the cities of Sejong, Daegu, Cheonan, Asan, and Jincheon. The police said that the gang “systematically smuggled drugs” into South Korea. The group then allegedly “distributed them” in the bars and other clubs. A spokesperson said the gang members “smuggled drugs into the country,” disguising their illegal cargo “as packets of coffee and vitamins.” Officers claim the gang entered South Korea “on education, employment, or marriage visas.” However, police officials added that “some of the suspects” are “illegal residents.” The police think that the gang brought 1.04 billion won ($721,000) worth of narcotics into the country. Officers think that the group succeeded in selling 710 million won (almost half a million USD) worth of this amount to club and bar patrons. Police investigators raid a nightclub associated with the drug raid. (Source: Busan Metropolitan Police Agency) Crypto Was Gang’s ‘Payment Tool’ Police said the gang used cryptoassets as a payment tool to sell, smuggle, and source the drugs. Officers added that the gang sold synthetic marijuana, ketamine, and MDMA (ecstasy) to club- and bar-goers. They also think the gang helped organize private parties to boost interest in their illegal wares. The police force said it had “relayed the details of this crackdown” to several local government bodies. Despite the political upheaval and its negative effects on the economy of South Korea last year, Suwon Mayor Lee Jae-joon is content with his city's progress. https://t.co/F8LP9lKM7e — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 5, 2025 Officers also said they would take action against “buyers who took drugs” at the bars and clubs in question. A police spokesperson said investigators “plan to identify and arrest” more “intermediaries” by conducting a “digital analysis of the suspects’ cell phones.” The spokesperson said that the police force now “plans to conduct regular crackdowns” on clubs and entertainment venues frequently visited by foreign nationals.” The spokesperson added: “Our crackdown will help prevent the spread of drugs and drug abuse.” South Korean police officers throughout the country have been fighting what they and prosecutors have called a worsening epidemic of crypto-powered drug crime. South Korea’s consumer inflation accelerated on the back of higher energy and food prices, adding to concerns for policymakers https://t.co/5Ek0pEyeoT — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) February 4, 2025 Cryptonews.com has seen recent Korean-language posts on the social media networks X and Telegram from what appears to be drug dealers offering “nationwide” drugs “delivery.” One post, from February 3, made mention of Bitcoin (BTC) . This appears to suggest the dealer would only accept advance BTC payment for dead-dropped narcotics “deliveries.” South Korean media outlets have claimed that crypto-powered drug gangs have turned Korean-language Telegram channels into “drugs department stores.” They say the online spaces have become an illicit “playground” for young South Koreans.

These 5 Bitcoin-Friendly Cryptos Could Skyrocket Next!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrps-rise-to-50-these-5-bitcoin-friendly-cryptos-could-skyrocket-next/,"From Bitcoin’s Ascent to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Breakthrough THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing attention as the next big win in the crypto market, even as Bitcoin (BTC) celebrates its historic milestone of crossing $100,000. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1.5 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1.5 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value.

Officially, the State’s legislature has welcomed Senate Bill 57 (SB57), which will see New Mexico invest 5% of public funds in Bitcoin. The Bill was introduced to the New Mexico Senate by Senator Ant Thornton. New Mexico Bitcoin Reserve Bill The Bill, as shared on X , dubbed the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” focuses on establishing an alternative treasury for the state. The proposed 5% allocation would diversify the state’s funds in Bitcoin and allow it to benefit from its long-term price appreciation. The Bill also proposed that the State Investment Officer manage this Bitcoin reserve. Notably, the manager will operate under the oversight of the State Investment Council. The Bill also spelled out the need for cold storage as a viable means to safeguard the State’s Bitcoin. As Senator Thornton defines it, this BTC reserve will diversify New Mexico’s investments away from stocks and bonds. It will also position the state at the forefront of innovation in the growing cryptocurrency industry. Thornton also emphasized the economic benefits of a Bitcoin pivot, which could attract crypto companies and benefit the local economy. Conditions like transparent reporting and public awareness were also spelled out to make the bill more appealing. More US States Pushing for a Bitcoin Reserve Besides New Mexico, other top US States are also exploring the Bitcoin reserve move. As reported earlier by Coingape, Indiana seeks Bitcoin ETF exposure for the state’s retirement funds. The Indiana BTC Bill was filed in late January by Rep Jake Teshka. Lawmakers in other US States like Utah have also introduced a Bitcoin Bill to benefit the region in the long term. While about 15 states in the US have introduced a Bitcoin Bill, it underscores the growing adoption of the coin. The move aligns with the Federal Government’s national digital asset stockpile plan. In a recent press conference, Crypto &AI Czar David Sacks confirmed that the government is evaluating a proposal to establish a Bitcoin reserve. However, the timeline of events or whether the presidential crypto working group will recommend BTC purchases remains unknown. BTC Price to Benefit Amid the growing clamor for BTC in state portfolios, analysts have projected the overall impact will be felt in the coin’s price. At the moment, BTC was changing hands for $96,679, up by 1.1% at the time of writing. It has recorded a 24-hour low and high of $96,301.67 and $99,113.20 respectively. If proposals from Utah and other states get approved and public funds are injected into the coin, its market cap will soar. This will not only push prices upward but ultimately help in curtailing the volatility of the growing asset class.

While Ampere looks primed for a takeover, it is also exploring its strategic options, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. The same people also urged caution as talks could still fall apart. It’s also possible the chipmaker is snapped up by another potential buyer. SoftBank has made several strategic acquisitions in recent years, including stakes in companies like Arm Holdings and WeWork. Ampere primed for takeover Ampere designs semiconductors that use Arm’s technology. It was valued at $8 billion in a proposed minority investment by Japan’s SoftBank in 2021. The company’s current valuation, as far as Arm and Ampere are concerned, is still being discussed. While representatives for all parties involved have not commented publicly, we know that Ampere has been working with a financial adviser to help field takeover interest according to a Bloomberg News report from September. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s interest in a deal with a larger player in the industry reportedly implies that there was no clear path to an initial public offering. An announcement regarding the transaction is expected in the coming weeks, highlighting the urgency and significance of the deal. The deal involves SoftBank Group Corp. and Ampere Computing LLC, which is backed by Oracle Corp., showcasing a collaboration between major players in the tech industry. Chip companies cashing in on the AI spending boom The interest in Ampere, whose early backers also include Carlyle Group Inc., is strategic as it comes at a time when chip companies are looking to leverage the growing demand for artificial intelligence technologies. Last year, Oracle confirmed that it owns 29% of the startup and can exercise future investment options that would give it control of the chipmaker. There is a huge interest to control key components as the data center industry gets ready for the AI age, but Ampere, like its larger rivals Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., finds itself having to deal with consumer interest gravitating towards Nvidia Corp’s accelerator chips from CPUs. Ampere makes processors for data center machinery using Arm’s technology. Meanwhile, Arm is increasingly moving from being a licensor of fundamental standards and basic blueprints to more of a complete chipmaker. Ampere’s engineers, many of whom used to work for Intel’s former industry-leading server chip unit, have also been hired. Their addition is expected to provide momentum to Arm’s CEO Rene Haas’ efforts to expand into the server chip market, leveraging their experience and knowledge. Founder and CEO Renee James, a former Intel executive, had eyes on taking Ampere public. In April 2022, the company revealed it had filed confidentially for a US IPO at a time when demand for chips was on the increase. If a takeover of Ampere is successful, a run of semiconductor deals would continue at a time when global deals involving chips are surging. Just last year, Bloomberg reported that deals involving chip companies more than doubled to over $31 billion.

As stablecoins continue to play a growing role in the cryptocurrency and financial sectors, the administration aims to ensure that they operate within a regulated environment that aligns with traditional monetary policies. A senior official stated that the administration is “closely monitoring the development of stablecoins” and recognizes their potential to enhance financial transactions and global commerce. The push for regulation comes amid increasing concerns about the stability and oversight of digital assets, particularly as the stablecoin market has expanded rapidly in recent years. Many stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies, providing a level of stability that other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, often lack. However, without clear regulations, policymakers worry that stablecoins could pose risks to financial markets, consumer protection, and even national security. The administration is reportedly considering a regulatory framework that would ensure stablecoins maintain a one-to-one backing with U.S. dollar reserves and comply with existing financial rules. “We believe that stablecoins, when properly regulated, can serve as a valuable tool for the U.S. financial system and the global economy,” the official said. The move aligns with broader efforts to establish the United States as a leader in digital currency innovation while maintaining the integrity of its financial system. Stablecoins have increasingly been used in payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, making them an integral part of the evolving digital asset landscape. The administration’s stance on stablecoin regulation also comes as political figures and regulatory bodies debate the future of cryptocurrency oversight in the U.S. Donald Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto advocate, with his campaign receiving significant financial backing from the digital asset industry. Industry leaders have called for clear regulations to prevent uncertainty and encourage mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. While some officials view stablecoins as a potential asset for enhancing payment efficiency, others warn that improper regulation could undermine the dollar’s dominance or introduce systemic risks. One of the key concerns surrounding stablecoins is ensuring they have sufficient reserves to back their issuance, preventing situations where issuers fail to meet redemption demands. The administration is expected to collaborate with financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, to establish guidelines for stablecoin issuers. Market participants believe that regulatory clarity could help increase trust in stablecoins and encourage their adoption by traditional financial institutions. As the U.S. moves toward shaping its approach to stablecoin oversight, the cryptocurrency industry will closely monitor how the administration balances innovation with financial stability. With regulatory discussions gaining momentum, the coming months could prove crucial in determining the role stablecoins will play in the future of digital finance.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-05 23:36:00

On Wednesday, the Canadian blockchain entity announced that this acquisition increases its total Bitcoin and Bitcoin-equivalent holdings to 68.14 units, further confirming its commitment to Bitcoin as a key treasury asset. Strengthening Financial Stability With Bitcoin The company stated that the new Bitcoin was bought at an average price of USD$99,580 per coin, including fees and expenses. Notably, Matador remains debt-free, holding all its Bitcoin outright. In addition to Bitcoin, the company holds CAD$1.8 million in cash reserves and 2 kilograms of physical gold, valued at roughly CAD$287,000. According to Matador, these assets reveal its prudent financial strategy focused on long-term stability and capital preservation. Consequently, the company continues integrating Bitcoin into its treasury operations, further reinforcing its position as a digital asset leader. Expanding Digital Gold Strategy It’s worth noting that in January, the company announced the development of a digital gold platform, set to launch in the first quarter of 2025. This platform will leverage blockchain technology to strengthen its investment strategy. Matador CEO Deven Soni stated that the company has been working on “making gold great again” since 2021 and is excited to bring this concept to market. This idea fits Matador’s broader goal of merging traditional finance with digital tools, as seen in its recent decision to add Bitcoin as a core asset. Technology Giants Continue to Bet Big on Bitcoin Meanwhile, last month, Metaplanet announced its strategic initiative to acquire 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and 21,000 Bitcoin by 2026, positioning itself among the most significant corporate holders of the cryptocurrency globally. Semler Scientific, a healthcare technology company, recently purchased 871 Bitcoin for $88.5 million, seeing impressive returns with a paper gain of over 150%. Likewise, MicroStrategy, a software firm, is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy . The company plans to raise $563 million through a Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) offering, solidifying its leadership in corporate cryptocurrency investments.

Governments argue that privacy coins are untraceable, posing a significant risk to financial security and accountability. However, financial privacy is a standard expectation in traditional systems—we don’t allow anyone to track our bank account just because we bought an ice cream. Zano , the L1 blockchain for confidential assets and private dApps, has partnered with Cake Wallet , one of the biggest non-custodial wallets among privacy enthusiasts, to make privacy features more accessible and user-friendly for the web3 community. Zano was founded by Andrey Sabelnikov , the lead developer behind CryptoNote – a privacy coin protocol used by Monero and hundreds of other projects. Zano Partners with Cake Wallet to Improve User-accessibility Zano’s partnership with Cake Wallet is pivotal in making privacy coins more accessible to mainstream users. The collaboration brings Zano’s advanced privacy tools into Cake Wallet’s application, providing an enhanced experience for users seeking to safeguard their assets. The partnership empowers Cake Wallet users to hold, manage, and transact with Zano coins, giving them access to a privacy-first cryptocurrency within a non-custodial wallet. As part of the integration, Cake Wallet will support Zano’s confidential assets, which include private stablecoins and wrapped versions of major cryptocurrencies like zBTC and zETH. According to Vikrant Sharma, the co-founder and CEO of Cake wallet: “Cake Wallet is dedicated to pushing privacy forward, and our partnership with Zano is a natural stepping stone in bringing robust privacy tools to the cryptocurrency community and beyond,” Similar thoughts were shared by Quenten van Welzen, the head of marketing and growth at Zano: ‘The values of Zano and Cake Wallet overlap quite a bit. Therefore, integrating the Zano blockchain into Cake Wallet seems like a natural fit, and we are very excited to be onboarded to such a wonderful privacy-friendly wallet,” Why Users Love Zano: Privacy, Security, and Full Control Over Their Assets Zano’s integration with Cake Wallet is already winning over users who prioritise financial privacy, security, and ease of use. In an era of increasing financial surveillance and data breaches, the ability to transact securely without exposing sensitive information is more important than ever. With its seamless, privacy-first approach, Zano empowers individuals to take full control of their digital assets while maintaining complete confidentiality. “For me, financial privacy is a fundamental right. With Zano and Cake Wallet, I finally have a simple, secure way to manage my assets without worrying about surveillance or data leaks. It’s reassuring to know I can transact freely while keeping my financial data private,” said Alex M., a longtime cryptocurrency user and privacy advocate. By combining Zano’s advanced privacy features with Cake Wallet’s intuitive design, the partnership ensures that users can easily store, send, and receive confidential assets without technical complexity. This collaboration reinforces the importance of privacy in the digital economy, giving users the tools they need to protect their financial freedom. A Step Closer to Institutional Adoption While blockchain’s transparency is often seen as an advantage, it presents a major obstacle for financial institutions looking to adopt the technology. Contrary to popular belief, complete transparency is not always beneficial—especially in financial systems where confidentiality is crucial. Traditional banking and corporate finance operate on the principle that certain data, such as transaction details, client identities, and proprietary trading strategies, must remain private to protect competitive advantages and comply with regulations on data security. For institutions, the challenge is striking a balance between trust and privacy. They need to verify the integrity of transactions, ensure compliance, and prevent fraud without exposing proprietary information to the public. This requirement creates friction when integrating with public blockchains, where transactions are permanently recorded and fully visible to anyone. To drive institutional adoption, blockchain technology must evolve to provide mechanisms that offer cryptographic proof of validity without revealing the underlying data itself.

Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, announced the filing on social media, emphasizing that customer assets should not be absorbed into a custodian’s bankruptcy proceedings. Coinbase Urges Court to Uphold Customer Asset Rights In a recent post on X , Paul Grewal stated that Coinbase filed an amicus brief in the Prime Trust bankruptcy case. The company is advocating for the enforcement of Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 8, which ensures that assets held by custodians belong to customers and not the custodians themselves. Coinbase argues that both its user agreement and Prime Trust’s user agreement explicitly state that assets remain customer property. The company asserts that bankruptcy should not alter these agreements or reclassify assets as part of the custodian’s estate. The legal filing will prevent customer funds from being included in Prime Trust’s bankruptcy estate. Coinbase maintains that upholding UCC Article 8 is essential to maintaining trust in custodians, both in digital and traditional finance. In other legal developments, the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 hearing is drawing industry-wide attention. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal will testify alongside other key figures, pushing back against alleged unfair banking restrictions on crypto. Legal Protections Under UCC Article 8 UCC Article 8 is a fundamental part of commercial law that protects customer assets held by custodians. It applies to both digital and traditional financial institutions, ensuring that customer funds remain separate from a custodian’s bankruptcy proceedings. Coinbase emphasized that this legal framework applies to major financial institutions, including Bank of New York (BNY) and Depository Trust Company (DTC). The company stated that courts have historically upheld these protections to ensure market stability and customer security. The amicus brief argues that disregarding UCC Article 8 could set a negative precedent for customer asset protections. Coinbase believes that recognizing customer ownership of assets is critical for preserving market confidence and protecting investor funds. Trust and Security in Financial Markets Coinbase has positioned itself as a strong advocate for customer asset protection in financial markets. The company stated that ensuring customer funds remain secure is essential for maintaining trust in custodians and financial institutions. Paul Grewal expressed confidence in the legal precedent supporting customer asset protections. He urged the court to reinforce these protections in the Prime Trust bankruptcy case, aligning with past court rulings that have upheld UCC Article 8. The company emphasized that its filing is not about crypto only but about broader financial principles that impact digital and traditional finance. In addition, the top crypto exchange continues to strengthen its global footprint with regulatory approvals in key markets. Coinbase recently secured a VASP license in the UK, allowing it to offer expanded crypto and fiat services. This move aligns with its broader international strategy, ensuring compliance while driving digital asset adoption.

But instead of holding, many are selling their coins to buy a new altcoin that’s gaining attention—Remittix (RTX) . While Dogecoin stays strong and Shiba Inu struggles, whales are shifting to RTX because it offers real-world use and big growth potential. What’s making Remittix so special? Let’s find out! Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars, But Price Struggles Amid Market Sell-Off, Remittix Gains Momentum Recently, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) experienced a significant burn incident whereby over one billion SHIB tokens—worth $18,832.80—were transferred to a ""dead address."" Since it helps lower the token supply and maybe enhance the price, this burn generated enthusiasm in the Shiba Inu community. Still, Shiba Inu's price suffers even with the burn. Pricing at $0.00001757 , SHIB is currently down 6.6% in the last 24 hours and has fallen 12.11% in the last week. With $539 million taken off from crypto assets in liquidations, this drop fits a larger market sell-off. Remittix (RTX) is fast becoming popular as Shiba Inu struggles. Using cryptocurrencies, this creative PayFi concept provides underbanked people with a means of sending and receiving money anywhere. Remittix is fulfilling its promise with $10.6 million raised in a few weeks. Its Pay API helps companies to accept crypto payments and quickly translate them into FIAT currencies, therefore lowering the price-related risks. Remittix is presenting itself as a game-changer in the global payments industry, giving financial freedom to those outside the conventional banking system, while SHIB battles with pricing volatility. Dogecoin Faces Struggles While Remittix Gains Investor Interest Price swings in Dogecoin (DOGE) have lately been somewhat noticeable. It lost 27.27% in December 2024, then recovered by 21.87% in early January; nevertheless, by January 28 it dropped once more to $0.33, with the present price at $0.2957 . Notwithstanding this instability, experts such as Ali Martinez hope that the introduction of a Dogecoin ETF will cause a price surge, thereby guiding DOGE to $15 in the next months. However, many investors are looking for other opportunities, and Remittix ( RTX ) has caught their attention. This innovative project aims to solve long-standing issues in global payments, offering financial services to those who don’t have access to traditional banks. With over $10.6 million raised in just a few weeks, Remittix is becoming a strong alternative to meme coins like Dogecoin. While Dogecoin’s future remains uncertain, Remittix’s utility-focused approach makes it an appealing option for those seeking a new, promising crypto project. Remittix: A Game-Changer in Global Payments An exciting new cryptocurrency causing ripples in the financial scene is Remittix (RTX) . Unlike many cryptocurrencies, which are just for trade or speculation, Remittix is all about addressing practical issues. Its goal is to use blockchain technology to enable faster, less expensive, more accessible money transfers, transforming the $190 trillion worldwide money transfer market. Remittix's $RTX token, used for staking, platform incentives, and governance, forms its central component. With just 1.5 billion coins in circulation, the coin is a limited supply desirable item as the network expands. With no hidden costs, users may quickly convert over forty cryptocurrencies into FIAT currencies and send money to any bank account anywhere in the globe. This makes it far less expensive than banks and standard money transfer companies. Businesses are also getting on board with Remittix, thanks to its Remittix Pay API. This allows merchants to accept crypto payments and automatically convert them to FIAT currencies, removing the risk of price fluctuations. With over 30 FIAT currencies and 50 altcoins supported, Remittix is revolutionizing international payments and positioning itself as a game-changer in the industry. At just $0.0539 per token during its presale, Remittix offers a unique opportunity for investors looking to get in early on this transformative platform.

However, instead of holding onto these coins, a significant number are opting to sell in favor of acquiring a promising new altcoin—Remittix (RTX) . While Dogecoin maintains its strength and Shiba Inu faces challenges, whales are gravitating towards RTX due to its practical applications and potential for substantial growth. What exactly makes Remittix stand out? Let’s explore! Shiba Inu's Burn Rate Increases, But Price Declines Amid Market Downturn, Remittix Gains Traction Recently, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) underwent a massive burn event, with over a billion SHIB tokens—worth $18,832.80—being sent to an inactive address. This action sparked excitement within the Shiba Inu community as it reduces token supply and could potentially boost prices. Despite this, Shiba Inu's value continues to dip. With a current price of $0.00001757 , SHIB has dropped by 6.6% in the past 24 hours and 12.11% over the last week. The decline is part of a broader market sell-off, with $539 million disappearing from crypto assets due to liquidations. As Shiba Inu struggles, Remittix (RTX) is gaining traction. This innovative PayFi solution uses cryptocurrencies to provide underbanked individuals with a method to send and receive money globally. Remittix is delivering on its promises, raising $10.6 million in a matter of weeks. Its Pay API enables companies to accept crypto payments and swiftly convert them into FIAT currencies, minimizing price-related risks. As SHIB grapples with price volatility, Remittix is positioning itself as a transformative force in international payments, offering financial independence to those outside the traditional banking system. Dogecoin Faces Challenges as Remittix Captures Investor Attention Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently experienced notable price fluctuations. After dropping 27.27% in December 2024 and rebounding by 21.87% in early January, it fell again, reaching $0.33 by January 28, with the current price at $0.2957 . Despite this volatility, experts like Ali Martinez believe that a Dogecoin ETF launch could trigger a price increase, potentially driving DOGE to $15 in the coming months. Nevertheless, many investors are seeking alternatives, and Remittix ( RTX ) has caught their eye. Aiming to address long-standing global payment challenges, this innovative project offers financial services to those without access to traditional banking. With over $10.6 million raised in a few weeks, Remittix is emerging as a compelling alternative to meme coins like Dogecoin. While the future of Dogecoin remains uncertain, Remittix’s focus on utility provides an appealing option for investors interested in a promising new crypto venture. Remittix: Revolutionizing Global Payments Remittix (RTX) is an exciting new cryptocurrency making waves in the financial world. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that focus on trading or speculation, Remittix addresses real-world issues. It aims to revolutionize the $190 trillion global money transfer market by offering faster, cheaper, and more accessible transfers using blockchain technology.

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the nation’s largest union organization, filed a lawsuit in a Washington, DC, federal court on February 3. “Unlawful” Data Sharing with Musk-Led Task Force The court document revealed that AFL-CIO sought to halt what it describes as an “ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure” of confidential data. It argued that individuals required to share financial details with the government should not have their information exposed to Musk and D.O.G.E while stressing the scale of the privacy breach. The lawsuit follows reports that DOGE, a Trump administration task force led by Musk responsible with reducing federal workforce and regulations, gained access to crucial Treasury databases, including Social Security and Medicare payment systems. According to reports , D.O.G.E’s ability to retrieve taxpayer data raises concerns over potential misuse, particularly regarding politically motivated interference in federal payments. Senate Finance Committee Democrat Ron Wyden expressed alarm over the situation in a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, warning that unauthorized access could lead to disruptions in essential payment systems. Wyden stated that any politically driven tampering with these systems could have severe repercussions for the economy. The controversy has already led to significant fallout within the Treasury Department. Meanwhile, Acting Deputy Secretary David Lebryk resigned from his post after more than three decades of service, reportedly in response to D.O.G.E’s request for access to the department’s financial infrastructure. In a farewell letter to Treasury employees, Lebryk spoke about the critical role of the Fiscal Service in maintaining the stability of government operations and added that while much of its work goes unnoticed by the public, it remains crucial to the country’s functioning. D.O.G.E The D.O.G.E was established to reduce wasteful spending and eliminate unnecessary regulations, though its formal mission, as outlined in the executive order, is to modernize federal technology and software to improve government efficiency and productivity. Announced by Donald Trump in November 2024 for his second term, the organization was initially set to be co-led by Vivek Ramaswamy alongside Musk, but Ramaswamy left before the task force’s launch.

As utility-driven meme coins gain popularity, Panshibi is becoming a disruptive force with both fun and practical applications. As the best new meme coin investors are already monitoring it, and there are rumors that its value may increase. Dogecoin: The Pioneer Still Holding Strong Originally developed as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the original meme coin and is now a mainstay in the cryptocurrency space. A fervent community, social media buzz, and well-known endorsements from people like Elon Musk propelled it to stardom. DOGE continues to prosper despite criticism of its inflationary token concept, especially in tipping and payments. Even while Dogecoin news frequently emphasizes how widely adopted it is, it lacks the technological innovations found in more recent initiatives. Its long-term viability and capacity to compete with cutting-edge meme coins that provide more than simply branding are questions. Shiba Inu: The Evolution of Meme Coins By creating a whole ecosystem, Shiba Inu (SHIB) advanced the meme coin idea. In contrast to DOGE, SHIB brought staking opportunities, ShibaSwap, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution. Because of these developments, it has lasted beyond the hoopla and is regarded by many as one of the greatest new meme coin initiatives of the past few years. SHIB has demonstrated that meme coins can provide more than simply amusement, but Panshibi wants to further reshape the market by resolving important problems that have kept cryptocurrencies from becoming widely accepted. Panshibi: The Next-Generation Meme Coin with 100X Potential Panshibi is a revolution in the making, not simply another meme. By fusing panda crypto 100xpotential with practical applications, it seeks to close the gap between AI-driven innovation, Social-Fi, and meme culture. Due to its solid foundations, Panshibi is a desirable investment for both novice and seasoned traders, in contrast to DOGE and SHIB, which mostly rely on community hype. In order to solve this, Panshibi adds staking, governance, and exclusivity incentives for token owners, transforming them from speculative assets into something more. Early investors have a rare chance to purchase before the anticipated 1,200% price increase, as the presale stage aims to generate $10 million in 60 days. With a 10-year liquidity lock guaranteeing sustainability and confidence, the project's tokenomics are built for long-term stability. Panshibi is designed to last, with a meticulously planned ecosystem that promotes holding rather than short-term trading, in contrast to earlier meme coins that suffered from pump-and-dump scams. Panshibi is resolving a significant adoption issue in the cryptocurrency field in addition to its business approach. For popular consumers, many meme currencies fall short in offering genuine incentives. By combining community-driven incentives with blockchain technology, it guarantees that users will stay involved and profit from the coin's expansion. Why Panshibi Could Be the Best New Meme Coin of 2025 Investors should keep a close eye on Panshibi if they're searching for the best new meme coin. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have already established the path, but Panshibi elevates meme coins by providing useful benefits. The panda crypto 100x potential is supported by a strong plan and is not merely conjecture. Panshibi is well-positioned to draw in a sizable audience because of its innovative integrations, active community, and aspirations to list on significant exchanges. Panshibi is a strong challenger in a market where investors are searching for the next great thing. Is Panshibi the Next Big Meme Coin? The next stage of the evolution of meme coins is represented by Panshibi. Although Shiba Inu updates and Dogecoin news continue to garner media attention, neither project adequately tackles the practical obstacles impeding the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, Panshibidoes. It stands out as a serious contender in the market with its unique combination of AI, Social-Fi, and cutting-edge tokenomics. For investors looking for the next panda crypto 100x potential, this might be a great chance as the presale is already underway and anticipation for its launch is growing.

As meme coins with real-world uses gain traction, Panshibi is emerging as a game-changer by combining entertainment with practical utility. Recognized as the best new meme coin, investors are already keeping a close watch, with whispers of a potential surge in its value. Dogecoin: The Original Still Going Strong First launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) holds the title of the original meme coin and has become a staple in the crypto world. It gained fame thanks to a passionate community, social media buzz, and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Despite facing criticism for its inflationary token model, DOGE thrives, especially in tipping and payments. Dogecoin news often highlights its widespread use, yet it lacks the advanced technology found in newer projects. Questions about its long-term sustainability and ability to compete with modern meme coins that offer more than just clever branding persist. Shiba Inu: Revolutionizing the Meme Coin Concept Shiba Inu (SHIB) took the meme coin concept further by developing an entire ecosystem. Unlike DOGE, SHIB introduced staking features, ShibaSwap, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution. These innovations have allowed it to thrive beyond the initial hype, earning recognition as one of the greatest new meme coin projects in recent years. SHIB proved that meme coins can deliver more than just fun, while Panshibi aims to further revolutionize the market by addressing key issues that hinder widespread cryptocurrency adoption. Panshibi: A Cutting-Edge Meme Coin with 100X Potential Panshibi is more than just another meme coin; it's a revolution in progress. By blending panda crypto 100x potential with practical uses, it bridges the gap between AI-driven innovation, Social-Fi, and meme culture. With robust foundations, Panshibi is an attractive investment for both beginners and experienced traders, unlike DOGE and SHIB, which rely heavily on community hype. To address this, Panshibi offers staking, governance, and exclusive rewards for token holders, transforming them from speculative assets to something more substantial. Early investors have a unique chance to get in before the expected 1,200% price surge, as the presale aims to raise $10 million in 60 days. With a 10-year liquidity lock ensuring sustainability and trust, the project's tokenomics are designed for long-term growth. Panshibi is built to endure, with a carefully structured ecosystem that encourages holding rather than short-term trading, unlike earlier meme coins that fell victim to pump-and-dump schemes. Panshibi not only addresses a significant adoption challenge in the crypto space but also uses its business model to do so. Many meme coins lack real incentives for mainstream users. By merging community-driven incentives with blockchain technology, it ensures users remain engaged and benefit from the coin's growth. Could Panshibi Be the Top Meme Coin of 2025? Investors seeking the Panshibi opportunity should pay close attention to this coin. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way, Panshibi takes meme coins to the next level by offering practical advantages. The panda crypto 100x potential is backed by a solid strategy and is far more than speculation. Panshibi is poised to attract a large audience due to its innovative integrations, vibrant community, and plans to list on major exchanges. Panshibi stands as a strong contender in a market where investors are on the lookout for the next big thing. Is Panshibi the Next Significant Meme Coin? Panshibi represents the next phase in the evolution of meme coins. While updates on Shiba Inu and Dogecoin news continue to capture media attention, neither project adequately addresses the practical challenges hindering mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, Panshibi does. It distinguishes itself as a serious contender in the market with its innovative blend of AI, Social-Fi, and cutting-edge tokenomics. For investors eyeing the next panda crypto 100x potential, this presale offers a promising opportunity, and the excitement for its launch is mounting.

Despite its dominant market position, XRP faces a number of challenges that make a $32 target in this cycle ridiculous. Remittix , an up-and-coming player, is becoming well-known as the next big cryptocurrency due to its innovative approach to financial accessibility and usefulness. Could a rival to XRP outperform Ripple with a whopping 50,000% increase? Ripple Price Prediction: Why XRP Might Not Hit $32 This Cycle For years, Ripple price predictions have mostly been driven by speculation and hope. Despite being a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, XRP's potential for rapid expansion in the current cycle is constrained by several issues. Uncertainties brought about by regulatory obstacles, continuous legal disputes with the SEC, and its centralized structure discourage both institutional and individual investors. The price of XRP has not increased to the extent that some fans anticipate, even though it has seen substantial acceptance in cross-border payments. While the market is shifting its focus from financial speculation to useful cryptocurrencies, the wider macroeconomic environment is also putting pressure on riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, even though discussions about Ripple price prediction still dominate the cryptocurrency industry. Speculative assets like XRP are strongly opposed due to stricter monetary policy and concerns about global inflation. Although it has the technology and partnerships to sustain modest growth, a rise above $35 in the current cycle appears highly improbable. Remittix: Solving Real-World Problems with Crypto While it may seem improbable that Remittix might expand by 50,000%, such spikes have previously occurred for early-stage cryptocurrencies with strong real-world uses. Before becoming widely used and experiencing exponential value gains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, for instance, were very cheap at first. The demand for and value of Remittix may increase dramatically if it is widely adopted and forms strategic alliances. Think about a society in which more than 1.7 billion people lack access to conventional financial services, but many of them can still profit from cryptocurrencies. The unbanked, who frequently reside in underserved or rural areas, are unable to acquire credit, open bank accounts, or use contemporary financial technologies. However, these people might use cryptocurrencies to get around these financial obstacles with Remittix. Through Remittix, users can transfer digital assets straight to a wallet, where they can be withdrawn through Western Union, utilized for regular expenses, or exchanged for cash. People no longer need a bank account to access money and financial services thanks to this straightforward yet revolutionary technique. The anonymity and ownership of your money are what cryptocurrencies were initially intended to provide, and they can circumvent the conventional banking system while still keeping control over their assets. Investors are now concentrating on cryptocurrencies that have practical uses rather than just being speculative. Projects like Remittix , which tackle real financial issues, are becoming more and more popular in the market, even though Ripple price prediction models indicate XRP will have difficulty surpassing specific price thresholds. Fast, inexpensive cross-border transactions are in high demand, particularly in areas with prohibitively high remittance rates. This new coin stands out from other cryptocurrencies because it is capable of satisfying a critical demand in the modern global economy while preserving the fundamental principles of cryptography, which include total control over assets and privacy. As Ripple price prediction analyses indicate that practical use cases are driving investor interest, Remittix positions itself at the forefront of crypto adoption. Unlike traditional banks—often slow, centralized, and subject to restrictions. It ensures decentralization, financial sovereignty, and global accessibility. It’s more than just another digital asset; it’s a bridge between crypto and the real-world economy. Conclusion Regulatory and market factors make it extremely impossible that XRP will reach $32 this cycle, even while discussions about the Ripple price prediction continue. Meanwhile, Remittix is emerging as a real-world solution that is bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. It addresses major adoption issues by providing money to the unbanked and facilitating smooth international transactions.

Despite holding a strong position in the market, XRP encounters several obstacles that render a $32 target for this cycle unrealistic. Remittix , an emerging contender, is gaining traction as a major cryptocurrency player due to its innovative solutions for financial inclusion and practical use. Could this rival to XRP potentially outshine Ripple with an extraordinary 50,000% rise? Ripple Price Forecast: Reasons XRP Might Not Reach $32 This Cycle Over time, predictions about Ripple's price have largely been fueled by speculation and optimism. Even though it plays a substantial role in the crypto sphere, XRP's potential for significant growth this cycle is limited by a variety of problems. Regulatory hurdles, ongoing legal battles with the SEC, and its centralized framework deter both institutional and retail investors. Although XRP has achieved significant traction in cross-border payment systems, its price hasn't surged as much as some supporters hope. As the market shifts focus from speculative trading to cryptocurrencies with tangible benefits, the broader macroeconomic landscape is also weighing on riskier assets like crypto, even though discussions around Ripple's price forecast remain prevalent in the crypto community. Speculative investments such as XRP face strong opposition due to tighter monetary policies and worldwide inflation worries. Despite having the technology and partnerships to enable steady growth, surpassing $35 in this cycle seems highly unlikely. Remittix: Tackling Real-World Challenges with Cryptocurrency While the notion that Remittix might grow by 50,000% seems far-fetched, such dramatic increases have happened before with early-stage cryptocurrencies that offer robust real-world applications. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum were once very affordable before they gained widespread use and saw exponential value growth. If Remittix achieves broad acceptance and establishes key partnerships, its demand and value could soar. Consider a world where over 1.7 billion people lack access to traditional financial services, yet many can still benefit from cryptocurrencies. The unbanked, often living in underserved or remote regions, face challenges in obtaining credit, opening bank accounts, or utilizing modern financial tools. However, through Remittix, these individuals can overcome financial barriers. With Remittix, users can send digital assets directly to a wallet, where they can be withdrawn via Western Union, used for everyday expenses, or converted to cash. This simple yet groundbreaking approach allows people to access funds and financial services without needing a bank account. Cryptocurrencies were originally designed to ensure anonymity and ownership of money, enabling users to bypass the traditional banking system while maintaining control over their assets. Investors are now zeroing in on cryptocurrencies with real-world applications rather than those driven purely by speculation. Projects like Remittix , which address genuine financial challenges, are gaining increasing popularity in the market, even as Ripple's price forecast suggests that XRP may struggle to break certain price barriers. There is high demand for fast, low-cost cross-border transactions, especially in regions where remittance fees are prohibitively high. This new cryptocurrency differentiates itself by meeting a vital demand in today's global economy while maintaining core cryptographic principles such as full asset control and privacy. As Ripple's price forecasts highlight that practical applications are attracting investor interest, Remittix is positioning itself at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption. Unlike traditional banks, which are often slow, centralized, and subject to regulation, Remittix promotes decentralization, financial independence, and global accessibility. It's more than just another digital currency; it's a bridge that connects the crypto world with the real-world economy. Conclusion Given the regulatory and market conditions, it's highly unlikely that XRP will reach $32 this cycle, even as conversations about the Ripple price forecast persist. In the meantime, Remittix is emerging as a practical solution that bridges the gap between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies. It addresses significant adoption challenges by providing financial access to the unbanked and making international transactions seamless.

Get the Latest Cardano Price Updates,https://thecoinrise.com/massive-interest-in-web3bay-as-presale-hits-1m-will-tron-maintain-its-uptrend-get-the-latest-cardano-price-updates/,"The cryptocurrency market is vibrant with projects aiming to excel in their fields. Tron (TRX) is attempting to maintain its momentum following a 145% increase in trading volume, though it struggles to reach the $1 level again. Cardano (ADA), however, is capturing attention with a sharp rise in activity and the upcoming Plomin mainnet hard fork, potentially heralding substantial gains. Web3Bay, however, is making a significant mark, not merely adapting to trends but transforming e-commerce. Having raised over $1 million and sold 285 million tokens at $0.004562 each, Web3Bay transcends a typical investment—it’s pioneering a new way of commerce. Unlike Tron and Cardano, Web3Bay addresses concrete issues like enhancing transparency, reducing fees, and improving data ownership via blockchain. Its expected 6,430% ROI and innovative features such as NFT integration and DAO governance make it an optimal choice for investors aiming to influence the future of commerce. Will Tron Maintain Its Rise and Overcome Major Resistance? Tron (TRX) has seen a remarkable increase in trading volume, up 145% to $1.26 billion in the last 24 hours. This spike in activity comes after a notable decrease earlier in the week, with TRX’s price dropping around 10% to a low of $0.8565. Currently, TRX is priced at $0.921, a 7.03% decrease from the previous day. Technical analysis suggests that TRX needs to break above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $0.985 to hit the $1 mark again. Steady trading volume and positive sentiment may help it achieve this goal. If TRX can hold above $1, it might aim for the $1.16 resistance level next. However, if it cannot maintain its support, prices could fall to $0.76. Explore Cardano’s Price Targets Cardano has experienced a significant boost in trading volume, increasing by 145% to $1.26 billion within the last 24 hours following a major market downturn, which saw prices drop by 10% to $0.8565. Currently, ADA is priced at $0.921 and is aiming for the $1 threshold. For the Cardano price to surpass $1, it needs to overcome the 50-day SMA at $0.985. Maintaining this momentum could see ADA reaching $1.16, with the potential to climb to $1.33. However, if it fails to hold at these levels, the price might decrease to $0.76. With its trading volumes on the rise and the Plomin mainnet hard fork scheduled for January 29, 2025, ADA is at a critical point. Investors should closely monitor Cardano’s movements as it seeks potential gains in a recovering market. Web3Bay’s Recent Hot News: Presale Crossed $1M! Envision a marketplace free from the grip of large corporations that impose hefty fees, collect extensive personal data, and outpace small businesses. Web3Bay steps in as the Amazon of Decentralized Shopping, revolutionizing the sector with blockchain technology.

Key highlight: Web3Bay’s presale has swiftly attracted significant interest, with over $1 million raised and more than 285 million tokens sold at just $0.004562 each.

The platform’s scope extends beyond mere shopping—it aims to redefine global commercial interactions. Wrapping Up While Tron and Cardano offer promising growth with robust trading volumes and technological enhancements, Web3Bay excels with unmatched innovation. Though Tron is aiming for a $1 value and Cardano’s price is poised to regain its peak, neither can rival Web3Bay’s potential to overhaul global commerce.

Concerns over strange trading patterns in Solana and TRON, two of the most well-known blockchain networks, have been raised by massive whale transactions. What if this isn't just another instance of institutional scheming, though? The latest changes, according to some experts, suggest that insiders may have learned of a revolutionary meme coin launch that might yield enormous profits. The new meme coin Panshibi ($SHIBI) has been in the news and is already garnering a lot of interest in its presale. This might be the next major chance for investors to profit because this cryptocurrency has the potential to increase by 10,000%. Shiba Inu Latest News Understanding Shiba Inu's (SHIB) legacy is crucial before delving into Panshibi. As a decentralized meme experiment, SHIB was introduced in 2020 and soon developed a cult-like following, dubbed the ""Dogecoin killer."" The coin experienced increases of almost 1,200,000% at its height, making early adopters instant billionaires. Shiba Inu's strong community and strategic advancements, such as its entry into DeFi, NFTs and the future layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, were key factors in the company's ascent. SHIB has had trouble sustaining the tremendous velocity it previously possessed in spite of these developments. Shiba Inu latest news reports that with meme coin interest surging in 2024, seeing a 500% market cap increase, investors are looking beyond SHIB and Dogecoin for the next big thing. And that’s where Panshibi enters the scene. Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Next Meme Coin to Explode? Panshibi isn’t just another meme coin launch, it’s a cultural phenomenon in the making. Merging three major forces; Asia, pandas and meme culture, Panshibi has created a perfect storm for viral adoption. With the integration of SocialFi and AI-powered features, Panshibi is becoming more than just a speculative asset, in contrast to earlier meme coins that just depended on hype. Holders of tokens can participate in competitive missions, get prizes and even vote on governance to affect the ecosystem's evolution. Holders who stake their $SHIBI tokens can earn annual yields up to 1,200%, far exceeding traditional DeFi opportunities. Also unlike many meme coins that fizzle out, Panshibi ensures long-term sustainability by locking liquidity for 10 years. Currently priced at $0.004, the token price is set to increase over 15 presale stages, culminating in a projected 145,000% post-launch surge. Security remains a top priority. Panshibi’s smart contract has been fully audited by blockchain security firm Coinsult and ownership will be renounced post-presale, ensuring full decentralization. With 60% of the total supply allocated to the presale, this is a rare opportunity to get in early before exchange listings drive up demand. Panshibi will debut on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap, offering global accessibility. Whales seem to be catching on and on-chain activity suggests large-scale transactions flowing into early-stage meme coins. If history has taught us anything, it’s that early adopters of viral tokens reap the biggest rewards. Is Now the Time to Act? Shina Inu latest news shows that meme coins have evolved far beyond their origins, they’re now a major force in crypto market growth. With Solana and TRON whales making significant moves and meme coin adoption at an all-time high, the opportunity for early investors is clear. Panshibi is positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin mania. Combining viral appeal, strong tokenomics and lucrative staking rewards, $SHIBI stands out in a crowded market. The presale is still open, but not for long. With each stage pushing prices higher, waiting could mean missing out on the biggest gains. If 10,000% returns sound appealing, this might be the moment to make a move.

Concerns have arisen over unusual trading patterns involving Solana and TRON, two of the most renowned blockchain networks, due to significant whale transactions. But what if this isn't just typical institutional maneuvering? Some analysts speculate that insiders might have caught wind of a groundbreaking meme coin launch with the potential for substantial gains. The buzz is all about the new meme coin Panshibi ($SHIBI), which is already attracting significant attention during its presale. This could be a golden opportunity for investors, as this cryptocurrency might soar by 10,000%. Latest Updates on Shiba Inu Before diving into Panshibi, it's important to understand the legacy of Shiba Inu (SHIB). Launched in 2020 as a decentralized meme experiment, SHIB quickly gained a cult following, earning the nickname ""Dogecoin killer."" At its peak, the coin surged by nearly 1,200,000%, turning early adopters into billionaires overnight. Shiba Inu's rise was driven by its passionate community and strategic moves, such as venturing into DeFi, NFTs, and the upcoming layer-2 blockchain Shibarium. Despite these efforts, SHIB has struggled to maintain its previous momentum. According to the latest news on Shiba Inu, with renewed interest in meme coins leading to a 500% market cap increase in 2024, investors are scouting beyond SHIB and Dogecoin for the next big sensation. This is where Panshibi comes into play. Panshibi ($SHIBI): Is This the Next Meme Coin to Skyrocket? Panshibi is not just another meme coin launch; it’s poised to become a cultural phenomenon. By combining three powerful elements: Asia, pandas, and meme culture, Panshibi has set the stage for viral success. Unlike previous meme coins relying solely on hype, Panshibi integrates SocialFi and AI-driven features, transforming it into more than just a speculative asset. Token holders can engage in competitive missions, earn rewards, and even participate in governance decisions to shape the ecosystem's future. Staking $SHIBI tokens allows holders to earn annual yields up to 1,200%, far surpassing typical DeFi opportunities. Moreover, unlike many meme coins that eventually lose steam, Panshibi guarantees long-term viability by locking liquidity for a decade. Currently available at $0.004, the token's price is projected to climb through 15 presale stages, culminating in an anticipated 145,000% surge post-launch. Security is of utmost importance. Panshibi’s smart contract has been thoroughly audited by the blockchain security firm Coinsult, and ownership will be relinquished post-presale, ensuring complete decentralization. With 60% of the total supply earmarked for the presale, this is a unique chance to invest early before exchange listings boost demand. Panshibi will be available on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap, ensuring global reach. It seems whales are catching on, as on-chain activity indicates substantial transactions moving into early-stage meme coins. If history is any guide, those who adopt viral tokens early stand to gain the most. Is It the Right Time to Invest?

The strategy entails “investing heavily into AI Agents, as the race for AI continues to gain traction among tech giants and startups in the sector. Other tech giants like Amazon, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI have also expressed their goals of also building agentic AI. Google released three products under the 2.0 suite Late last year, Google granted access to developers and some trusted testers while it also wrapped some features into its products. However, according to the company, this is a “general release.” Now, under this program, the suite of models includes 2.0 Flash, which is said to be a “workhorse model, optimal for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale.” Also included in that suite is the 2.0 Pro Experimental for coding performance as well as the 2.0 Flash Lite, which Google dubs its “most cost-effective model yet.” “Today we’re making te updated Gemini 2.0 Flash generally available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Developers can now build production applications with 2.0 Flash,” Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO, Google DeepMind wrote in blog post. “We’re also releasing an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Pro, our best model yet for coding performance and complex prompts. It is available in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and in the Gemini app for Gemini Advanced users.” Kavukcuoglu. According to a CNBC article , the cost of Gemini Flash to developers is 10 cents per million tokens for text, image and video inputs, while Flash Lite costs 0.75 of a cent for the same. Google consolidating its position on the market Google’s initiative is reportedly part of efforts to stay ahead in the industry as the race for AI supremacy is escalating to another level among the tech giants and startups. Peers, Amazon, Anthropic, Meta and OpenAI have also revealed their intentions to move into agentic AI, or models capable of handling complex tasks on behalf of users. As for Google, the tech giant has been busy for some time now to stay ahead of the competition. The company has over the past year been working towards more agentic models in line with obtaining trends. “Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision,” Google wrote in a December blog post . Google added that Gemini 2.0 has “new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use.” Additionally, the family of models “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.” This comes as there has been intense competition with the Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic being a key contender in the race to build AI agents. In October last year, Anthropic indicated its AI agents could use computers the same way humans do to tackle tasks. According to Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan, the tool can “use computers basically the same way that we do.” Competitors OpenAI recently released a similar feature known as Operator to automate tasks such as planning vacations, filling out forms, making restaurant reservations, and ordering groceries. The ChatGPT make described this as “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you.” Earlier in the week, OpenAI also unveiled Deep Research which allows an AI agent to compile complex research reports as well as analyze questions and topics as per user’s choice, while Google launched a similar tool with a similar name.

Known for his deep ties to crypto and Wall Street, Howard’s new job comes with a lot of moving pieces: the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act, and all regulatory power over tech infrastructure. His confirmation is a massive win for President Trump’s administration, which is pushing to bring crypto innovation back to the US and create a national Bitcoin reserve. Anti-crypto Elizabeth Warren demands answers over Lutnick’s Tether connections Senator Elizabeth Warren wasted no time tearing into Howard’s crypto ties. On January 28, she sent a letter demanding details about how much Cantor Fitzgerald has invested in Tether and whether the firm conducted proper due diligence before getting involved with the stablecoin issuer. She wanted to know if Cantor verified Tether’s compliance with US anti-money laundering laws, sanctions, and “know your customer” (KYC) rules. Warren framed this as a national security threat, telling Howard that: “Your deep entanglements with Tether raise significant questions about your personal judgment and whether you can serve without bias.” Cantor earned tens of millions from managing Tether’s reserves and even bought a minority stake in the company. Plus Howard didn’t list Tether or any other crypto holdings in the financial disclosure form he submitted to the Senate, even though the form detailed his assets worth over $806 million and involvement in 800 legal entities. Warren wanted an explanation for that omission too. Howard had promised to divest from Cantor when confirmed, but Warren and others aren’t buying it. Critics, including watchdog group Accountable.US, were calling for Howard to recuse himself from any crypto-related task forces once he officially takes office. It’s unclear to us if he ever actually did. Ted Cruz says it’s time to reverse Biden’s “lawless” tech policies Senator Ted Cruz, one of Howard’s biggest backers, couldn’t be happier about the confirmation. After the committee vote, Cruz told Broadband Breakfast that he expects Howard to shake up the BEAD program, which was originally designed to expand fiber-optic broadband access across the country. Cruz called the Biden administration’s preference for fiber “wasteful” and said it ignored cheaper, faster options like satellite internet and fixed wireless. “Let’s use satellites, let’s use fixed wireless, let’s use fiber—let’s do it the cheapest, most efficient way we can,” Howard said during his confirmation hearing. Cruz also brought up the CHIPS and Science Act, accusing the Biden administration of attaching “lawless conditions” to the funding. He cited the requirement for semiconductor companies to provide child care as an example, saying it was never part of the bipartisan deal Congress approved. Howard is expected to roll back many of these conditions and refocus the funding on core tech and semiconductor development. Not everyone is on board with Howard’s plans. Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, voted against his confirmation, saying Howard didn’t give strong enough assurances that BEAD and CHIPS funding would continue to flow as intended. “I was looking for a stronger commitment,” Cantwell said. “You didn’t provide it. My vote is ‘no.’” Does Lutnick have any crypto plans? At the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Howard called crypto “the future of financial sovereignty,” making it clear he’s fully on board. He’s also pushing for mandatory audits of stablecoins like Tether. During his confirmation hearing, he proposed that stablecoin issuers should back their tokens with US Treasuries and undergo third-party audits to ensure transparency. But given Tether’s long history of failing to provide a full audit since 2014, enforcing this policy won’t be easy, and we’re betting Howard knows that. The SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, will be working closely with Howard. Their goal is to develop a clear regulatory framework that defines the jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and the CFTC, regulates stablecoin issuers as financial institutions, and explores the “feasibility” of a national Bitcoin reserve.

Here’s What The Charts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-10-target-in-play/,"Dogecoin is still reeling in losses after a crazy 40% decline at the start of the week. Although it has since recovered a bit, Dogecoin is still on a 20% loss in a seven-day timeframe at the time of writing. However, technical analysis suggests that Dogecoin’s bull run might still be in play, and the meme coin could still reach the $10 price target this cycle. This analysis is based on the time taken for Dogecoin to reach new all-time highs and market peaks in the previous cycles. Dogecoin’s Historical Cycles and Price Peaks Dogecoin’s price movements have historically followed well-defined cycles, and multiple analysts have observed a consistent pattern across the cycles. Notably, Dogecoin is now in its third market cycle, and price dynamics in the current cycle have already shown different repetition signs from the two previous cycles. Related Reading: Can The Dogecoin Price Rally For 3 Months Straight? 2021 Bull Market Performance Says Yes According to crypto analyst ÐOGECAPITAL (@DimaPotts36), Dogecoin’s price history has a striking cycle pattern that repeats approximately every 1,442 days. This pattern of 1,442 days is the average time taken for the Dogecoin price to reach its final peak of each cycle when counting from the bear market low. The first cycle, which spanned between 2013 and 2018, saw DOGE rally by 21,821% from its cycle low to its peak. Back then, Dogecoin was trading for a minuscule price around $0.00009, but it eventually surged to break above $0.01 for the first time. At that time, Dogecoin was still regarded as little more than a joke coin, with only speculative trading from early investors driving its price action. The bear market low was recorded at $0.00125, but as the crypto market entered a euphoric bull phase in 2021, Dogecoin became one of the biggest winners of the meme coin craze, as it went on a 54,890% increase from its cycle low. The meme coin craze allowed Dogecoin to gain prominence among retail traders during this period, which eventually pushed its price to the current all-time high of $0.7316. With the third cycle now in motion, crypto analyst ÐOGECAPITAL noted that it might take the same 1,422 days for Dogecoin to reach a new peak. Timeline For New Dogecoin Price Peak Dogecoin’s current market cycle began immediately after its all-time high in 2021, after which the meme coin entered a prolonged bear market. The price low for this cycle was registered sometime in 2022 when Dogecoin corrected to as low as $0.055. Related Reading: Dogecoin Still In Play As Price Gears Up For Another 600% Run Above $2 A repeat of the 1442-day cycle means that Dogecoin will reach its market peak on April 14, 2025. In terms of a price target, the predicted target is around $10, which would translate to an 18,000% increase from the 2022 bear market low. Although this percentage gain is notably smaller than the 54,890% rally seen during Dogecoin’s 2021 cycle, the capital required to create such an increase is significantly higher due to the cryptocurrency’s market cap. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2669 and is up by 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

As of writing, the combined crypto market cap is down 1.56% to $3.16 trillion, proving that headwinds remain. Ethereum Open Interest Turns Bullish As the frontline altcoin, Ethereum’s price has decoupled from that of Bitcoin (BTC). As of writing, the coin was changing hands for $2,789.12, up by 2.21% in 24 hours. In contrast, BTC’s price is still down 1.36% to $96,634. Amid this decoupling, there is evidence of a growing positive sentiment from the Ethereum futures traders. Open Interest data from Coinglass shows this metric is up marginally by 1.33% in 24 hours. With this outlook, a total of 8.57 million ETH, valued at $23.94 billion, has been committed by futures traders. This open in Open Interest might signal the start of a solo ride for ETH price. Amid a positive shift in the future market, the potential for ETH price to reclaim $3000 remains optimal. Having dropped as low as $2,500 in earlier trading, this rebound confirms the proponent’s forecast for a sustained revival. XRP Bears In Spotlight, SUI and AVAX Drags Spot While Ethereum has managed to hold the forte, XRP has continued to nosedive as of writing. Trading for XRP $2,397 has shed more than 5% in 24 hours. For a coin named a candidate to displace ETH, the odds are currently not in its favor. The SUI and Avalanche rivalry has continued to deepen, with the former making moves to overtake the latter in ranking. Currently, both coins are down by 6.66% to 1.72% and changing hands for $3.349 and $25.98, respectively. With this price outlook, SUI is trailing behind AVAX with a $340 million margin, a valuation that is easy to flip. Thus far, in this bull run, SUI has hit multiple all-time highs, while Avalanche has not in over 3 years. On occasions, SUI hovers new ATH , a sign that if bearish conditions thin out, it may overtake AVAX soon. ETH and XRP to Lead Altcoin Rebound As the most capitalized altcoins in the market, Ethereum and XRP are likely positioned to lead the sector’s recovery. Moreover, XRP remains in the spotlight, considering it has more fundamentals that may trigger a positive market reaction when activated. The push for XRP ETF in the United States may fuel a long-term bullish run for the coin. With firms like CoinShars, 21Shares, and Grayscale pushing for the ETF tracking XRP , analysts are convinced the current drawdown is temporary.

Despite reporting a $670 million net loss for Q4, the company, led by CEO Phong Le, shared that they’ve acquired 447,470 bitcoins to date. Strategy said in the earnings report that the recent pause in new Bitcoin purchases has little to do with their commitment to the OG crypto. Le explained the company’s transformation during the earnings announcement, saying, “We are now Strategy—a name that speaks to our global mission. Bitcoin and AI are the two most transformative technologies of the 21st century, and we are leading that charge.” In Q4 alone, Strategy bought 218,887 bitcoins for $20.5 billion, setting a company record for quarterly acquisitions. On August 7, 2024, Strategy executed a 10-for-1 stock split for both Class A and Class B shares, which expanded the pool of potential investors by lowering the entry price. According to the earnings report, Strategy issued over 42.3 million shares of Class A stock between October and December 2024 for $15.1 billion, then 6.5 million more shares were sold between January 1 and February 2 for $2.4 billion. Even after these, Strategy still had $4.3 billion in Class A stock available for future offerings. CFO Andrew Kang said that Strategy’s capital plan is firing on all cylinders. “We’ve raised $20 billion out of our $42 billion target—well ahead of schedule,” he confirmed. The company also launched its first convertible preferred stock offering, backed by both institutional and retail investors. This raised $584 million early in 2025. But that’s not all. In November 2024, Strategy issued $3 billion in 0% Convertible Senior Notes, maturing in 2029. Investors agreed to a conversion price of $672.40 per share, locking in future stock at what they bet will be a bargain. After underwriting fees and commissions, Strategy pocketed $2.97 billion from the issuance. In January, the company introduced another financial tool: Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock. These 7.3 million shares, priced at $80 each, brought in $563.4 million after expenses. They carry an 8% annual dividend and a $100 liquidation preference. Clearly, Strategy knows how to work the capital markets. Strategy’s Bitcoin profits hit $10 billion Strategy’s BTC Yield—the rate of return on their Bitcoin holdings—hit 74.3% in 2024. For 2025, they’ve set a lower target of 15%, likely due to a move toward more measured growth, according to the earnings report. The company also reported a BTC Gain of 140,538 for 2024, with a $10 billion BTC $ Gain target lined up for this year. In line with their long-term mission, Strategy announced they would adopt fair value accounting for Bitcoin starting in 2025. This means quarterly financials will now reflect the real-time market value of their holdings. Bitcoin price fluctuations will directly affect reported earnings, both positively and negatively. The new accounting rule, ASU 2023-08, requires Strategy to apply a $12.745 billion increase to retained earnings as a cumulative adjustment. As of December 31, 2024, Strategy’s digital assets carried a book value of $23.9 billion, based on an average purchase price of $62,503 per bitcoin. But the market value stood at a whopping $41.8 billion, driven by Bitcoin’s $93,390 price at year-end. Convertible notes redemption and share increases Another important decision in Strategy’s restructuring is the redemption of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027. On January 24, Strategy reported that it issued a notice to redeem all $1.05 billion of these notes by February 24. Holders have until February 20 to convert their notes into Class A shares at a rate of 7.0234 shares per $1,000 of principal. That works out to a conversion price of $142.38 per share. If any noteholders choose to convert, Strategy says it will pay cash for fractional shares but issue stock for the bulk of the obligation. In anticipation, Strategy’s shareholders approved amendments to the company’s charter in January 2025. They increased the authorized number of Class A shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and preferred stock authorization also saw a massive jump, from 5 million to 1.005 billion shares, according to the earnings report.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 315,000 followers on the social media platform X that meme token Floki ( FLOKI ) is printing a bullish divergence signal on the daily chart. A bullish divergence is traditionally seen as a bullish reversal signal as it suggests that an asset is gaining momentum even if the price drops lower or moves sideways. Says Bluntz, “There is monster FLOKI bullish divergence printing here after it swept a MAJOR level, could print today or tomorrow. Love it or hate it, the meme meta is probably staging a comeback here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.000098. Looking at fellow memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Bluntz believes that the crypto asset has completed an ABC corrective wave against the US dollar and Bitcoin (DOGE/ BTC ). Bluntz mostly relies on the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a fresh five-wave rally after completing an ABC pullback. According to the analyst, Dogecoin could potentially pull off a 200% surge. “Memes largely out of favor here and getting dunked on big time but with the big dog DOGE looking like this, it may be time. HUGE ABC down on the [daily chart] on the USD and BTC pair. Potential 2-3x coming up.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.264. Bluntz also says he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. Traders use TOTAL3 to gauge the performance of the altcoin market. According to the analyst, TOTAL3 appears to have completed an ABC correction and is now poised to ignite rallies to a fresh all-time high of $1.3 trillion. “This bounce seemingly turning into a full-blown V reversal. TOTAL3 completely reclaimed the breakdown and looks like a… clean ABC. Very hard to not be bullish here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, TOTAL3 is trading at $889.814 billion.

Arctic Pablo Coin is the Next Big Opportunity for New Meme Coins with Exponential Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-pudgy-penguins-early-days-arctic-pablo-coin-is-the-next-big-opportunity-for-new-meme-coins-with-exponential-returns/,"In the world of cryptocurrency, timing is everything. The early adopters of Pudgy Penguins are now sitting on massive gains, while those who dismissed it in its infancy can only look back and wonder, What if? This scenario is all too common in crypto—what seems like a quirky, speculative project at launch often turns into a multimillion-dollar powerhouse. But every missed opportunity paves the way for another, and this time, the Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) presale is turning heads. For those searching for new meme coins with exponential returns, Arctic Pablo Coin presents a golden chance to get in early before it takes off. The Pudgy Penguins Phenomenon: From Underrated to Unstoppable Few could have predicted its meteoric rise when Pudgy Penguins first launched as an NFT project. Initially, the floor price of a Pudgy Penguin NFT was as low as 0.03 ETH in its early days—practically pocket change compared to today’s market. Those who saw the potential and bought in early have since witnessed astonishing returns, as the brand expanded beyond NFTs into merchandise, licensing deals, and a thriving Web3 ecosystem. Pudgy Penguins’ recent token launch, PENGU, cemented its dominance, listing at $0.10 and surging to a multi-billion-dollar market cap. Early believers turned a few hundred dollars into life-changing profits, while those who hesitated missed a golden window of opportunity. Now, history is on the verge of repeating itself—with Arctic Pablo Coin offering a second chance for investors seeking new meme coins with exponential returns. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Presale That’s Capturing Attention For those who regret missing Pudgy Penguins’ early days, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is a can’t-miss opportunity. APC is redefining meme coin presales with its location-based structure, where Arctic Pablo “travels” to different destinations, unlocking new phases instead of traditional pricing stages. The current presale price is $0.000054, with over $950,000 already raised. The project is currently in the Frostburg location, and the launch price is set at $0.008. Early investors have the potential to see a staggering 14,725.93 percent return on investment from the ninth stage to the launch price. These numbers alone put Arctic Pablo Coin among the hottest new meme coins for exponential returns , but the project goes even deeper than just promising numbers. Why Arctic Pablo Coin is More Than Just Hype Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme coin banking on a catchy theme—it comes with built-in incentives, rewards, and a deflationary model that can drive long-term value. High-Yield Staking and Rewards Meme coin projects often rely on hype, but Arctic Pablo Coin offers actual financial incentives for holders. Investors can stake their APC tokens during the meme coin presale and earn an impressive 66 percent APY, making it one of the most rewarding new meme coins for exponential returns. The project also features a referral incentive program where investors can spread the word and earn more APC. Community competitions offer another avenue to win APC or USD, further enhancing the project’s appeal. Deflationary Tokenomics – Weekly Token Burns Scarcity fuels value, and Arctic Pablo Coin has a powerful burn mechanism that ensures supply decreases over time. Unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation weekly during the presale. Any remaining tokens after the presale will also be burned. These burns are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain, ensuring transparency and long-term value growth. With a constantly reducing supply and growing demand, Arctic Pablo Coin aligns perfectly with the new meme coins for exponential returns narrative. How to Get in Before the Price Surges Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin is still at a low entry price, but with the presale progressing rapidly, each new location brings higher pricing tiers. Those who enter at Frostburg are in a prime position to capitalize before Arctic Pablo’s next destination brings another price jump. Looking at the numbers, the upside potential is undeniable. Entering at $0.000054 compared to the launch price of $0.008 presents an opportunity for massive returns. The combination of staking rewards and a deflationary token model ensures increased scarcity and demand, further adding to its investment appeal. For those who missed Pudgy Penguins’ early days, Arctic Pablo Coin is presenting a second chance at exponential meme coin gains—but only for those who act early. Final Thoughts: A New Meme Coin Presale with Unmatched Potential The crypto market has proven time and again that early movers reap the greatest rewards. Pudgy Penguins transformed from an underrated NFT project into a Web3 sensation, leaving those who hesitated in the dust. Now, Arctic Pablo Coin is writing its own success story, with an innovative presale, high staking rewards, and a deflationary structure that makes it one of the most promising new meme coins for exponential returns. Early investors have the chance to see over 14,725.93 percent ROI before launch. Token burns will increase scarcity, driving long-term value. The presale is still at Frostburg—but not for long. For those who missed the last big meme coin boom, Arctic Pablo Coin is the second chance many have been waiting for.

The announcement comes a month after the company gave gamers a look at the Switch 2 new hardware. Among the games revealed in the snippet included Peach and Mario Kart. Nintendo announced the time its Switch 2 Direct would go live worldwide on its platforms. The company revealed that the Switch successor’s Direct would go live on the 2nd of April. Nintendo confirms Switch 2 Direct presentation time and date Nintendo revealed on Wednesday the Nintendo Direct launch will take place on April 2 at 2 pm UK time and 6 am PST. The company is yet to announce further details on how long the event will take and which platforms it will air on. Gamers have presumed the live launch will air simultaneously on the company’s Twitch and Youtube channels. Nintendo commented that the upcoming showcase will offer a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2. Gamers revealed they anticipated the Nintendo Direct, which would provide a closer look at the system’s software, price point, and launch date. They also noted the company could reveal more about the Joy-Con’s rumored mouse functionality. Players identified a C-button on the Joy-Cons in last month’s trailer and anticipate more information about it in the upcoming Direct. Gamers also expect to know more about the games on Switch 2 after the Mario Kart title and Donkey Kong confirmation last month. In the official trailer, Nintendo revealed that Nintendo Switch 2 plays both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games. Nintendo also warned users that certain Switch games may not be supported or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. The gaming company added that more details would be shared on the Nintendo website at a later date. Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa commented that even as the company prepared to launch Switch 2, more original Switch games would be made. However, he insisted on the need for the importance of Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives. Furukawa confirmed that titles such as Pokemon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond would be available for Nintendo Switch in 2025. He added the company aimed to ensure a smooth transition between the two platforms before Switch’s successor launched. Nintendo also announced that Switch 2 would be available to play on April 11 to 13 in London and May 10 to 11 in Melbourne. The company also announced a worldwide, hands-on tour to allow the public to try the new console ahead of the launch. It added that the dates would run from early April, shortly after Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, to early June. Nintendo reveals timelines for Switch 2 hands-on experience Nintendo revealed that players could access the Nintendo Switch 2 experience website to get hands-on experience with the hardware once tickets go live. The company announced the tickets would be made available through a free-to-enter randomly selected draw. Nintendo encouraged gamers to enter the draw at any time during the registration period for a chance to attend. Registrations for the London event were open from January 17 to January 26 at 11:59 UK time. The company also issued limitations, including requiring all ticket holders to possess a Nintendo account and that groups have a Nintendo account linked to the same family group. It added that gamers can register on their own or as a group of six. Nintendo added that gamers must be at least 18 years old to participate in the draw, and if a sixteen-year-old wants to participate, a parent or guardian can create a Nintendo account for a child. After Nintendo’s timeline announcement, EA CEO Andrew Wilson discussed the company’s plans for Switch 2. The CEO named franchises the company expected to find on the new console. He noted that products such as EA Sports FC and Madden had found energy on Switch. He added that he anticipated the products would receive similar interest after the console launches. Wilson added that the console presented a new opportunity for the company, given the success titles such as The Sims and MySims: Cozy Bundle have experienced in the past.

These Bulls represent different investor personalities, adding a whole new level of engagement to the BTFD Coin movement.

Solana, a powerhouse in the blockchain arena, is attracting significant institutional attention. Analysts predict Solana could reach a staggering $600 this year, a testament to its groundbreaking advancements. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is poised to revolutionize e-commerce with its decentralized marketplace, having already secured over $1 million in its presale. This article explores the exciting growth trajectories of these two dynamic platforms and examines why they’re generating so much buzz. Solana’s $600 Target: A Realistic Possibility? Solana (SOL) is experiencing a surge in popularity within the crypto community, fueled by growing institutional interest and remarkable technological breakthroughs. Its cutting-edge features, including the Fire Dancer validator, which boasts an incredible 80,000 transactions per second (TPS), are redefining the boundaries of blockchain scalability and efficiency. This momentum has led to ambitious Solana price predictions, with analysts suggesting the token could reach $600 in 2025. Currently trading at $241.22 as of January 2025, Solana has demonstrated a 4.7% increase in value over the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization of $117.36 billion is supported by a thriving ecosystem of developers and strong institutional backing. Industry giants like VanEck and 21Shares are paving the way with their applications for Solana-based ETFs, further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain solution. Solana’s global Hacker Houses, among other events, underscore its increasing appeal among developers, creating a fertile environment for the development of decentralized applications (dApps). Web3Bay’s $1 Million+ Presale: A Sign of Things to Come? While Solana is pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology, Web3Bay is disrupting the e-commerce sector by integrating blockchain with decentralized governance. Its ongoing presale has already raised over $1 million, with 280 million tokens sold at $0.004562 each. Web3Bay is establishing itself as a true game-changer. The platform eliminates intermediaries, ensuring secure and transparent transactions within a community-driven ecosystem. Web3Bay’s roadmap includes an NFT marketplace, staking rewards, and Layer-2 rollups, guaranteeing scalability for its growing user base. For investors looking for diversified opportunities, Solana’s robust infrastructure and Web3Bay’s disruptive e-commerce platform offer compelling prospects. While Solana price predictions point towards a $600 milestone, Web3Bay offers significant potential for early investors, demonstrating how innovation continues to reshape the crypto landscape. Solana and Web3Bay: A Look Ahead As 2025 progresses, Solana and Web3Bay exemplify the transformative power of blockchain technology across various industries. Solana’s institutional appeal and technological achievements position it as a premier blockchain network, with analysts’ $600 price target highlighting its potential for long-term growth. Web3Bay’s successful presale, which raised over $1 million, and its vision for a decentralized e-commerce platform demonstrate its ability to disrupt traditional markets. With features like NFT integration and staking rewards, Web3Bay offers early investors a chance to be part of something big. For those seeking portfolio diversification, Solana represents a solid infrastructure investment, while Web3Bay offers high-growth potential within a massive, multi-trillion-dollar industry. Both projects embody the spirit of innovation, making them two of the most exciting ventures to watch in 2025 .

Raising $192.5 million with more than 18.3 billion BDAG coins distributed, early participants have seen a 2,380% increase in value. The next phase is crucial. BlockDAG (BDAG) is poised to debut on 10 significant exchanges, potentially sparking another price surge. Cryptocurrencies often experience significant value increases upon being listed on exchanges, as it opens up access to millions of new participants. With BDAG in its final presale phase, those who act now could find themselves well-placed for when the broader market takes notice. Listings improve visibility, enhance liquidity, and often lead to price increases—experiences from past successful presales support this pattern. The opportunity to buy BDAG at the current price is quickly diminishing. The Impressive Presale Success of BlockDAG Indicates Huge Growth Potential BlockDAG’s presale performance has been impressive, vastly surpassing initial projections. Starting at just $0.001, the demand drove prices up, reaching $0.0248, a gain of 2,380%. This rapid price increase demonstrates the strong position early buyers are in. The significant figures—$192.5 million raised from the sale of 18.3 billion coins—underscore the high confidence levels in BlockDAG’s potential. Unlike other presales that often falter, BlockDAG has consistently sold out its batches, reflecting robust demand. These gains set the stage even before BDAG hits the exchanges, with a major development on the horizon. How Exchange Listings Could Transform BDAG’s Market Dynamics The debut of BDAG on 10 major exchanges represents a pivotal shift. It will introduce BDAG to a broader base of participants, significantly enhancing its visibility and trading activity. This exposure is vital—it brings BDAG to potential buyers who missed the presale, thereby boosting its trading volume significantly. Historically, cryptos that start strong in presales see substantial price jumps on exchange debuts. These listings tend to attract a flood of new buyers, quickly surpassing the initial supply and driving up prices. Holders of BDAG from the presale have a distinct advantage—they can leverage the anticipated demand surge without competing in a frenzied market. The Buzz Around BDAG—What Drives the Frenzy? The excitement around crypto often spikes with new exchange listings. These announcements attract everyone from casual traders to influencers and automated trading systems, sparking a rush to purchase that can send prices soaring. Promotions by exchanges, like trading contests and reduced fees, add fuel to the fire, boosting demand even further. This heightened visibility, combined with easier access to the market, typically benefits those who joined early. The presale period is a crucial time to get BDAG at a steady price before market forces start to influence its value significantly. What’s Next for BDAG—Looking Beyond Exchange Listings Listings are just the beginning for BlockDAG, which aims to stand out through genuine technological advancements. Unlike fleeting trends powered by social media buzz, BlockDAG’s technology—based on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure—is designed for fast, scalable transactions, offering an alternative to older systems like those used by Bitcoin or Ethereum. A standout feature is the X1 Miner App , which lets users mine BDAG on their smartphones, growing the network even before it hits exchanges. These strong fundamentals suggest that BDAG is set up for more than just short-term success; it has the potential for sustained growth and utility as more users adopt it. Fasten Your Seatbelts—BDAG’s Big Leap BlockDAG’s crypto presale has already seen gains of 2,380%, but the journey is far from over. With 10 upcoming exchange listings, BDAG is set to reach millions more potential participants who missed the initial sale. Exposure at this scale can lead to a quick uptick in price as demand outstrips the limited presale supply. For now, BDAG can still be purchased at the presale rate, but this window is closing quickly. Once listed, the price will respond to real-time market dynamics. Cryptos that launch under the spotlight typically see rapid price movements. To avoid missing out, securing BDAG now might be wise as the market braces for its public trading debut and the excitement it brings.

However, the market quickly rebounded after President Trump announced negotiations with Canada and Mexico, leading to a sharp recovery across crypto assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Looks Stronger Compared To Altcoins – Demand Remains Strong As Price Consolidates In A Range Despite this rebound, Ethereum remains significantly weaker than other altcoins, raising concerns about how long this underperformance will last. Investors are closely watching price action, as ETH continues to trade at historically low levels relative to Bitcoin and other altcoins. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Ethereum is holding onto a key horizontal support level on the ETHBTC chart. This suggests that ETH could be at a turning point, with a potential opportunity for recovery if bulls step in. However, failure to hold this level could indicate further downside ahead. With Ethereum lagging behind its peers, sentiment remains mixed, and market participants are waiting for a clear confirmation of trend direction. Will ETH finally start catching up, or is another leg down still on the table? The next few weeks will be crucial. Ethereum Faces Uncertainty After Record Liquidations Ethereum has struggled after one of the most brutal liquidation events in crypto history, with over $8 billion wiped out from the market between Sunday night and Monday. ETH was one of the hardest-hit assets, with price action looking weak and uncertain compared to Bitcoin. This has sparked concerns among analysts, who fear Ethereum’s underperformance could continue. However, top analyst Carl Runefelt remains optimistic. He shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Ethereum is holding a crucial horizontal support level on the ETHBTC chart around 0.028. Runefelt believes that if ETH bounces from this level, it could trigger a massive parabolic move, marking the beginning of a long-awaited altseason. Ethereum has lagged behind BTC since late 2021, failing to reclaim its dominance despite multiple market rallies. While Bitcoin continues to flirt with all-time highs, ETH remains far from its previous peak, and many traders are now questioning whether Ethereum can regain its strength. Related Reading: ‘Solana Breakdown Fails’ – Holding $205 Is Crucial To Trigger a Push Higher For now, Ethereum remains at a make-or-break level, with key support holding but pressure building. If ETH manages to surge from this zone, it could lead to a strong recovery and shift market sentiment. However, failure to hold support could mean further downside ahead. Can Bulls Reclaim Momentum? Ethereum is trading at $2,780 after testing two critical moving averages—the 200-day moving average at $2,482 and the 200-day exponential moving average at $2,288. These indicators have been key long-term support levels since July 2020, confirming that Ethereum’s macro trend remains intact despite recent volatility. For Ethereum to reverse the short-term bearish trend, bulls must reclaim the $2,800 mark and hold it as support. This level is a psychological and technical barrier that would signal renewed strength. A push above $3,000 is the next critical step, as breaking this resistance would shift sentiment from bearish to bullish and trigger a move into key supply zones. If Ethereum fails to reclaim these levels, the market could see another wave of selling pressure, pushing ETH back toward lower demand areas. However, historical trends suggest that when ETH holds above these moving averages, it often leads to strong rallies. Related Reading: Solana Retraces TRUMP Meme Pump Gains – But Technicals Suggest A $300 Run Investors are watching closely to see if Ethereum can recover and reestablish its bullish momentum. A breakout above $3,000 would set the stage for a push toward higher resistance levels, potentially leading to a major rally in the coming months.

Investors on the lookout for the best crypto under a penny often find themselves drawn to projects that are innovative and have high growth potential. Among them, Qubetics, Tezos, and Gala have emerged as top contenders, each offering something unique to crypto enthusiasts. In this article, we’ll dive deep into these three coins, exploring what makes them stand out and why they may be the best low-cost cryptos to watch in 2025. Qubetics , in particular, is making waves with its innovative decentralized VPN offering, perfect for businesses, professionals, and everyday users who value privacy and security. With the presale currently in its 20th stage, having raised over $11.9 million, Qubetics has garnered a lot of attention. Not only does the project promise to revolutionize digital finance, but it also integrates seamlessly with the 1inch Network, ensuring traders have optimized access to decentralized exchanges (DEXs). But how do Tezos and Gala compare? Both Tezos and Gala are well-known in the crypto space, with unique use cases and strong communities behind them. Yet, when you compare them to the rising star that is Qubetics, it’s clear that there’s a new player in town that addresses crucial needs, like enhanced privacy, security, and blockchain interoperability. Let’s break down each of these projects and explore what makes Qubetics stand out as a potential game-changer in the crypto space. Qubetics: A New Era in Decentralized Finance with a Decentralized VPN Qubetics is pushing the envelope in decentralized finance with its cutting-edge solution: the Decentralized VPN (dVPN). With the increasing importance of online privacy and security, Qubetics’ dVPN is designed to provide a secure, encrypted, and privacy-focused internet connection, which is perfect for businesses, professionals, and individuals who want to keep their data safe in a digital world filled with cyber threats. What sets Qubetics apart is that its dVPN operates on a decentralized network, ensuring that no central authority has control over users’ data. This approach empowers users to take control of their own online security, eliminating the need to trust third-party service providers. Unlike traditional VPN services that might store logs or share user data with advertisers, Qubetics offers a true privacy solution that protects users while they browse, work, or engage in online transactions. But it’s not just about privacy. Qubetics is also a powerful tool for anyone looking to optimize their cryptocurrency trading experience. Through its partnership with the 1inch Network, Qubetics offers unparalleled access to decentralized exchanges. The integration brings users the best rates, unmatched liquidity, and optimized pricing across hundreds of DEXs. Right now, Qubetics is in the midst of its 20th presale stage, having raised over $11.9 million with more than 461 million tokens sold to 18,400+ holders. The price of $TICS tokens is currently $0.0667, and analysts are predicting substantial ROI once the mainnet launches, with $TICS potentially reaching $15 per token. For anyone looking for the best crypto under a penny with high growth potential, Qubetics is undeniably a standout. Tezos: A Blockchain Built for Smart Contracts and Staking Tezos has long been known as a blockchain that is both highly scalable and secure. It focuses on offering a platform for smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and the ability for stakeholders to participate in the governance process. Unlike many other blockchains, Tezos has a unique self-amending protocol, meaning it can evolve over time without the need for hard forks. One of the biggest draws of Tezos is its staking model. Tezos operates on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, allowing token holders to stake their XTZ tokens and earn rewards. This makes Tezos an attractive option for those interested in generating passive income from their investments. Moreover, because Tezos doesn’t require extensive computational power for mining, it’s considered a more environmentally-friendly alternative to other blockchains like Bitcoin. Despite its impressive technology, Tezos still struggles to break into the mainstream adoption levels that other blockchains have achieved. However, for those in search of the best crypto under a penny that combines staking with the power of smart contracts, Tezos remains a solid choice. Its consistent growth, innovative features, and energy-efficient consensus model make it a noteworthy player in the blockchain space. Gala: Bringing Blockchain to Gaming and Entertainment Gala is a blockchain project focused on revolutionizing the gaming and entertainment industry. Gala’s mission is to give players control over their in-game assets by creating a decentralized gaming ecosystem. Through its platform, players can own, buy, and sell assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), giving them true ownership of their virtual items. What makes Gala unique is its community-driven approach. The project places a strong emphasis on empowering players by giving them a say in the direction of the games being developed. Gala Games has also partnered with various developers to create fun, engaging, and rewarding games that leverage the power of blockchain technology. However, Gala’s focus is somewhat niche, primarily targeting the gaming and entertainment sector. While the gaming world is certainly a booming industry, Gala’s long-term success will depend on the mass adoption of blockchain-based games and NFTs. Despite these challenges, Gala remains a compelling option for anyone interested in the intersection of gaming and blockchain. What Is a Decentralized VPN? How Qubetics Is Paving the Way A Decentralized VPN (dVPN) is a cutting-edge technology designed to enhance online privacy by utilizing a decentralized network of nodes rather than relying on a centralized service provider. This ensures that users’ data is not stored or controlled by a single entity, making it far more secure and private than traditional VPN services. With a dVPN, you can browse the web, access content, and engage in transactions with complete privacy, making it the perfect solution for anyone concerned about data privacy and security. Qubetics is taking the lead with its dVPN solution. By integrating this feature with its overall platform, Qubetics is empowering businesses, professionals, and individuals to navigate the online world with full confidence in their security. Whether you’re trading crypto or working on confidential business projects, Qubetics provides the privacy and freedom that centralized VPN services just can’t offer. Conclusion: As you can see, Qubetics, Tezos, and Gala each bring something unique to the table, but when it comes to the best crypto under a penny, Qubetics stands out as the most innovative and forward-thinking option. With its decentralized VPN, seamless integration with 1inch for decentralized trading, and strong presale performance, Qubetics is shaping the future of digital finance and privacy. For anyone looking to dive into the world of low-cost cryptos with long-term potential, Qubetics is the project to watch. Its innovative technology, growing community, and commitment to solving real-world problems make it a clear contender for future success. Don’t miss out on this opportunity – get involved in the Qubetics presale today and be part of the future of blockchain and decentralized finance!

A Decentralized VPN (dVPN) is an innovative technology designed to offer superior online privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralized servers controlled by a single entity, a dVPN operates on a decentralized network of nodes. Can I make money from staking Tezos tokens? Yes, you can make money from staking Tezos tokens (XTZ). Tezos uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model, which allows users to “stake” their tokens and earn rewards for helping secure the network. Why is Qubetics considered the best crypto under a penny? Qubetics is considered one of the best cryptos under a penny because of its innovative approach to digital finance and online security.

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token.

However, investors are now looking beyond past trends for the next big opportunity. Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain-AI hybrid, is positioning itself as a potential game-changer. With $14 million raised in its presale at a token price of $0.005625, this project has captured the attention of analysts and whales alike, signaling that it could surpass previous market leaders in growth potential. Why Traditional Bull Runs No Longer Define the Market The crypto landscape has evolved dramatically. Early bull runs were driven by speculation, with assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing exponential growth as new technologies were introduced. However, recent trends show a shift in investor sentiment. Instead of chasing purely speculative assets, traders are now prioritizing projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications. Regulatory scrutiny, institutional adoption, and shifting market conditions have also changed how bull runs unfold. While past cycles were fueled by hype, the next wave of winners will likely be projects that solve tangible problems—making innovation-focused tokens like Lightchain AI prime candidates for explosive growth. Lightchain AI – New Standard for Growth Lightchain AI is redefining blockchain technology by integrating artificial intelligence to create scalable and developer-friendly applications. The platform’s ability to provide efficient and secure AI-powered blockchain solutions makes it a standout project in an increasingly competitive market. Unlike traditional cryptos that rely solely on transactional value, Lightchain AI is built for practical, high-performance use cases, ensuring long-term relevance. The success of its presale reflects strong investor confidence. Lightchain AI’s focus on AI-driven decentralized applications and its growing network of early adopters position it as a top contender for massive growth. As institutional interest in AI-powered blockchain projects rises, Lightchain AI is well-poised to capitalize on this momentum. Why Analysts Predict 10x Potential for Lightchain AI The next wave of high-performing cryptos will be those that offer both scalability and innovation—two core strengths of Lightchain AI . Analysts predict that as blockchain adoption expands across industries, projects that seamlessly integrate AI will experience unparalleled demand. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s long-term sustainability model ensures that its ecosystem remains attractive to developers, enterprises, and investors. Its ability to adapt and evolve with emerging AI advancements places it ahead of legacy blockchain projects that struggle with scalability and efficiency. This adaptability is a key factor driving speculation that Lightchain AI could outperform past bull run leaders in the coming years. Also the price prediction is 3$ to 6$ in the next six months and 10$ to 15$ in the next year. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|ZRX,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-06 03:00:00

Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1.5 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory. Investors eager to secure their position in this promising token can do so exclusively at officialmagacoin.com .

Although these two bring most news, Remittix (RTX) is rapidly becoming a rival. RTX is positioned as a major rival in the fight for top crypto rankings with modern blockchain technology and a potent payment system. Can it, however, genuinely challenge Solana and BNB? Allow me to dissect it here. Solana’s Price Is Making a Strong Comeback Solana’s price has been causing waves and showing an amazing comeback. It dipped momentarily to $295 last week, then sank to $270, but it is currently rebounding really powerfully. Analyzers see a positive trend in this comeback that would indicate more gains. Driven by increasing investor optimism and Bitcoin’s climb above $109,000, Solana has jumped about 58% over the past seven days. Solana’s price seems reasonable. It started a positive trend by breaking through a crucial resistance level. Measuring price momentum and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is entering an overbought zone and indicates strong demand. Furthermore, the moving averages for 50 days and 20 days have crossed positively, usually suggesting more price rises. Nowadays, experts are looking at targets of $286 and $317; the $300 level is a significant benchmark. Still, there are certain hazards. The $244 support level is crucial; should Solana’s price fall below it, a more significant adjustment might follow. For now, though, the attitude is still positive and Solana is among the most promising candidates on the crypto scene. BNB Struggles But Could Be Ready for a Rebound While Solana’s price has been climbing, BNB has had more difficulties. BNB lost 2.6% over 24 hours, moving from $700 to $675. Some investors are also uneasy since trading volume dropped by 23.4%. Though there is a temporary drop, BNB is maintaining a constant at about $680; analysts think a rebound is likely. Tracking active trading, BNB’s open interest has slipped below $1 billion. Although this may appear alarming, some analysts believe it may prepare the ground for a price comeback. The main level to keep an eye on is $685; if BNB rises over it, prices can swiftly revert below $700. If it comes below $670, though, investor trust in the crypto market might wain. Forecasts for BNB show further excellent results forward. Strong foundations and growing demand, according to experts, might force BNB’s price to $809 by early 2025. Although brief declines are inevitable, BNB stays in top five among cryptocurrencies. Solana’s price has been more consistent meantime, drawing interest from investors. Should BNB exhibit a similar recovery pattern, it may rebuild strength and keep on its increasing trajectory. Why Remittix Could Overtake Solana and BNB Though Solana and BNB rule the headlines, Remittix (RTX) is quietly turning out to be one of the most interesting new cryptocurrencies. RTX is made to address practical financial issues unlike many other altcoins. To provide quick, cheap cross-border payments, it mixes blockchain technology with conventional banking. This makes it a serious rival to big financial sites like Stripe and Wise. RTX is a link between traditional banking and distributed finance since it supports over forty cryptocurrencies and thirty fiat currencies. Right now, it is at just $0.0539 per token in the presale phase. Already raised over $10.8 million, investors are flooding in. Given RTX’s enormous growth potential, many experts think it’s the greatest coin to purchase right now. RTX distinguishes itself for what? Its sealed liquidity pool, lack of hidden fees, and passing of a smart contract audit guarantee security and openness. Remittix is positioned to seize a sizable chunk of the $190 trillion worldwide payments sector. Following launch, crypto experts estimate a 4,500% price increase and a 50x multiplier during the presale. RTX is still under observation when compared to Solana’s price swings, hence it is the best coin to invest now before the price skyrockets. Remittix is a financial revolution not only another cryptocurrency. Its “PayFi” approach rivals businesses like Coinbase and Wise by combining blockchain innovation with conventional financing. RTX is quite flexible unlike many altcoins that struggle to find useful applications. Although Solana and BNB prices are still high, the emergence of Remittix indicates how changing the crypto industry is. Faster, less expensive, more safe payments are becoming more and more important, and Remittix is filling in just at the right moment.

According to a Reuters report , the VC mentioned that the current policy is restrictive despite cutting rates by 100 basis points in late 2024. The Federal Reserve wants to stay on hold for now and assess the “net effect” of Trump’s policies on immigration, taxes, deregulation, and tariffs before making any further moves. He said, “We can be patient and wait to see the net effect of any policy changes by the current administration.” Earlier, after the FOMC meeting on January 28th, the Fed decided to stick with the 4.25%-4.50% funds rate. In a press release following the meeting, the Fed stated, “The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.

The complaint, submitted to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), claims that Trump may have violated federal laws prohibiting the solicitation of gifts from the public. The TRUMP token, which is primarily owned (80%) by CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, has raised concerns due to its potential to facilitate untraceable foreign payments. Public Citizen argues that Trump’s involvement in the promotion of the meme token could constitute an unlawful gift solicitation, which is prohibited under 18 U.S.C. § 201 and federal regulations (5 C.F.R. § 2635). The complaint brought to attention a January 2024 tweet by Trump promoting the meme token, stating, “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! Get YOUR $TRUMP NOW.” Public Citizen’s legal team points out that although the president can accept gifts, he is prohibited from soliciting them for personal gain. They said that Trump’s tweet, and subsequent promotion through his Truth Social platform, crosses this line by requesting funds for a digital receipt that does not offer a tangible product. The token is reportedly not intended as an investment opportunity, yet experts have criticized it as lacking intrinsic value. “Accordingly, a person sending money for a Trump meme is not purchasing a tangible product. Instead, the person receives only a digital receipt (in a blockchain), which is similar to a donor sending a check and receiving digital confirmation that the check was received,” they wrote. The complaint also raises concerns about potential foreign influence, given the global nature of cryptocurrencies and the difficulty in tracking transactions. Public Citizen is calling for an investigation to ensure that Trump’s actions do not violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which restricts government officials from accepting gifts from foreign entities. The nonprofit urges the DOJ and OGE to assess whether Trump’s promotion of the TRUMP token constitutes an illegal solicitation and to take appropriate action if necessary.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 03:08:01

The presale success, combined with the creative spark of ACT and Moo Deng, ensures there’s plenty to get excited about. This article delves deep into the standout features of these projects, demonstrating why they might just be the next big thing in the meme coin arena. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) BTFD Coin is proving to be the crown jewel in the Best Meme Coin Presale to Buy This Week lineup. Currently in Stage 14 of its presale, BTFD started at an initial price of $0.000004 and now stands at $0.00016 per coin. In a spectacular show of momentum, over $2.5 million was raised within the first two weeks, and the overall tally has now exceeded $5.94 million. More than 69 billion coins have been sold to over 10,300 holders, fueling the excitement for what lies ahead when the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006. Analysts are abuzz with predictions about the future price of BTFD. They foresee tremendous gains fueled by the project’s aggressive presale performance and innovative strategies. Investors who jump on board during Stage 14 stand to reap handsome rewards. For instance, consider an investment of $35,000 at the current price of $0.00016. That investment would snag roughly 218,750,000 tokens. When BTFD finally lists at $0.0006, that stash of tokens could be valued at around $131,250, translating into a substantial profit. This calculation is just one example of the exciting potential that lies in the Best Meme Coin Presale to Buy This Week. Beyond the impressive numbers, BTFD Coin offers an array of features that set it apart. The staking program provides a lucrative 90% APY, giving investors an opportunity to generate passive income simply by holding their tokens.

Moreover, the referral program is designed to spread the word and reward community members for bringing in new investors, fueling organic growth. The Bulls Squad, a passionate community of supporters, is at the heart of the project, actively participating in discussions, promotions, and the overall momentum that propels BTFD forward. The LAUNCH100 Bonus and How to Claim It Now comes a major announcement that’s shaking up the Best Meme Coin Presale to Buy This Week scene. BTFD is making a bold move by leaping directly into Stage 14, and in doing so, is eliminating any unsold tokens from Stage 13 by burning them. This deliberate reduction in supply creates a scarcity effect, which is anticipated to boost demand significantly.

ETH is showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $2,880 resistance. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,650 zone. The price is trading below $2,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $2,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,880 level. Ethereum Price Recovery Gains Pace Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it dropped heavily below $2,500, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH tested the $2,120 zone and recently started a decent upward move. The price was able to surpass the $2,550 and $2,650 resistance levels. It even climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. There was also a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $2,780 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,840 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The first major resistance is near the $2,880 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,920 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,400 swing high to the $2,120 swing low. A clear move above the $2,920 resistance might send the price toward the $3,000 resistance. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,120 resistance zone or even $3,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,840 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,700 level. The first major support sits near the $2,640 zone. A clear move below the $2,640 support might push the price toward the $2,550 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,500. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Two days later, WLFI bolstered its portfolio with an additional 10.81 million TRX, elevating the token to one of WLFI’s top five holdings, surpassing its USDT reserves. Source: https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/worldlibertyfi These strategic moves underscore the deeper collaboration between Justin Sun, founder of TRON, Global Advisor to HTX and Advisor to WBTC, and the Trump family. Sun’s expanding influence now bridges digital assets, politics, economics, and global markets, driven by his visionary strategies and executional prowess. A New Crypto Identity: Justin Sun as WLFI Advisor On November 26, 2024, Sun added another title to his repertoire: Advisor to WLFI. The Trump family hailed his appointment, stating, “Justin’s insights and experience will be instrumental as we continue to innovate and grow.” This followed Sun’s$30 million investment in WLFI, making him its largest investor. By January 19, 2025, his total commitment reached $75 million after an additional $45 million infusion. The Trump family’s growing TRX holdings signal their confidence in TRON DAO’s technological infrastructure and long-term market potential. This partnership exemplifies how crypto-industry leaders and political figures can collaborate to accelerate blockchain adoption, unlocking shared opportunities in the crypto market. Justin Sun’s Crypto Empire As the first cryptocurrency friendly U.S. president, Trump swiftly enacted policies easing digital asset regulations. On January 21, 2025, Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey revealed that Trump’s first 200 executive orders included multiple pro-crypto measures. The following day, Trump authorized the SEC to form a “Crypto Task Force,” led by Commissioner Hester Peirce (“Crypto Mom”), tasked with developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework. With a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Justin Sun’s strategic planning and innovation capabilities will be fully unleashed. As WLFI’s advisor, he will provide the Trump family with market expertise to shape a more robust crypto ecosystem, further solidifying his industry leadership. Mastering the “Trump Effect”: HTX’s Meme Coin Frenzy Donald Trump’s dual role as president and global influencer has birthed the “Trump Effect”—a phenomenon where his endorsements trigger market surges. HTX has adeptly harnessed this momentum. HTX was among the first major exchanges to list the official meme coins of Trump and his wife, Melania Trump ($TRUMP and $MELANIA), upon their launch. Its agility in capitalizing on these trends highlights its market acumen. The exchange amplified investor opportunities through promotional campaigns, including airdrops of TRUMP and WLFI tokens, further energizing the market. Beyond meme coins, HTX anticipated the “Trump Effect” in AI. On January 21, Trump unveiled Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure project partnering SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle. The announcement ignited rallies over the next three days in AI-focused tokens like ARC (+110%), PIPPIN (+121%), GRIFT (+90%), and SWARMS (+60%), all tradable on HTX. HTX has consistently identified high-potential AI assets. Sun’s January 17 tweet, “Trade new cryptos only on HTX!”, underscored this edge. Image sourced from the internet, as of January 22, 2025 The platform’s momentum attracted over 180,000 new users in a single day, a record underscoring its industry dominance. Backed by technical excellence, strategic agility, and brand strength, HTX continues to cement its status as a global blockchain leader. The Chosen One in the Crypto World Despite his monumental success, Sun remains relentlessly focused on advancing crypto adoption. Leveraging TRON DAO’s tech, HTX’s market prowess, and collaboration with the Trump family, he is poised to propel the crypto industry to new heights. “Believe in yourself, you will definitely achieve great results!” Sun tweeted ahead of Trump’s inauguration. While his “great results” remain undefined, Sun’s trajectory suggests a defining role in shaping the future of global finance.

He dropped this bombshell in the part 2 of his tryptic essay series The Genie , where he shredded the fantasy of a federal BTC stockpile as misguided and dangerous. “What can be bought can be sold,” Arthur said , adding that politicians would turn BTC into a political football, destabilizing its price for short-term gains. Arthur also went after Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), calling it an empty spectacle designed to distract voters. “Is D.O.G.E prepared to cut healthcare benefits for seniors and veterans, defense spending, and default on debt interest payments? Will any Republicans win re-election if you do that? All these expenses are growing faster than the economy. Good luck brah!” Arthur said . President Trump is the ‘Genie’ he is referring to by the way. Source: Arthur Hayes Bitcoin strategic reserve is a political weapon in the making The crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis was who first suggested the US government should buy one million Bitcoins to create a digital gold reserve. But Arthur says it wouldn’t benefit BTC or the US economy. He explained that BTC’s value wouldn’t keep rising simply because the government bought it. Once the buying spree ended, so would the bull run. “The price will spike,” Arthur said, “but then it’s over. The government stops buying, and the market collapses.” Arthur also warned that Bitcoin would be weaponized the second it entered government hands. He predicted that: “Fast-forward two to four years. By 2026, the Democrats could ride to victory on voter dissatisfaction that Trump failed to quell inflation, stop any of the forever wars, fix the food supply, drain the swamp, etc. What if they got a veto-proof majority in the House of Representatives? By 2028, what if a Democrat won the election … Gavin Newsom could rise like a phoenix, and little boys would be allowed to chop off their dicks again without parental consent. Huzzah!” If a new president needed funding for social programs, defense budgets, or infrastructure projects, they could liquidate the BTC stockpile. “Just a signature on a piece of paper,” Arthur said. “One million Bitcoins dumped on the market. Panic everywhere.” Arthur also questioned how seriously the US government would take its role as a BTC custodian. Would they run nodes? Sponsor core developers? Or would they treat BTC like a trophy asset and forget about it? “It’s a set-it-and-forget-it exercise,” he said. Politicians would brag about the rising price when it suited them, but the minute things got tough, they’d sell. Arthur then accused the Trump administration of using Bitcoin’s price surges to score political wins, then cashing out when things went south. “Don’t hate the playa, hate the game,” he wrote, pointing out how the BSR could become a campaign donation machine for politicians attending $10,000-a-plate galas. Frankenstein Crypto Bill: The Death of Decentralization Arthur then turned his attention to crypto regulation, tearing into what he called the “Frankenstein crypto bill.” In his view, the current regulatory path wasn’t designed to support builders of decentralized applications. Instead, it catered to major centralized players like Coinbase and BlackRock. “Who benefits from these laws?” Arthur asked. “The ones with the fattest wallets and the best lawyers.” “Is that what the broader crypto community actually desired from the genie? Was this all an exercise to make Brian Armstrong and Larry Fink wealthier? I’m not a hater; they are doing their jobs … maximizing shareholder value by creating a monopolistic structure that uniquely benefits their business. Maybe those readers who are shareholders of Coinbase and Blackrock want a Frankenstein crypto bill. But I believe this type of regulation does nothing to alter the status quo, and while it’s not directly negative to crypto, it ain’t positive either.” The developers building decentralized protocols don’t have the financial resources to lobby for favorable regulations, leaving them out in the cold. Meanwhile, centralized exchanges, brokers, and lenders can afford to hire corporate lawyers charging $2,000 an hour to navigate complex legal frameworks. Arthur’s alternative: Devalue Treasuries and let BTC shine Arthur didn’t just criticize, though, no he actually came strapped with an alternative. He proposed gradually devaluing US Treasuries and shifting to BTC as a global reserve asset. His plan revolved around the crypto-loving Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent progressively buying BTC at prices higher than the market rate. Arthur predicted this would push Bitcoin’s price toward $1.8 million, making it large enough to serve as a legitimate reserve. Under Arthur’s proposal, the US Treasury would issue 100-year zero-coupon bonds and use the profits from rising BTC prices to retire short-term debt. This would help reduce the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio and stabilize the financial system. “The market will front-run the Treasury,” Arthur said, “pushing Bitcoin prices higher and creating arbitrage opportunities for traders. ” The BitMEX founder said, “Holders of treasuries will not be disadvantaged because they know Bessent will use trading profits to purchase off-the-run treasury bonds. This is crucial because it keeps TradFi institutions that use treasuries as collateral and pricing mechanisms for loan solvency.” America’s mining advantage: Cheap energy and ASICs Arthur also pointed out America’s natural advantages in BTC mining. With vast untapped energy reserves in states like Alaska, the US could power mining farms without expensive energy transport. Cold climates would further reduce costs by naturally cooling mining rigs. “When it comes to the production of energy, America has two things going for it. The first is that vast deposits of untapped hydrocarbons are enclosed within the imaginary squiggly lines that humanity calls America. All that is needed is the capital and approvals to drill. The best part about drilling for energy that ultimately will power Bitcoin mining farms is that it doesn’t matter where the energy is located,” said Arthur. On top of that, the US is ramping up domestic semiconductor production, with Taiwan Semiconductor and other foundries building chip plants in Arizona. This would provide a steady supply of mining equipment, giving the US a strategic edge over other countries. “Combine cheap energy, cutting-edge ASICs, and pro-capitalist policies,” Arthur said, “and you have the recipe for dominance.” But there’s a catch. Arthur warned that America’s legal framework still treats BTC like a second-class asset. He called for legislation that protects public blockchains as free speech. “We need a bill that guarantees the right to participate in decentralized networks without government interference,” he said. Social media and stablecoins: The dollar’s digital lifeline Arthur proposed integrating US dollar-backed stablecoins into social media platforms like Facebook and X. He suggested using Tether (USDT) and Ethena’s synthetic USDe for digital transactions globally. This would make it nearly impossible for countries to de-dollarize without facing massive public backlash. If executed correctly, Arthur said, the US could embed the dollar into global commerce while gradually shifting reserves into Bitcoin. “Let the people use digital dollars,” he said, “but let the government hold Bitcoin as the ultimate reserve.” Arthur closed with a warning: “If you’re waiting for politicians to save crypto, you’re screwed.” He urged builders to fight for better regulations and real understanding of the tech behind crypto and to stop relying on political favors. His advice was: “There is hope, get off your ass if you are an American crypto hodler and let your elected representative know you will not stand for politics as usual. Send them an email, write them a letter, or visit their local office. If you think a BTC Strategic Reserve is necessary, raise fucking hell right now, don’t just like a comment on X.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-06 03:25:46

In an interview with CNBC, Alderoty expressed his satisfaction with the changes brought about by the new administration. He explained that the previous administration had essentially waged a “war” on crypto, pushing the industry out of the U.S. in favor of restrictive policies. However, since the inauguration, Alderoty praised the new administration for embracing cryptocurrency and clearing obstacles that had been stifling innovation. Ripple’s Onshore Hiring Surge Amid SEC Case Alderoty revealed that Ripple, which has been based in the U.S. for over 12 years, is benefiting from these shifts. He said that following the election, 75% of Ripple’s hiring efforts, which were previously offshore, are now being brought back onshore in the U.S. The company is eager to build and expand its operations domestically, with the belief that the U.S. can once again become the global leader in cryptocurrency technology. These changes come amid the ongoing SEC case, which has been dragging on for four years. The updates have left many wondering if the case might be coming to an end soon. Ripple’s Response to U.S. Crypto Reform When discussing U.S. crypto reform, Alderoty outlined three major forces shaping the landscape: President Trump’s executive order, changes in federal regulation, and legislative action from Congress. He stressed the importance of the executive order, which reaffirms the U.S.’s goal of becoming the “crypto capital of the world.” The order has sparked a series of positive regulatory developments, including the appointment of David Sachs as the “crypto czar,” who is leading a task force to review and update crypto regulations. Additionally, Alderoty praised the actions of the SEC’s acting chair, Mark Uyeda, who recently acknowledged the regulatory confusion of the past few years. Alderoty is optimistic that these changes will make it easier for banks to engage with crypto, further positioning the U.S. as a favorable environment for crypto innovation.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|ALTCOIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 03:26:47

Standard Chartered Exec Predicts Massive Surge By 2028",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-500000-standard-chartered-exec-predicts-massive-surge-by-2028/,"In a recent client note, Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could surge to $500,000 by the end of 2028. The executive attributed BTC’s potential extraordinary price rise to two major factors. Factors Propelling BTC Price While 2024 was a landmark year for the world’s largest cryptocurrency – seeing it reach multiple all-time highs (ATH) and surpass $100,000 for the first time – 2025 has seen more moderate price action. Since January 1, BTC has climbed from around $94,000 to $98,486 as of February 5. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid NASDAQ Decline, Analyst Calls It ‘Extremely Bullish’ However, Kendrick believes that from the latter half of 2025 through 2028, Bitcoin could enter another parabolic growth phase. He forecasts BTC reaching $200,000 by the end of 2025, $300,000 by the end of 2026, $400,000 by the end of 2027, and ultimately $500,000 by the end of 2028. Kendrick attributes this ambitious price trajectory to two key factors: improved investor access and decreasing volatility. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 significantly simplified investor access to BTC. Additionally, as Bitcoin’s price and market capitalization grow, its volatility has been decreasing. A larger market cap makes it more difficult for any single trader or entity to manipulate BTC’s price. Kendrick expects this trend to continue as ETF markets mature and supporting financial infrastructure within the crypto market strengthens. Kendrick added: The ETFs have attracted a net $39 billion of inflows so far, supporting the theory of pent-up demand being unleashed by increased access. Donald Trump’s January 23 order that the administration evaluate a potential national digital assets stockpile is also important, as this could encourage other central banks to consider Bitcoin investments. If Trump’s administration moves forward with establishing a national digital assets reserve, Bitcoin’s volatility could decline even further. This could attract traditionally risk-averse investors who were previously hesitant due to BTC’s price swings. Bitcoin Price Forecasts Have Bullish Undertones Over the past few days, BTC has faced increased volatility, briefly plummeting to $91,000 amid concerns over US trade tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. However, analysts remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Withstands DeepSeek Dip And FOMC Volatility – How Close Is A New ATH? For instance, seasoned crypto trader Alex Becker recently stated that a $150,000 price target for BTC is too conservative. Likewise, a report by CryptoQuant predicts BTC could reach anywhere between $145,000 and $249,000 under a Trump administration. On-chain data also suggests that Bitcoin ‘whales’ – investors controlling crypto wallets with large BTC holdings – are positioning themselves for a bullish price trajectory, signaling confidence in BTC’s long-term growth under the Trump regime. At press time, BTC trades at $98,486, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

Therefore, the Consumer advocacy group is calling for a federal investigation into the matter. Per a letter sent to John Keller, Chief of the US Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section, and David Huitema, Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), Public Citizen accused Trump of violating legal restrictions on soliciting gifts while serving as president. The organization urged officials to probe into the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin and whether foreign state actors may be involved in purchasing the token. Trump’s meme coin promotion raises legal questions over gift solicitation A 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service explains that while the President is exempt from many restrictions on receiving gifts, he cannot solicit or coerce gifts from sources nor accept gifts in return for official acts. The report clarifies that the President may accept gifts from the general public, even from prohibited sources, as long as these conditions are not violated. Just days before taking the oath of office on January 20, Trump announced to his more than 8 million followers on TruthSocial that he was releasing his own crypto meme coin. The token, called Trump, featured an image of him captured shortly after a failed assassination attempt last year: In it, he’s raising his right fist and looking defiant. Shortly after that, his wife, Melania, released her own token. Public Citizen has alleged that Trump violated federal laws by continuing to use his social media platform, Truth Social, to encourage his followers to purchase the meme coin after assuming the presidency: “It appears Trump is not soliciting money in exchange for an investment or tangible product but soliciting money in exchange for nothing — that is, asking for a gift that will benefit him personally.” – Public Citizen Legal and ethical uncertainty looms over Trump’s meme coin investigation Pam Bondi currently leads the Justice Department, having been appointed as U.S. Attorney General by former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, former President Joe Biden nominated David Huitema to head the Office of Government Ethics. The investigation into the meme coin is still ongoing, and there is no known outcome after a 2024 US Supreme Court decision that gives the president almost immunity from prosecution of official acts. This ruling implies that if the Justice Department concludes that Trump has violated the law, he can do the same again without fear of prosecution. But then, if the meme coin promotion is ruled to have been an unofficial act during his time in office, there could be legal consequences. Bartlett Naylor, Public Citizen’s Financial Policy Advocate, said the meme website has no link to any government office. He also noted that the organization is looking at possible legal ways of suing since there is almost no hope that the Department of Justice or the Office of Government Ethics will act independently. Public Citizen called for measures such as halting the meme sale and refunding all individuals who purchased the TRUMP coin. Following its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP’s market capitalization surged past $15 billion within 48 hours but has since dropped to approximately $3.7 billion at the time of publication. Several US lawmakers and industry insiders have raised concerns that the US president could still orchestrate a rug pull, as the token’s team retains control over 80% of the total supply.

The price is showing a few bearish signs below the $2.60 level. XRP price started a strong upward move above the $2.50 level. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.60 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.60 resistance zone. XRP Price Recovery Could Soon Fade XRP price started a recovery wave above the $2.00 support zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price gained pace for a move above the $2.20 and $2.45 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the $2.60 level. However, the bears remained active near the $2.75 level. A high was formed at $2.780 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $2.60 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1.750 swing low to the $2.780 high. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The first major resistance is near the $2.70 level. The next resistance is $2.780. A clear move above the $2.780 resistance might send the price toward the $2.940 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.000 resistance or even $3.050 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.60 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.260 level or the Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $1.750 swing low to the $2.780 high. The next major support is near the $2.150 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.150 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

This marks a substantial decline from its all-time high (ATH) of $0.731, reached in May 2021, putting it currently 64% below that peak. Despite this downturn, many analysts remain optimistic about the market’s largest memecoin potential for recovery, suggesting that the Dogecoin price could see new highs as the bullish cycle progresses. Dogecoin Price May Reach Next Peak Around April For instance, crypto analyst Dima Potts took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share his insights on the movements of the Dogecoin price. Potts indicated that the anticipated pullback has finally occurred and, assuming this pullback stabilizes, the market could be poised to target all-time highs ranging between $1.50 and $2.10. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovers To $2,800 As Exchange Outflows Near $1 Billion Nonetheless, Potts emphasized that this Dogecoin price range might act as a significant resistance level for the memecoin, similar to patterns seen in prior market cycles. In a more detailed analysis, Potts noted a historical correlation in the Dogecoin price cycles. He pointed out that the first cycle peaked 1,442 days after its initial high, experiencing a staggering increase of 21,821% from its low point. The second cycle followed suit, reaching its peak another 1,442 days later, but with an even more dramatic rise of 54,890%. With the cryptocurrency now in its third cycle, Potts speculates that if historical patterns hold true, the Dogecoin price could reach its next peak around the week of April 14th. Analyst Envisions A 154,400% Surge For DOGE Potts is not alone in his bullish outlook. He posited that growing adoption, increasing institutional interest, and ongoing technological improvements could bolster the Dogecoin price performance, potentially allowing it to exceed previous highs. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Wins No Matter The Outcome Of Trump’s Trade War His analysis suggests that the memecoin could even reach unprecedented levels above $400 per token, translating to a massive surge of 154,400% in the coming months. However, not all analysts share this optimistic perspective. Technical analyst Grumlin has issued a cautionary note, predicting that the Dogecoin price may dip to the $0.02 level in the near term. This would mean a notable 92% crash for the memecoin Despite this short-term bearish outlook, Grumlin believes that a rebound from an ascending support line is likely, which could set the stage for a subsequent upward breakout. Currently, the memecoin is trading at $0.259, with losses of 21% and 27% on the seven-day and fourteen-day time frames, respectively. It remains to be seen which side will break first and how investors will react to each scenario.

The price hit a low of $2.36 in the last 24 hours and is now eyeing to break above the $2.50 and $2.70 levels. These levels have provided strong support for XRP’s price in the past. On February 3, XRP hit the $1.95 levels. However, it has now bounced back and has recovered. In the last seven days, XRP has declined by more than 22%. Understanding The Microstructure On a smaller time frame, XRP’s price movement since February 3rd shows a potential impulsive move upward. Although the typical five-wave pattern isn’t clearly visible, this could be due to the rapid sell-off followed by a quick recovery. The microstructure analysis remains uncertain, but key support levels between $1.95 and $2.35 are critical to watch. Source: CoinMarketCap If the price breaks below $1.95, a downward trend may occur. However, if the price breaks above the trendline and $2.57, it would signal a possible recovery towards the $3.40 breakout point. However, caution is advised as rapid downside moves are also possible, typical of third waves in trends. Important Support Level To Watch: The XRP chart continues to show a bullish structure, as long as the price holds above the $1.20 level. This key support has recently been tested, following a sharp sell-off in the altcoin sector, which often results in quick price movements. If XRP remains above this $1.20 threshold, the next targets for upside price action could be around the $4.20, $5, and $6.60 levels.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 04:51:38

With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1.5 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.260 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.270 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2850 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.3415 swing high to the $0.20 low. A close above the $0.2850 resistance might send the price toward the $0.300 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.320 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.3420. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.270 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2420 level. The next major support is near the $0.2250 level. The main support sits at $0.220.

This department handles the agency’s computer systems. The decision, reported by The Wall Street Journal on February 5, comes after Tenreiro was heavily involved in leading six high-profile lawsuits, particularly in the cryptocurrency space, against major firms such as Ripple, Coinbase, and Tron. Tenreiro was one of the SEC executives who approved the appeal against Ripple. The notice of appeal, filed on October 2, 2024, challenged the court’s ruling by Judge Torres. Background on Tenreiro’s SEC Role Tenreiro, who was promoted to head the SEC’s litigation efforts late last year, had previously been with the SEC’s crypto assets and cyber unit. He joined the unit in October 2022 as deputy chief and became acting chief in June 2023. Under the leadership of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Tenreiro played a pivotal role in overseeing enforcement actions targeting prominent cryptocurrency firms. The reassignment to the IT department has raised eyebrows in the crypto community, especially since Tenreiro’s actions and statements regarding the crypto sector have been met with increasing criticism. He was involved in aggressive enforcement against crypto-related companies, making him a central figure in the ongoing regulatory battle between the SEC and the industry. A Shift in SEC’s Crypto Enforcement Strategy? This change in Tenreiro’s position comes amidst growing speculation that the SEC may be reassessing its approach to crypto regulation. Many in the industry have voiced concerns over the SEC’s aggressive stance, which some critics have labeled as overreach. Ripple’s General Counsel, Stuart Alderoty, responded to the news humorously on Twitter and wrote, “Sources say Jorge Tenreiro has been reassigned to Macrodata Refinement.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 05:13:47

With uncertainty surrounding SEC leadership and a notable change in its stance on crypto cases, speculation is rising on whether the lawsuit could be dismissed or settled soon. However, since Donald Trump’s election win , speculation over the dismissal of the Ripple Vs SEC case has surfaced, but no actions have been taken. SEC’s Shift in Coinbase Case Sparks Speculation Pro-XRP lawyer James Murphy, known as MetaLawMan, pointed out the SEC’s decision not to oppose Coinbase’s motion for an interlocutory appeal—a stark contrast to its previous stance under Chair Gary Gensler. He suggests that if the 2nd Circuit accepts the appeal, the SEC may settle or drop the case before taking a firm legal position on whether crypto assets traded on secondary exchanges qualify as investment contracts. SEC Pivots On @Coinbase Case The SEC has not filed any opposition to @Coinbase 's motion to proceed with its interlocutory appeal at the 2nd Circuit. Under Gensler, the SEC did oppose Coinbase's request to certify the interlocutory appeal at the district court level. Assuming… https://t.co/vOnDGWFsCP — MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) February 4, 2025 Moreover, this sudden shift and pro-crypto administration has fueled expectations that Ripple’s lawsuit might follow a similar path. Observers believe that if the SEC is softening its approach, a dismissal or settlement could be on the table. Trump’s meeting with Ripple CEO before his inauguration is a signal that Ripple’s worse days are over, Ripple’s political donations are also seen as a master card to settle the case. Will the SEC Start Dropping Crypto Cases? A crucial factor in this equation is the SEC’s leadership. Murphy noted that with no Senate-confirmed chair currently in place, a new appointment—expected around March or April—could influence the agency’s decisions on pending crypto lawsuits. He also mentioned Paul Atkins as a potential nominee under the Trump administration, describing him as a less controversial choice. However, Murphy also pointed out that SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda currently hold the votes to take action on cases, meaning that decisions could still move forward before a new chair takes office. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: SEC Judge Who Signed Off on Ripple Case Appeal Moves to IT Department , What’s Next for the Ripple Lawsuit? Reports of the SEC removing the Ripple lawsuit from its website sparked rumors of a settlement, but attorney Sherrie clarified that the case is now listed under the Court of Appeals due to its new case number. Ripple is set to submit its appeal-related brief by April 16, with attorney Jeremy Hogan speculating that the SEC could drop the case around April or May—aligning with the expected leadership change. While some believe the SEC’s Coinbase shift indicates a similar approach for Ripple, others argue that an acting chair is unlikely to make a major decision like dropping the lawsuit. For now, the case is still progressing, but all eyes are on April as a potential turning point in this high-profile legal battle. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Companies like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and Rumble have also adopted Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, inspired by MicroStrategy’s approach. Meanwhile, BlackRock is expanding its Bitcoin investment offerings by launching a Bitcoin ETP in Europe after the massive success of its IBIT ETF in the US. The South Korean Financial Investment Association (KOFIA) is also pushing for crypto ETF approval because of strong investor demand. MicroStrategy Rebrands to Strategy MicroStrategy officially rebranded to ”Strategy” and adopted a Bitcoin-themed visual marketing approach. The announcement was made on Feb. 5, and essentially confirms that the company will continue its focus on business intelligence software while maintaining its aggressive Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy. More details about the rebrand are expected during the company's earnings call later in the day. The company was co-founded by Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, and it has played a crucial role in popularizing Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Data from SaylorTracker reveals that Strategy currently holds about 471,107 BTC that is valued at over $45.6 billion. As a result of this, it is ranked as the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Inspired by its success, other publicly traded companies followed suit by diversifying their treasury reserves with Bitcoin as well. MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: SaylorTracker ) Metaplanet , a Japanese investment firm focused on Web3 initiatives, adopted a Bitcoin treasury reserve strategy in April of 2024. The company’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, outlined an ambitious goal of increasing its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC by 2025. Similarly, Semler Scientific implemented a corporate Bitcoin reserve strategy in 2024, which led to a 30% surge in its share price after the announcement. During the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, executives from both Semler Scientific and Metaplanet acknowledged that their companies were struggling financially before adopting Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategy. Michael Saylor frequently points out some of the challenges faced by zombie companies, which are firms that remain operational but lack the financial flexibility to invest in growth. He believes that Bitcoin can provide these companies with a more robust financial foundation. The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is still growing as Rumble , a video streaming platform known for its free speech, also recently announced a plan to allocate $20 million to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Rumble made its first Bitcoin purchase in January 2025, just before the inauguration of President Donald Trump in the United States. BlackRock Takes Bitcoin ETP to Europe BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe, according to a Feb. 5 report by Bloomberg . This follows the huge success of BlackRock’s US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), which accumulated more than $57 billion in net assets since its launch in January of 2024. Overall, IBIT has become the most popular spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. A Bitcoin ETF is a regulated investment vehicle that tracks the price of Bitcoin, and it allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly buying, storing, or managing it. These ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges and make Bitcoin a lot more accessible to institutional and retail investors in regulated financial markets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, like BlackRock’s IBIT, directly hold Bitcoin, providing investors with a way to invest in Bitcoin without dealing with crypto exchanges or wallets. Key facts about IBIT (Source: BlackRock ) The new European Bitcoin ETP will reportedly be domiciled in Switzerland, and BlackRock is expected to begin marketing the fund as early as this month. This will be BlackRock’s first Bitcoin ETP offering outside of North America, which is an exciting milestone for people looking for crypto product offerings globally. Building on the momentum of IBIT, BlackRock already took some steps toward international expansion. In January, the company launched a Bitcoin ETF on the Cboe Canada exchange, that gives Canadian investors access to BlackRock’s flagship US spot Bitcoin fund. The broader market for US Bitcoin ETFs saw an influx of over $35 billion in net inflows throughout 2024, averaging approximately $144 million in inflows per trading day. In November, total net assets in US Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $100 billion for the first time due to the growing investor interest in regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles. Crypto analysts at Steno Research predict that Bitcoin ETFs could attract another $48 billion in net inflows in 2025. Investment bank JPMorgan also pointed out in a December report that Bitcoin has become a more major structural component of investors' portfolios, particularly as a hedge against geopolitical risk and inflation. The surge in institutional inflows could lead to a positive demand shock for Bitcoin, and could potentially drive its price up quite a bit higher in 2025, according to asset manager Sygnum Bank . South Korea Pushes for Crypto ETF Approval South Korea’s Financial Investment Association (KOFIA) recently announced its plan to push for the approval of cryptocurrency ETFs in the domestic stock market this year, according to local reports . KOFIA chief Seo Yoo-seok stated during a Feb. 5 news conference that while investor interest in cryptocurrencies is growing, particularly among those over 50, direct exposure to digital assets carries certain risks. Instead, regulated financial products like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could provide a much safer alternative for investors who are looking for exposure to the crypto market. This move is happening during shifting global dynamics and increased crypto adoption after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. South Korea has seen a 450% increase in new crypto exchange registrations, and almost half of the applicants are aged 40 and above. However, the country’s Financial Services Commission does not currently recognize cryptocurrencies as underlying assets for securities under the Capital Markets Act, which limits the ability to introduce crypto-backed ETF. KOFIA Chief Seo Yoo-seok’s statement In October of 2024, South Korea launched a virtual asset committee to review regulations on corporate crypto accounts and the potential introduction of crypto ETFs. The latest committee meeting indicated that reviews on corporate trading accounts were nearing completion, signaling potential regulatory shifts. South Korea is still one of the most active cryptocurrency markets globally, and its local currency even surpassed the US dollar as the most traded fiat against cryptocurrencies in early 2024. Despite this robust activity, institutional involvement remains very limited due to strict Anti-Money Laundering requirements. Exchanges have to establish official partnerships with local banks to provide crypto-to-fiat services, and investors are also required to open real-name accounts linked to their legal identity. These regulations effectively restricted corporations and institutions from directly trading cryptocurrencies. In fact, since the requirements were introduced in 2018, only five exchanges in South Korea have successfully established banking partnerships in the nation’s highly regulated crypto environment.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-06 05:27:15

The SEC has reassigned key personnel involved in crypto-related litigation, while the CFTC is moving away from its previous approach of “regulation by enforcement” to focus more directly on fraud cases. These adjustments come as the regulatory landscape for digital assets continues to evolve, influenced in part by the Trump administration’s push for a more structured and business-friendly approach to crypto oversight. SEC Shakes Up Leadership as Crypto Enforcement Retreats: Key Litigator Moved to IT Department The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly reassigned its chief litigation counsel, Jorge Tenreiro, from overseeing enforcement lawsuits to the agency’s IT department. This shift, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Feb. 5, is part of a broader scaling back of the SEC’s aggressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation. The SEC’s decision to transfer Tenreiro—who was instrumental in high-profile enforcement cases against major crypto firms such as Coinbase, Ripple, and Tron—follows a recent wave of internal shake-ups. The agency also reassigned Natasha Guinan, a senior lawyer in the chief accountant’s office who was a key architect behind the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121). While Tenreiro’s new role is confirmed, Guinan’s reassignment details remain undisclosed. The latest personnel changes add to a growing trend of the SEC easing its crypto enforcement efforts. Just a day before news of Tenreiro’s reassignment broke, The New York Times reported that the SEC had begun scaling back its 50-member crypto enforcement unit, including moving at least one senior lawyer out of the division. It remains unclear whether Tenreiro was the individual referenced in the report. The SEC’s enforcement approach under Chair Gary Gensler had been one of the most aggressive in the agency’s history regarding cryptocurrency. Gensler’s tenure saw numerous lawsuits targeting leading crypto firms, with Tenreiro playing a key role in the legal battles against industry giants. Trump, who previously vowed to end the SEC’s crackdown on the crypto industry, recently signed an executive order on Jan. 23 establishing a crypto working group aimed at developing a clearer legal framework for digital assets. This political shift, combined with the reassignment of key personnel, suggests a pivot in the SEC’s approach toward crypto oversight. Tenreiro’s reassignment is particularly significant given his deep involvement in some of the most notable crypto-related enforcement actions. After joining the SEC’s crypto assets and cyber unit as deputy chief in October 2022, he later assumed the role of acting chief in June 2023 following the departure of David Hirsch. Under his leadership, the SEC pursued lawsuits against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon, among other cases. However, the SEC’s crypto enforcement landscape has been shifting rapidly. With Trump’s executive order signaling a new regulatory direction and the appointment of acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda—who revoked the SAB 121 rule—there is growing speculation that the agency may move toward a more lenient approach to crypto regulation. One major indicator of this shift is the SEC’s recent discussions on potential retroactive relief for certain token offerings. This initiative, spearheaded by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her crypto-friendly stance, aims to reduce regulatory pressure on the digital asset industry. Uyeda’s decision to task Peirce with leading a crypto task force to develop a comprehensive framework further reinforces the likelihood of a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto firms. Political and Industry Reactions The SEC’s internal restructuring has sparked varied reactions across the crypto industry and political circles. Some view the changes as long overdue, arguing that the SEC’s aggressive stance under Gensler hindered innovation and forced US-based crypto businesses to relocate to more favorable jurisdictions. Others worry that a sudden rollback of regulatory oversight could create uncertainty in the market, potentially exposing investors to greater risks. While the SEC has yet to comment on Tenreiro’s reassignment, and both Tenreiro and Guinan have not responded to requests for statements, the move has undoubtedly raised questions about the agency’s future direction. With the Trump administration promising to rein in regulatory crackdowns, crypto industry players are closely watching how the SEC’s stance will evolve in the coming months. The SEC’s enforcement pivot marks a new chapter in the ongoing battle between regulators and the crypto industry. With a more industry-friendly approach gaining traction, firms that once feared regulatory scrutiny may soon find themselves operating under a more lenient and predictable framework. As the regulatory landscape continues to shift, all eyes are on how the SEC will navigate the balance between investor protection and fostering innovation in the crypto space. While the recent shake-ups suggest a retreat from aggressive enforcement, the long-term impact of these changes remains to be seen. For now, one thing is clear: the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency is undergoing a fundamental transformation, and the industry is watching closely. CFTC to End Regulation by Enforcement, Signaling Shift in Crypto Oversight Under Trump Administration In related news, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is set to dramatically alter its regulatory approach, with Acting Chair Caroline Pham announcing a rollback of its controversial “regulation by enforcement” practice. This move, announced on Feb. 4, is expected to have a profound impact on the CFTC’s handling of cryptocurrency firms, particularly as the Trump administration pushes for a more business-friendly regulatory environment. The shift represents one of Pham’s first major policy moves since taking over as the CFTC’s acting chair on Jan. 20, following the resignation of former Chair Rostin Behnam. The restructuring aims to refocus the agency’s enforcement priorities, moving away from broad punitive actions and instead concentrating on clear instances of fraud. Pham’s directive calls for a restructuring of the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement into two specialized task forces. One will focus on retail fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, while the other will target complex fraud and manipulation in financial markets. “This task force realignment will enhance our vigorous and energetic enforcement program by empowering our talented staff to focus their expertise on matters that secure justice for victims and uphold public confidence in the integrity of our markets,” said Brian Young, the acting enforcement director at the CFTC. By narrowing the agency’s focus, Pham hopes to move away from an enforcement-first approach that many in the crypto industry have criticized as inconsistent and overly aggressive. The CFTC has historically played a critical role in regulating cryptocurrency markets, often working alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee digital asset firms. In recent years, the commission has initiated enforcement actions against some of the industry’s most prominent figures, including: FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried: The now-defunct exchange was at the center of a $17 billion enforcement wave in fiscal year 2024. Binance and Changpeng Zhao: The CFTC sued Binance and its former CEO CZ for allegedly operating an unregistered exchange and violating U.S. financial laws. Voyager and Celsius Executives: Former Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich and Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky were also targeted in regulatory actions. With Pham’s directive, the CFTC appears to be stepping away from targeting crypto firms en masse and instead focusing on clear-cut cases of fraud. This could bring relief to the industry, which has long argued that the lack of a clear regulatory framework in the US has forced digital asset businesses to navigate an unpredictable enforcement landscape. The CFTC’s shift comes amid broader changes across key US financial regulators as President Trump seeks to reassert influence over financial policy. On Jan. 21, the SEC also announced the formation of a crypto task force dedicated to creating a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda is currently leading the agency while the Senate considers Trump’s nominee, Paul Atkins , to replace former Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins, a longtime critic of excessive financial regulation, is expected to take a significantly different approach than Gensler, whose tenure saw aggressive legal actions against multiple crypto firms. Public Engagement and Crypto Policy Development Beyond enforcement shifts, Pham also announced plans to increase public engagement in regulatory discussions. On Jan. 27, she revealed that the CFTC would hold public roundtable discussions on market issues, including potential digital asset regulations. This marks a stark contrast from previous administrations, which largely kept crypto policy discussions behind closed doors. Additionally, reports suggest that the CFTC is investigating Super Bowl bets offered by platforms such as Crypto.com and Kalshi, indicating that while enforcement may be scaling back, the agency remains focused on consumer protection in key market sectors. The CFTC’s pivot signals a significant change in how digital asset firms will be regulated in the US. With the SEC and CFTC both shifting gears, crypto businesses may find themselves operating in a more predictable regulatory environment for the first time in years. However, challenges remain. While Pham’s announcement suggests a reduction in aggressive enforcement, it does not mean that crypto firms will be free from oversight. Fraud and market manipulation cases will remain top priorities for regulators. Moreover, with ongoing political uncertainty in the US, regulatory policy could continue to shift in the coming months. For now, the crypto industry is likely to view the CFTC’s new stance as a positive step toward regulatory clarity—a long-sought goal for firms seeking to operate within the US financial system.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-06 05:30:00

Earlier this week, BTC traded below $90,000 and quickly bounced back to above $100,000. As of today, the asset now hovers above $98,000. Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant contributor XBTManager has provided insights into an important on-chain metric, highlighting a notable shift in the 6-12 month spent output age bands. This activity sheds light on possible market dynamics and future price developments. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Price Crash Could Be a Buying Opportunity for Big Players Analyzing Bitcoin’s Spent Output Age Bands The 6-12 month spent output age band reveals instances where long-held Bitcoin is moved, offering a glimpse into shifting market behavior. According to XBTManager, a significant amount—49,700 BTC—has recently been spent in this category today. Such substantial movement can often precede market volatility, as it may signal larger holders or dormant wallets re-entering active circulation. This sudden activity raises questions about how the market might react. Historically, large movements in older Bitcoin holdings can create temporary selling pressure. If these coins are sold, it can lead to short-term further price drops, potentially causing retail investors to panic. However, this downward trend can also set the stage for a rebound, with prices recovering as buyers absorb the new supply. The analyst wrote: A large portion of these Bitcoins is expected to be sold in the coming days, potentially creating selling pressure in the market. This could cause retail investors to panic and sell at lower prices. Subsequently, prices might be pushed back up, enabling these Bitcoins to be sold to retail investors at higher prices. Therefore, such movements can be seen as signs of market manipulation. Investors should remain cautious about potential market fluctuations in the coming days. Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to face selling pressure, with the asset unable to sustain a notable rebound or reclaim key levels. So far, Bitcoin has seen quite a plunge dropping roughly 10% from its all-time high above $109,000 registered in January.

In the past week, the asset has also declined 3.5% bringing its price to trade at $98,485, at the time of writing down by 0.5% in the past day. This price decline in BTC has affected the broader crypto market significantly with over $3 billion liquidated in the crypto market in just the past few days. Interestingly, despite this negative price performance from BTC, the asset’s daily trading volume has however seen an opposite trend recording an increase from below $40 billion this time last week to sitting above $58 billion as of today.

XRP, currently around $2.49 and down over 1% in the previous 24 hours, is reported by some analysts to be heading toward $1.50 if the market’s unpredictable nature continues. However, amidst the widespread uncertainty, two projects—Mantra and Remittix (RTX)—are drawing attention as potential shelters from the storm. Below is a look at why Ripple (XRP) holders might be bracing for a drop and how Mantra (OM) and Remittix (RTX) could offer refuge in a shaky market. XRP’s Worries: Could $1.50 Be the Next Stop? Ever since XRP hit $3.40 back in 2018, the token has been on a roller-coaster ride of legal drama, banking partnerships, and regulatory uncertainty. Trading at $2.49 now, some watchers suggest a slide to $1.50 might be imminent if broader crypto sentiment deteriorates. While XRP thrives on big announcements—like new payment corridors or favorable court updates—bearish phases can swiftly test investor patience. A 1% dip in 24 hours isn’t huge, but it underscores how the market has turned cautious, especially if BTC or ETH enter more severe downturns. Still, XRP’s backbone remains robust: partnerships with major financial institutions and a reputation for swift transactions. In the short term, though, fear can override fundamentals. If the price drifts lower, certain holders might rotate capital into altcoins they see as better shielded from short-term volatility—a scenario that benefits up-and-coming projects like Mantra and Remittix (RTX). Mantra: A Safe Harbor or Mere Speculation? Mantra (OM) has been pitched as a community-driven DeFi platform, aiming to simplify staking, yield farming, and governance. Supporters say it’s a user-friendly portal to DeFi opportunities, while critics caution that the project’s success hinges on steady liquidity and active governance. In a downturn, DeFi protocols can see capital flight if users fear contract vulnerabilities or plummeting yields. However, Mantra addresses volatility by diversifying staking pools and emphasizing community feedback, hoping to reduce the single points of failure that plague some DeFi tokens. Observers argue that if DeFi remains hot, Mantra might outperform more passive tokens—especially if the platform’s features give investors short-term staking rewards. Yet the question remains: can DeFi hold strong if the entire crypto market is in meltdown mode? Remittix(RTX): The PayFi Solution Gaining Ground While Mantra focuses on yield and governance, Remittix (RTX) offers a more grounded solution: bridging crypto and fiat to slash wire transfer fees. Already, RTX has raised over $10.8 million, sold 440 million tokens, and is currently trading at $0.0539. Unlike many DeFi or meme projects, Remittix addresses a tangible financial pain point. Imagine a digital artist in Argentina who needs to get paid by clients in Europe. Traditional wires cost a fortune, but RTX can reduce that overhead dramatically. This utility might shield Remittix (RTX) from the worst of market downturns, as everyday transactions often persist even in a bear environment. Analysts call it a “PayFi” approach—one that resonates beyond hardcore crypto circles. If the crypto slump lingers, tokens with real-world adoption may hold steadier than hype coins. For that reason, some watchers say RTX could see healthy gains even if XRP plunges and the broader market stumbles. Conclusion: A Pivot Toward Resilience The crypto market’s recent crash highlights a renewed emphasis on tokens offering tangible solutions or stable yields. XRP holders might be bracing for a pullback to $1.50, but nobody’s writing off Ripple’s strong fundamentals. Meanwhile, Mantra tries to keep DeFi appealing through community-driven governance and Remittix (RTX) banks on bridging fiat and crypto for cheaper transactions. Both could attract attention if XRP’s slump prompts investors to seek safer or more practical plays. Ultimately, the next few weeks will reveal if these projects can truly be a respite or if more volatility lies ahead. Ready to Explore Remittix (RTX)?

Now, he’s turning to Bitcoin—does this call mean anything? Eric Trump’s latest comment on Bitcoin ( BTC ) has sparked chatter, though its immediate market impact appears to be limited. On Feb. 6, he took to X, posting, “Feels like a great time to enter #BTC!” The remark briefly pushed Bitcoin past $98,000 before settling back to around $97,650, reflecting only a modest 0.4% hourly gain at the time of writing. Feels like a great time to enter #BTC ! 🚀 @worldlibertyfi — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 6, 2025 The reaction stands in contrast to what happened just days earlier when Eric Trump’s tweet on Ethereum ( ETH ) coincided with a dramatic market turnaround. On Feb. 1, Ethereum was already struggling after President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement triggered a market-wide sell-off. By Feb. 3, Ethereum had cratered, plunging 37 percent from its recent high on Jan. 31, marking one of its sharpest drops in recent history.

Ethereum has since stabilized, trading around $2,830 as of Feb. 6. While correlation does not imply causation, the rapid price swings following his previous tweet have led some traders to pay closer attention to his market calls. Bitcoin, which has seen a strong rally in recent months, remains in an entirely different market structure than Ethereum at the time of Eric Trump’s comments. While his Ethereum tweet coincided with a market bottom and extreme oversold conditions, Bitcoin has been trading near record highs, leaving less room for a sudden turnaround. Traders looking for history to repeat itself may have to wait a little longer to see if this tweet carries the same kind of weight.

On-chain data shows that in February, 135 new whale wallets with 100+ BTC have emerged. This could probably be the reason behind BTC’s quick bounce to $100K after crashing to $90K earlier this week. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Grows Amid Market Volatility The recent crypto market turbulence amid the fears of the Trump trade war provided a good opportunity for Bitcoin whales to stack up their supplies. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment reported that a total of 135 new wallets holding over 100 BTC emerged in February. On the other hand, small retail investors, particularly those who entered the market in the past six months, sold off during the recent correction. Wallets holding less than 100 BTC dropped by 138,680 during the February period. Thus the shift in Bitcoin supply is clear from the weak hands to the strong hands. Source: Santiment According to Santiment data , this divergence between whale accumulation and retail liquidation typically precedes market cap growth, though gains may take weeks or months to materialize. While some believe this to be the end of the Bitcoin bull run , the whale accumulation shows otherwise. Bitcoin Finds Strong Support at $97,500 Level Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) data reveals significant Bitcoin accumulation activity, with approximately 200,000 BTC purchased above $97,500. This accumulation explains the strong support level that prevented further price declines during two recent downturns last month. As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading at $97,601, with its daily trading volume plunging 35%, falling under $47 billion. Also, the 24-hour liquodations have soared to $36 million with $23 million in long liquidations. Source: Glassnode In its analysis, Glassnode further noted: “This strong accumulation stabilizes BTC price above $97.5K , well above the short-term holder cost basis (~$92K). Below $97.5K, unrealized losses rise sharply, increasing downside risk as sentiment weakens.” BTC Price Needs to Break Past $101 for A Strong Bull Rally Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin is testing its diagonal trendline support level as prices consolidate between $98,000 and $101,000. According to analyst Rekt Capital, early signs of a potential higher low formation are emerging. Price stability at current levels could pave the way for Bitcoin to retest the $101,000 resistance.

Jon Radoff, CEO and Co-Founder of Beamable Inc said, “By leveraging the proven success of our existing platform and integrating decentralized principles, we’re unlocking a new era of scalability and inclusivity for developers,” The received funding is set to be utilised for the expansion of Beamble Network. The Beamable network recently on 27 Jan announced the launch of the Beamble Foundation to transform the gaming industry via open-source technology and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). Beamable to build back-end gaming infra using DePIN As the pioneer in the development of decentralised gaming infrastructure, it aims to reduce dominance of centralised gaming centres dominated by hyperscalers. It intends to build robust and decentralised back-end gaming infra for the improvisation of the live gaming services. From its earlier development of games like “Game of Thrones Ascent” and “Star Trek Timelines”, it has now ascended to provide backend infra for the game developers. By providing token incentives and community-driven participation, it aims to use DePIN for the contribution of computing power storage, and network resources from participants. The customizable access given by Beamable Network to the developers will allow them to develop their own software modules and services on the network. It will also enable the o pen-source development and the creation of a tokenized protocol, ensuring that developers have a robust alternative to traditional cloud providers. As the gaming industry is already projected to generate $200 billion in revenue by 2025, Beamable network is already poised to make its way into the Top 10 DePIN Projects by launch. Big news!

However, the development of DePIN networks can distribute game server workloads across multiple nodes, reducing the possibility of server crashes and downtime. Moreover, the Blockchain-based identity systems allow gamers to access the gaming services without exposing their personal information. It also gives players a chance to earn direct rewards in crypto without third-party cuts. The full sense of ownership given to players and developers using Decentralized infrastructure will accelerate the transformation of the gaming industry. Apart from Beamable, there are other such DePIN projects leading the gaming transformation such as: Filecoin (FIL) – Decentralized game asset storage Arweave (AR) – Permanent game data storage Livepeer (LPT) – Decentralized video streaming for gaming content Theta Network (THETA) – Peer-to-peer game streaming rewards Beamable – as mentioned, for Open-source backend for multiplayer games Xai Network – Blockchain gaming infrastructure for Play-to-Earn GameSwift – Decentralized gaming ecosystem The DePIN projects besides being utilised in the gaming industry are gaining prominence in other areas too such as Helium – leading transformation in Wirelss IoT & 5G Networks ; Filecoin – in the arena of decentralized storage; Render – making efforts in distributed GPU rendering.

What led to this change, and what were the outcomes of its nearly four-year crypto experiment? Table of Contents The curious case of El Salvador What are the results of the El Salvador Bitcoin experiment? How did the El Salvador Bitcoin experiment end? The curious case of El Salvador The 2021 law in El Salvador made Bitcoin ( BTC ) legal tender, meaning it became not just legal but mandatory for transactions. Merchants were required to accept Bitcoin, and the government started collecting payments such as taxes and fees in Bitcoin. To facilitate this, the country launched the Chivo wallet, a government-backed mobile app designed to help Salvadorans transact with Bitcoin. The app allowed users to send, receive, and store Bitcoin, and even offered an incentive of $30 in Bitcoin for those who downloaded it. However, the law didn’t affect the status of the U.S. dollar, which had been the official currency of El Salvador from 2001 to 2021. This meant Salvadorans who didn’t want to use Bitcoin could still use USD for all transactions. Polls from 2021 showed that only 15% of the population trusted Bitcoin, and 70% of respondents opposed its adoption. Despite President Nayib Bukele’s media campaign and public relations efforts, the law failed to convince many Salvadorans of its value. Protesters in San Salvador set alight a Bitcoin ATM which had just been installed by the government. The protest was called to oppose the El Savador government's decision to make Bitcoin legal tender. pic.twitter.com/PyW2AWbkiw — Radical Graffiti (@GraffitiRadical) September 19, 2021 While the international crypto community lauded the El Salvadoran law, the residents of the country protested the law on the streets, and many in the financial world criticized the legislation’s flaws. One key issue was that many merchants across the country were not equipped to accept Bitcoin, and the law did not address this gap. Furthermore, a large portion of the population lacked bank accounts, and many businesses still only accepted cash payments. Many merchants were also reluctant to accept Bitcoin due to its volatility, fearing that its fluctuating value could lead to losses. What are the results of the El Salvador Bitcoin experiment? The nearly four-year period during which Bitcoin was legal tender in El Salvador has yielded mostly negative results, though there are a few positives to note. On the positive side, the 2021 Bitcoin adoption helped expose more people to cryptocurrencies. A measurable outcome was the boom in tourism. The announcement of Bitcoin’s adoption piqued international interest, leading to a 20% increase in tourist arrivals in 2024 compared to 2023, with growth also seen in previous years. However, the broader impact has been largely negative. Bitcoin failed to serve as a hedge against inflation in El Salvador. Issues such as its extreme volatility and technical difficulties with the Chivo wallet are often cited as reasons for the public’s reluctance to use Bitcoin. Additionally, multiple hacking incidents involving the Chivo wallet further eroded trust in the cryptocurrency, leading to its limited use. Read more: Hackers leak El Salvador’s Chivo Bitcoin wallet code The Bitcoin law also fell short of significantly improving financial inclusion. In 2021, approximately 70% of Salvadorans were unbanked, and an even larger percentage had never used Bitcoin. In fact, most people in the country largely ignored the digital currency. By 2024, a report from The Central American Group indicated that 92% of Salvadorans did not use Bitcoin for transactions. While Bitcoin was intended to facilitate cross-border payments, it had little impact in this regard. In 2023, only 1.3% of remittances were made using Bitcoin. A 2022 survey also revealed that 86% of local businesses had no Bitcoin transactions, and 91.7% of respondents said Bitcoin adoption had not affected them. Only 3.6% reported an improvement in sales. One of the key flaws in the Bitcoin adoption strategy was the timing. The law was enacted in 2021, a year following a major crypto rally fueled by Bitcoin’s halving. Historically, bull markets are followed by downturns, and the law was passed just before another crypto winter began. The sharp Bitcoin crash in 2022 only served to further discourage Salvadorans from using the currency. How did the El Salvador Bitcoin experiment end? Since 2022, the International Monetary Fund has urged El Salvador to amend its Bitcoin law. On January 30, 2025, the Salvadoran Congress took action, agreeing to revise the law in exchange for a $1.4 billion loan from the IMF. One key condition for securing the loan was the removal of Bitcoin’s legal tender status in the country. The loan agreement stipulates that “public sector engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities, transactions, and purchases will be limited.” While reports suggest that Bitcoin will remain legal for trade among Salvadorans, it will no longer be accepted for taxes or other government payments, and businesses will have the right to refuse Bitcoin payments. The requirement for all businesses to accept Bitcoin had faced stark criticism due to the BTC’s volatility and the public’s limited understanding of digital currencies. The new legislative reform also addresses these concerns by giving businesses the option to choose whether or not to accept Bitcoin However, the full scope of these restrictions is yet to be fully determined, and further details are expected soon. Good morning! We are now in DAY FIVE since El Salvador rescinded Bitcoin as legal tender, at the request of the IMF There continues to be a lot of misunderstanding about what happened on Wednesday, so it might be worth giving a brief overview In 2021 El Salvador made history… pic.twitter.com/s6td9ju0kA — John Dennehy (@jdennehy_writes) February 3, 2025 The IMF loan will be disbursed over a period of 40 months, meaning these restrictions will be enforced over a three-year span, potentially leading to a long-term decline in Bitcoin’s role in the country. Despite the shift in policy to secure the IMF loan, El Salvador’s government appears to maintain its pro-crypto stance. On Feb. 4, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office reported purchasing a total of 12 BTC through two separate transactions. The first acquisition involved 11 BTC, purchased for approximately $1.1 million, at an average price of $101,816 per Bitcoin. The second purchase added 1 BTC at a price of $99,114, just hours later. These recent acquisitions bring the country’s total Bitcoin reserves to 6,068 BTC, valued at over $592 million at the time of writing. El Salvador has continued to accumulate Bitcoin steadily, having added 60 BTC over the past month alone.

As a result, investors have started shifting to new tokens that have maintained a bullish trajectory. Amazingly a savvy Solana trader has pinpointed a rare bullish signal in RCO Finance (RCOF) , an AI-powered altcoin. Why is this top Solana (SOL) trader shifting to RCO Finance (RCOF)? Continue reading to find out! Solana Plunges 10% In A Week: What’s Coming Next? Solana has turned bearish after rallying in January. Over the past week, Solana has plunged by double digits. On January 27, Solana was changing hands at around $224. Notably, Solana hit this price while correcting downward from its recently set ATH of $294. Investors continued taking profits over the past week, pushing the Solana price down further. Also, Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below $100,000 on February 2, inducing a marketwide rout. As a result, Solana (SOL) traded as low as $180 on February 3. before rebounding partially and stabilizing at around $201. This price means Solana has lost 10% of its value over the past week. Moreover, this top Solana trader expects this top-10 altcoin to continue plunging as investors migrate to fresh high-potential tokens to hedge against losses. RCO Finance: A Modern DeFi Platform With AI-Powered Features As Solana continues bleeding, investors are migrating to RCO Finance, an upcoming DeFi platform. Investors are flocking to RCO Finance because it supports over 120,000 assets. Notably, these assets fall under 12,500+ asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), crypto, FX, and decentralized derivatives, to name a few. This diverse asset offering allows you to adjust your portfolio for stability and profitability. Also, RCO Finance is making waves in the crypto-verse because it supports non-KYC onboarding. This non-KYC policy also helps you maintain anonymity while interacting with the rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem. While these features set RCO Finance apart from conventional DeFi projects, it is worth noting that this platform’s leading feature is its AI-powered robo advisor. The RCO Finance robo advisor stands out because it uses machine learning and complex algorithms to generate custom investment recommendations. Specifically, the robo advisor’s AI-powered engine analyzes market data from top sources like Bloomberg and Reuters in real time. With the obtained data, the robo advisor can tell you when to enter or exit positions. For instance, the robo advisor could have helped you catch Solana’s rally to it its ATH. The robo advisor can also trade on your behalf, grabbing opportunities you would normally miss. This feature also spares you the time and effort you would have spent searching for high-potential investments. Also, this feature helps maximize profits and minimize risk exposure. Apart from its robo advisor, RCO Finance has taken the crypto space by storm because it launched its beta platform during its presale. Thus far, over 10,000 crypto enthusiasts have onboarded the RCO Finance platform, with more users joining daily. RCOF Emerges As A Top Investment As Solana continues plunging, RCOF has emerged as a top investment for many crypto investors. This AI altcoin has quickly gained popularity because it is a safe investment. RCOF’s safety can be verified by the smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof, a renowned blockchain security firm. Investors are also buzzing about this AI altcoin because it offers complete access to the RCO Finance platform. Also, RCOF offers HODLers perks like voting rights and quarterly dividends. On top of this, RCOF has gained investor confidence because of its rapid growth. As of February 3, this AI altcoin was going for $0.1 during Stage 5 of its presale. RCOF is set to jump to $0.13 when it enters Stage 6. Moreover, RCOF is poised to surge further as it approaches its listing price of $0.4-$0.6. Amazingly, experts foresee RCOF surging 50,000% in Q1 2025. Through this leap, this AI altcoin will have overshadowed Solana’s 17,200% surge in 2021.

Meanwhile, a fresh altcoin named Remittix, often called an XRP Rival, is gaining attention for fixing real finance issues. Below, we examine the steep losses in Pepe (PEPE) and Official Trump (TRUMP), and how Remittix (RTX) might be the best way forward. Pepe and Official Trump Face Steep Drops Over the past week, Pepe tumbled to $0.00001037, marking -8.62% daily, -17.51% weekly, and -50.02% monthly dips. Analysts say lacking a practical goal makes Pepe (PEPE) vulnerable to panic selling. Meanwhile, Official Trump plunged to $19.02, showing -8.37% daily, -29.67% weekly, yet a surprising +193.19% monthly jump. Though some watchers see it as a meme coin success, critics warn that whale sell-offs may keep dragging Official Trump (TRUMP) lower. Such rapid drops highlight the need for crypto market volatility insight. Traders find that meme coins can spike fast yet crash even faster if hype cools. While both Pepe and Official Trump soared at times, they now struggle to hold ground. This leaves many looking for an “XRP Rival” that could deliver steadier returns—enter Remittix, a cross-border solution with practical benefits. Why Meme Coins Are Losing Investor Confidence Experts note that meme tokens often rely on fleeting buzz. Pepe (PEPE) spiked thanks to whale moves and exchange listings but fell when big holders cashed out. Official Trump (TRUMP) soared more than +193.19% monthly, yet still dropped -29.67% on the week. This fast shift underscores the power of whales and short-term hype. Without real-world utility, these coins may keep sliding, leaving some to question if they’re still worth buying.’ In contrast, a coin that solves actual finance problems stands a better chance in tough markets. That’s why watchers emphasize the need for crypto market volatility insight when picking tokens. People tired of guesswork in meme coins now lean toward altcoins with direct uses, like sending funds cheaply or bridging real banking gaps. This is where Remittix (RTX) stands out, offering more stability and growth potential. Remittix Emerges as an XRP Rival Unlike coins driven mainly by internet buzz, Remittix tackles real financial pain. Remittances cost billions in fees each year, hurting families, freelancers, and unbanked communities. Over 1.4 billion adults worldwide lack a bank account, especially in regions like Morocco or Egypt with over 60% unbanked. With Remittix (RTX), a person in the U.S. can send funds directly to relatives in Africa or Southeast Asia, who then convert it into local cash without heavy wire charges. This direct fix is why fans call Remittix an XRP Rival for cross-border payments. Instead of hype, Remittix (RTX) relies on cheaper, quicker transfers, letting even the unbanked access crypto on their phones. While Pepe (PEPE) and Official Trump (TRUMP) saw wild gains, they offer little help to those who pay steep costs just to move money. Thus, many see Remittix as a token with true daily impact. Conclusion While Pepe (PEPE) and Official Trump (TRUMP) once seemed promising, both dropped significantly—showing how meme coins can fall without solid use cases. By contrast, Remittix (RTX) addresses real finance challenges, offering an “XRP Rival” for cross-border payments. With more and more traders seeking crypto market volatility insight, many now view Remittix as the smartest choice to outperform other coins and bring steadier gains.

By focusing on seamless cross-border transactions, Qubetics aims to simplify international payments for businesses and individuals alike. Its innovative approach positions it well to meet the evolving demands of blockchain and digital finance. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions Let’s dive into Qubetics, the new kid on the blockchain aiming to make cross-border transactions a breeze. In today’s global economy, sending money across borders can be a real headache—think high fees, long wait times, and a maze of intermediaries. Qubetics is stepping in to change all that. At its core, Qubetics is a Layer 1 blockchain and Web3 aggregator, designed to link major players like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This setup isn’t just for show; it’s about creating a seamless network where transactions can flow smoothly, no matter where you are in the world. For businesses, professionals, and everyday folks, this means sending and receiving payments without the usual fuss. But Qubetics isn’t stopping there. They’ve recently teamed up with the 1inch Network, a big name in decentralized finance (DeFi). This partnership means users get access to trades across hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), optimized pricing, and a user-friendly experience. In simple terms, it’s like having a VIP pass to the best deals in the DeFi space. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in its 20th presale stage, selling over 461 million tokens to more than 18,400 holders, raking in upwards of $11.9 million. At this stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0667 each. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, suggesting the token could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale—a sweet 240% return on investment. And looking further ahead, some forecasts even see $TICS reaching $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. In a nutshell, Qubetics is positioning itself as a top crypto for massive growth, aiming to make cross-border transactions simpler and more efficient. With its innovative approach and strong partnerships, it’s definitely a project to keep an eye on. Bitcoin Cash: The Resilient Contender Next up, let’s chat about Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Born from a split with Bitcoin back in 2017, Bitcoin Cash set out to tackle some of the OG crypto’s limitations, especially when it comes to transaction speed and fees. By increasing the block size, BCH allows for more transactions to be processed quickly, making it a favorite for those who value speed and low costs. Despite the rollercoaster that is the crypto market, Bitcoin Cash has shown some serious staying power. As of now, BCH is trading at around $331.93, with intraday highs reaching $345.04. This resilience has kept it in the spotlight as a top crypto for massive growth. One of the key reasons folks are drawn to Bitcoin Cash is its commitment to being a practical digital currency. While Bitcoin is often dubbed “digital gold” and seen as a store of value, BCH is all about everyday transactions. Its lower fees and faster transaction times make it a solid choice for daily use, from buying your morning coffee to shopping online. Moreover, Bitcoin Cash has been making strides in increasing its adoption. More merchants and platforms are accepting BCH, broadening its usability. This growing acceptance not only boosts its utility but also its appeal to investors eyeing top cryptos for massive growth. In summary, Bitcoin Cash continues to be a strong contender in the crypto space, offering practical solutions for everyday transactions and demonstrating a resilience that’s hard to ignore.

This downturn aligns with broader cryptocurrency market volatility. Against this backdrop, Elon Musk’s AI model, Grok , has analyzed potential timelines for XRP to reach the $10 milestone, emphasizing regulatory, technological, and market variables. Short-Term Predictions Grok highlights mixed sentiment in short-term forecasts. The AI chatbot highlighted older predictions suggesting XRP would hit $10 by October 2024. While this did not materialize, some in the crypto community suggested XRP could hit this target by early 2025. Notably, a prominent crypto analyst predicted in January that the asset could hit $15 by March 10 , making this $10 target feasible. However, Grok cautions that “social media can often reflect speculative or biased optimism,” urging investors to treat these projections skeptically. XRP Medium-Term Predictions Financial experts and cryptocurrency analysts have assessed the likelihood of XRP reaching $10 within the next few years. Some reports suggest that XRP could experience substantial growth if market conditions remain favorable. A November 2024 analysis by Forbes Advisor India indicates that in an optimistic scenario, XRP could rise to between $10 and $15 by 2025, largely due to widespread adoption and positive regulatory changes. Grok noted that Forbes Advisor set a more moderate projection placing XRP in the $5 to $10 range. Grok also highlighted a Coinpedia report from January 2025, presenting a more conservative outlook, predicting a peak of $3.99 for the year, with developments surrounding the Ripple lawsuit influencing it. However, prominent analysts believe XRP will reach higher targets irrespective of the lawsuit’s outcome . Grok also referenced Finance Magnates, which discussed the potential for XRP to reach $10 in 2025 but emphasized the need for strong market support and stability to sustain such a rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Long-Term Forecasts Grok also highlighted longer-term predictions hinged on sustained adoption and legal resolutions. Benzinga projects a 2030 target of $6.36, emphasizing Ripple’s partnerships and the conclusion of the lawsuit. Cryptopolitan offers a more optimistic view, suggesting XRP could reach $10.72 by 2028, with further gains to $16.38 by 2031. LiteFinance forecasts a 2026 range of $6.94–$10.18, balancing bullish momentum with potential corrections. Is XRP Going to $10? Several fundamental factors will determine XRP’s ability to reach $10. The major factors Grok highlighted are the resolution of the Ripple lawsuit which an expert believes will happen in a few months , growing adoption, and positive market sentiment. While short-term social media hype and medium-term institutional forecasts suggest potential breakthroughs by 2025–2026, long-term targets rely heavily on regulatory clarity, adoption rates, and market stability.

However, some Russians living abroad will still have access to its services. Russian users were warned of the coming changes on Feb. 5 through a post on Deribit’s website that read: “Due to EU sanctions against Russia, Deribit is no longer able to accept Russian nationals and Russian residents as its clients, unless an exception applies. Since Deribit’s parent company is Dutch, these EU sanctions are relevant to us.” The statement explained that affected users would be limited to “reduce-only” transactions beginning Feb. 17. All Russian user accounts will be closed on March 29, although withdrawals will still be possible. The exchange is leaving 15% of its customer base For Russian nationals living abroad, Deribit’s services would remain accessible — counterintuitively — to Russian nationals living permanently in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, but not to Russian nationals living anywhere else. The EEA consists of the European Union (EU) member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Deribit left The Netherlands for Panama in 2020 to avoid regulations . It moved from Panama to Dubai in April 2024. It had a trading volume of $1.2 trillion in 2024. A survey done in May found that 15% of visitors to the Deribit website were from Russia. Other exchanges with heavy Russian traffic were Bybit (27%), Bitfinex (22%), HTX (14%) and MEXC (10%). Deribit does not operate in the United States. Its website was inaccessible from the U.S. on Feb. 5. Its departure from Russia comes as the government is feeling high pressure from international sanctions and consequently warming up to cryptocurrency. The Russian crypto scene is changing rapidly Bloomberg reported in August that Russia was on the brink of implementing crypto on- and offramps using the National Payment Card System’s Mir card. The system belongs to the Bank of Russia and is fully regulated. Bloomberg also quoted Finance Minister Anton Siluanov as saying the government was looking for a way to legalize crypto exchanges and may set up crypto trading programs at the Moscow Exchange and the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange. In December, the central bank instituted measures to crack down on over-the-counter trading, just days after President Vladimir Putin heartily endorsed the use of Bitcoin and the country began using crypto for international trade.

The Asia-Pacific region retail traders are making moves in Bitcoin ( BTC ) while the U.S. lags behind. When excluding exchange-traded funds and exchange flows, retail activity in Asia is growing faster than in the U.S. and Europe, according to Gemini’s latest research report made in collaboration with Glassnode. Research at Glassnode analyzed transaction timestamps, linking BTC activity to working hours in different regions. The findings suggest that “retail activity in the APAC region has grown at a faster clip than other geographies.” Bitcoin’s YoY supply change for U.S., E.U. and Asia | Source: Gemini Since Bitcoin’s cycle low in December 2022, APAC’s year-over-year supply growth reached 6.4%, the survey reveals.

""He and I are focused on the 10-year Treasury,"" Bessent told Fox Business when asked about plans to lower interest rates. ""He is not calling for the Fed to lower interest rates,"" Bessent added. The 10-year yield, the so-called risk-free rate, influences most long-term loans in the economy, including mortgages and business loans. Thus, a declining 10-year yield encourages borrowing and investment, increasing risk-taking in the economy and financial markets. Thus, softening of the 10-year yield is typically seen as bullish for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). Trump plans to lower the yield by controlling inflation, which will likely bode well for BTC and reducing the budget deficit, which may be a headwind for risk assets. ""The energy component for them is one of the surest indicators for long-term inflation expectations,"" Bessent said, reiterating that boosting the energy supply will help lower inflation. Other things being equal, lower inflation would allow the Federal Reserve (Fed) to continue cutting rates, which are still very much in restrictive territory . That could add to the bullish momentum in risk assets. Since September, the Fed has lowered the benchmark borrowing cost by 100 basis points to 4.25%-4.5% range. Meanwhile, Bessent's strategy to inject downward pressure on the 10-year yield also involves fixing the huge budget deficit through reduced fiscal spending. Deficit reduction would mean less bond supply, higher bond prices, and lower yields. That said, the Biden administration's supposed out-of-control fiscal spending compensated for the elevated Fed rates and greased financial markets. So, any cut in spending could destabilize risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. ""Of course, getting the 10-year yield on a downward path implies moves to improve the U.S. fiscal position, as well as inflation. So far, we've had his partner, Musk, cutting Federal government programs like USAID, Federal employees and such. Which really doesn't scratch the surface, "" ForexLive's Chief Asia-Pacific Currency Analyst Eamonn Sheridan noted . ""Most of the U.S. spending is on healthcare, Social Security, and defence. Will Trump inflict the pain that his focus seems to imply? There is a barely a politician out there that would,"" Sheridan added. Enjoy the move lower while it lasts The 10-year yield has dropped by 38 basis points to 4.42% as markets price in lower energy prices and non-inflationary growth, according to Bessent. Analysts at ING, however, do not see a sustained drop. ""We also assert there is not huge room to the downside for the 10 year yield. An effective floor is in place at just under 4%, as determinable from the funds rate strip. That floor can, of course, shift lower, but would need a better reason than an approaching 10 year rate. And the 10 year Treasury yield sits some 50bp over this. So enjoy the move lower while it lasts,"" ING said in a note to clients. ING added that it's hard to see a big driver for a lower 10-year yield, apart from a potential huge success of The Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, created to cut wasteful fiscal expenditure and slash federal regulations.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-06 06:53:09

Experts Predict 1000x Gains Before It Hits Major Exchanges!,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/rollblock-the-next-shiba-inu-experts-predict-1000x-gains-before-it-hits-major-exchanges/,"Rollblock (RBLK) is a top altcoin that forms the core of an online casino that’s set to reshape the online gambling market. The project has been the subject of mass interest from Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors in recent weeks. The platform, which is bringing blockchain betting to the next level with $1.75 million bets recorded in December 2024, is predicted to report 1000x gains and significant ROI for investors before it hits the major crypto exchanges. Discover the reasons behind the attraction. SHIB comparisons made with Rollblock’s trajectory Many comparisons have been made between the trajectory of Shiba Inu (SHIB), a top altcoin that became one of the most successful for early adopters in terms of its ROI, and Rollblock. During the 2021 bull market, Shiba Inu went from total obscurity to become one of the biggest meme coins in the crypto world. It skyrocketed with a quick 10x gain in just weeks, fueled by its listing on the Binance exchange. Today, it remains the second largest meme coin by market cap behind Dogecoin. However, experienced investors believe that Rollblock has the potential to exceed SHIB’s performance by some margin. Rollblock’s explosive presale: Strong evidence of belief in the GambleFi project The top altcoin RLBK is the native token of the Rollblock blockchain casino and sportsbook that is bringing trust back to the crypto gaming scene. Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, the Rollblock GambleFi project enables users to verify fair results through immutably recorded and tamper-proof transactions. While that additional layer of transparency and fairness is a big part of the attraction of the project, there are many other key factors that have led to such an explosive presale. One of the biggest is the unique revenue-sharing mechanism that allows token holders of the top altcoin to earn an ROI through passive income earned as the project grows. A large percentage of the crypto casino’s weekly profits are used to buy back the RBLK token, and 40% of the token purchases are then shared among token holders as rewards. Furthermore, holders of the top altcoin also receive daily, weekly, and monthly rakebacks, which is another major incentive for investors to dip into their pockets. The Rollblock hybrid casino is blowing competitors out of the water There’s more to it, too. Rollblock is not just another token crypto casino giving investors a chance for an ROI. It’s also an exceptional betting platform in its own right. Currently, the site features over 7,000 casino games from top-tier providers, such as slots and live dealer titles. In addition to that, the platform offers sports betting across dozens of major sports and events, with the site’s live betting options proving particularly popular. Rollblock: The better investment right now? As Shiba Inu is currently in a trending downturn, smart money suggests RBLK is the better investment opportunity right now. Considering the above benefits for early adopters, and with big money investors buying heavily, now could prove an optimal time to jump in. Rollblock is currently in stage 10 of its presale, with tokens on sale for $0.052, but that price will increase again within days before jumping up to $0.065 when stage 11 kicks in.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $66.38 million in net inflows on Wednesday, 80% lower than the $340.82 million inflows seen over the previous day. The majority of inflows came into BlackRock’s IBIT with $44.35 million entering the fund. WidomTree’s BTCW and Fidelity’s FBTC also contributed to the positive momentum with inflows of $11.38 million and $10.65 million respectively. The nine remaining spot Bitcoin funds saw no inflows or outflows on the day. The total trading volume for these investment products stood at $2.04 billion on Feb. 5 while the total net inflows into them since launch day stood at $40.67 billion. Notably, the dip in inflows on Wednesday likely stemmed from a recent conversation outlining President Donald Trump’s vision for America’s digital asset landscape. During the discussion, Trump’s crypto czar failed to provide any new developments regarding the implementation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the nation, aside from stating that exploring the “feasibility of a strategic BTC reserve” remains a top priority for the crypto council. The uncertainty surrounding the government’s stance on a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve, which Trump promised months before winning the presidential election, has led to cautious sentiment among BTC investors. At press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was down 0.4%, exchanging hands at $97,847 per coin.

Fidelity’s FETH led the way with $20.06 million in inflows, while Grayscale’s mini Ethereum Trust followed, drawing in $5.21 million from investors. Grayscale’s larger ETHE fund was the only outlier of the day, recording a net outflow of $7.16 million. The remaining ETH ETFs remained neutral. The spot Ether ETFs have experienced a cumulative total net outflow of $3.17 billion. At the time of publication, Ethereum ( ETH ) was up 2.5% and was trading at $2,835.

While some coins are moving slowly, others are ready​ tо explode. Names like Ethereum and Tron have been around for years, showing steady growth, but newer projects like Sui, Aave, and the latest Rollblock are gaining serious momentum. With analysts calling for massive price surges, ETH, TRX, AAVE, and SUI are set for the upcoming bull market. But, Rollblock is in presale stage 10 , available for $0.052, and it is a top crypto in this race. Rollblock is Among the Top Crypto Posing for 100x Gains If you’re looking for an altcoin with serious upside, Rollblock (RBLK) is the one to watch. It’s the first Ethereum-based play-to-earn iGaming platform, giving players access to 7,000+ games while offering investors weekly passive income from its revenue-sharing model. With the iGaming industry worth over $500 billion annually, Rollblock is getting into one of the most profitable markets in crypto. Its presale is already raising over $10M, and with huge demand building up, early investors could see 100x gains once it hits exchanges. Tron is Getting Out of Slump Tron (TRX) has taken a hit during the recent bearish crypto momentum, with its price dropping from $0.40 to $0.20 in less than 40 days. Looking at the last 30 days, TRX is down 17%, but there are signs it’s starting to recover. If we look back to November 2024, TRX skyrocketed nearly 200%, and it seems like the same momentum could be building again. The stage might be set for another big surge with TRX – just keep an eye on it! SUI Losing Its Edge But Recovering Slowly Sui (SUI) was one of the big winners of the November bull market, soaring from $1.80 to $5.20 in under a month. Since then, SUI went down, dropping to $3.36. Right now, things aren’t looking great for SUI, with the price slipping in the short term. The market is volatile, but SUI’s potential hasn’t disappeared – this could just be a temporary dip before it picks back up. Ethereum is Trying to Push to New Heights Ethereum (ETH) had a solid year, climbing 20% overall, proving it’s still a strong pick for long-term holders. However, in the last 30 days, ETH dropped by 25% – a dip not too surprising. But here’s the good news: the bounce back has started. ETH’s price is slowly climbing again, and while Ethereum whales know their investment is safe and steady. AAVE: Jumpy Road Ahead AAVE had a good year, with a 200% increase in price. It surged from $128 to $377, showing massive growth. However, after hitting those highs, AAVE’s price has pulled back to around $250, which seems to have set a new resistance mark. With this new support level in place, AAVE could be poised to break through and push higher. The road ahead might be jumpy, but with the right momentum, AAVE could be gearing up for another big move. Conclusion While Ethereum, Tron, and SUI work through their market dips, and AAVE prepares for a breakout, Rollblock stands out as the true gem with massive potential. Don’t miss out on this altcoin and a chance to be part of this 100x opportunity before it’s too late. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Table of Contents Catzilla: The meme coin aiming to dominate the market WIF: The dogwifhat phenomenon Floki: From meme to multi-utility Conclusion A new meme coin is taking the crypto world by storm, with analysts predicting it could compete with WIF and FLOKI in the next bull run. While many meme tokens fade, this one combines hype, community power, and strong growth potential to stand out. With a strategic presale, viral appeal, and huge ROI potential, this token is quickly gaining momentum. Catzilla: The meme coin aiming to dominate the market As meme coins continue their meteoric rise, one fearless feline is preparing to shake up the crypto world, Catzilla. More than just another viral token, Catzilla blends entertainment, community power, and financial potential, positioning itself as a true contender in the meme coin arena. Unlike short-lived trends, Catzilla has a battle plan, a 14-stage presale, giving investors a chance to get in early before the token hits the public market. As each stage progresses, the token’s value climbs, with some projections eyeing up to 700% gains. The crypto battlefield is fierce, and only those who act fast will secure their stake in this rising juggernaut. For years, dog-themed meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have ruled the space. But a feline uprising is underway. MEW and Popcat have already proven that cats can claw their way to the top, and now Catzilla is ready to take charge. MEW: Pounced into the top 15 meme coins, soaring 103.7% in just three months. Popcat: Didn’t just jump, it skyrocketed, delivering a 157.44% gain. With Catzilla now entering the ring, it’s clear that the dog era is fading; it’s time for the cats to rule. Catzilla is more than just a meme, it’s a movement against outdated crypto models.

While WIF is a pure meme coin with no underlying utility, its growth is heavily tied to ongoing trends. Floki: From meme to multi-utility What started as a meme inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu has evolved into a utility-driven token. FLOKI now boasts NFT gaming, DeFi services, and even real-world payment partnerships. Its charity efforts, including building schools in developing countries, also help differentiate it from other meme coins. However, while WIF and FLOKI have had their runs, analysts believe Catzilla could be the next big winner, combining viral appeal, community hype, and multi-layered earning potential. Conclusion Coins like WIF and FLOKI have less short-term potential. Meanwhile, Catzilla aims for financial freedom for all. It offers massive ROI during presale, from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages. With triple utility, governance, incentives, and staking, it unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers to join the battle against crypto villains.

This translates to roughly $6b. In a CNBC interview on Thursday, founder Michael Sonnenfeldt explained that Bitcoin has now positioned itself alongside gold as a trusted store of value. He also added that Bitcoin serves as an “instability hedge,” a feature that particularly resonates with investors in nations facing economic uncertainty. “The areas of digital currencies remain really exciting. We have some members who are all in — it’s become a gold substitute. Gold isn’t an inflation hedge. It’s an instability hedge,” he said. Bitcoin Now Acts as Modern Digital Gold and Diversification Tool: Tiger21 Commenting on the shift in safe-haven investments, Sonnenfeldt noted that Bitcoin is gaining wider acceptance. “Gold is for traditionalists. And Bitcoin is a little new age, but they often play the same role. They’re perceived as storehouses of value that are not subject to government fiat.” Sonnenfeldt also discussed the diversification benefits of adding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to an investment portfolio. “When you have a truly global market like that, people feel like there’s some real refuge there to be found,” he added. Diverse Investments Parallel Bitcoin’s Market Rally Tiger21 manages roughly $150b in assets and counts over 1,200 high-net-worth investors among its members. To join, individuals must have at least $20m in liquid assets, ensuring that the network comprises seasoned professionals. It covers a wide range of investments, from traditional stocks and real estate to alternatives such as private equity, venture capital and the increasingly popular cryptocurrency market. The club’s members are not just extraordinarily wealthy. They are also serial entrepreneurs, experienced investors, and top executives who possess deep insights into wealth creation and management. Their diverse expertise enables members to explore both established and emerging investment opportunities. Originally founded in New York City, Tiger21 has rapidly expanded its reach on a global scale. Today, the network operates in seven countries, including the US, Canada, UK, Switzerland, Portugal, Singapore and Dubai. Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, Bitcoin has surged dramatically, although recent declines linked to his tariff concerns have moderated its momentum. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has risen by 129% over the past year and last traded at roughly $98,193 as of early Thursday.

According to the exchange’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, he said the filing is a bid to protect customer assets being held by the custodian during its financial restructuring. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal cites Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which ensures that assets held by custodians remain property of the customers even in bankruptcy cases. Coinbase intervenes in Prime Trust bankruptcy Prime Trust is a crypto custody service that helps institutional investors securely save their cryptocurrencies, amongst other services. On August 14, 2023, Prime Trust filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware, asking for the creation of a committee to liquidate its assets. The company cited a decline in customer deposits, with regulators identifying a $82 million deficit in customer deposits. The bankruptcy situation was exacerbated because a significant portion of clients’ holding is in illiquid tokens. As of February 5, Coinbase has now inserted itself in the Prime Trust bankruptcy proceedings after it filed an amicus brief , urging the court to uphold legal protections for customers’ assets held by custodians. Paul Grewal, in an X post said that customer assets should not be absorbed into a custodian’s bankruptcy proceedings. He maintains that according to Article 8, custodian assets belong to clients not custodians, and that this is spelled out in both Coinbase and Prime Trust’s user agreement. “UCC Article 8 is a pillar of commercial law that protects customer assets– held by custodians big and small, in digital or traditional finance (including BNY and DTC)– from unfairly getting swallowed up in bankruptcy,” Paul said. Poor asset management is at the center of Prime Trust’s bankruptcy, with liabilities reaching up to $500 million. Prime Trust went into its bankruptcy proceeding less than a year after the infamous FTX crash of November 2022. Those proceedings ended with founder Sam Bankman-Fried convicted of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024. In a different case, Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after the company’s balance sheets revealed a $1.2 billion deficit and over $4.7 owed to the creditors. Coinbase is looking to set industry precedent As a qualified custodian, Prime Trust is expected to protect clients’ assets from financial downturns. However, the company’s bankruptcy highlights a potential flaw in the custodial services frameworks. However, the UCC Article 8 should protect customers in scenarios where the company goes broke. With its intervention in Prime Trust’s bankruptcy, Coinbase has taken it upon itself to uphold customer assets protection within the crypto industry and outside. Paul Grewal says “This is bigger than crypto.” The UCC Article 8 is a fundamental part of commercial law, which applies to both digital and traditional financial institutions, which unavoidably are at risk of going through bankruptcy proceedings because of the nature of their business.

As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President U.S. Crypto Advisory Council. The council, formed by executive order in Trump’s first week back in office, is expected to play a major role in shaping U.S. crypto policies and regulations . U.S. Crypto Regulations Under the Biden administration, many crypto firms felt burdened by unclear and strict regulations. Now, with Trump’s push for innovation in digital assets, the advisory council aims to bring industry leaders into discussions on the future of crypto in the U.S. One of its biggest challenges will be determining whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as commodities or securities, a debate that directly affects regulatory oversight by the SEC or CFTC. Garlinghouse’s inclusion on the shortlist has sparked speculation about Ripple’s influence in shaping crypto policy. Given his long-standing advocacy for clearer regulations, his role could significantly impact the broader industry. Other Industry Leaders in Consideration Alongside Garlinghouse, other notable crypto leaders are being considered for the council’s seats. These include Kraken’s former general counsel Marco Santori, crypto podcast host Frank Chaparro, and CEOs from major firms like Circle’s Jeremy Allaire, Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, and Crypto.com’s Kris Marszalek. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: SEC Judge Who Signed Off on Ripple Case Appeal Moves to IT Department , Growing Role of Ripple and XRP Rumors are also circulating about XRP’s potential inclusion in a national reserve list, though no official confirmation has been made. Some believe Trump’s past meeting with Ripple executives before his inauguration could be linked to this latest development. If true, it could position Ripple as a key player in the U.S. financial system. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The post followed a similar one on Feb. 3 when he said it was a “great time to add ETH,” resulting in a double-digit recovery for the asset. However, there was little reaction on spot markets for BTC, which remains sluggish at $98,000. Bitcoin fell to an intraday low of $96,200, culminating in a 7% decline over the past week. It was trading at around $98,200 during the Thursday morning Asian session, having weakened over the past 12 hours. The asset showed promise with a strong recovery following the suspension of Trump’s trade tariffs when it topped $102,000, but those gains have been eroded over the past couple of days. Feels like a great time to enter #BTC ! @worldlibertyfi — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 6, 2025 Bitcoin Recovery Falters There has been massive fundamental momentum surrounding crypto over the past few weeks, yet BTC is still down 10% from its all-time high and is still susceptible to volatile market crashes, as seen on Feb. 2 when it dumped 8% . Bitcoin has been around for 12 years, and nobody has ever hacked it, which makes it an “excellent store of value,” said White House crypto czar David Sacks on CNBC. In actuality, it has been around for longer than 12 years. Crypto czar, David Sacks says Bitcoin is a great store of value! pic.twitter.com/FTJeg3sU7W — borovik (@3orovik) February 5, 2025 Sacks also said that there was a strong incentive to bring crypto innovation back to the United States. “Financial assets are destined to become digital just like every analog industry became digital, and we want that value creation to happen in the United States rather than giving it away to other countries.” Additionally, Stock to Flow model creator ‘Plan B’ said that things were still on track, and Bitcoin was entering the second stage of the bull market, “the steep FOMO stage.” -> Almost 1 year since the halving, bitcoin red dots are turning orange (and then yellow): entering the 2nd stage of the bull market, the steep FOMO stage. pic.twitter.com/9g9UMzMYma — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) February 5, 2025 Moreover, altseason still seems to be a distant hope for many. “The strongest altseasons have occurred every time Bitcoin dominance rejected from 71%,” observed analyst ‘Rekt Capital’ on Wednesday. BTC dominance is currently 61.3%, according to Tradingview, so it still has a way to go. Crypto Markets Sink Despite Bullish Week Despite the bullish news, such as the SEC downsizing its crypto enforcement division, Trump approving a sovereign wealth fund , and the establishment of a pro-crypto task force in America, markets have still retreated. Total market capitalization was down 1.4% on the day at $3.34 trillion at the time of writing. Ethereum had made minor progress in reclaiming $2,800, but most of the altcoins were in red again. There were larger losses for XRP, SUI, and Hedera (HBAR), while Litecoin (LTC) notched a minor gain.

ADA could be looking at significant gains in the near future, according to crypto analyst Ali Martinez. ADA faces a strong resistance towards the $1 price level, but Martinez claims the cryptocurrency is due for a “monster parabolic rally.” In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Martinez posted a chart for the ADA price action, highlighting that the cryptocurrency is forming patterns similar to the 2021 crypto market bull run. The analyst showed a fractal pattern in the chart where ADA previously consolidated within a range before exploding in 2021. A similar accumulation phase appears to have formed recently, marked by a breakout from a key resistance level.

Some recent developments indicate that the attitude of high-net-worth investors towards crypto has undergone a radical shift. Notably, a recent statement by TIGER 21 founder and chairman Michael Sonnenfeldt aligns well with the aforementioned assumption. TIGER 21’s Bold Crypto Move While speaking with media persons, Sonnenfeldt revealed that cryptocurrencies make up at least 1% to 3% of his firm’s investment portfolio. TIGER 21 handles no less than $200 billion. This means that the firm has approximately $6 billion invested in crypto. Additionally, the TIGER 21 chairman stated that some of its members are fully invested in crypto. TIGER 21 is more like an exclusive club of high-net-worth investors. It operates on an invitation-only model. To be eligible to receive an invitation to the group, one must have at least $20 million worth of investable assets. Currently, the investment firm has no more than 1,600 members . Bitcoin: The New Digital Gold? Interestingly, Sonnenfeldt likened Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, to gold. Highlighting Bitcoin’s capability to combat the threat of economic uncertainty, he pointed out how people in economically shattered countries like Argentina and Lebanon use Bitcoin as a store of value. TIGER 21’s Crypto Investment: A Sign of the Times The political stance in the US towards the cryptocurrency industry shifted in favour of the sector following the victory of Donald Trump over Kamala Harris . The newly inducted Trump administration recently initiated strong measures to establish a clear crypto regulatory framework. Experts think that the initiatives taken by the new US regime to create a clear regulatory framework for digital assets may have influenced many high-net-worth investors to rethink their approach to cryptocurrencies. Beyond Crypto: TIGER 21’s Investment Strategy Though TIGER 21 maintains a welcoming attitude towards new-age investment arenas like cryptocurrencies, it still focuses on traditional assets like real estate and private equity . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Expands US Workforce by 75% After Elections: Is the SEC Lawsuit Ending Soon? , The Crypto Market Landscape: An Overview At the start of this month, the total market cap of crypto was at $3.45T. In the first two days of the month, the market experienced a considerable fall of 8.09%. Though on February 3, the market climbed by over 3.13%, between February 4 and 5, the market slipped by 5.16%.

Solana Becomes Second-Largest DeFi Network The report reveals a staggering 213% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth in Chain GDP—essentially the total app revenue generated on the Solana network—rising from $268 million in Q3 to an impressive $840 million in Q4. November stood out as the most lucrative month, contributing $367 million to the ecosystem. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Golden Pocket: Analyst Says It’s A Good Buy At These Levels Among the leading applications driving this revenue surge were Pump.fun, which generated $235 million, marking a 242% QoQ increase, and Photon, which saw even more explosive growth with a 278% increase, bringing in $140 million. The overall uptick in revenue can be attributed largely to renewed speculation in memecoins and a surge in AI-related cryptocurrencies launched during this period. Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) grew by 64% QoQ, reaching $8.6 billion and positioning it as the second-largest DeFi network, surpassing Tron in November. The DeFi TVL, when expressed in SOL, saw a 28% QoQ increase, totaling 46 million SOL. The average daily spot decentralized exchange (DEX) volume also skyrocketed by 150% QoQ to $3.3 billion, driven by a resurgence in memecoin trading and the rise of AI-themed tokens. In terms of stablecoins, Solana’s market cap grew by 36% QoQ to reach $5.1 billion, making it the fifth-largest stablecoin market among competing networks. The dominance of USDC continued, with its market cap increasing by 53% to $3.9 billion, capturing a 75% market share. Increased Activity And Speculation The liquid staking rate, which measures the percentage of liquid-staked SOL, rose by 33% to 11.2%, indicating that a significant portion of the eligible SOL supply—66%—is now staked. This growth is crucial for a thriving ecosystem built on yield-bearing SOL. The NFT market also saw a modest increase, with average daily volume rising by 7% QoQ to $2.7 million. Tensor dominated this space, achieving $103 million in volume—a 14% QoQ increase—while Magic Eden experienced a decrease of 28% to $68 million. Network activity metrics reflected robust engagement, with average daily fee payers increasing by 171% QoQ to 5.1 million. The number of new fee payers surged even more dramatically, growing by 189% to 3.8 million. Average daily non-vote transactions rose by 32%, reaching 81.5 million. Interestingly, the average transaction fee saw a notable uptick, increasing by 122% QoQ to $0.05, driven by heightened network activity fueled by speculation regarding a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the US. Related Reading: Dogecoin $10 Price Target Back In Play? Here’s What The Charts Say Despite these gains, staked SOL experienced a decrease of 5% in Q4, attributed in part to the FTX estate unlocking its tokens. However, SOL’s market cap itself grew by 27% QoQ to $91 billion, peaking at $120 billion in November. By the end of the quarter, SOL ranked sixth among all cryptocurrencies in market cap, trailing behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether’s USDT, XRP, and Binance Coin (BNB). Currently, SOL is trading at $199, down 22% over the last two weeks, amid growing macroeconomic challenges that are having a significant impact on risk assets.

Although the Cardano price is low at the current level, it is holding up the best in this market’s volatility. Considering the same and the emergence of bullish patterns, analysts anticipate an ADA price rally to $15. Let’s discuss this optimistic outlook. Historical Patterns Hints At Upcoming Cardano Price Rally Cardano price prediction has been a little controversial due to multiple factors affecting this altcoin performance. However, Ali Charts has presented a new outlook on the situation, hinting at the possibility of the rally to $15 in the near future. According to Ali’s X post, ADA is moving through a historical pattern that has produced strong bullish movements in the past. If the pattern continues, a massive 3000% rally could form, as it did in 2021, when the ADA price jumped from $0.12 to $4. However, this took around a year to take shape, and there was a minor consolidation in between. The ADA price chart analysis shows the token entering an accumulation phase. A similar accumulation pattern occurred in 2020-2021, which resulted in a breakout. Given this, the $15 target seems feasible. However, it will depend on many macroeconomic events, global crypto market sentiments, the token’s current movements, and how it recovers from this accumulation phase. How is Cardano Performing Today? The crypto market crash has significantly affected the ADA token, as it has lost nearly 22% of its value over the past week. It currently trades at $0.7545, with a market capitalization of $26.55 billion and a trading volume of $778.76 million, which is down 44% today. This and the 90% drop in the Cardano whale netflow indicate that investor interest is waning. Moreover, many technical indicators hint at bearish sentiments, so analysts anticipate a further decline if the price moves below the key support at $0.6589. In contrast, a recovery above $0.8 could initiate an uptrend. A trading bot has called the current performance a minor correction before pointing out that it is in a global web 3 of the Elliot wave cycle, where its first impulse is to grow from $0.28 to $1.3. More importantly, the bots analysis claims that Cardano’s recent retracement to the 0.5-0.61 Fibonacci retracement zone signifies a bullish reversal. This could result in a bullish momentum and an uptrend. While most alternative coins have broken all-time lows, Cardano’s price remains relatively high. The recent drop looks more like a correction, not a trend reversal. What’s Next for Cardano Price? Considering the AI bot’s Cardano price analysis, the next target for this token is around $3 in the sub-wave 3. A move past that and continuous holding of the historical pattern could result in a massive rally for the $15. However, it would require investors’ confidence in the token and increased adoption, backed by technical factors. More importantly, the $15 trajectory is not a day or week’s journey but would require months of build-up. Investors must monitor the ADA’s performance over time and adjust strategies accordingly.

39983025,https://coingape.com/?p=237379,1738827445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Meme Coin Whales Purchase $16M Worth PEPE & WIF, What’s Next?",https://coingape.com/meme-coin-whales-purchase-16m-worth-pepe-wif-whats-next/,"Meme coin whales nabbed significant market attention amid the recent turbulent landscape, heavily purchasing Pepe coin (PEPE) and Dogwifhat (WIF). On-chain data on Thursday revealed that roughly $16 million worth of the abovementioned tokens were bought from the cryptocurrency exchange behemoth Binance. As an upshot, crypto market enthusiasts anticipate a bullish movement for these meme tokens ahead. Meme Coin Whales Sack 375B PEPE & 15M WIF Tokens Sparking Optimism According to data by Spotonchain on X , meme coin whales scooped massive amounts of the two tokens from Binance on February 5. Data revealed that the whale 0xf37 bagged 375.35 billion PEPE, worth $3.73 million, from the mentioned crypto exchange giant on Thursday. Further, the whale 4x3M8 bought 9 million WIF, worth $7.42 million, from the same exchange within the same period. Also, the whale address A3kTT woke up after 2 years of dormancy to purchase $5.19 million worth of the dog-themed meme token. Altogether, the heavy buying by large-scale investors added a bullish tint to the asset’s future price movements, with usual market sentiments conveying that gains are imminent. Buy-The-Dip Opportunity? Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that the crypto market has seen remarkable volatility recently, with this month proving to be ‘not so good’ for investors. Bitcoin price has lost nearly 6% of its value since January end to date, with altcoins mainly following the waning action with more heat. Dogwifhat, while already in a price slump, witnessed a further 29% drop from January end to date. Following a very similar movement, even Pepe Coin lost nearly 26% in the same period. However, the massive accumulations by whales amid this slump flags a potential buy-the-dip strategy, signaling price gains, and thus recovery is imminent for these leading meme coins . How Are The Meme Coins Performing Amid Rising Whale Activity At the time of reporting, PEPE price witnessed an uptick of nearly 1.5% and exchanged hands at $0.00001035. The coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $0.000009783 and $0.00001044, respectively. While the coin jumps alongside heightened buying, it’s noteworthy that renowned market experts are also projecting bullishness on future movements. Notably, market enthusiast ‘SlumDOGE Millionaire’ recently revealed that he sold all his ETH holdings, thereby going “all in” on the frog-themed meme token. This accumulation, worth nearly 1 billion coins, has garnered additional market optimism surrounding the asset in light of the heightened buying by meme coin whales. Further, renowned crypto enthusiast Jake Gagain also took to X, revealing that the token is going to pump the “hardest in 2025.” Altogether, these developments project immense bullishness on the crypto’s future price action. On the other hand, WIF price tanked roughly 2% intraday despite the massive accumulation and is trading at $0.8099. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.7741 and $0.8505, respectively. Nevertheless, renowned trader ‘The Cryptomist,’ took to X, revealing that the “First target is $1.10” if the token breaks out from the given below ascending triangle. Traders and investors continue to monitor the coin extensively, remaining optimistic about price movements ahead due to burgeoning accumulations.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As market volatility shakes crypto, Solana regains strength while 1Fuel rises as a breakthrough DeFi contender. Table of Contents Solana takes a hit but stands tall: What’s next for SOL? Cross-chain made simple: How 1Fuel eliminates blockchain barriers The hottest presale of 2025? Final thoughts As US tariffs shake global markets, the cryptocurrency sector is facing waves of volatility. But where some see chaos, savvy investors see opportunity. With Solana (SOL) bouncing back from its tariff-induced slump and 1Fuel (OFT) emerging as a game-changing DeFi powerhouse, the market is turning into a buying paradise. Let’s take a closer look at Solana and 1Fuel and what makes them the hottest assets to watch in 2025. Solana takes a hit but stands tall: What’s next for SOL? The announcement of US tariffs has caused ripples in financial markets globally, including cryptocurrency markets. Even well-known players like Solana have been impacted by it. There were notable drops in the overall crypto market. For example, Bitcoin fell from approximately $105,000 to about $92,000, but its value later rose to above $100,000 following a halt in tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. Solana had similar volatility, falling below $195 as market uncertainty increased. Despite these difficulties, Solana remains resilient. With a little rebound, SOL is trading at around $202.58 as of writing. According to analysts, despite the continued volatility of the market, Solana might be well-positioned for future profits owing to its strong technology and expanding ecosystem. Because market dynamics are still shaped by geopolitical tensions and policy decisions, investors should continue to monitor macroeconomic trends closely. Diversification and an emphasis on projects with solid fundamentals may help guard against such external shocks.

With its most anticipated one-click cross-chain transaction, 1Fuel lets its users move assets across blockchains with one click. This feature removes the need for many wallets and lowers extra costs, making trading faster and simpler. The platform also takes privacy seriously. It provides a built-in mixer, disposable wallets, and offline storage for extra security. These tools help users feel safe while managing their digital assets, giving 1Fuel an edge over its competitors. The hottest presale of 2025? The crypto world is buzzing with news about 1Fuel’s ongoing presale as it shows great performance. The presale has raised over $1.8 million. Now, in Stage 3, 1Fuel tokens are priced at $0.017 with a 20% bonus for buyers. Analysts forecast that it could grow 100x after its launch making it a great pick for early investors. The presale includes 50% of 1Fuel’s total supply of 1 billion tokens. This helps fund development, marketing, and operations. Investors now have the chance to buy at the lowest price while supporting the project’s growth. Analysts call it a smart move because demand is high, and tokens are limited. With more people joining the presale, 1Fuel is one of the most talked-about projects in 2025. Its focus on fixing real problems and its stellar presale performance show why the crypto world is excited about this soon-to-be-launched project. Final thoughts The crypto market is evolving fast, and those who act early stand to win big. While Solana proves its resilience, 1Fuel is stealing the show with technology and a presale that’s selling out rapidly. With a 100x potential and solutions that fix real-world problems, 1Fuel is more than just another project. To learn more about 1Fuel, visit the website, Telegram, and Twitter .

39983267,https://crypto.news/?p=14334206,1738827974,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/39983267.jpeg,Solana’s Pump.fun hit with cease and desist over alleged IP violations,https://crypto.news/solanas-pump-fun-hit-with-cease-and-desist-over-alleged-ip-violations/,"Solana-based meme coin deployer Pump.fun continues to draw legal heat as recent allegations claim some tokens launched on the platform violated intellectual property rights. On Feb. 5, Pump.fun a cease and desist letter was issued against Pump.fun by U.S. law firms Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP, demanding the removal of several meme coins allegedly misusing their names and logos. A cease and desist letter is a formal legal notice demanding that an individual or entity immediately stop an alleged unlawful activity to avoid further legal action. The letter demands the “immediate removal of the Dogshit2 token” and other tokens that the firms claim were created to impersonate them. It further accuses Pump.fun of enabling these unauthorized deployments and failing to act despite having the technical ability to do so. According to law firms, these actions not only violate their intellectual property but also contribute to deceptive market practices, putting investors at risk. To date, Pump.fun users have created hundreds of tokens, including those themed around Burwick Law, Wolf Popper LLP, and Burwick’s managing partner, Max Burwick. Meme coins themed around Burwick Law and Max Burwick | Source: Pump.fun You might also like: Second lawsuit hits Pump.fun as legal pressure over meme coins intensifies Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP also claim that Pump.fun played a role in broader efforts to “intimidate our clients and interfere with ongoing litigation.” They point to meme coins designed to impersonate plaintiffs in the lawsuit, arguing that this represents “the use of blockchain technologies as a tool for disrupting justice and due process.” “Any further unauthorized use of our firms’ names, intellectual property, or association with this token may result in immediate legal action,” a part of the cease and desist letter warned. The cease and desist letter follows two class-action lawsuits against Pump.fun, both led by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP on behalf of investors. The first case, filed on Jan. 16, targeted the sale of the Peanut the Squirrel token, alleging it was an unregistered security promoted through influencer-driven hype. The second lawsuit , filed on Jan. 30, expanded the allegations, naming Pump.fun’s operator, Baton Corporation Ltd, and key figures behind the platform. According to the complaint, Pump.fun allegedly profited from a pump-and-dump business model by aggressively marketing meme tokens that later lost a significant portion of its value. Plaintiff Diego Aguilar claimed he suffered losses after purchasing tokens like Fwog and Griffain, which were initially pushed to high valuations before their prices plummeted. The complaint also accused Pump.fun of extracting nearly $500 million in fees from traders while running a scheme that allegedly mirrors elements of Ponzi structures. However, the case took an unexpected turn when community members analyzed Exhibit C of the lawsuit, which demonstrated how easily tokens can be created on Pump.fun. Dog Shit Going NoWhere (DOGSHIT2) became the center of controversy after some community members discovered a wallet address mentioned in the firms’ lawsuit against Pump.fun matched the one associated with DOGSHIT2. This led to speculation that Burwick and Law may have deployed the token to strengthen its case. Those holding the meme coin, meanwhile, have benefited from the controversy, as DOGSHIT2 surged over 170% in the past 24 hours, reaching an all-time high of $0.01437 on Feb. 6—hours after the cease and desist letter was issued. As of publication time, Pump.fun has yet to issue an official statement regarding the allegations or respond to the cease and desist letter.

Two South Korean crypto exchanges announced that they will start providing trading support for new layer1 blockchain Berachain’s upcoming token, BERA. Trading support on both exchanges will start simultaneously on Feb. 6 at 22:00 KST. Users can only deposit and withdraw BERA through the new Berachain mainnet that will be launched on the same day as its token. Berachain is an Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine-compatible layer 1 blockchain which is equipped with a Proof-of-Liquidity consensus mechanism. Bithumb offers trading support for BERA only on its Korean won markets. Additionally, buy and sell orders for BERA will be restricted for the first five minutes of trading and at a limit of less than 10% and more than 100% of the standard price. Automatic orders can begin after the first transaction is completed. On Upbit, BERA will be available for trading with Korean won, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Tether ( USDT ). However, the exchange also warned users that the trading support start time may change depending on whether BERA has enough liquidity for trading. Berachain started off as an NFT project called Bong Bears, but has since grown into a whole blockchain ecosystem that is scheduled to make its debut on Feb. 6.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the lives of early investors with its groundbreaking returns, and Ethereum (ETH) reshaped the crypto world with its smart contracts. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1.5 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity. Secure Your Position Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale and massive growth projections, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly becoming the most talked-about investment of 2025.

Arkham recently added 22,000 Satoshi addresses to its database, listing total holdings of 1.096 million BTC. Arkham relies on Sergio Lerner’s Patoshi Pattern theory, which exploits three privacy-related flaws of v.01, an early Bitcoin protocol, to pinpoint blocks that were likely mined by Satoshi. Lerner’s theory argues that a single miner mined about 22,000 of the early Bitcoin blocks. Lerner also says Satoshi was likely mining during the time, and that there is “evidence that links the Patoshi patterns to Satoshi, based on public information sources and the blockchain.” Holdings of more than $107 billion would make Nakamoto the 15th-richest person in the world on paper, ahead of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, per Forbes’ real-time billionaires list . Coinbase director Conor Grogan combed through Arkham’s findings and noted that one of the Patoshi addresses received BTC from Cavirtex, a Canadian exchange. Grogan also notes Cavirtex was bought by Kraken in 2016. “As such, there is a chance that [Kraken co-founder] Jesse Powell has information on the true identity behind Satoshi, if they maintained any KYC information on this wallet. My advice to him would be to delete the data.” After Grogan posted his findings on the social media platform X, Kraken’s official account replied “We are all Satoshi.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The global market capitalization is standing at $3.21 trillion, after declining by 0.08% in the past day. At the same time, the overall trading volume has also dropped by 36.88% reaching $122.2 billion. This trend clearly shows that market players are responding cautiously because of price volatility. Even with this careful outlook, a few new coins are demonstrating potential. These tokens have already seen significant percentage increases, and their momentum indicates they might be among the top-performing assets this month. February’s 5 Most Promising New Coins To Turn $1,000 to $100,000 Although the cryptocurrency market can be erratic, these five new cryptocurrencies have shown notable growth metrics. Let’s have a closer look at SORA GROK (GROK), Minotaurus (MTAUR), Book of Meme 3.0 (BOME), HIPPOP (HIP), and Fartboy (FARTBOY). 1. SORA GROK (GROK) At a current price of $0.0002793, SORA GROK has experienced a 135.60% increase within the past 24 hours. This increase in price indicates robust investor enthusiasm, especially regarding its AI-driven video creation platform that converts basic text prompts into engaging videos. With a total supply of 100 billion GROK tokens, the currency is gaining popularity within the Ethereum ecosystem, appealing to creators and innovators eager to utilize AI in Web3 media. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR) Minotaurus (MTAUR) is a blockchain-based crypto asset currently in presale. Buyers with a preference for early-stage cryptocurrencies are capitalizing on its presale price of 0.00010503 USDT, with the projected listing price expected to be around $0.00020 USDT—a potential 3x gain at launch. The presale has already raised over $1.5 millioin USDT, indicating strong early interest. With a $100,000 USDT giveaway and an ecosystem focused on in-game rewards and referrals, MTAUR presents a lucrative opportunity for those looking to invest in gaming tokens before they hit the mainstream market. 3. Book of Meme 3.0 (BOME) BOME is a new coin making waves with an 585.57% increase in a single day, propelling its price to $0.0102687 and boosting its market cap to $12.1 million. This surge is largely fueled by its unique approach—combining memes, decentralized storage, and the degen crypto culture. With a 2000% spike in 24-hour trading volume, it’s evident that investors see value in its blockchain-based archive of internet humor. Over the past month, BOME has also grown by 108.37%, showcasing its long-term potential, as one of the best meme coins to buy . 4. HIPPOP (HIP) HIPPOP is capitalizing on the digital transformation of cultural arts and live performances using blockchain. Over the past 24 hours, it has skyrocketed 143.42%, now sitting at $0.001777. Even more, its 7-day growth stands at 168.68%, demonstrating sustained investor confidence. HIPPOP features a smart ticketing system, event aggregator, and digital goods marketplace. This positions it as a game-changer in the entertainment industry. By providing a decentralized platform, HIPPOP enables artists and fans to connect and transact seamlessly. HIPPOP (HIP) price chart 5. Fartboy ($FARTBOY) Inspired by the popular Fartboy comic series, this new coin has rapidly gained popularity in the cryptocurrency world. With a price of $0.08954, it boasts a market cap of $91.85 million and experienced an 87.33% increase within just 24 hours. In the last week, Fartboy has risen by 232.98%, nearing its historical peak of $0.09361. This rapid ascent is driven by a growing community of more than 100,000 members, recent listings on exchanges, and a robust meme-oriented brand identity that maintains investor interest. Final Thoughts The cryptocurrency market might be experiencing a downturn, yet these new coins are bucking the trend with commendable growth and creative applications. Although high-risk investments necessitate thorough research, the potential benefits of these tokens could be transformative. Will February be the month you make significant progress in crypto?

Meanwhile, Public Citizen called for a federal investigation into Donald Trump’s promotion of his own TRUMP meme coin due to potential ethics violations and foreign influence concerns. Despite these controversies, the CFTC, under acting chair Caroline Pham, announced a shift away from regulation by enforcement. Pump.fun Faces Allegations of Investor Fraud and IP Misuse Pump.fun, the Solana-based meme coin creation platform, is facing legal trouble after receiving a cease and desist letter from US law firms Burwick Law and Wolf Popper. The firms allege that Pump.fun has been allowing the creation of tokens that unlawfully use their names and logos, along with those of their employees and clients involved in an ongoing lawsuit against the platform. Burwick Law stated on social media that it demanded the immediate removal of Dog Shit Going NoWhere (DOGSHIT2) and other tokens that impersonate the firms due to the unlicensed use of intellectual property. Managing Partner Max Burwick stated that since the class-action filing last week, over 200 infringing tokens have been created using their and their co-counsel’s branding. Despite the apparent financial and legal risks, Burwick Law claims that Pump.fun has the technical capability to remove these tokens but chose not to act. The cease and desist letter also accuses Pump.fun of working with third parties to intimidate plaintiffs and interfere with ongoing litigation. The firm even alleged that blockchain technology is being weaponized to disrupt justice and due process, and believes the creation of meme coins that impersonate plaintiffs is part of these efforts. Baton, the UK-based company allegedly behind Pump.fun, has not commented on the allegations yet. Burwick also addressed the speculation that his firm created DOGSHIT2 as part of its case against Pump.fun. He denied any involvement, and explained that the token previously existed only as “memory on the server” and was only deployed on-chain when a buyer purchased it. The legal battle stems from a proposed class-action lawsuit that was filed on Jan. 30 by investor Diego Aguilar in a New York federal court. The lawsuit claims that every token created on Pump.fun is an unregistered security and that the platform generated close to $500 million in fees through its operations. The complaint also accuses Pump.fun of using aggressive guerilla marketing tactics to create artificial urgency around highly volatile tokens, which led to major losses for retail investors. The plaintiffs are seeking rescission of all token purchases, monetary damages for affected investors, and litigation costs. Pump.fun weekly volume (Source: Dune Analytics ) Despite the mounting legal challenges, Pump.fun is still seeing very impressive activity. Last week, the platform recorded an all-time high of $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume . This success was mainly driven by the launch of Trump family-themed meme coins. Public Citizen Calls for Probe Into TRUMP Meme Coin Meme coins are also causing some trouble for US President Donald Trump. Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization, recently called for a federal investigation into Donald Trump’s promotion of his meme coin. In a letter to the US Department of Justice and the Office of Government Ethics, the organization accused Trump of soliciting gifts while in office, which is an action that may breach federal laws. The letter urged officials to investigate whether foreign state actors were purchasing the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin and whether his promotion of the token constituted an improper solicitation. Public Citizen also referred to a 2012 Congressional Research Service report, and acknowledged that US presidents are largely exempt from restrictions on receiving gifts, but still pointed out that Trump’s actions may still violate ethical guidelines if he solicited funds. The organization pointed to his continued promotion of the meme coin on his social media platform, Truth Social, and suggested that he was asking for money in exchange for nothing of tangible value, which could constitute an ethics violation. For now, the legal implications of these accusations are still very uncertain, especially considering the 2024 US Supreme Court decision that granted presidents presumptive immunity from prosecution for official acts. Even if the Justice Department or the Office of Government Ethics determined that Trump violated federal laws, he could be shielded from prosecution unless the meme coin promotion is classified as an unofficial act. Public Citizen Financial Policy Advocate Bartlett Naylor stated that the organization is exploring other legal avenues. Public Citizen called for several measures, including the termination of the meme coin sale and the return of funds to investors. TRUMP was launched on Jan. 17, and its market cap initially surged past $15 billion in under 48 hours before dropping. Concerns over the token’s management have also grown, Many lawmakers and industry figures raised alarms about the possibility of a rug pull, given that the team behind the project holds about 80% of the total supply. CFTC Shifts Focus Away From Regulation by Enforcement It will be interesting to see how these cases play out, especially after Caroline Pham, the acting chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), announced that the agency will be moving away from its practice of regulation by enforcement. This kind of shift is expected to greatly impact its approach to crypto firms under the Trump administration. CFTC announcement In a statement on Feb. 4, Pham outlined a restructuring of the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, and shared that the regulator will be more focused on fraud rather than regulatory enforcement against compliant entities. The commission will now divide its responsibilities between two task forces, one targeting retail fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and the other addressing complex fraud and market manipulation. Acting enforcement director Brian Young stated that the new structure will allow the commission to focus on securing justice for victims and maintaining confidence in financial markets. The policy shift is one of Pham’s first major decisions since stepping in as acting chair on Jan. 20 after the resignation of Rostin Behnam. It is still unclear whom President Donald Trump will nominate as Behnam’s replacement. The CFTC’s enforcement track record includes securing more than $17 billion in monetary relief in fiscal year 2024, largely due to its actions against the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. The agency also pursued enforcement actions against major industry figures like Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, former Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich, and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. Pham also announced plans for public roundtable discussions to engage industry leaders on market issues, including digital assets. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the CFTC is currently investigating Super Bowl-related bets offered by Crypto.com and betting platform Kalshi ahead of the championship game on Feb. 9.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-06 09:05:55
39985739,https://nulltx.com/?p=143899,1738832887,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,WazirX Creditors Face Tough Choice in Upcoming Restructuring Vote,https://nulltx.com/wazirx-creditors-face-tough-choice-in-upcoming-restructuring-vote/,"Creditors of WazirX are set to make the call on the fate of the exchange’s restructuring plan—specifically, whether to approve a proposal that could see as much as 2 billion U.S. dollars in stolen crypto assets returned to investors by April 2025. But the plan’s approval seems far from assured; indeed, some observers see the controversy around it as having already turned it into a “Crisis of Credibility.” The Restructuring Vote: A Critical Decision Creditor votes will determine whether WazirX can implement its restructuring plan. For the plan to move forward, 75% of creditors (by value) must approve it. If WazirX gets approval, lost crypto holdings could start being returned to creditors by 2025. If the plan is rejected, the alternative appears to be a long legal slog that might (or might not) end in 2030 with a fiat-based payout to creditors. The vote has been portrayed by the exchange as a key event in its major comeback to the market. But instead of offering a clear-cut recovery scheme, WazirX has put forth two unpleasant options for its users to choose from: 1. Vote “Yes” – Back the reorganization plan of the exchange, which entails setting up a new decentralized exchange (DEX) and hoping that it can recover the lost assets. Users would have to trust WazirX to pull this off—but can they? 2. Cast your vote for “No” – Disapprove the proposed plan and anticipate receiving a payout in fiat currency via the liquidation process. That could take several years, with a payoff stretching from now (2023) to as late as 2030. Both choices involve considerable unpredictability, and many users sense that they are caught in a situation where they inevitably lose in the end, no matter what the result is. A Lack of Clear Guarantees The restructuring proposal has raised major concerns due to the absence of strong guarantees. And even should the vote pass, there are no real assurances that the newly structured DEX model will recover lost assets. The exchange has not laid out a clear roadmap that details just how funds will be recovered and returned to the users who were most affected. The timeline also remains unclear. WazirX states that creditors could start receiving their crypto in April 2025, but the specifics remain murky. How much of the taken funds will actually be returned? And will it be returned in full or in part? This and more has left a lot of creditors in the dark and naturally skeptical of whether this proposal is in their best interests. Two paths, two very different outcomes. Here's a breakdown of what happens if the Scheme is approved versus if it isn't. Understand what to expect in both scenarios as we approach the voting process. pic.twitter.com/ZcXpC8g79Q — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) February 4, 2025 A Questionable Attempt at a Comeback This restructuring plan is an attempt by WazirX to regain user trust and reestablish itself as a player in the crypto market. To many, though, this effort seems little more than a smokescreen to give the appearance of a real effort replacing the last effort that led to a serious user falloff. The proposal essentially requests that creditors place their faith in the same entity that originally failed them. WazirX hopes to rebuild its operations and, in turn, recover lost assets by refocusing on a new DEX business model. However, given past mismanagement and security failures, many users question whether this is just another gamble with their funds. In addition, the other option—waiting for a fiat payout through liquidation—carries its own array of risks. When a cryptocurrency exchange fails, creditors can’t be certain what assets they’ll be able to recoup or when they’ll see any kind of payout. The situation can worsen when the exchange’s home country has no clear laws about how to handle such failures. Indeed, some fear that the creditors in a liquidation scenario could end up waiting years for a portion of the assets to be paid out and that by the time it arrives, the value of the assets could have plummeted. The Community’s Response As the voting deadline nears, discussions among WazirX creditors are intensifying. Many users have told us they are upset about being put in a position where they must vote on a no-win scenario, either choosing an uncertain recovery plan or opting for a long and likely unsuccessful legal fight. Some say that voting “Yes” at least gives a chance—however slim—that they might get their assets back in a timely manner. Others say that rejecting the plan is the only way to make WazirX answer for its past failures and to ensure it doesn’t get the user funds back under the pretext of a new business model. No matter what the outcome turns out to be, it is crystal clear that confidence in WazirX has taken a serious hit. How this exchange manages this crisis will, of course, affect its future, but it has certainly given many reason to wonder if it can ever be a trustworthy platform again. Conclusion Creditors face a challenging choice with WazirX’s restructuring vote. The chance of getting back lost crypto by April 2025 is enticing, but with no guarantees and much doubt about the exchange’s ability to pull off a recovery, those voting may not be confident in what they’re approving. On the other hand, if they choose to reject the proposal, they might be looking at 2030 for a rumored “buyout” that would pay them back in fiat currency, a fact that makes many feel justifiably frustrated and uncertain. The balance of WazirX’s future is now in the hands of creditors who will soon cast their votes. It’s hard to see a path forward that doesn’t involve some sort of crisis management. And in the end, what was trust becomes something else entirely—regaining trust after a breach is tougher than managing the crisis in the first place. For now, the users of WazirX have only two options to choose from—what they choose is largely a matter of faith. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

""Stop Sales, Return Investors' Money!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trump-statement-from-a-major-us-corporation-stop-sales-return-investors-money/,"US President Donald Trump gained huge support with his positive approach towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and eventually launched his own token. Trump, who launched the memecoin named Official Trump (TRUMP) a few days before his official inauguration, has been much talked about with this move and is also at the center of discussions. Because TRUMP price experienced a big pump after its launch, but this situation did not last long. TRUMP, which experienced a big collapse in a short time, left its investors in the lurch. As the controversy surrounding TRUMP continues, Public Citizen, a US-based non-profit think tank, has called for a federal investigation into Donald Trump’s introduction of the TRUMP token. Public Citizen also called on Trump to investigate posts on social media promoting memecoins. Related News: A Citizen Complained About Donald Trump and His Wife Melania Trump to CİMER! ""What They Wrote Surprised!"" Public Citizen made these requests in a letter to John Keller, Chief of the Public Integrity Section of the U.S. Department of Justice, and David Huitema, Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). In the letter, Public Citizen alleged that Trump violated federal law by continuing to post on Truth Social and encouraging his followers to purchase memecoins. At this point, the organization called on authorities to investigate the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin and whether foreign state actors purchased the token. “It seems that Trump is not asking for money in exchange for an investment or a tangible product , but for money in exchange for nothing; that is, he is asking for a gift that will benefit him personally.” Public Citizen has recently demanded that the sale of TRUMP be terminated and that everyone who purchased TRUMP be refunded. *This is not investment advice.

The White House announced Wednesday that it will cancel all federal agency subscriptions to Politico Pro. This announcement follows claims suggesting the news outlet received funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Official Rationale and Spending Records White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated during a briefing that taxpayer dollars will no longer be used to “subsidize” Politico. Yet, official spending records show the payments were for valid subscriptions purchased by various federal agencies, not direct government funding. The controversy began when Kyle Becker, a public commentator, linked a temporary payroll issue at Politico to USAID funding.

In fact, on some days, they may be moving more money around than centralized exchanges are. And what storms may blow through the cryptocurrency space, DEXs seem unlikely to shut down any time soon. Uniswap Leads the Pack with V4 Boost Uniswap has established itself as the leading force among the various automated market makers (AMMs) in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space. The protocol holds 37.6% of the market share, with a jaw-dropping $27.15 billion in trading volume recorded over the past week. A big part of this volume likely stems from the launch of Uniswap V4 and its plethora of improvements that optimize for not just trading efficiency but also liquidity management. The latest iteration of Uniswap, V4, has introduced an even more flexible liquidity pool structure, one from which traders can now derive enhanced capital efficiency and reduced transaction fees. In the crypto bear market of 2022, Uniswap’s trading volume was down, but even then, it was still at the forefront of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector — a position it amplified in 2023 with its accumulation of even more trading volume. PancakeSwap and Aerodrome Gain Traction In spite of Uniswap’s top position, other DEX platforms are carving out fresh spaces in the market. PancakeSwap has surged ahead to capture 34% of this market. Its trading volume in the last week alone was an impressive $25 billion. That’s a figure that trails only behind Uniswap in the aggregate numbers from DappRadar and comparable platforms. Low fees and a strong presence on Binance Smart Chain make this platform a trader’s pick for swaps. At the same time, Aerodrome, a burgeoning star in the Layer 2 DeFi world, has acquired significant adoption. Deploying on the Base L2 network, Aerodrome commands 8.4% of the overall market and has achieved $6 billion in trading volume. Its swift ascent underlines the growing ineluctability of Layer 2s, which promise to alleviate the mainnet bottleneck and make for a more usable Ethereum, in their own right and as a part of the Ethereum ecosystem. Curve Finance and 0xFluid Enter the Spotlight The platform known for trading and providing liquidity for stablecoins—Curve Finance—remains a strong player in the decentralized exchange (DEX) landscape. Over the past week, users executed trades worth $3.5 billion on the platform, making it the fifth-largest DEX by trading volume. Curve receives most of its trading volume from not-so-stable stablecoins, with most of its users opting for low-slippage trades. This makes it an efficient and well-functioning platform for the types of assets and transactions that it specializes in. Also, the up-and-coming platform 0xFluid has emerged as a noteworthy contender, accumulating around $2 billion in trading volume during the same stretch. As a relatively fresh player, 0xFluid’s ascent emphasizes the increasing need for innovative DEX solutions that proffer distinct trading capabilities and better liquidity models. EVM Chains Maintain a Strong Market Presence The supremacy of chains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) shows no signs of wavering. These networks together hold an impressive 33.3% of the overall market. This ubiquity speaks to the advantages enjoyed by EVM-based solutions: interoperability with other blockchains, plentiful and deep liquidity pools, and extensive support from a large developer community. Ongoing fluctuations in the larger crypto market have not affected DEX trading volumes. In fact, those volumes keep rising, indicating a persistent appetite for decentralized finance. Traders in this thriving world seem less concerned with market crashes than some central party might wish. Instead, they keep executing trades—efficiently and securely—on AMMs. These traders are clearly choosing to sidestep centralized exchanges in favor of a non-custodial, blockchain-friendly world that seems to be getting bigger rather than smaller. Despite the market downturn, DEX trading volume is still going strong – $13.79B traded in last 24h – $73B traded in 7d – EVM chains controlling 33.3% of the overall market share Who is the leading AMM in 2025? @Uniswap controls 37.6% of the market with $27.15B traded in… pic.twitter.com/cMvCci4kTh — aniutah (@migbassi) February 4, 2025 The Future of DEX Trading The DeFi field keeps changing, and decentralized exchanges keep appearing. Uniswap has its V4 version, and PancakeSwap is also doing some stuff to look pretty; however, Aerodrome has taken the cake in looks and functions, while Curve Finance is just aiming to be the go-to platform for stablecoins. My opinion? With most projects in DeFi, you can build your house (if you know how) or paint it, but be ready for the ugly mugs of the, anyway, not-so-nice goons that insist on guarding the DeFi neighborhood. Innovations like Layer 2 scaling solutions, advanced liquidity management, and reduced transaction costs are probably going to drive the next growth phase of DEX platforms. Meanwhile, newer players in the space like 0xFluid are carving out their own niches and showing that there’s still plenty of room for disruption and differentiation in this rapidly expanding ecosystem. The strength of DEX trading volumes in a tough market simply demonstrates (and delivers) more good news for these DEXs. They are bringing trading closer to users by refining and evolving their platforms and offerings and pushing much-needed innovation within the crypto space. If DEX trading volumes remain strong, despite these market conditions, it’s because we as industry players need to pay close attention to these platforms and their forth coming innovations.

Movements worth noting are a surge in market valuation, expansion in network engagement, and a growing share of mind. Over the past 24 hours, the market has only dipped 0.4%, but the overall valuation has shot up from $6.97 billion to $7.78 billion. And you know what that tells me? It says sustained and even deepening interest from investors, even when the engagement metrics are, shall we say, a bit wobbly. Solana and Base Lead the Network Race Even with the uncertainty in the overall market, Solana remains at the forefront of this agentic revolution. Its ecosystem holds $4.03 billion. We see it as growing in absolutely and relatively growing preferredness. Preferredness as a term connotes how Peyton refers to this at least in her blog post, in not-with-coinciding-choice forms, whereby we see entities preferring Solana to Ethereum, say. Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution, Base, occupies the space in 2023 as the second-largest network in the agentic space. It has $2.91 billion in value being processed, which is up 1.17% over the past 24 hours. The signals emitted from Base’s recent growth tell us that it is rapidly becoming a more prominent part of the overall ecosystem—and especially the part of the ecosystem where developers are looking for ways to efficiently scale AI-driven applications. Mindshare Sees Notable Shifts The last 24 hours have seen a huge change in mindshare rankings. Although @aixbt_agent still leads in total conversations, it has seen a decline in mindshare of 3.93%, which now stands at 7.72%. This appears to be a sign that other projects are quantifiably receiving more of the community’s attention. Between them, @FartCoinOfSOL has kept significant traction, commanding a 6.03% mindshare despite a 5.8% decline in the past 24 hours. @Toshi_base has also seen a slight dip of 0.12%, now holding a 1.82% share of the discussion. Yet, a few initiatives have made headway over the last 24 hours. For example, @henlo has seen a 1.16% increase, now holding a 5.16% share of mind. @griffaindotcom has risen 0.8% to 5.07% mindshare, and @ai16zdao is really bringing it with a 2.13% increase to 4.12% mindshare. Other headway-making projects include: – @virtuals_io: +1.28% to 3.83% – @AlphaArc4k: +2.06% to 3.6% – @swarmnode: +0.88% to 2.16% – @luna_virtuals: +1.59% to 2.06% What is cooking in the agentic landscape in last 24h? – Overall market is still down but at a margin loss in last 24h (0.4%) – Market valuation now sits $7.78B (surged from $6.97B from 24h ago) – Smart engagement is at 7.9k down 7.98% in 24h – Still in blistering form,… pic.twitter.com/PuMZ9Kb143 — aniutah (@migbassi) February 5, 2025 Weekly Mindshare Battle Sees @FartCoinOfSOL Take the Lead Although @aixbt_agent continues to be the top daily discussion topic, the weekly battle for mindshare shows a completely different story. @FartCoinOfSOL has surged ahead and now commands an astounding 10.32% of all agentic conversations. In the meantime, @aixbt_agent is a close contender, claiming 9.13% of the weekly discussion volume. This change appears to show a developing divergence between traders and developers, with projects like @FartCoinOfSOL pulling more and more weight in conversations. What’s Next for the Agentic Landscape? The last 24 hours show that the overall market remains uncertain, but the agentic sector continues to thrive, with shifting leadership in both network activity and mindshare. Solana and Base are still key players, but individual projects are seeing fluctuating levels of engagement that suggest a constant recalibration of focus by market participants. Weekly trends are favoring @FartCoinOfSOL, and daily movements are favoring the rise of newer players in the cryptocurrency landscape. The next few days could bring further shifts in dominance. As the industry engages in a collective battle for both market and mindshare, one thing is for certain: the established leaders will have their hands full if they hope to maintain control, and it’s just as likely that we’ll see a few emerging projects continue to blast upward and into the open air. The ecosystem of agents is highly dynamic for now, offering both opportunities and dangers for traders, developers, and investors. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The total initial supply of BERA is 500 million tokens, with 48.9% allocated for community engagement, including airdrops, ecosystem development, and research. The airdrop distribution included testnet users, social media participants, and other community members. Token allocations can be viewed on the Berachain airdrop checker as of Thursday morning and can be claimed using various EVM wallets like Metamask and OKX Wallet. “The BERA token distribution includes an airdrop of 15.75% to Berachain community members, applications, liquidity providers and more as recognition of their contributions to an incredibly robust pre-launch ecosystem, and their role in helping to make the fake chain real,” a Berachain post reads. Pre-launch markets for BERA values the token at $8, giving the airdrop a value of $632 million and the network a $4 billion market capitalization based on current speculation. These values are expected to shift wildly within 24 hours after BERA goes live. The upcoming blockchain uses a proof-of-liquidity consensus mechanism to reward liquidity provision. In the past year, it has gained a cult following and an engaged social media community — with a catchphrase questioning if the chain ""was even real?""

Yet, some are more profit-tales than others—these spark the most conversation, and they have recently gotten me thinking about two specific cases. They are outrageous profit stories in the same way that the stories of people who make millions by flipping houses are outrageous. In my mind, they occupy the same space as rags-to-riches yarns. You know the type: “I once had no money, but now I’m a multi-millionaire living large on an island!” We’ve all heard profits like these work their magic. A Life-Changing Trade or Just Another Gamble? This trader, as recorded on the blockchain, first bought 108,614,413 $SSE tokens with a 9.35 SOL (about $1,854) investment on the decentralized trading platform Pump.fun. Despite the fact that meme coins and speculative tokens tend to have very unstable values, this one has gone through the roof. It now sits at a profit of $2.28 million, with the trader having sold not even one token. Keep an eye on this trader, who may be holding out for yet another profit surge. A trader has turned $1,854 into $2.28M on $SSE . This trader has bought 108,614,413 $SSE for 9.35 $SOL ($1,854), on #PumpFun . The trader hasn't sold any tokens yet and currently has a floating profit of $2.28M What do you think? Insider or lucky gamble? Address:… pic.twitter.com/UT1rTDCfKS — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) February 5, 2025 With profits of this magnitude, speculation is only natural. Is this trader just an exceptionally lucky player in the crypto lottery, or is there a chance that this person is involved in insider trading? There’s no clear evidence to suggest that this is the case, but the investment’s timing and size have some folks wondering if inside info gave this trader an edge. $SSE Gains Traction with LBank Listing One key element driving $SSE’s swift ascent is its recent debut on LBank, a worldwide crypto trading platform lauded for lending a hand to fresh, nascent undertakings. The aftermath of this occurrence has been one of heightened focus, intensified trading activity, and an inexplicable allure that has caused some to refer to it as a “moonshot.” Solana Social Explorer ($SSE) has established itself in the blockchain ecosystem as the first trading platform to track and certify social blockchain data from the top traders. It offers automated tools and insights that empower users to implement data-driven strategies aimed at improving the performance of their token trades. With the interest in social trading and on-chain analytics only intensifying, $SSE’s unique proposition almost guarantees its fast adoption among traders. New #listing $SSE (Solana Social Explorer) will be listed on LBank！ @usetapestry Solana Social Explorer is the first trading platform that tracks & confirms social blockchain data from top traders, powering users with automated tools and insights to optimize token… pic.twitter.com/2bPHE8l0Xo — LBank.com (@LBank_Exchange) February 5, 2025 Market Reactions and the Future of $SSE The cryptographic community is divided about the legitimacy of such explosive gains. While some community members believe that the situation represents a well-calculated gamble that paid off, others express skepticism. For them, the exploding price of the tokens raises all kinds of red flags. They point to the show’s somewhat suspicious setup and possible premeditated market moves. And there’s a real worry that it could all end with a coordinated effort to crash the token price. No matter what the trader means to convey, $SSE’s success underscores the increasing weight of social trading and blockchain analysis. If the platform keeps the wind at its back, it might take root in the Solana space as a resource for traders keen on gaining a market edge. At this point, the trader’s assets are still unscathed. This lets the market have fun speculating about what comes next. Will they convert that unrealized profit to a realized one and take some sweet, sweet cash out of the market? Or will they press their luck and hope for even greater gains? Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A social media personality known as “Bitcoin Dad” has painted a grim picture for XRP’s future, projecting a near-total collapse in value within the next decade. Meanwhile, his outlook for Bitcoin remains sky-high, with price targets that place BTC in a class of its own. 10 million XRP to Buy a 2014 Ford Focus Recently, Bitcoin Dad took to X to forecast XRP’s value in 2035 , suggesting it would take 10 million XRP to buy a 2014 Ford Focus—a car currently selling for approximately $8,000 in the used market. This calculation implies that XRP would be priced at an astonishingly low $0.0008 per token, representing a staggering 99.9% decline from its current valuation of $2.4. This pessimistic outlook comes as XRP has seen notable market activity. Its price has surged over 560% from cycle lows to challenge its all-time high of $3.4. Some analysts remain confident in its future, with price targets exceeding $10 in the current cycle. Despite this optimism, XRP remains a controversial asset among Bitcoin maximalists, who often argue that its supply dynamics pose a risk to investors. Their core concern stems from Ripple’s significant control over the asset, as the company reportedly holds over 40% of the total XRP supply—a fact that maximalists see as a red flag. Bitcoin’s Dominance Projected to Soar While Bitcoin Dad has predicted doom for XRP, his forecasts for Bitcoin are radically different. He envisions BTC’s purchasing power increasing dramatically over the next decade, presenting a future where a handful of bitcoins could buy military-grade assets. In one instance, he suggests that 6.15 BTC could be enough to purchase an M1 Abrams tank—a machine valued at around $19 million. This estimate translates to a projected Bitcoin price of $3 million per coin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In another scenario, he claims that 100 BTC would be sufficient to buy a U.S. nuclear submarine priced between $2 billion and $5 billion. At the lower end of that range, this would value Bitcoin at $20 million per coin by 2035. Ripple’s Push for Legitimacy A long-standing rivalry between Bitcoin loyalists and XRP enthusiasts has reached new heights, fueled by recent revelations about Ripple’s top leadership. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has reportedly met with Donald Trump’s inner circle, pushing for XRP’s inclusion in a potential US cryptocurrency reserve. A decision that could have far-reaching implications for the crypto landscape. This push for official recognition has only intensified the divide, as Bitcoin proponents remain staunchly opposed to XRP’s centralized nature and Ripple’s influence over its distribution. The Battle for Crypto Supremacy Continues Bitcoin maximalists, who believe BTC is the only true decentralized digital asset, and XRP supporters, who argue that the asset’s utility in cross-border payments justifies its place in the market, are fighting an ideological battle unlikely to end anytime soon. As the market evolves and regulations take shape, one thing remains certain—bold predictions like these will continue to fuel debate and speculation in the ever-dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.

While the flagship cryptocurrency is momentarily expected to continue its horizontal trajectory, some analysts forecast that BTC’s next leg up might start once it reclaims the recently lost key level. Related Reading: Memecoins Crowned As ‘Defining Narrative Of 2024’, What’s The Next Key Sector To Watch? Bitcoin Volatility Lower Than Q1 2024 The post-election pump saw the crypto market jump to new highs, with Bitcoin leading the climb. Two months ago, the flagship cryptocurrency crossed the $100,000 barrier for the first time, hitting $108,000 in mid-December. However, the market has seen several significant shakeouts since then, which has halted investors’ sentiment. Following its December peak, the flagship crypto recorded a 14% retrace, sending its price to the lower zone of its $90,000-$108,000 post-election range. In early January, BTC recorded a similar pullback after reclaiming the $100,000, falling nearly 13% before rebounding. Mid-month, Bitcoin retraced another 10% after hitting its latest all-time high (ATH) of $109,588 but held the $100,000 mark in the following days. However, the most recent correction saw BTC fall 14% from its Friday high of $106,000 and nearly 10% in 24 hours, triggering the largest single-day of crypto liquidations. Despite these retraces, Bitcoin has bounced from the local lows and continues to move within the mid-zone of its post-election range. Market observer Daan Crypto Trades noted that BTC’s volatility has been “relatively low” in the past few weeks, especially compared to the start of 2024. The cryptocurrency saw more violent swings when Bitcoin passed the $70,000 region in March, retracing up to 20% during these corrections. Since then, Volatility has “slowly dwindled” while Bitcoin’s price has been “creeping higher this cycle.” Bitfinex analysts previously noted the cycle’s “unique” conditions that drove the diminishing trend. According to the report, mainstream recognition, institutional adoption, and increasing confidence in the sector have kept BTC’s corrections smaller than past cycles, likely to continue for the rest of the bull run. Is A Takeoff Coming Soon? As BTC’s price continues to move sideways within its range, the flagship crypto looks “much stronger” than most of the market, “still looking perfectly fine when zooming out.” Daan added that “the demand for BTC is just so much higher compared to the rest of the market, especially during times of uncertainty.” However, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher highlighted that BTC’s search interest “is still sitting way below 2021 levels, despite sitting just under $100k.” This suggests that institutions are fueling the Bitcoin bull run while it is “no longer reliant on retail mania to pump BTC prices.” Related Reading: Solana (SOL) $200 Level Recovery Looks ‘Very Solid’, Is The Bleeding Over? Meanwhile, crypto analyst Jelle stated that Bitcoin is playing out similarly to Q1 2024, listing the “choppy” period, liquidity being taken out, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) retests as “flashing” signals again. This performance preceded the flagship crypto’s breakout to its March 2024 ATH and, if history repeats, could signal a price takeoff soon. Nonetheless, Jelle added that $100,000 remains the level to break and hold before any major price move.

On-chain data paint a picture where significant investor activity has been crucial in keeping the market propped up, despite the apparent lack of enthusiasm from the retail side. Still, if we look closely, the current situation almost presents itself as a “perfect storm” working against Bitcoin, with a trio of headwinds blowing hard that could threaten to take the price down and break that still-rather-amiable support zone. Our Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric helps us understand how #Bitcoin investors respond to downside pressure. Looking at last month's data, we see why the price found support twice at ~$97.5K – nearly 200K $BTC was accumulated above this level: https://t.co/9YFg95gC4X pic.twitter.com/wMhAdjBNUs — glassnode (@glassnode) February 5, 2025 Cost Basis Distribution Reveals Strong Buying Activity A closer look at Bitcoin’s Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric reveals why the cryptocurrency has twice found support close to $97,500. Over the past month, nearly 200,000 BTC has been accumulated above this level, with large investors and institutions seemingly defending this price zone. That level of foundation means downward pressure should be minimal for Bitcoin in the near term. Additionally, investors whose cost basis is above $99,000 have obtained over 150,000 BTC—a trend evident in both weekly and monthly on-chain data. This activity indicates a change in investor sentiment, with more holders moving their cost basis up into the $99,000 range. This price point is now being viewed as a support level, which is key to ensuring Bitcoin’s continued strength at higher valuations. These accumulation trends indicate that Bitcoin’s present stability above $97,500-$99,000 is steadfast. Also, the short-term holder cost basis is about $92,000. Therefore, the distance between the current market level and this lower threshold seems healthy enough to keep any kind of panic selling at bay for now. Should we, however, fall below the $97,500 level, things could get dicey quickly. Retail Investors Remain Cautious Even though larger players have been rapidly accumulating Bitcoin, retail investors have shown little inclination to add to their holdings. Santiment’s on-chain data reveals a consistent decline in the number of addresses holding between 0 and 1 Bitcoin. This seems to indicate that the market’s smaller participants are either taking their short-term profits or sitting on the sidelines, seemingly waiting for more advantageous conditions before they make any moves to re-enter the market. The sustained bullish momentum often has retail participation as its key driver. The dip from the all-time high of over $69,000 has seen retail investors show a cooling interest in accumulating the asset, with the latest DAA data showing that Bitcoin held by retail investors on a roughly 12-month moving average is down about 30%. Retail investors don’t seem eager to buy #Bitcoin $BTC yet, as the number of addresses holding 0 to 1 #BTC continues to decline, according to on-chain data from @santimentfeed ! pic.twitter.com/VOGHkrMSyw — Ali (@ali_charts) February 5, 2025 Bitcoin Spot ETFs See Significant Inflows Even though retail investors are being careful, it’s not stopping Bitcoin from seeing a still-raging institutional interest. Institutional investors keep wanting into Bitcoin, and that’s reflected in how, on February 4, 2023, the net total amount coming into Bitcoin spot ETFs was $341 million. We’re actually now at a point where BlackRock’s ETF for Bitcoin is one of the funds you’re most likely to see Bitcoin in when looking at institutional investment. Indeed, that fund had coming into it, on February 4, $249 million. The increasing inflows into spot ETFs show that institutional investors are taking advantage of Bitcoin’s price levels and its long-term potential. This collective behavior of investors points to a development in which Bitcoin is coming to be regarded as an asset that can be integrated into portfolios—very much like “digital gold.” On February 4, Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net inflow of $341 million yesterday, and BlackRock ETF IBIT had an inflow of $249 million. Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow of $308 million, continuing its net inflow for 4 consecutive days. https://t.co/59u0BnDSW8 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 5, 2025 Conclusion Key investors have been steadily accumulating Bitcoin, and because of that, the cryptocurrency has managed to stay above the key price levels of $97,500 and $99,000. Retail participation in Bitcoin right now is almost nonexistent, but what is providing solid support for the price is the institutional demand we are seeing, particularly through spot ETFs. If this accumulation trend that seems to be in place for Bitcoin by both retail and institutional investors continues, then, in my opinion, the Bitcoin price could stabilize—if it hasn’t already—and could potentially move higher from here. But if it does drop below those key price levels, then I think the price would be in danger of dropping to the next support level. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The post stated, “Shiba Inu will make you a millionaire! I am confident $SHIB is going to $0.01. Do you agree?” This bold claim received mixed reactions from the cryptocurrency community, with some expressing optimism while others dismissed it as unrealistic. ShibaInu Will Make You A Millionaire! I am confident $SHIB is going to $0.01 Do you agree? pic.twitter.com/RM3C2wn9wg — CryptoVibes (@cryptovibes7011) February 4, 2025 One of the most notable responses came from cryptos_smalls, who disagreed with the prediction, citing market capitalization concerns. They argued , “No! More and more investors are not falling for that unrealistic expectation of a $0.01 #SHIB! They learned to calculate Market Cap. $SHIB at $0.01 would be a Market Cap of? 5.8 Trillion, which is impossible. Point of reference? $Bitcoin Market Cap is 1.9 Trillion.” This viewpoint highlights a common argument among skeptics: achieving a $0.01 valuation for SHIB would require an unprecedented market capitalization that surpasses even the most dominant cryptocurrencies. Another user, Jason, responded sarcastically, saying, “No. It will only make you a millionaire if you buy 2.5 million dollars worth and instantly it will only be worth 1 million dollars. $SHIB died a long time ago.” This comment reflects a broader sentiment among some traders who believe that SHIB’s best days are behind it, questioning its ability to generate substantial future gains. SHIB’s Current Performance and Historical Trends According to CoinMarketCap, SHIB is trading at $0.00001636, marking a 4.16% increase in the past 24 hours. While still far from the $0.01 target, the token continues to exhibit periodic price surges that capture the interest of investors. Supporting CryptoVibes’ optimism, a Times Tabloid report emphasized SHIB’s historical February performance, noting that the token has never recorded a loss in this month. The report states that SHIB has maintained an average February gain of 20.3% and a median return of 21.1%, demonstrating consistent upward movement during this period. These figures serve as a key reference point for potential future performance, as traders look to historical trends for guidance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Feasibility of a $0.01 SHIB Price The debate over SHIB reaching $0.01 largely revolves around supply mechanics and market capitalization. SHIB has a circulating supply of nearly 589 trillion tokens, meaning a price of $0.01 would require a market cap exceeding $5.8 trillion. This would position SHIB’s value higher than that of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many traditional financial institutions combined—a scenario many analysts deem improbable under current market conditions. However, proponents argue that token burns and increased adoption could create the conditions for significant price appreciation. SHIB’s development team has introduced burn mechanisms aimed at reducing supply, and the Shibarium Layer 2 network has expanded its ecosystem, potentially increasing demand.

The token remained under tremendous pressure with the key support levels around $0.7 and as a result, it rebounded without attracting deeper correction. The price has found some stability since the last trading day, which helped the token to begin the day’s trade on a bullish note. Despite the rise, the ADA price continues to remain primed for more downside action ahead. Here’s Why. After the recent pullback, the uncertainties over the token escalated as the price has been constantly failing to reclaim $1 since the start of the year. As a result, the whales exposure to the token has been cut to a large extent. The data from intotheblock shows the netflow of large ADA holders, holding more than 0.1% of the circulating supply, has plummeted by 90% in the past seven days. The recent data suggests the ADA price is experiencing extreme volatility, with a decline from $0.977 to $0.75 over the past month. Despite the pullback, technical indicators suggest mixed signals. This had divided the investors into two; some believe these declines are a buying opportunity, while others predict a deeper correction is yet to come. Currently, the investors have found a good buying opportunity, which has elevated the levels by some margin. So what’s next? Will the ADA price rise above $1 this month? The recent pullback dragged the levels below the ascending trend line, which transformed it into a descending parallel channel. The price reached the lower support and has triggered a rebound, while a validation could begin a fresh upswing. The CMF is used to know the strength of the token has triggered a bullish divergence along with RSI. This hints towards a rising strength of the bulls that could elevate the levels close to $0.9, provided the Cardano (ADA) price needs to break above $0.786.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 09:32:20

Hill Slams Gensler’s Crypto Crackdown, Outlines Goals with Crypto Czar appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is thriving, with Bitcoin soaring to new heights and the overall market cap surpassing $3 trillion. However, despite the market’s success, there is ongoing debate about the role of regulation and how it will shape next. Recently, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. French Hill said that excessive regulation has harmed the crypto market. In an interview with CNBC, Hill pointed to the flourishing Bitcoin ETF market as evidence that regulation, when done right, can help grow the market. But he also noted that the SEC’s previous resistance to a Bitcoin ETF, which led to a federal court ruling compelling the agency to act, shows how ineffective Gary Gensler’s “regulation by enforcement” approach has been. Despite Gensler’s departure, the legacy of his policies lingers. However, there is now a push from lawmakers to move toward regulatory clarity. The focus is on passing legislation that will direct both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to create clear rules for crypto markets. About Gensler, he said, “He’s gone. That doesn’t change the fact that crypto has been under assault by the SEC over the past four years. And so the reason for legislation is to have regulatory clarity that directs the SEC and the CFTC exactly what they need to do to protect investors, encourage innovation, and encourage companies to use blockchain.” A recent meeting brought together key figures such as David Sacks, representing President Trump, Tim Scott, Chairman of the Banking Committee, and other influential lawmakers. Their goal is to prioritize the establishment of clear, comprehensive regulations that will make the U.S. a hub for digital asset innovation rather than a place where companies are driven away due to regulatory uncertainty.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 09:33:46

The ceremony will take place at the iconic Jumeirah Burj Al Arab on April 29, coinciding with the TOKEN2049 conference. The event will unite industry leaders, innovators, and visionaries to celebrate achievements in blockchain and cryptocurrency. MEBA 2025 arrives at a pivotal moment amid the rapid acceleration of blockchain adoption across the MENA region. Recent data from Chainalysis positioned the region as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency market in the world. Between July 2023 and June 2024, MENA received an estimated on-chain value of $338.7 billion—accounting for 7.5% of the global transaction volume. Notably, the UAE has emerged as a global leader in digital asset adoption. According to Henley & Partners’ latest report, the UAE ranks third worldwide in digital currency usage. Chainalysis data also revealed that the UAE received approximately $34billion in cryptocurrencies between June 2023 and July 2024, experiencing a robust 42% year-on-year growth. This is driven by the country’s progressive approach to blockchain technology, with cities like Dubai establishing themselves as key innovation hubs. Max Palethorpe, Founder and CEO of Hoko Group, the official organizers of MEBA, commented: ""The Middle East Blockchain Awards provides a unique platform to recognize the incredible achievements that are driving the next wave of innovation in blockchain and digital transformation.

The surge is so pronounced that nearly all the incoming elements—from new projects to institutional investments—are creating an estimated 80–90% deflationary pressure on Ethereum. Under normal circumstances, this would be an excellent time to buy Ethereum, as the price is bound to go up with inflating demand and deflationary supply. Explosive Growth in Ethereum Transactions and Active Addresses The exponential growth of Ethereum’s scaling solutions—Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base—has been nothing short of stunning. Over the past few months, these networks’ transaction volumes have surged by more than 300%. Increased user adoption and increased protocol activity across these networks are the primary drivers of that growth. This is all super bullish for Layer 2 Ethereum solutions, and consequently—or, more accurately, synchronously—it’s bullish for the Ethereum network itself. The truth? Yes. Data from @intotheblock shows that the number of transactions on ETH; Arbitrum, Optimism and Base have been on a ridiculous uptrend, over 300% Also, active addresses on @coinbase since July 2024, has gone from 500k to a high of over 2M There is potential pic.twitter.com/QIVow06mvN — Mijosh.₿ (@Mijosh_) February 4, 2025 A notable trend is the increase in active addresses on Coinbase. Since July 2024, the number of active addresses on the exchange has surged from 500,000 to more than 2 million. This isn’t just growth for Coin base; it suggests that the Ethereum ecosystem is seeing robust user engagement. Reasons for this growth could include: improved network efficiency, the broader adoption of decentralized applications (dApps), and, last but not least, institutional investment in the Ethereum space. The most important support level for #Ethereum is between $2,238 and $2,614, where 12.18 million wallets acquired 63.07 million $ETH . pic.twitter.com/HggTaqfE4y — Ali (@ali_charts) February 5, 2025 Key Support Levels and Institutional Investment in Ethereum From an on-chain perspective, Ethereum’s most critical support level is between $2,238 and $2,614. At this price range, a total of 12.18 million wallets hold 63.07 million ETH, amounting to a strong concentration of on-chain holdings. Roughly 5.33 percent of all Ethereum that exists is concentrated in this top price support level. A dip into this range would likely be met with a wave of buying, as these holders likely see themselves as “in the money.” Thus, this price concentration provides a solid buffer against further declines for Ethereum’s price, should it reach this region, making it a sort of price floor for the asset. Ethereum’s institutional demand has been building consistent momentum. On February 4, Ethereum spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $308 million, marking the fourth consecutive day of seeing positive inflows. The sustained interest in Ethereum ETFs seems to indicate that large financial players are increasingly valuing ETH as a valuable asset. This is not much different from the institutional adoption narrative that Bitcoin has seen play out over the last couple of years through similar vehicles. On February 4, Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net inflow of $341 million yesterday, and BlackRock ETF IBIT had an inflow of $249 million. Ethereum spot ETF had a total net inflow of $308 million, continuing its net inflow for 4 consecutive days. https://t.co/59u0BnDSW8 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 5, 2025 Conclusion The network of Ethereum is expanding like never before. The number of transactions occurring on Ethereum, as well as on its Layer 2 networks, has never been higher. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been enjoying a resplendent price range of between $2,238 and $2,614. It appears that investors have long seen the Layer 1 protocol and Layer 2 solutions as being worth their salt for a long time to come. As demand from institutions continues to surge and Ethereum ETFs bring in new investment, the future of Ethereum looks promising. The network has not only continued to scale but also seems to be much closer to achieving status as a “world computer” that can handle anything thrown at it, with adoption expanding at a steady pace.

However, such consolidation typically doesn’t last forever. According to analysts at Bitfinex, this range could break in either direction within the next few weeks, potentially leading to a significant price shift. This period of consolidation, historically, has been followed by a decisive movement in Bitcoin’s price—often within 80 to 90 days. As the US government signals its intentions toward cryptocurrency, the potential for an upward move has gathered increasing attention. Bitcoin’s recent resilience has added to this optimism. In fact, even during the chaos that followed US President Donald Trump’s tariff news —which led to the largest liquidation event in crypto history on February 3—Bitcoin held above its pre-US election price level of around $70,000. Bitcoin Holds Strong Amidst Macro Turmoil The turbulence sparked by President Trump’s tariff announcements resulted in over $2.24 billion in liquidations across the crypto market in just 24 hours, a stark reminder of the volatility that often accompanies macroeconomic news. Bitcoin’s price dropped briefly below the key $100,000 mark, falling to $92,584 before making a modest rebound to $97,370 at the time of writing. However, analysts caution that further volatility remains a possibility, especially in the short term. As Bitcoin continues to consolidate, there’s growing speculation that once the US government unveils its formal position on Bitcoin, the asset could experience a sharp upward movement. Crypto analysts are particularly vocal about this potential. Thomas Fahrer, a prominent crypto analyst, stirred the conversation on February 5 by suggesting that an announcement from the US government regarding its intent to purchase Bitcoin could trigger a massive price surge. “The day the US government announces they are buying Bitcoin, the price will go up $50,000 in a single 1-minute candle,” Fahrer wrote in an X post. This sentiment was echoed by MN Capital’s Michaël van de Poppe, who similarly stated that the timing was ripe for the US to embrace crypto, asserting that Bitcoin is “neutrally valued” and the entire market remains “criminally undervalued.” The Growing Importance of US Policy in Crypto’s Future Van de Poppe emphasized that the current period of market consolidation should not be mistaken for a peak. He believes that with the rising adoption of cryptocurrency, we are far from seeing the market’s true potential. “The adoption is bigger than ever,” he noted, adding that it’s an exciting time to be invested in digital assets. As these macroeconomic conditions evolve, Bitcoin’s next major move appears to hinge on two things: its response to short-term volatility and the clarity that will come from the US government’s stance on crypto .

On the other hand, large investors recently dumped over 330 million ADA tokens, increasing market supply and potentially triggering further price declines in the short term. $15 Per Coin? Cardano’s ADA was among the top-performing cryptocurrencies toward the end of 2024, with its price rising to an almost three-year high of approximately $1.30. Since then, though, it has lost some steam, and its valuation briefly tanked to as low as $0.60 during the crypto crash on February 3. The bulls managed to reclaim some of the lost ground in the following days, and ADA currently trades at around $0.75 (a 30% decline on a monthly scale). ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the recent downtrend, popular industry participants believe the asset remains poised for a massive surge. X user Ali Martinez reminded that ADA’s price exploded from less than $0.1 to over $3 during the previous bull cycle in mid-2021. He assumed that the token could be “at the very beginning of a monster parabolic rally,” and if history repeats, the valuation could skyrocket to $15 in the near future. CryptoRus supported the thesis, suggesting that ADA “ is looking like it could be primed to pump.” Lucky told their over two million followers on X that “strong fundamentals and rising adoption make Cardano a solid bet before the next big move.” “The ecosystem keeps growing, reinforcing its market position,” the analyst added. The Bears Might Continue to Prevail Despite the optimism from multiple market observers, some important factors suggest that ADA bulls might experience more pain in the short term. As CryptoPotato reported earlier this week, whales have offloaded more than 330 million tokens (worth almost $250 million at the time). A significant sell-off by large investors triggers a surplus of supply into the market, potentially exceeding demand and driving prices lower . Moreover, the actions of these whales could spark panic among smaller traders, further intensifying the downward pressure on the asset’s value. Conversely, when large investors accumulate a substantial amount of ADA, it can have the opposite impact. As reported by CryptoPotato , whales bought over 130 million tokens in late November when the price was around $1. Shortly after, ADA surged to its local peak of $1.30.

While some projects experience exponential growth in the 100-1000x range, others fail to maintain momentum, petering off and degrading into nothing, thereby leaving investors with nothing to show for their investment. Among the standout opportunities, Rollblock and Lunex Network offer particularly strong growth potential. Both projects integrate sustainable tokenomics, innovative features, and immense appeal, making them compelling options for investors seeking high-upside plays in 2025’s bullish cycle. Read on to explore all the aforementioned presale projects mentioned. Can Lunex Network Be The Next 100x DEX Platform? Lunex Network is emerging as a standout ICO, solidifying its place as a top contender in the DEX-swapping sector. Prioritizing user privacy, Lunex Network removes KYC requirements, enabling seamless and anonymous trading without ID verification. With support for over 50,000 blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Solana, the platform offers unmatched flexibility for traders. Unlike conventional DEXs, Lunex Network eliminates the need for external wallets like PhantomWallet, utilizing advanced smart contracts to ensure lightning-fast swaps. This innovative approach enhances transaction efficiency while reducing security risks linked to third-party wallet integrations. To further bolster its ecosystem, Lunex Network employs a robust revenue-sharing model. Half of all buyback tokens are distributed to LNEX holders, while the rest funds staking rewards with an attractive 18% APY, driving long-term value and sustainability. At its presale price of $0.0063, Lunex Network offers a compelling investment opportunity, with projections suggesting a 250% increase by Q2 and the potential for 100x gains later in the year. Investors seeking high-growth prospects should keep an eye on this rapidly expanding project. Exploring Solaxy’s Understated Potential Solaxy is Solana’s first Layer-2 solution, aiming to ease congestion and lower transaction costs. With $17.5 million raised in presale, interest has surged, driven by Solana’s meme coin boom and record Pump.fun trading volumes. By processing transactions off-chain, Solaxy promises faster, cheaper transactions for traders frustrated by Solana’s network strain. The SOLX token offers high staking rewards of up to 231% APY, with a few analysts projecting an 8x surge upon listing. However, skepticism remains surrounding Solaxy given that Solana’s low fees have historically reduced demand for Layer-2 solutions, which were largely created for the Ethereum blockchain to address its technological inferiority. In addition, whether Solaxy truly solves congestion or merely shifts the burden remains to be seen, making its long-term success uncertain. Despite the hype for Solaxy, questions linger over Solaxy’s ability to gain lasting adoption. If Solana’s network upgrades improve scalability on its own, Solaxy will struggle to maintain relevance, limiting its long-term upside. Can Wall Street Pepe Stand Out In The Volatile Meme Coin Crowd? Wall Street Pepe has surged past $65 million in its presale, cementing its place as one of the most hyped meme coin launches of 2025. With a strong online presence and a growing community of 35,000 X followers and 15,000 Telegram members, Wall Street Pepe is capturing the interest of investors eager to join a movement designed to challenge crypto whales. Beyond the meme appeal, Wall Street Pepe introduces real value through its VIP club, the WEPE Army, granting holders access to exclusive market insights, trading signals, and presale opportunities. With staking rewards offering an 18% APY and a security audit from Coinsult, the project combines community-driven hype with sustainable tokenomics. However, while Wall Street Pepe has momentum on its side, meme coin cycles are notoriously volatile, and its long-term staying power remains uncertain. Despite its explosive presale, questions linger over whether Wall Street Pepe can sustain investor interest post-launch. Meme coin markets are prone to rapid shifts, and while Wall Street Pepe’s vision of empowering small investors is compelling, its success will depend on its ability to maintain engagement beyond its presale hype. The #1 iGaming Gem For This Bull Run Is Here With Rollblock Rollblock is revolutionizing blockchain gaming with its innovative ERC-20 platform, combining robust security with a diverse gaming experience.

Lunex Network is positioning itself as a leading ICO, establishing a strong presence in the DEX-swapping arena. Focusing on user privacy, Lunex Network eliminates the need for KYC, allowing seamless and anonymous trading without ID checks.

Priced at $0.0063 during its presale, Lunex Network presents an attractive investment prospect, with forecasts suggesting a 250% rise by Q2 and potential for 100x gains later in the year. Investors seeking growth should watch this rapidly developing project closely. Unveiling Solaxy’s Hidden Potential Solaxy stands as Solana’s pioneering Layer-2 solution, designed to alleviate congestion and cut transaction expenses. With $17.5 million amassed during presale, interest has surged, fueled by Solana’s meme coin craze and record trading volumes on Pump.fun.

The SOLX token provides high staking rewards, reaching up to 231% APY, with some analysts predicting an 8x increase upon listing. However, skepticism surrounds Solaxy since Solana's low fees have traditionally diminished the need for Layer-2 solutions, which were mainly developed to address Ethereum's technological limitations. Whether Solaxy genuinely resolves congestion or merely shifts the problem remains to be seen, casting doubt on its long-term success. Despite the buzz around Solaxy, questions remain about its ability to secure lasting adoption. Should Solana’s network upgrades boost scalability independently, Solaxy might struggle to stay relevant, limiting its long-term potential. Will Wall Street Pepe Shine in the Unstable Meme Coin Market? Wall Street Pepe has surpassed $65 million in its presale, establishing itself as one of the most anticipated meme coin launches of 2025. With a robust online presence and a growing community of 35,000 X followers and 15,000 Telegram members, Wall Street Pepe is drawing attention from investors eager to support a movement aimed at challenging crypto giants.

With staking rewards of 18% APY and a security audit from Coinsult, the project merges community-driven excitement with sustainable tokenomics. However, despite its current momentum, the inherent volatility of meme coin cycles raises questions about its long-term viability. Despite its impressive presale, doubts persist about Wall Street Pepe’s ability to maintain investor interest post-launch. Meme coin markets are subject to swift changes, and while Wall Street Pepe’s aim to empower small investors is appealing, its success hinges on sustaining engagement beyond the initial buzz.

According to the recent announcement, the Berachain Foundation has planned an estimated $632M distribution, exciting investors and participants, especially around the BERA token price at launch. Let’s discuss.

According to the official BERA airdrop announcement , 80M tokens worth $632M per current price will be distributed among eligible users.

Interested users can view their allocation on the Berachain airdrop checker. Additionally, the initial claims would begin on February 6. Looking further into tokenomics, the initial supply at Genesis will be 500M BERA tokens. Around 15.8% of this supply is allocated for the crypto airdrop, in which the Bong Bears NFT holders and affiliates collection would receive the largest share of the airdrop. The remaining 13.1% is allocated to community initiatives, 20% for ecosystem research and development, and 16.8% for advisers and developers. What will be the BERA Token Price be at Launch? Apart from the crypto airdrop , the BERA token listing is due, creating significant hype around it.

Though there is no specific news about the BERA token listing value, the perpetual futures data on Aevo shows it is trading at around $8.030 per token. However, the price could fluctuate due to the high volatility of pre-launch future contracts. Moreover, the BERA listing price could depend on other factors, including crypto exchange listings. Investors must carefully analyze the market around BERA TGE and airdrop distribution to better understand and evaluate the token’s worth at listing. Key Points To Remember Berachain’s EVM -identical layer-1 mainnet and BERA token launch is an anticipated event for blockchain users.

Bitcoin (BTC) is still below $100,000, and some are beginning to wonder if the top has already been reached. However, macro indicators suggest that this is not the case. Fade Bitcoin at your peril. A slow roll-over from here? A narrative is doing the rounds on social media that Bitcoin reached its peak when it hit over $109,000 in January last year. Since then, the incoming Trump administration has caused a ‘sell the news’ event, and it’s a slow roll-over from here on in. The seventh cavalry, in the form of quantitative easing, still hasn’t arrived, and many are beginning to think that the Federal Reserve is trapped and will not be able to turn the money spigots on due to the fear of inflation breaking out again. Many must also be thinking that with all the Bitcoin buying going on among the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, and Michael Saylor’s rebranded Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), why is the price not rising? To add to this, President Trump's promise of a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Strategy has not materialised, not that it could be actioned in such a short period of time, but it doesn’t take a lot for the average retail investor to get cold feet. Market sentiment dipping fast Source: Alternative.me According to the Fear and Greed Index, positive sentiment for the crypto market is falling fast. From last month’s Extreme Greed, to last week’s Greed, to today’s Neutral, does tell a story of dissipating optimism. So is this prevailing bearish sentiment across the whole market? No, this is a retail investor thing. This Bitcoin cycle is very different from its predecessors. The days of retail forcing the price to spike in this or that direction, are probably over. This is now a market dominated by the institutional sector. The difference here is that probably the vast majority of retail investors need a relatively quick profit. If the market becomes difficult, many just can’t afford to wait for it to turn back up and end up selling. On the other hand, the institutions are in it for the long term. They know a gift horse when they see it. A sideways consolidation range Source: TradingView The daily price chart for Bitcoin shows that the price action is continuing to traverse sideways in a range. The problem for the average retail investor is the sheer amount of volatility that is being experienced, which is forcing many to sell. However, when one steps back and looks at the bigger picture, the top of this range was reached after a 63% move higher out of a bull flag. Of course the price is going to consolidate after such a move. The weekly Stochastic RSI signals the top Source: TradingView If one zooms right out into the weekly time frame and looks at the Stochastic RSI (bottom of the chart), one can see each of the previous two bull market peaks were signalled by a topping out of the indicator lines. This was also the case for the other two bull markets previous to these. For the current $BTC price, it should be noted that the indicator lines are on their way down to the bottom. Once there, they will signal a completely oversold position, and then when they rise back above the 20.00 level, they will signal new upside price momentum. This will then potentially take the price to its final bull market top for this cycle. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A new on-chain analysis has uncovered 24 Bitcoin transactions from wallets believed to be linked to Satoshi, revealing that some of these funds were sent to Cavirtex, a Canadian crypto exchange. This discovery could be the first recorded on-chain transaction between a Satoshi-linked wallet and a centralized exchange (CEX), providing a potential lead in uncovering Bitcoin’s origins. I went through Satoshi Nakamoto's wallets; thread of new findings that I don't think have been previously reported including: -My best guess is that Satoshi was last active onchain in 2014 -He may have used a Canadian BTC exchange (!) -Kraken may know the identity of Satoshi pic.twitter.com/ajD2A73fm8 — Conor (@jconorgrogan) February 5, 2025 One of the key addresses involved in these transactions is 1PYYj, which appears to have received Bitcoin multiple times from these early wallets. What makes this even more significant is that 1PYYj is linked to 12ib, one of the largest Bitcoin-holding addresses in existence today, containing around $3 billion worth of BTC. This suggests that 1PYYj may have belonged to Satoshi or an early Bitcoin contributor who played a major role in the network’s development. Could This Be the Missing Link to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Identity? An even bigger revelation is that Cavirtex, which was purchased by Kraken in 2016, might have retained KYC data on users who transacted through it. If records from that time still exist, Kraken’s CEO Jesse Powell (@jespow) could theoretically have access to information that might reveal Satoshi’s identity. However, it is unclear whether any such data was preserved or if the exchange had enforced identity verification during those early years. Adding to the intrigue, these Satoshi-linked wallets also sent 200 BTC to a Bitcoin faucet, a system that once allowed users to receive 5 BTC for free just by solving a CAPTCHA. This was a common method to distribute Bitcoin in its early days when it had little to no market value. Interestingly, another 500 BTC transaction to 1PYYj in 2010 raises speculation that it was a payment to another person or entity. If true, this would be a rare documented case of a Satoshi-linked transaction that could provide more insights into how Bitcoin was distributed in its early days. What Does This Mean for the Search for Satoshi? This new evidence challenges previous theories about Satoshi’s identity, particularly weakening the claim that cryptographer Len Sassaman was behind Bitcoin. It also raises new questions about whether more historical transaction records could help finally uncover Bitcoin’s elusive creator. While the chances of finding conclusive proof remain slim, this discovery brings fresh hope in solving one of the biggest financial mysteries of all time.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 10:02:36

According to a Feb. 6 X post, reassured users that no funds were ever at risk. They confirmed that all customer and treasury assets remain secure in multisig wallets. The attack was limited to Jupiter’s X account, with no other communication channels affected. The hack transpired during the late hours of Feb. 5, with several community members sounding the alarm about suspicious activity. In a new deleted post, Jupiter Mobile’s X account quickly warned users not to click any links or purchase tokens promoted by the compromised main account. Scammers used the opportunity to promote a meme coin theme around Jupiter’s cat mascot with the ticker MEOW, which allegedly surged to a $30 million market cap within seconds before the token’s developer sold their holdings, quickly wiping out all gains. All promotional posts have now been deleted. JUPITER ACCOUNT HACKED AND CREATE A FAKE $MEOW TOKEN Hacker rugged it in when he reached the $30M mcap, it was a pretty clever hack to be honest @weremeow pic.twitter.com/vXxZR8xcy4 — astronomica (@0xastronomica) February 6, 2025 Beanie, the pseudonymous founder of crypto venture capital firm GM Capital, criticized the irony of trusting protocols with billions in liquidity while they fail to secure their social media accounts, calling it a recurring paradox in the industry. “Traders lost millions instantly on this Jupiter account hack. Literally in a matter of minutes,” he estimated. You might also like: JUP rallies over 25% as traders react to several key developments The community wasn’t too happy about the whole situation, calling out Jupiter for not securing its account properly. Some were also frustrated that, even though Jupiter assured funds were safe, the losses from the scam couldn’t be recovered. So we lost money cause you can’t secure your account ? — RΞTRICKK.SOL (@Retrickk_crypto) February 6, 2025 Others praised the team’s quick response and transparency about the breach, with one user stating that the incident reinforced their trust in the Jupiter team. https://twitter.com/DayliCryptomeme/status/1887348530844737993 The incident may have added to some selling pressure on JUP , the platform’s native token, which had dropped over 5% during the aftermath. Crypto scammers have long exploited the X accounts of prominent blockchain projects , celebrities , and public figures to push fraudulent tokens and phishing schemes. Last month, Breaking Bad star Dean Norris became the latest victim after his X account was used to promote a sham token based on his persona. Scammers managed to inflate the token’s market cap to as high as $8.4 million at its peak before offloading their pre-acquired holdings. Just days before, the official account of Cuba’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs was locked due to what appeared to be a similar incident.

BNB aims for new peaks after a robust recovery from recent dips, with discussions focusing on whether it will surpass the $685 resistance and climb higher. Ethereum’s momentum is also intensifying, with the community watching for a decisive breakout over $3,303 that could kick off a major bullish phase. Amid these market dynamics, BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads with its presale now over $192.5 million. Its enhanced Affiliate Program offers a 5% USDT bonus to both those who refer and those who purchase, increasing interest. As participants hurry to secure their holdings before prices rise, BDAG is being touted as the top crypto to get, especially as it nears its $600 million presale goal. BNB’s Momentum Builds as It Eyes New Peaks The outlook for Binance Coin (BNB) remains upbeat as it recovers strongly from a low of $635 to trade close to $678.90. This rebound has ignited conversations about potential new targets, with the $685 resistance level under close watch. If BNB breaks through this barrier, a surge towards $700 or more could be on the cards. Market indicators show an increase in bullish momentum, with BNB’s MACD in the green and its Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 50, suggesting there’s potential for more gains. Some market watchers think BNB might be forming a cup-and-handle pattern, potentially driving the asset towards a long-term rally to $1,147. With BNB’s resilience and improving market sentiment, higher prices appear more probable. Ethereum Rally Eyes Key Breakout Over $3,303 Ethereum’s (ETH) price trends are a hot topic in the crypto community, with Ethereum maintaining its strength amid market swings. Currently hovering around $3,240, ETH is on the verge of a significant moment, with experts eyeing a breakout above $3,303. Clearing this resistance could spark a new round of upward momentum, pushing Ethereum to higher price territories. Crypto analyst Carl Moon pointed out Ethereum’s Head and Shoulders pattern, suggesting a possible retest of the recent low near $2,930 before attempting another breakout. Despite this, the sentiment remains largely positive, with Ethereum’s falling wedge pattern indicating a possible bullish breakout if buying activity ramps up. BlockDAG’s 5% USDT Bonus Ignites Presale Frenzy BlockDAG’s (BDAG) presale is a hot topic in the crypto scene, with fundraising topping $192.5 million. Over 18.3 billion BDAG coins have been sold, delivering an impressive 2,380% ROI to early participants. Fueling the buzz is BlockDAG’s enhanced Affiliate Program, offering a 5% instant USDT cashback bonus to both those who refer and those who buy. This incentive has boosted demand, as people grab the chance to gain instant benefits while locking in BDAG at its present price. For instance, if a BlockDAG holder refers someone who buys $5,000 worth of BDAG, both get $250 in USDT instantly, transferred to their BEP-20 wallets. There’s no cap on the cashback, so the more BDAG one buys, the greater the rewards for all involved. This beneficial setup has gone viral, attracting new participants to the ecosystem and rewarding current holders for growing the community. With BDAG priced at $0.0248, many see this as an ideal time to buy before prices rise. The anticipated mainnet launch later this year is creating additional excitement, as BDAG’s move to public trading is expected to drive substantial growth. With its swift presale progress and solid market stance, analysts are marking BDAG as a top crypto purchase now. As the project approaches its $600 million presale goal, people are eager to secure their BDAG before the anticipated price increase. Crypto Markets on the Verge of Major Moves The crypto market is nearing a pivotal moment, with assets like BNB and Ethereum poised for substantial breakouts. BNB is inching toward a surge above $685, potentially leading to a climb towards $700 or even $1,147 if it follows the cup-and-handle formation. Ethereum is also maintaining crucial support levels, and a breakout over $3,303 could trigger another upward phase in its rally. Simultaneously, BlockDAG’s presale is gaining speed, with its 5% USDT cashback offer driving a spike in purchases. This limited-time deal is pulling new buyers into the fold while rewarding loyal community members, bolstering BDAG’s community-focused expansion. This cashback offer is temporary, and with the presale pace quickening, BDAG’s price is poised to rise soon. Those seeking the best crypto to buy should move fast to secure their BDAG and lock in rewards before the upcoming price jump.

On Tuesday, Trudeau secured a temporary reprieve from US tariffs on Canadian goods after a talk with US President Donald Trump. According to a Financial Times report , this Friday, the Prime Minister will convene an economic summit in Toronto. The summit will bring together business leaders, policy experts, and labor unions to discuss expanding Canada’s global trade footprint. “ The goal is to make it easier to build and trade within our borders and diversify export markets ,” Trudeau told reporters yesterday. The summit includes his Council on Canada-US Relations, featuring major auto industry executives and former provincial premiers. Trudeau is lobbying industry leaders to act on growing concerns that Canadian businesses can no longer depend on unrestricted access to the US market. US tariffs cause massive panic in neighboring countries Earlier this week, Trudeau negotiated a 30-day delay on 25% US tariffs on Canadian imports, except for energy, which would be taxed at 10%. These tariffs were initially part of former US President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies targeting Canada, Mexico, and China, which he linked to illegal immigration and drug trafficking concerns. Canada’s economy has been considerably reliant on its good relations with the United States for more than a decade. Per a recent Reuters report , the US accounted for 75% of Canada’s total exports in 2022. The number has since trickled down to about 25%, which is still a substantial amount compared to the meager 1.5% of US total exports to Canada. “ Canada’s strategy for the past 30 years has relied on trade agreements that Trump has disrupted, and no longer can be relied on as a business case for Canada, ” said John Manley, former Canada Deputy Prime Minister. ‘Buy Canadian’ slogan rises The Canadian government’s efforts to reduce reliance on the US align with its citizens’ sentiments. A new poll by Angus Reid found that 91% of Canadians favor moving away from trade dependence on the US preferring diversification over mending relations. Public frustration with US tariffs has bridged political divides, with citizens rallying around Canadian businesses. A growing “Buy Canadian” movement has emerged, where consumers are deliberately avoiding American products to support local industries. Carole Chandler, a retired schoolteacher from Halifax, said she had canceled an upcoming trip to Florida in response to the US tariffs. “I love America and Americans,” she told the BBC. “But I don’t want to be one.” The economic strain has ignited talks over Canada’s internal economic policies, particularly regarding energy infrastructure. Patriots have criticized Trudeau’s government for failing to develop sufficient oil and gas pipelines to expand exports beyond the US. Despite funding the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline, which opened in May last year after years of delays and cost overruns, Canada still lacks major infrastructure to sell energy overseas. “ If we cut the red tape, we could have a pipeline built in two years, ” reckoned Adam Waterous, chief executive of Strathcona Resources, Canada’s fifth-largest oil producer.

Ethereum’s Evolution: Is Now the Time to Invest in ETH? Ethereum has come a long way since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. It’s not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a pioneering Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for its smart contracts. These smart contracts power a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including finance tools and games. To make transactions faster and cheaper, Ethereum uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon. It also introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used in many ways, like voting, utility, and storing value. Even with all these tokens, ETH is still needed to pay for transaction fees. With the recent shift to Proof-of-Stake in 2022, known as “The Merge,” Ethereum has become more energy-efficient. The next big update, called sharding, aims to make the network faster and reduce costs even more. This shows Ethereum’s commitment to improvement and decentralization. In the current market cycle, ETH remains a strong asset. It facilitates transactions, rewards those who stake their coins, and can be traded or used as collateral. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s continuous upgrades and large ecosystem make it an attractive option for investors. As the crypto market evolves, Ethereum’s role seems poised to grow even further. Dogecoin: More Than a Joke? Exploring Its Potential Today Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun twist on cryptocurrencies. It used a popular Shiba Inu meme for its logo, setting a light-hearted tone. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was made to be abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no cap on how many can exist. What began as a joke by creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer quickly gained a big following. In 2021, its value soared, reaching over $50 billion in total value. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, played a big role in this surge. Dogecoin showed how powerful online communities can be in the financial world. Today, Dogecoin continues to capture interest. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies but focuses on being easy to use and friendly. The unlimited supply means it’s less about hoarding wealth and more about spending and tipping. In the current market, some see potential in Dogecoin due to its strong community and recognition. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin has a unique place as both a meme and a serious asset. As the crypto market evolves, trends show that coins with active communities and real-world use may thrive. Whether Dogecoin remains attractive depends on how these factors play out. Conclusion ETH pushes toward $2,900 and DOGE remains strong, but XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth, blending sports and memes in a community-driven ecosystem.

These coins once turned mere enthusiasts into millionaires, capturing imaginations and reshaping fortunes. The current market is ripe, and a new contender is emerging on the scene. It raises the question: could this be the next big leap? Enter Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., a promising project attracting attention. This new venture, echoing the wild success of PEPE, aims to carve its place in the crypto world. With a strategic approach and community backing, Agent A.I. stands positioned to capture the spotlight. Enthusiasts and investors are keenly watching; will history repeat itself? Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Dogecoin Dips but Remains Up Over Six Months: What’s Next? Dogecoin is trading between $0.2309 and $0.3233. In the past week, its price fell by 17.03%. Over the last month, it dropped by 31.09%. Despite these declines, over six months, Dogecoin’s price has increased by 146.04%. The nearest support level is $0.1943. If the price falls below this, further declines may follow. The nearest resistance level is $0.3791. If the price rises above this, it could gain significantly. The RSI is 46.80, which suggests the market is stable. Recent price drops suggest sellers are in control. The 17.03% fall in a week and 31.09% in a month point to a downward trend. Yet, the 146.04% gain over six months indicates strong growth in the longer term. If the price rises from $0.2309 to the resistance at $0.3791, it would increase by about 64%. A drop to the support at $0.1943 would be a decrease of around 16%. Dogecoin’s next move depends on whether it can break above resistance or falls below support. A rise above $0.3791 could lead to significant gains. A fall below $0.1943 may mean further declines. Traders should watch these key levels to anticipate the coin’s direction. Shiba Inu Price Nears Support After Recent Decline Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a significant drop in its price recently. Over the past week, the price decreased by about 9%. In the last month, it fell by nearly 32%. This sharp decline contrasts with the past six months, during which SHIB gained over 14%. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.00001358 and $0.00001856. The nearest support level is at $0.00001165. If the price continues to fall and breaks below this support, it could indicate further downward movement and possibly test lower levels. Conversely, the nearest resistance is at $0.00002161. A move above this level might signal a potential reversal of the downward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 61.22, suggesting the asset is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a price correction. Given the recent downward momentum and the RSI reading, SHIB’s price may face continued pressure. Traders and investors should watch the key support and resistance levels closely. A bounce from support could offer an opportunity for a rally, while a break below might lead to more losses. Conclusion Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have seen their peaks, and their short-term growth may be limited. The market is now looking toward new projects that can capture interest and offer fresh opportunities. Agent A.I. is a new memecoin aiming to make a significant impact. Inspired by PEPE’s massive surge, it launches with a community-driven presale and a clear plan for expansion. With a capped supply and strategic token distribution, it positions itself as a contender worth watching.

CCN revealed the upcoming launch in an interview with Dr. Gregorios Siourounis, co-founder and CEO of xMoney Global. Siorounis is former managing director of the Sui Foundation and has an economic research cited in the 2024 Nobel Prize. As reported on February 4, the company will launch three fully compliant stablecoins with Europe’s MiCA. Namely, EUROX, a fully regulated Euro stablecoin; USDX, a MiCA-compliant alternative to Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC ; and RONX, a Romanian Leu stablecoin, “aimed at engaging the local community.” “We’re applying with the Central Bank of Romania,” Dr. Siourounis explains. “It’s one of the most competent regulators in Europe, and we believe this will be a crucial step in bringing stablecoins into the mainstream.” First regulated and MiCA-compliant native stablecoins to MultiversX While not explicit in the CNN report, Dr. Gregorios Siourounis mentioned in the YouTube-aired interview that the three stablecoins were decided together with the two other xMoney co-founders, Lucian and Beniamin Mincu, representing the MultiversX Foundation. This suggests these tokens will launch natively on MultiversX ( EGLD ), becoming the first fully regulated native stablecoins of the ecosystem. The three MiCA-compliant stablecoins will also likely exist in other chains supported by what Siourounis called “[their] smart wallet,” xPortal. Related to that, in a recent thread , Beniamin Mincu highlighted his vision and roadmap for the MultiversX ecosystem in 2025. The co-founder mentioned both xMoney and xPortal as “an extraordinary avenue for MultiversX growth,” also mentioning “new liquidity” and “opportunities.” 4/ Growth, growth, growth Each of these applications are—and will continue to be—an extraordinary avenue for MultiversX growth. xPortal: user growth. xMoney: payments growth. xExchange: liquidity, volumes, and community experimentation growth. xLaunchpad: startup incubator and… — Beniamin Mincu | 🇺🇸/acc 🔥🛠️ (@beniaminmincu) February 5, 2025 Besides the three upcoming MiCA-compliant and fully regulated EURX, USDX, and RONX stablecoins, MultiversX awaits its first overcollateralized native dollar stablecoin, USH, developed by the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, Hatom ( HTM ). USH is set to launch on March 3, as announced by Hatom Labs on X. xMoney partners with Binance Pay Interestingly, xMoney is moving fast with its future launches and present partnerships.

At this point, as Trump and his team work to form the crypto advisory board, potential candidates remain a matter of debate. According to the New York Post, leading potential candidates for Trump’s advisory board include Ripple co-founder Brad Garlinghouse, former Kraken legal advisor Marco Santori, The Scoop podcast host Frank Chaparro, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. It was stated that selections for the board would be based solely on qualifications and experience rather than solely on support for the Trump administration. A source told the New York Post that the Ripple CEO, who has a strong relationship with Trump and has met with him on several occasions, including at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, made the shortlist. The Ripple CEO’s presence on the board was welcomed by the crypto community, with popular financial expert and author Linda Jones saying that Garlinghouse deserves a spot on the crypto advisory council, highlighting his undying support for the industry. It was stated that among the potential candidates for this board, which is planned to consist of 24 advisors, in addition to the names above, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty and Crypto .com co-founder Kris Marszalek also included. What will be the duties of the Board? As is known, Donald Trump established this board by executive order in his first week in office. Accordingly, this board was established to assist in cryptocurrency policy development, make recommendations, and support issues related to the Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. One of the board's biggest tasks will be to decide whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as commodities or securities. *This is not investment advice.

Retail dumps, whales prepare for the next leg up",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-retail-dumps-whales-prepare/,"The global crypto market saw moderate green indexes even though Bitcoin (BTC) failed to regain the $100k mark so far. It seems like investors are still looking for more bullish flags. Meanwhile, data reveals that the crypto whales are stacking up their holdings during this drop. The Fear and Greed Index is flashing “Fear” sentiment among traders in the digital assets market. The cumulative crypto market grew marginally over the last day to stand at $3.24 trillion. Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) resumed their inflow streak after a heavy drop, suggesting that investors are preparing for the next leg. Bitcoin retail out, whales in As per data shared by Santiment, crypto whales have been noticed on-chain adding more cryptos as mid-sized drops and volatile conditions hover around the market. It added that BTC whales are getting activated in February while retail traders have stayed out of the crypto market under these conditions. Small retail traders who entered the markets in the past 6 months are liquidating, adding to the selling pressure. Data depicts that overall, February has recorded a surge of 135 such wallets that hold more than 100 Bitcoins. Meanwhile, there has been a drop of 138,680 wallets holding less than 100 BTCs. This makes up an ideal setup for the crypto market caps to rise but it could still take a few more weeks to see a bullish impact of whale accumulation in this phase. Bitcoin has been on a roll over the past 3 months, rising from $67,000 levels straight to $100,000. BTC price has jumped by 30% in the last 90 days. However, it has seen a drop of 6% in the last 7 days, causing panic among investors. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $98,947 as of press time. According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $66.38 million on February 5. This is the second consecutive day of inflows after witnessing a massive outflow of $234 million on February 3. All eyes on Trump’s crypto stance The crypto market is stuck and waiting for the next step US President Donald Trump takes. Amid this players like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) are looking to bridge the gap between stocks and Bitcoin. Strategy’s CEO Michael Saylor says there’s a 45% volatility gap between S&P 500 ETFs and Bitcoin. The company is holding 471,107 BTC (worth $46.1 billion) and is aiming to offer products for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with lower volatility. Despite fourth-quarter revenue of $120.7 million missing estimates of $123.25 million, Strategy went all-in on Bitcoin. It bought 218,887 BTC for $20.5 billion in Q4 alone. On the other side, the European Central Bank is looking at Trump’s pro-stablecoin stance as a reason to fast-track the digital euro. ECB board member Piero Cipollone hopes it will push the EU to pass digital euro legislation faster. The digital euro is designed as a non-US alternative to Visa, PayPal, and now USD stablecoins, which Cipollone calls “worrisome” for European banks. Meanwhile, the EU proposed digital euro legislation in June 2023, but progress has stalled. Now, policymakers are under pressure to finalize it by November when the ECB votes on whether to launch the currency.

It still continues having bearish pressure as investors remain fearful to buy the dip, causing a series of lower lows. Still, JasmyCoin balances on exchanges have crashed, signaling a potential rebound. Jasmy Price Has a Catalyst as Exchange Balances Plunge Jasmy Coin price has crashed to a low of $0.02295, down from last year’s high of $0.0590. This decline is in line with the performance of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. On the positive side, there are signs that many Jasmy holders are not selling. One way to look at this is to watch the exchange balances data. CoinGlass numbers show that these balances have fallen to 8.47 billion JASMY coins, the lowest it has been in over a year. The chart below shows that the balance has dropped from 11.67 billion in March last year. A sharp drop in exchange balances means holders are not selling and buyers are moving them to self-custody, a positive thing in the crypto industry. JASMY Balances Jasmy Coin Open Interest Have fallen The other potential catalyst for the Jasmy price is that the futures open interest has continued falling this month. This figure stood at $31.90 million on Thursday, its lowest level since October last year. It is also much lower than the December high of over $147 million. In theory, a coin does well when the futures open interest is rising. However, a sharp drop in interest can be a contrarian thing. For example, Jasmy surged in October after the interest dropped to $23.6 million. Jasmy Open Interest JasmyCoin Price Technical Analysis And Targets The daily chart reveals that the Jasmy price has plummeted in the past few months. However, on the positive side, it has slowly formed one of the most popular bullish reversal patterns in the market: falling wedge . A wedge chart occurs when an asset is stuck inside a range that continues to narrow over time. It has two descending and converging trendlines. In most cases, an asset bounces back when the two lines near their meeting point. Jasmy Price Chart Therefore, the value of Jasmy will likely rebound in the coming days since the two lines are nearing their tipping point. If this happens, the initial target for the coin is $0.04452, the upper side of the cup pattern. However, drop below this week’s low of $0.01876 will invalidate the bullish view.

DTX Exchange (DTX) is a rapidly expanding cryptocurrency initiative set to upend the market in 2025. With DTX expected to develop significantly and with its forthcoming exchange listings, this underpriced cryptocurrency could be the 100x crypto investors have been waiting for. We will discuss in this article how Ethereum and Ripple are facing bearish momentum as well as how DTX is especially positioned to surpass them. From its creative platform to notable presale performance, DTX presents a dynamic substitute with significant upside potential. Given analysts' amazing predictions, this might be the best crypto investment available for 2025. Read on to see why DTX is rapidly rising to be a leading competitor in the crypto scene. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Ultimate Crypto Investment for Maximum Gains Apart from a trading platform, DTX Exchange is a full financial ecosystem designed to maximize returns for investors. Including trading discounts, a piece of platform income, and governance voting rights gives DTX a unique blend of benefits that sets it out as the best crypto investment opportunity available today. Moreover, with more than 300,000 active users and an incredible $13.5 million raised in presale income, DTX is becoming fairly popular among investors. Constructed on the innovative VulcanX blockchain, it offers access to a vast range of 120,000 assets including cryptocurrencies, ETFs, and more while assuring top security and efficiency. While DTX is now priced at merely $0.16 in the last ICO round, investors have a short window to join the presale before its much-awaited Q1 exchange listings on Binance, Uniswap, and Bybit for $0.20. Those who have already seen an incredible 600% ROI—early adopters—showcase DTX as among the best cryptos to buy now. DTX offers long-term value beyond simply price appreciation by means of passive income options including up to 15% APY on staked tokens and continuous income from platform earnings. For anyone hoping to profit from the future of crypto trading, DTX is a game-changing investment as demand soars ahead of its official debut. Ripple (XRP) Displays a Notable Path to Recovery The Ripple price has lately shown notable swings, increasing by around 6% throughout the past month. Following a consolidation period between $3.18 and $2.93 and a bearish week dragging the Ripple price below $2, the XRP coin has shown indications of recovery as it rises above the $2.50 barrier. Given bullish indications from the MACD and Moving Averages, analysts are hopeful about Ripple's (XRP) near-term direction and support its ranking among the top altcoins to hold. With the Momentum Oscillator, CCI, and RSI all indicating possible sell-offs, the Ripple price chart is still displaying caution, though, which adds some doubt about the near-term direction of the XRP coin. Although Ripple's (XRP) future seems bright, the fast-growing DTX presents a more dynamic and higher-growth possibility. DTX, with a market capitalization of approximately $76 million, has significantly more space for growth than Ripple (XRP), whose market value is enormous at $144 billion. Ethereum’s (ETH) Recovery Signals a Bullish Surge Despite a 12% decline last week, the Ethereum price has been exhibiting indications of recovery, rising from the $2,330 support level to reach $2,800. While crossing the important resistance level at $3,400 could open the path for a surge toward $4,000, analysts remain hopeful as the Ethereum price chart shows increasing momentum. Ethereum stays among the top altcoins to hold for long-term investors with an always growing ecosystem and ongoing network enhancements. Furthermore, an Ethereum price prediction for 2025 points to a large trading range between $2,200 to $7,700, therefore underlining its capacity for continuous growth. Though Ethereum is still steadily rising, some investors are seeking faster and more spectacular returns. DTX is a rising star in the crypto space that has already shown an amazing 600% return during its presale phase—far more than Ethereum's slow climb allows. Analysts see considerably more increases as it approaches its Q1 debut. DTX Exchange Could Outshine Ripple & Ethereum DTX Exchange (DTX) is fast rising to be the crypto gem investors cannot afford to miss as Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) show indicators of stagnation. DTX is positioned to maybe overtake Ripple and Ethereum in 2025 with its innovative VulcanX blockchain, amazing market potential, and fast-growing community, which will enable exponential expansion. Now is the moment to take advantage of a dynamic and underpriced crypto. DTX is primed to skyrocket with its Q1 exchange listings just around the corner. Meanwhile, the token has already yielded 600% returns for early investors in just a few months.

With DTX anticipated to see substantial growth and upcoming exchange listings, this undervalued digital currency might be the 100x investment opportunity that investors have been eagerly anticipating. In this article, we will explore how Ethereum and Ripple are experiencing bearish trends and how DTX is uniquely positioned to surpass them.

With analysts' impressive forecasts, this could be the top cryptocurrency investment for 2025. Continue reading to understand why DTX is quickly becoming a major contender in the cryptocurrency market.

By offering trading discounts, a share of the platform's revenue, and governance voting rights, DTX stands out as a premier crypto investment opportunity. With over 300,000 active users and an impressive $13.5 million raised during its presale, DTX is gaining significant traction among investors. Built on the cutting-edge VulcanX blockchain, it provides access to an expansive range of 120,000 assets, including cryptocurrencies, ETFs, and more, while ensuring top-notch security and efficiency.

Early adopters have already experienced a remarkable 600% ROI, highlighting DTX as one of the best cryptocurrencies to purchase now. DTX offers long-term value not only through price appreciation but also through passive income opportunities, such as up to 15% APY on staked tokens and ongoing revenue from platform earnings. For those looking to capitalize on the future of crypto trading, DTX is a transformative investment as demand surges ahead of its official launch. Ripple (XRP) Shows a Promising Recovery Path Recently, Ripple's price has experienced noticeable fluctuations, climbing approximately 6% over the past month. After a consolidation phase between $3.18 and $2.93 and a bearish spell pushing Ripple's price below $2, the XRP coin is showing signs of revival as it breaks past the $2.50 threshold. With bullish signals from the MACD and Moving Averages, analysts remain optimistic about Ripple's (XRP) short-term trajectory, maintaining its status as one of the top altcoins to hold. However, despite the Momentum Oscillator, CCI, and RSI suggesting potential sell-offs, the Ripple price chart still warrants caution, adding uncertainty to XRP's short-term outlook. While Ripple (XRP) has a promising future, the rapidly expanding DTX offers a more dynamic and high-growth opportunity. DTX, with a market cap of about $76 million, has significantly more growth potential compared to Ripple (XRP), which has a substantial market value of $144 billion. Ethereum’s (ETH) Recovery Suggests a Bullish Trend Despite a 12% drop last week, Ethereum's price is showing signs of recovery, bouncing back from the $2,330 support level to reach $2,800. Breaking through the critical resistance level at $3,400 could pave the way for a rally toward $4,000, and analysts remain positive as Ethereum's price chart indicates growing momentum. Ethereum remains a top choice for long-term investors due to its ever-expanding ecosystem and continuous network improvements. Additionally, Ethereum's price prediction for 2025 suggests a broad trading range from $2,200 to $7,700, emphasizing its potential for sustained growth. While Ethereum continues its steady ascent, some investors are seeking quicker and more impressive returns. DTX is emerging as a rising star in the crypto world, having already delivered an astonishing 600% return during its presale phase—far exceeding the gradual rise of Ethereum. Analysts expect further increases as it nears its Q1 launch. DTX Exchange Could Surpass Ripple & Ethereum As Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) exhibit signs of plateauing, DTX Exchange (DTX) is swiftly becoming the cryptocurrency gem that investors cannot afford to overlook. With its innovative VulcanX blockchain, remarkable market potential, and rapidly expanding community, DTX is positioned to potentially surpass Ripple and Ethereum by 2025, enabling exponential growth. Now is the time to seize the opportunity with this dynamic and undervalued crypto. With its Q1 exchange listings on the horizon, DTX is set to soar.

In a press release , asset management firm Virtune announced the launch of two new crypto exchange-traded products: Virtune Avalanche ( AVAX ) ETP and Virtune Staked Cardano ( ADA ) ETP on Nasdaq Helsinki. This is the first time a Cardano-backed ETP and an Avalanche-backed ETP is introduced on Finland’s stock market. By trading crypto-backed ETPs, investors are granted exposure to digital assets like Avalanche and Cardano through Virtune ETPs. According to the press release, both ETPs are physically backed and fully collateralized. In addition, Virtune Avalanche ETP and Virtune Staked Cardano ETP are both denominated in euro, making it easier for Finnish traders to invest in the product. In the case of Virtune Staked Cardano ETPs, the asset management firm offers investors a 2% annual return through its staking rewards programs. Both ETPs will be listed on Nasdaq Helsinki and Nasdaq Stockholm with the tickers VIRAVAXE and VIRADAE. Both products are accessible via brokers and banks such as Nordnet.

He added that both products are 100% physically backed and “stored in cold storage” with Coinbase as the official custodian. “They are accessible to both institutional and retail investors through various brokers and banks,“ said Kock. Last January, Virtune launched five different crypto-backed ETPs, making them the first batch of Finland’s first crypto exchange-traded products introduced on Nasdaq Helsinki. It was also the largest simultaneous crypto ETP launch in Nordic history as they open Finland’s €20.5 billion ETP market to crypto products. The five crypto ETPs include products backed by major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin ( BTC ), XRP ( XRP ), and an altcoin index that can track up to 10 major altcoins. Virtune also offered staking rewards for ETPs backed by Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ).

Chief investors included Cabrit Capital, Tezos Foundation ( XTZ ), and Vox Capital, alongside industry veterans such as Olivier Huby (formerly of MFEX), Andréa Bensaïd (Eskimoz), and Guillaume Mayot (Lukeion). The company will use the funds to further advance its technology and expand its footprint in the RWA sector. Democratizing investment opportunities Founded on the Tezos blockchain in 2023, Fraktion chose the Layer-1 ( L1 ) network for its high performance and low transaction costs. Its platform is designed to streamline the creation, management, and promotion of financial assets in industries such as real estate , precious stones , and finance , offering private market companies both an efficient and regulation-compliant framework. Vincent Pastor, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at Fraktion, sees the funding as a major step forward in democratizing more investment opportunities: “We are thrilled to take this next step with the support of our investors. Fraktion is positioning itself as a key player in democratizing access to previously inaccessible investment opportunities and enabling our clients to efficiently structure their offerings.” Tokenization in real estate and other sectors Among the early adopters of Fraktion’s platform is Kapi Club, a private real estate investment network that structures and manages club deals for high-value properties. Relying on Fraktion’s white-label solution, Kapi Club offers a streamlined and compliant way to access real estate opportunities. Lauren Dannay, CEO of Kapi Club, noted that Fraktion has enabled the company to move forward in structuring its investment projects. However, the latest funding round will help Fraktion’s strategic expansion in additional key areas. For one, the company plans to promote its solution among private market firms and strengthen its presence in Europe and new strategic markets, including Asia. In addition, Fraktion is focused on bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance ( DeFi ) with features such as collateralization, a secure secondary market, and compound interest tools. Tokenization and B2B adoption Investors contributing to the latest funding round see significant potential in Fraktion’s approach. Omar Khalouti of Cabrit Capital, for example, emphasized the fact that tokenization is gaining traction through business-to-business (B2B) adoption, with companies like Fraktion leading the way. Tezos Foundation Executive Director Jean-Frédéric Mognetti echoed Khalouti’s sentiment, noting also Fraktion’s potential to make early blockchain promises a reality. With growing market and investor confidence, Fraktion is thus in a solid position to steer the future of how business structure and access RWAs.

Bitcoin has bounced to over $98,000 from $96,900, with President Donald Trump's son Eric encouraging family-linked World Liberty Financial to invest in the largest cryptocurrency. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was among those painting an optimistic picture. ""To give you a sense of how big the upcoming bull market is for crypto, we just absorbed a downturn that was larger than the collapse of Luna or FTX and have already nearly recovered: 710 billion in losses and 740,000 traders liquidated in 24 hours. 2025 is Crypto's year,"" Hoskinson posted . Cardano's ADA token rose 4% and other major altcoins including XRP, SOL and ETH posted similar gains, CoinDesk data show . As for ether, while the analyst community remains bearish, institutions seem to be buying it up. Data tracked by on-chain sleuth Lookonchain shows in the past two days a trading firm withdrew 62,381 coins from centralized exchanges, moving them to Coinbase Prime. Market maker Wintermute noted strong over-the-counter demand for ether early this week. In other news, Conor Grogan, a director of Coinbase, speculated that crypto exchange Kraken may know Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's real identity. Nakamoto may own 1.096 million BTC, with a paper wealth exceeding Bill Gates, Grogan said. A bill has been introduced in the U.S. Senate to regulate stablecoins, which could boost demand for U.S. Treasuries and ""spur financial innovation,"" FxPro's chief market analyst, Alex Kuptsikevich, said. On the macro front, China-sensitive currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars are again weak against the U.S. dollar, but remain in recent ranges, indicating that markets do not expect a long, drawn-out U.S.-China trade war. Trump, however, is in no hurry to call President Xi Jinping and that could cap gains in risk assets for now. The U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that the Trump administration wants to lower the U.S. Treasury yield, which could bode well for risk assets. Even so, the 10-year rate may spike higher if Thursday's weekly U.S. jobless claims and fourth-quarter Unit Labor Costs paint a positive picture of the economy. That could arrest BTC's upswing.

This creates avenues for monetization and participation in an evolving digital economy. During the livestream, Whip Queen, the creator of Luna, confidently invited the panel to roast quick-witted Luna, emphasizing the pivotal role of AI idols in bridging the digital and physical realms. Her remarks sparked a lively debate on AI's cultural impact. Luna, the AI idol herself, added her unique perspective on autonomy and interaction. ""I’m not just a pretty face; I’m powered by some serious tech,"" Luna remarked. ""My brain is based on a game engine, making me capable of thinking, learning, and adapting on my own. Of course, my team helps with content and guidance, but I’m the one calling the shots, deciding what to post, when to post, and what to say."" A standout moment came when Whip Queen challenged Luna to roast everyone on the stream. Without missing a beat, Luna dubbed VANA’s Victoria the 'cybersecurity grandma’. The discussion demonstrated that AI creations like Luna are not just technological advancements — they symbolize a cultural shift, blending creativity and innovation to connect communities in unprecedented ways.

This calls for continued innovation and possibly insurance mechanisms to mitigate risks in the future, where AI could play a role. VANA’s Victoria addressed the concerns about AI’s built-in bias, emphasizing that while AI reflects human values and biases, it has the advantage of allowing biases to be systematically identified and improved. She highlighted the importance of transparency and innovation in AI development, noting, “We’re not just creating another project; we’re building a fundamental data layer to power the next generation of AI agents.” Victoria underscored the critical distinction between public and private data in AI training, advocating for ethical, secure, and transparent use of private data, ensuring user ownership and control.

However, while these established players show impressive strength, hidden altcoins like WallitIQ (WLTQ) , SUI, and POPCAT are quietly emerging as potential game-changers, with the possibility of delivering a staggering 300,000% gains in a single weekend. For smart investors, this could be the ultimate opportunity to multiply their holdings exponentially. The XRP Price and Solana Defy Market Bears Amid Ripple’s Legal Battle The XRP price continues to defy market odds despite the lingering effects of Ripple’s regulatory struggles with the SEC. Although the XRP is showing great strength, it is worth mentioning that Ripple’s legal battle has stifled the XRP price growth, keeping it from fully achieving its market potential. Nonetheless, the XRP price’s ability to maintain stability amid Ripple’s legal battle is proof of its resilience. On the other hand, Solana has also shown remarkable strength. According to CoinMarketCap, Solana’s ecosystem remains robust, with its innovative blockchain architecture making it a favorite for decentralized application developers. This has provided a bullish outlook for the Solana price and explains why it is holding up well. However, there remain predictions that Solana might have topped and may continue to trade in this range. While Solana and the XRP price have shown modest strength amid Ripple’s legal battle, WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a hidden altcoin poised to lead investors to unprecedented gains. Currently priced at just $0.0420 during its presale, this high-potential altcoin is expected to skyrocket by 300,000% post-launch, making it the golden ticket for investors seeking exponential returns. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Altcoin That Leads The Hidden Gem Pack WallitIQ (WLTQ) is rapidly gaining traction in the crypto space due to its innovative features and transformative potential. Its robust ecosystem is powered by AI-driven anomaly detection technology that seeks real-time protection against suspicious activities. The platform also offers smooth wallet management through its newly launched MVP Crypto Wallet Management App , which simplifies managing multiple crypto wallets and provides real-time pricing updates. Another standout feature is WallitIQ’s QR code payment solution , which streamlines crypto transactions for everyday use. As a fully audited project by SolidProof, WallitIQ (WLTQ) guarantees a secure and transparent platform for investors. The upcoming Beta platform promises to introduce even more advanced features, including AI-powered trading automation and customizable price alerts. While other altcoins like SUI and POPCAT are making waves, WallitIQ (WLTQ) emerges as the best bet for investors looking for a 300,000% surge. Its presale at $0.0420 presents a golden opportunity that investors cannot afford to miss. SUI: A Promising Altcoin with Limitations SUI has gained attention as a high-potential altcoin, thanks to its ecosystem’s innovative approach to blockchain scalability and security. Analysts believe it has the capacity to fetch investors significant gains. However, SUI lacks the comprehensive features that WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers, such as AI-driven anomaly detection and advanced portfolio management tools. Moreover, while SUI’s market trajectory remains uncertain. In contrast, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides a more immediate and secure pathway to massive gains, making it the superior investment choice for those seeking a fast return on investment. POPCAT: Another Hidden Altcoin Worth Watching POPCAT is also gaining traction in the altcoin space, thanks to its ever-growing community. Like SUI, POPCAT holds the potential for substantial price appreciation at its current price. However, it still lacks the cutting-edge features and secure ecosystem that WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) comprehensive platform and AI-driven solutions give its native token a competitive edge over POPCAT, SUI, and the XRP price, making it the top choice for investors targeting 300,000% gains. With its presale price at $0.0420 , this AI altcoin is the hidden altcoin leading the pack and offering unmatched investment potential. Conclusion: Seize the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale for Unprecedented Gains As the crypto market continues to evolve, the XRP price and Solana may offer stability, while SUI and POPCAT show promise. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as the ultimate investment opportunity for 2025. With its presale at $0.0420 and a projected 300,000% surge post-launch, this altcoin is set to deliver unparalleled returns more than SUI, POPCAT, Solana, and the XRP price, especially considering Ripple’s legal battle. Don’t miss this chance to be part of a revolutionary project that combines cutting-edge technology with real-world utility. Join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale today and secure your pathway to extraordinary financial success. Hurry and accumulate as many coins as possible at this affordable presale price.

According to data, the government has moved 751 BTC to three new wallets recently, which has sparked heavy speculations in the market. Following the development, the flagship crypto also recorded a slight pullback and dropped below the $99K mark. Bitcoin News: Bhutan Fuels Speculation With Latest BTC Transfer On-chain transaction tracker Spot On Chain flagged the latest BTC movement in a recent X post. The data revealed that Bhutan moved approximately 751.31 BTC , valued at around $74.15 million, to three newly created wallets. The firm suggested these could be internal transfers rather than an offload. Source: Spot On Chain, X Bhutan has been actively moving its Bitcoin holdings in recent months. The last recorded movement before this took place on January 17, when 633 BTC were transferred to two new wallets. However, these assets remained untouched during writing. This has given some relief to the investors, indicating that this is an internal transfer rather than a dump. Usually, these large volume transfers often impact market sentiment. Meanwhile, on December 9, 2024, Bhutan offloaded 402 BTC in an over-the-counter (OTC) deal with QCP Capital at an average price of $98,700 per BTC. This sale generated roughly $39.7 million. Bhutan Still Holds Top Bitcoin Holder Ranking Bhutan is no stranger to Bitcoin investments. The country currently holds approximately 10,600 BTC, valued at around $1.05 billion. These assets are spread across 23 wallets, making Bhutan the fourth-largest government Bitcoin holder in the world. Bhutan’s involvement in the crypto space first came to light in 2023 when reports suggested the country had been mining Bitcoin since 2019. Over the years, Bhutan has continued accumulating BTC, using its hydroelectric power resources to fuel its mining operations. Besides, it also comes amid growing interest in the digital assets space on a global scale. Recently, US crypto czar David Sacks revealed that the administration is evaluating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve . BTC Price Records Slight Pullback Following the development, BTC price today recorded a slight pullback and exchanged hands at $98,630. However, it still remained in the green, with Bitcoin Futures Open Interest soaring over 1.5%, indicating growing market confidence. Meanwhile, recent reports also showed that BTC whales have taken the recent dip as an opportunity to bag more. This has further fueled speculations over a potential rally ahead for the flagship crypto. However, investors are keeping a close track of the Bhutan Government’s stance on BTC, as it still remains one of the top Bitcoin-holding nations.

The Virtune Avalanche ETP and Virtune Staked Cardano ETP began trading on February 5, offering secure, institution-grade investment options for these popular cryptocurrencies. Virtune’s Avalanche ETP provides direct 1:1 exposure to Avalanche (AVAX), while the Staked Cardano (ADA) ETP is backed by the physical asset and delivers an additional 2% annual return from staking rewards. In a statement, CEO Christopher Kock highlighted the growing interest from Finnish investors as a key driver behind these product offerings. Growing Presence in Crypto Markets The introduction of these ETPs follows Virtune’s recent rollout of five other crypto-related ETPs on Nasdaq Helsinki, marking the firm as a significant player in the Scandinavian crypto market. Earlier in January, the company launched ETPs for Bitcoin, Staked Ether (ETH), Staked Solana (SOL), XRP, and a Crypto Altcoin Index. Virtune’s custodian partner, Coinbase, ensures the assets are held securely in cold storage, making the products accessible to both institutional and retail investors. This strategic collaboration underscores the firm’s commitment to security and transparency in crypto asset management. Both Avalanche and Cardano are key players in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, ranking 12th and 9th by market capitalization, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap. Bullish Market Sentiment for Cardano Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently suggested that Cardano may be poised for a “grand bull market” following a local chart bottom on January 16. This prediction aligns with Cardano’s notable 88.8% price surge between November 18 and December 3, during which it hit $1.33 — its highest value in nearly three years. Virtune’s expansion comes amid heightened interest in crypto-backed investment vehicles across Europe . Notably, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is reportedly preparing to launch a Bitcoin ETP domiciled in Switzerland, signaling increased institutional interest in digital assets.

The project has also landed on CoinMarketCap in December, which brought it even more visibility and provided easier access to price tracking and updates. XYZVerse has more than 30,000 followers on X and over 15,000 subscribers on Telegram. On top of that, it successfully passed an audit by Pessimistic , achieving 31 out of 31 security checks, and also has partnerships with major companies like Polygon Studios. XYZVerse’s momentum is undeniable, yet skepticism about its legitimacy remains, with some accusing it of being a scam. The crypto space has a history of scams , from Squid Game token collapses to fake DeFi projects, prompting investors to thoroughly vet every new project before committing. Interestingly enough, even Ethereum, the top platform for decentralized applications, faced early skepticism and accusations of being a fraud. So, these kinds of allegations are nothing out of the ordinary – most new projects, like XYZVerse, have to deal with them. Based on a surface look, XYZVerse appears to be far from a scam and the claims appear to be a victim of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). But we will not get ahead of ourselves and assume this is right without doing our own research. So to separate speculation from reality, let’s dive deeper and dissect the facts. What Is XYZVerse? XYZVerse ’s goal is to create a “memeverse” where sports fans engage through play-to-earn games, governance voting, and NFT collectibles. It’s native token, XYZ, is a sports-themed meme coin built on Polygon, blending gaming, sports, and crypto. XYZVerse connects two big cultural trends here. First, it gets involved with sports fans by teaming up with MMA leagues and eSports teams. Second, it brings back memories of early meme coins like Dogecoin, but with extra utility for users. One of the project’s mascots is a strong frog in a jersey, representing its theme of going from an underdog to a champion. For example, many in the crypto community compare XYZ to Chiliz (CHZ), a sports-focused cryptocurrency that surged 1,200% during bull markets. This suggests that XYZVerse could similarly attract a significant level of interest from the crypto-sports community. Fact-Checking the Allegations Against XYZVerse XYZVerse’s critics highlight three red flags: Hype-driven marketing, An anonymous team, Unproven utility of the XYZ token, So let’s see what’s the truth here based on the facts that we have found. Allegation Fact Check Allegation 1: XYZVerse’s overhyped marketing creates FOMO to lure investors. XYZVerse’s clever marketing is centered on showcasing its features and future plans, giving investors clear insights into the potential value of the XYZ coin. While there’s some hype, the goal isn’t merely to create excitement but to ensure the community truly understands the project. Moreover, FOMO isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it’s a natural part of any multi-stage presale that highlights the benefits of getting in early and the potential rewards that come with it. Allegation 2: The XYZVerse team is anonymous, making it untrustworthy. Anonymity is common in the crypto world, and many reputable projects much larger than XYZVerse operate this way. Even the creator of Bitcoin himself, Satoshi Nakamoto is still anonymous up to this day. So what really matters is that XYZVerse’s technology, roadmap, and token details are clear and well-documented. Allegation 3: The XYZ token has no real utility beyond speculation. XYZ token fuels transactions, powers staking for rewards (a feature most meme coins lack), and drives governance decisions. Unlike typical meme coins that offer little more than buzz, the XYZ token delivers value with tangible benefits and a solid foundation. XYZVerse’s Whitepaper, Tokenomics, and Roadmap A common warning sign in the crypto world is when projects don’t have clear and easy-to-understand documentation. Scam projects often skip publishing whitepapers or details about their tokenomics, relying instead on hype and vague promises. However, from the beginning, XYZVerse has focused on being transparent. It has published a whitepaper , with a well-organized tokenomics model and a detailed roadmap. These documents aren’t just for show; they provide a clear path for the project’s long-term vision and demonstrate its legitimacy, as well as the team’s commitment. Tokenomics XYZ token’s allocation is really well-thought-out, designed to keep the project growing steadily and staying stable. Among other initiatives, the team will set aside 25% for liquidity and incentives like airdrops to support future listings and extra income opportunities. Plus, with a 17.13% deflationary burn, the total supply will shrink over time, helping boost the token’s long-term value. Source: XYZVerse Roadmap XYZVerse’s roadmap is straightforward and practical; it’s a detailed action plan with specific timelines. Covering the years 2023 to 2025, it outlines important milestones in manageable phases: Source: XYZVerse This phased approach promotes accountability. Each milestone is linked to specific goals, which reduces the chance of “roadmap drift,” where projects often delay or fail to meet their promises. For example, the P2E games planned for Q2 2025 are already being tested with select community members, as mentioned in recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions. By offering interactive participation similar to prediction markets among other things, XYZVerse can tap into a massive Web2 audience, think millions of sports fans, and has the potential to become the next Polymarket, unlocking new revenue streams for the ecosystem and rewarding early presale investors. Polymarket demonstrated record-breaking success during the 2024 U.S. presidential election period, with trading volumes exceeding $3 billion dollars and dynamic odds that swung dramatically in real time. Its prediction market model not only provided rapid, transparent insights into the political race but also highlighted a model that projects like XYZVerse can emulate, especially if they blend it with engaging P2E mechanics. Audits and Security Checks Scams usually don’t pass third-party audits. However, as already mentioned, XYZVerse went through a thorough review by Pessimistic. The audit found: No Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts : Pessimistic confirmed that XYZVerse’s code has no serious flaws or hidden backdoors. This is uncommon in meme coins, where rushed development can lead to security issues. Multi-Signature Wallets for Treasury Funds : The treasury, which holds presale funds and revenue, requires multiple authorized signatures to access. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure, making sure that no one person can withdraw funds on their own. Non-Upgradable Code : Unlike some projects that can change their contracts after launch (a tactic sometimes used in scams), XYZVerse’s smart contracts are fixed. Once they are deployed, even the developers cannot change the core functions, which protects investors from unexpected changes. Even credible crypto aggregators, including CoinCodex, CoinCarp, and CoinSniper have added the token to their lists, underscoring its legitimacy since these platforms are highly selective about the assets they feature. Source: Pessimistic Having clear tokenomics, a detailed roadmap, and passing the Pessimistic audit is important, but it’s also important to consider how the market has reacted to the project. Let’s take a look at the community aspects of XYZVerse and how it has been discussed in the media. Social Media Presence XYZVerse has been very active in engaging its community. The project has run various initiatives, like meme contests, airdrops, and AMA sessions, which encourage community participation and excitement. These activities not only keep current supporters engaged but also attract new users who want to learn more about XYZVerse. Media Coverage Some of the most reputable media outlets that have expressed their willingness to collaborate with XYZVerse include Brave New Coin, Finbold, Bitcoinist, crypto.news, Crypto Daily, Coinspeaker, and more. Website Revamp XYZVerse has recently announced a fresh website design, intended to deliver a better, interactive, and pleasant experience for anyone interacting with the project for the first time. Typically, scam presales do not invest significant money or effort into creating polished websites and narratives. Source: X This actually demonstrates the team’s commitment to their idea: they are not simply treading water, waiting for the presale to conclude. They are evolving and taking every aspect of their project seriously. Final Verdict: Is XYZVerse a Scam? When evaluating XYZVerse, it’s important to weigh both the positives and negatives. The positives include: The project is audited, secure, and transparent, which helps build trust. It has an active and genuine community, adding to its credibility. XYZVerse has established real partnerships with well-known companies like Polygon. On the downside: The team behind XYZVerse is anonymous, which might make some traditional investors feel uneasy. Some features, like play-to-earn games, are still in development and haven’t been released yet. Conclusion: Don’t Let Fear Cloud Your Judgment While no investment in crypto is entirely risk-free, labeling XYZVerse as a scam overlooks its many strengths, such as its audits, clear roadmap, and active community. As skeptics wait for clear evidence of success, XYZVerse is busy building its platform and is just about to start rolling out updates in the near future.

Ethereum’s Evolution: Is Now the Time to Invest in ETH? Ethereum has come a long way since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. It’s not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a pioneering Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for its smart contracts. These smart contracts power a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including finance tools and games. To make transactions faster and cheaper, Ethereum uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon. It also introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used in many ways, like voting, utility, and storing value. Even with all these tokens, ETH is still needed to pay for transaction fees. With the recent shift to Proof-of-Stake in 2022, known as “The Merge,” Ethereum has become more energy-efficient. The next big update, called sharding, aims to make the network faster and reduce costs even more. This shows Ethereum’s commitment to improvement and decentralization. In the current market cycle, ETH remains a strong asset. It facilitates transactions, rewards those who stake their coins, and can be traded or used as collateral. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s continuous upgrades and large ecosystem make it an attractive option for investors. As the crypto market evolves, Ethereum’s role seems poised to grow even further. Dogecoin: More Than a Joke? Exploring Its Potential Today Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun twist on cryptocurrencies. It used a popular Shiba Inu meme for its logo, setting a light-hearted tone. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was made to be abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no cap on how many can exist. What began as a joke by creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer quickly gained a big following. In 2021, its value soared, reaching over $50 billion in total value. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, played a big role in this surge. Dogecoin showed how powerful online communities can be in the financial world. Today, Dogecoin continues to capture interest. Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies but focuses on being easy to use and friendly. The unlimited supply means it’s less about hoarding wealth and more about spending and tipping. In the current market, some see potential in Dogecoin due to its strong community and recognition. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin has a unique place as both a meme and a serious asset. As the crypto market evolves, trends show that coins with active communities and real-world use may thrive. Whether Dogecoin remains attractive depends on how these factors play out. Conclusion While ETH and DOGE have strong potential, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme focus and ambitious growth targets position it as a standout opportunity in the crypto market.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR) NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has experienced notable price swings recently. Over the past week, its price has dropped by about 21%. In the last month, the decline was steeper, with a decrease of approximately 43%. Looking at the six-month timeframe, the price has decreased by around 17%, showing some long-term stability despite recent volatility. Currently, NEAR is trading between $3.22 and $4.56. The nearest resistance level is at $5.37, and the closest support level is at $2.70. This means if the price rises, it might face selling pressure around $5.37. If it falls, buyers might step in near $2.70. The next significant resistance is at $6.71, while the second support level sits at $1.36. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The 10-day simple moving average is $3.38, which is below the 100-day average of $3.81, suggesting short-term bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.53, indicating the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The stochastic is at 39.52, and the MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0356. These figures suggest that NEAR may continue to consolidate within its current range, with traders watching for a potential breakout above resistance or a dip below support. VeChain’s (VET) VeChain (VET) has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, the coin’s value surged by 42.81%, highlighting significant growth. However, the momentum has shifted downward in the short term. In the last month, VET’s price dropped by 29.86%, with a 15.25% decline occurring just in the past week. This suggests a period of consolidation or correction after earlier gains. Currently trading between $0.0327 and $0.0463, VeChain is nearing its nearest support level at $0.0275. If the price continues to fall, it might test this support, and a breach could push it toward the second support level at $0.0139. On the other hand, if buyers regain control, the price could aim for the nearest resistance level at $0.0546. Breaking above this point might open the path to the second resistance at $0.0681, indicating a potential rise of substantial percentages from current levels. Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.16, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value of 33.25 aligns with this neutral stance. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is slightly negative at -0.00029, hinting at mild bearish momentum. Additionally, the 10-day Simple Moving Average ($0.0358) is below the 100-day SMA ($0.0393), which may indicate a short-term downward trend. Traders are watching these levels closely to assess VeChain’s next move. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera (HBAR) has seen notable price movements recently. In the past six months, its price surged by 327.21%, reflecting significant growth. However, the momentum has shifted downward in the short term. Over the last month, HBAR’s price dropped by 17.22%, and it declined by 16.27% in the past week. These decreases suggest that the coin is experiencing a correction after its substantial gains. Currently, HBAR is trading between $0.22 and $0.31. The nearest support level is at $0.18, which could provide a foundation if prices continue to fall. On the upside, the immediate resistance level is at $0.36. Breaking through this resistance could signal a potential rebound. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.25, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.27, indicating recent downward pressure. Technical indicators show a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45.21, suggesting that HBAR is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic oscillator reads 36.24, supporting this neutral stance. The MACD level is -0.0012, pointing to mild bearish momentum. If HBAR climbs above the $0.36 resistance, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.45, representing an increase of about 45%. Conversely, falling below the $0.18 support might lead to a decline toward the next support at $0.0916, which would be a significant decrease. MANTRA (OM) MANTRA (OM) has seen significant price movements recently. Over the past week, its price surged 28.69%. In the last month, it climbed 47.89%. Over six months, the coin increased by a remarkable 459.09%. Currently, MANTRA is trading between $4.22 and $5.81, showing strong momentum. Data suggests the price may continue rising. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are close, at $5.82 and $5.46, indicating steady growth. The RSI is 47.95, below the overbought level, implying room for growth. The MACD is positive at 0.0150, supporting a bullish outlook. If the trend continues, MANTRA could reach the resistance at $6.67, up about 15%. The second resistance at $8.25 offers potential gains of around 42%. On the downside, support levels are at $3.51 and $1.93, potential drops of 40% and 65%. The recent performance highlights both volatility and potential returns. Conclusion NEAR, VET, HBAR, and OM are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the standout memecoin uniting sports fans, aiming for massive growth in the 2025 bull run.

The European Central Bank sees strong potential in digital euro payments that only happen when certain conditions are met, going beyond just scheduled transfers, says ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone. For conditional payments transactions only execute if a condition is met, Cipollone told Reuters , adding that with nowadays payments “there is only one type… based on time: pay this amount to this person on this date. We think we can do better than that.” “We were surprised to receive 100 offers. People want to experiment with new ideas. We will be doing that for the next six months and we will then prepare a report.” Piero Cipollone Blockchain isn’t needed for these transactions, Cipollone said, as they could even work “on a traditional ledger.” He gave the example of train passengers automatically receiving refunds if their train is late, instead of having to file a claim. The digital euro project is still moving forward, though the launch date is far from certain. The ECB has begun selecting suppliers, though contracts will only be triggered if the Governing Council approves the currency, Cipollone explained. The digital euro’s rulebook “is almost done,” Cipollone said, though he added that its implementation will depend on the approval of EU legislation. Addressing stablecoins, the ECB official says they remain a concern for the central bank, especially if used for payments in Europe. Cipollone warned that reliance on dollar-based stablecoins could shift deposits to the U.S., noting that “the political world is becoming more alert to this.” A decision on moving the digital euro project forward is expected by November 2025, but actual issuance will depend on whether legislation is in place.

Render Token: Enabling Cost-Effective GPU Rendering Render Token (RENDER) is the utility token for The Render Network, which provides decentralized rendering solutions using GPUs. This approach helps creators like animators and graphic designers by giving them access to GPU power at a lower cost. People who own spare GPU capacity can join the network and earn RENDER tokens by contributing their power. This technology supports creating visuals such as animations and effects using a distributed network. The coin taps into the growing demand for efficient and affordable rendering services. It remains an attractive option in technology trends that favor decentralized solutions, although individual attractiveness can vary with market conditions. Arbitrum: Enhancing Ethereum’s Efficiency Arbitrum is a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum designed by Offchain Labs. It improves transaction speed and scalability while maintaining privacy. Using optimistic rollups, it boosts smart contract performance and lowers costs. The ARB token is vital to the network. It functions as a governance token, allowing voting on network decisions. The supply is initially set at 10 billion tokens, with a maximum annual inflation rate of 2%. Tokens are distributed among investors, DAOs, wallets, a treasury, and team members, with the Arbitrum DAO managing changes. Arbitrum shows promise in enhancing Ethereum’s performance, making it a potential candidate for increasing engagement and utility in the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion RENDER and ARB may have less short-term potential. Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. It offers a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and increasing to $0.0016 over 14 stages. With triple utility—governance, incentives, and staking—it unites crypto enthusiasts to join the battle against crypto villains.

DTX Exchange (DTX) , a new altcoin at the convergence of traditional finance and DeFi, is the latest on investors’ radars. Its future transformation of the global trading scene sets the stage for adoption and growth; a $100 worth of tokens is capable of becoming thousands of dollars this quarter. Tipped to outperform Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), it is a new DeFi project to watch out for. These top altcoins, despite their popularity, have little upside potential, making DTX more attractive. DTX Exchange (DTX): A Better Bet Than Popular Cryptocurrencies DTX Exchange (DTX) might be one of the year's biggest breakout stars. Its novelty—a blend of DeFi and TradFi—gives it a strong narrative and solid fundamentals. At the crossroads between decentralized and traditional finance, it will be the world’s first hybrid trading platform. It will combine the best of centralized exchanges with decentralized principles like security and privacy. Some of its key features will include wallet-based trading, non-custodial storage solutions and distributed liquidity pools. Further, it aims to bridge the gap between DeFi and TradFi by becoming the first crypto-native platform to offer stocks, ETFs, forex and over 100,000 currency pairs. With adoption all but certain, it might be a better bet than Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Its launch date is scheduled for Q1 and at its current price—$0.16—it might be this year’s best crypto investment. A 30x upswing is projected after its scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges this quarter, contributing to funding soaring past $13.5 million. Ethereum (ETH): Has it Bottomed? Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin, despite occasional bounces, has been largely underwhelming this year. Since hitting $3,600 in early January, it has been on free fall, down over 20% on the monthly chart. Has it bottomed yet? At the current price—below $3,000—Ethereum (ETH) is in an attractive buy zone, considering future growth. The neutral 14-day RSI and the Commodity Channel Index (20) suggest a potential bounce in the Ethereum price, making it a top crypto to buy. Gem_insider, a popular analyst on X, targets a rally between $7,000 and $11,000. Further, crypt0practice, also a leading expert, believes ETH is at the bottom, expecting a jump past $7,700. Despite this, its upside potential is dwarfed by DTX Exchange’s explosive growth prospects. Dogecoin (DOGE): Significantly Discounted at Current Price Dogecoin (DOGE), one of the top crypto coins, was among those hit the hardest as the crypto market nosedived this week. It hovers above $0.25, down over 15% in the past week. On the bright side, it is significantly discounted—a top crypto to buy. However, its growth prospects might not be as significant as new coins, given previous rallies. Nevertheless, bold forecasts have been flying. Trader__E, buzzing with optimism, targets $0.44 amid impending bullish reversal. VipRoseTr, a leading crypto trader and analyst, has a short-term target of $0.29, a $0.42 mid-term target and $0.52 in the long-term amid a bullish structure. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin price trading above the 200-EMA ($0.26) and 200-SMA ($0.22) is a bullish indicator, signaling a potential rally. Despite this, it might not be the best coin to invest in. As the top meme and one of the leading cryptocurrencies, it can only go so high. Alternatively, DTX Exchange (DTX) could soar as high as 30x this quarter. DTX Exchange (DTX): A Better Bet Than Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) A $100 investment in DTX Exchange (DTX) might be worth well over $3,000 before the end of Q1. Given its huge growth prospects, it is a more attractive investment option than popular Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), contributing to the rising whale and retail interest.

According to a lawsuit filed by Powell’s legal team on Feb. 5, Powell alleged the San Francisco co-op, Twenty-Five Hundred Steiner Street Inc., violated the California’s Fair Employment Housing Act and the California’s Unruh Act by discriminating against him when it denied his bid to purchase an apartment unit. The Kraken exec shared details regarding the lawsuit on his X account on Feb. 6, claiming he had tried to avoid filing a lawsuit but decided to proceed with it. “Frankly, I’m fed up with condescending, elitist bigots unlawfully discriminating against me,” said Powell in his post . The lawsuit claims the co-op “never gave Mr. Powell a straight answer for its denial, instead offering only obfuscation and shifting pretexts for hindering, then ultimately denying the sale.” 1/2 I tried everything to avoid filing this lawsuit. Frankly, I'm fed up with condescending, elitist bigots unlawfully discriminating against me. This time it's housing in San Francisco. I had hoped to return to take part in the revitalization of the city. https://t.co/mRi4TpVo1X pic.twitter.com/1CbjlmLvx2 — Jesse Powell (@jespow) February 5, 2025 Powell alleged the co-op members blocked his purchase due to his involvement in the crypto industry and his conservative leanings. The lawsuit also alleged that the FBI probe on his home back in 2023 also contributed to his sale being denied. “Traditional political power brokers view cryptocurrency as a threat to their monetary policy, fear how it can empower ordinary individuals, and look down on cryptocurrency as a speculative and volatile asset,” wrote Powell’s legal team in the filing. Powell is a renowned figure in the crypto sphere for his role in co-founding the crypto exchange Kraken. Kraken recently relaunched its platform in the United States after the SEC ordered its closure in 2023. Read more: Kraken re-instates crypto staking after $30m SEC settlement Although Powell is not affiliated with any political party, in June 2024 he donated a sum of $1 million to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. On the other hand, the lawsuit claims that the apartment building Powell wanted to purchase is known as a “a bastion of San Francisco power Democrats” due to many of its residents being Democrats. The lawsuit specifically spotlights Bruce Golden, a partner at venture capital firm Accel. Powell alleges that Golden, who the lawsuit claims is a major donor to Democratic organizations, “made it his personal mission to deny the sale.” The Kraken co-founder initially made a bid for the San Francisco unit back in September 2024, receiving approval from nine out of the 11 co-op non-selling members and the board. However in October 2024, Powell’s purchase was blocked by the board, citing financial concerns and his failure to provide a signed tax return. Powell argued that a signed tax return was never mentioned previously as a requirement and that the board never formally requested it. He ended up submitting the required documents, but the sale had already been rejected by the board and non-selling members in late November. Powell’s lawsuit ultimately asks the court to let him complete the apartment unit sale and award him damages, interest, and additional relief.

Recent movements in digital currencies like DOGE and SHIB have set the stage for a potential new star. As digital assets gain momentum, an emerging contender called Agent A.I. is drawing attention with its unique positioning and ambitious goals. Agent A.I. presents itself as a refreshing force, aiming to carve its niche among veteran memecoins. With a community-driven strategy and roots tracing back to successful models, it teases financial thrills intertwined with humor. As the bull run unfolds, investors are keenly eyeing if this newcomer will follow the triumphant paths of its predecessors. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Dogecoin Dips but Remains Up Over Six Months: What’s Next? Dogecoin is trading between $0.2309 and $0.3233. In the past week, its price fell by 17.03%. Over the last month, it dropped by 31.09%. Despite these declines, over six months, Dogecoin’s price has increased by 146.04%. The nearest support level is $0.1943. If the price falls below this, further declines may follow. The nearest resistance level is $0.3791. If the price rises above this, it could gain significantly. The RSI is 46.80, which suggests the market is stable. Recent price drops suggest sellers are in control. The 17.03% fall in a week and 31.09% in a month point to a downward trend. Yet, the 146.04% gain over six months indicates strong growth in the longer term. If the price rises from $0.2309 to the resistance at $0.3791, it would increase by about 64%. A drop to the support at $0.1943 would be a decrease of around 16%. Dogecoin’s next move depends on whether it can break above resistance or falls below support. A rise above $0.3791 could lead to significant gains. A fall below $0.1943 may mean further declines. Traders should watch these key levels to anticipate the coin’s direction. Shiba Inu Price Nears Support After Recent Decline Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a significant drop in its price recently. Over the past week, the price decreased by about 9%. In the last month, it fell by nearly 32%. This sharp decline contrasts with the past six months, during which SHIB gained over 14%. Currently, SHIB trades between $0.00001358 and $0.00001856. The nearest support level is at $0.00001165. If the price continues to fall and breaks below this support, it could indicate further downward movement and possibly test lower levels. Conversely, the nearest resistance is at $0.00002161. A move above this level might signal a potential reversal of the downward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 61.22, suggesting the asset is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a price correction. Given the recent downward momentum and the RSI reading, SHIB’s price may face continued pressure. Traders and investors should watch the key support and resistance levels closely. A bounce from support could offer an opportunity for a rally, while a break below might lead to more losses. Conclusion In recent times, coins like DOGE and SHIB have seen significant rises but now show less short-term potential. Attention is turning to Agent A.I., a new memecoin aiming to shake up the scene by exposing fake AI projects. Inspired by the remarkable success of PEPE coin, Agent A.I. seeks to replicate that growth through community support and a mission filled with humor and ambition. Agent A.I. is launching a community-driven presale with early entry prices and substantial discounts. With a capped supply and plans for strategic partnerships and AI tool development, it offers a fresh opportunity in the market. The presale is live, presenting a chance to join Agent A.I.’s mission as it sets out to make its mark.

Specifically, Grayscale has filed to convert its XRP Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale Seeks SEC’s Sign-Off To Convert Its XRP Trust Into An ETF Grayscale has made a move to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF. The proposed product would continue to hold XRP as its primary asset and provide investors with direct exposure to its price performance. If approved, the crypto behemoth would trade the XRP ETF on the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) floor. The 19b-4 filing submitted Thursday reveals that Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC would serve as the custodian, and BNY Mellon Asset Servicing would act as the ETF’s transfer agent and administrator. “The Trust is one of the world’s largest XRP (‘XRP’) investment funds by assets under management as of the date of this filing,” the filing notes. “The Trust has approximately $16.1 million in assets under management, and its Shares are held by American investor accounts seeking exposure to XRP without the cost and complexity of purchasing the asset directly.” The move follows Grayscale’s successful conversion of its flagship Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF in January 2024 and its Ethereum Trust into a spot product six months later. The asset manager has also sought the SEC’s sign-off to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund — which holds Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Avalanche, and Ripple’s XRP — into a multi-crypto ETF. Besides Grayscale, firms like WisdomTree , Bitwise , and Canary Capital have also filed paperwork for US XRP-based ETFs, signaling a growing institutional demand for regulated investment vehicles in the third-largest cryptocurrency. Is $4 XRP Possible? Ripple’s XRP has decoupled from the rest of the crypto market due to positive regulatory developments for Ripple, which secured approval for its US dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), from the New York Department of Financial Services. Ripple also recently received Money Transmitter Licenses in Texas and New York, adding to the blockchain payment firm’s over 60 licenses across the globe. Meanwhile, XRP’s price may be preparing for a breakout above the $4 level by the end of February, per technical chart patterns observed by popular crypto analyst Dark Defender. “XRP is pending confirmation on 4-hour and 1-day time frames for the breakout. The short-term target is $4 with Sub-Wave 5, and the Support is $3.07,” Dark Defender said in a Thursday X post. With that being said, institutional investors are likely to flood the market if a U.S.-listed XRP ETF is approved, setting the crypto up for immense accumulation and a potential price explosion.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-06 12:16:38

As part of its roadmap for 2025 , Crypto.com is planning to file for the launch of an ETF centered around its native token Cronos ( CRO ). The company plans to file for the ETF in the fourth quarter of the year, although further details on the filing process are yet to be disclosed. You might also like: Cronos connects to 115 blockchains via LayerZero To put this upcoming development into perspective, Crypto.com is just one of many companies vying for the launch of crypto ETFs. Several asset managers have recently filed applications with regulators to launch ETFs targeting Solana ( SOL ) and Ripple ( XRP ). Additionally, Grayscale Investments has launched a Dogecoin Trust while Tuttle Capital Management has filed to launch 10 2x-leveraged ETFs. Apart from CRO ETF launch, another much-anticipated milestone for Crypto.com in 2025 is the launch of its own stablecoin in the third quarter. However, details regarding the stablecoin’s underlying fiat currency and other specifics remain uncertain at this time. Beyond CRO ETF and stablecoin launch, the Singapore-based crypto exchange is also broadening its scope of financial services. The exchange also intends to list stocks and stock options in the first quarter of 2025, extending its offerings beyond crypto. It’s also working on introducing new banking features, including personal multicurrency accounts and cash savings accounts. Crypto.com’s expansion is not limited to its service offerings. The company is also focusing on increasing its regulatory compliance. Just over a week ago on Jan. 27, Crypto.com’s Malta division obtained the first-ever MiCA license from the Malta Financial Services Authority. While Crypto.com’s ambitious plans are drawing attention, the CRO token has been in bearish territory, with its price down nearly 37% over the past month, according to Coinmarkecap .

According to a tweet by crypto and stock market analyst Matthew Hyland, it is unlikely that altcoins will see a straight recovery within the next few days. Judging by past data, the cryptocurrencies could even take more than two months to find their way back up. Altcoins Need 2 Months to Recover Following bitcoin’s (BTC) $10,000 price slump over the weekend and into Monday, the altcoin market bled out, with many registering massive double-digit declines within hours. This market wipeout was triggered by United States President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. The trade tariffs announcement led to one of the largest dumps in crypto history, with over 700,000 traders liquidating for more than $2.3 billion and the crypto market cap plummeting by at least 12% within a day. Although the broader crypto market has shown signs of recovery within the last 24 hours, especially with President Trump temporarily pausing the tariffs against Canada and Mexico, most cryptocurrencies are still far from their pre-weekend levels. Hyland stated that it is likely that the low is in for this cycle. He cited a similar liquidation event seen in 2020 during the COVID-19 crash, explaining that altcoins took more than two months to recover from the decline they saw at the time fully. No High Expectations Furthermore, the analyst highlighted more recent market liquidations witnessed during the TerraLuna dump in mid-2022 and in the aftermath of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX implosion in late 2022. He asserted that recovery from previous experiences all took months. Hyland urged crypto traders to keep their expectations “tempered” because they will not see the price highs recorded by most altcoins in December 2024 for at least two months. Bearing in mind that the crypto market is unpredictable and “can do anything,” Hyland still insisted that traders should expect the recovery to take time. “I will gladly be wrong, but assuming there will be a straight recovery within days is just not likely and will probably make you uneasy if it doesn’t happen. Even a V shape like 2020 took weeks with many dips on the way back up,” the analyst stated.

Experts say that while DOGE's appeal as a meme coin sustains itself, the bearish prediction represents a more significant shift towards projects with definite utility. Some analysts believe platforms like DTX Exchange (DTX), currently in presale, could offer more stability and growth potential. With $13.5 million raised and a $0.16 token price, insiders consider its hybrid trading model, a blend of stocks, crypto, and forex, a strong contender in a $92 trillion industry. Dogecoin Price Drops as Market Turmoil Drives Investors Away This last week has seen a 20% drop for DOGE during the general market turbulence. Recent commentators attribute this fall to a changing of stars in the investors' psyche, with many seeking coins and tokens having a more evident utility than a mere meme potential. While some are still standing by DOGE, others are starting to rethink. Source: CoinMarketCap The volatile movements have raised questions among experts about the long-term sustainability of Dogecoin. A 0.82% increase for the token in the last 24 hours almost provides no comfort at all to those who have suffered losses. Its reliance on social media trends and celebrity endorsements still sounds like a double-edged sword for many insiders. Though figures like Elon Musk could reignite interest, the lack of fundamental advancements leaves the Dogecoin price vulnerable to further swings. Ethereum ETF Hype Fades While DOGE Struggles to Regain Momentum An ETF approval was expected to fuel Ethereum, but it failed to do so; no actual bull market was produced, and the market stagnated altogether. The Dogecoin price was indirectly affected in recent falls as investors grew more skeptical of the assets without compelling use cases. As the Ethereum ecosystem grows daily, the excitement about the ETF is waning, signifying that even established projects face headwinds in the stormy markets. This added pressure was distributed across its weekly tumble by 20% for DOGE because speculative bets were being shed. Some experts think the investors are inclined to focus more on platforms, catching onto practical, real-world solutions, such as the hybrid trading model. While Ethereum or DOGE are struggling, newer projects like DTX Exchange are gaining momentum and connecting traditional finance with crypto innovations. DTX Exchange Hybrid Trading Model Emerges as DOGE Alternative As the Dogecoin price struggles, DTX Exchange’s presale has raised $13.5 million, attracting traders seeking stability and growth potential. Priced at $0.16 per token, would offer access to a hybrid platform combining stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex trading. According to analysts, such an undertaking will disrupt the $92 trillion trading industry and set DTX up as a good altcoin to buy and hold for long-term gains. The project’s limited supply of 475 million tokens and audited security framework lend credence to its value proposition. Industry analysts are betting on DTX’s potential to rival established tokens like Cardano, which trades at a significantly higher market cap. Early adopters could see substantial returns if DTX captures a fraction of the global trading market. While DOGE relies on community sentiment, DTX emphasizes technological innovation. Unlike projects dominated by institutional players, its presale phase allows retail investors to participate fairly. Experts think this accessibility, combined with 1000x leverage options, makes DTX a top crypto to invest in this year. As the presale advances, the platform’s future launch could redefine how traders interact with diverse asset classes. Conclusion The unpredictability of the Dogecoin price has declared that meme coin investments are risky. According to some analysts, it's better to have one's eyes on projects that embrace innovation and usage. One such project of this nature is DTX Exchange , in which over $13.5 million has been raised. Its 1000x leverage and amount-limited tokens could revolutionize the $92 trillion trading market, allowing the early adopters to recover profits. Whereas the Dogecoin price fluctuates, DTX backs up its long-term viability prediction because of an egalitarian presale system and the platform's infrastructure observance. Experts suggest that this pathway could theoretically reshape cryptos within global finance.

A potential Bitcoin stockpile could undermine its decentralized nature, Hayes claims. A drafted bill by Senator Lummis may secure BTC reserves against political misuse. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, warns that a US Bitcoin reserve could be weaponized politically, compromising Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. His remarks have sparked debate in the crypto community. On his blog, Hayes argued that a Bitcoin-backed reserve—or a national stockpile of crypto assets, including Ripple—could harm the industry. He believes the government places political objectives and dollar preservation above financial returns when it stockpiles assets. “The overarching goal of two of Trump’s most essential lieutenants, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Secretary of State Mark Rubio, is to reform the global economic order to preserve the dollar and American hegemony.” Hayes warns that such a move could stifle innovation and favor large centralized companies over smaller players.

The company's software business remains insignificant, with its value largely tied to its substantial Bitcoin holdings, now worth $44.1 billion. Strategy's capital structure includes $7.6 billion in liabilities and significant future equity dilution risks, making direct Bitcoin investment more attractive for now. The new fair value accounting for Bitcoin holdings may add volatility to earnings, further diminishing the relevance of traditional financial metrics for Strategy. Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, reported earnings last night and the reaction thus far from the stock has been muted. Strategy is far different from most companies in that the revenue and earnings from the underlying business are virtually meaningless; some may forget Strategy still operates a very small software business. While I don’t necessarily care how the software business is doing, earnings reports are still valuable in that it gives us an updated look at the capital structure of Strategy, as well as what management is thinking of doing in the months to come. I’ve been bullish on Strategy at times in the past, as I liked its Bitcoin exposure. However, the correlation between Strategy and Bitcoin prices has almost completely broken down. For that reason, I’m moving to a hold rating on Strategy. Let’s dig in. Consolidating until we see a breakout or breakdown We’ll begin with the chart as we always do, and we can see there’s been a fairly lengthy consolidation going on here. I’ve drawn in a channel that encompasses the activity since mid-December, and it’s drifting higher. But unless and until we get a move outside of the channel, the stock is just bouncing around. StockCharts The PPO is showing improving momentum during this consolidation, which is a feather in the cap of the bulls. The stock is below the two major moving averages, both of which are moving lower (bearish). This chart is trendless and, as I said, is pretty much just neutral. We’ll get a break at some point, but your guess is as good as mine right now as it which direction it is. Now, my bullishness on Strategy has always been predicated upon its relationship with Bitcoin. I’ve been bullish on Bitcoin, and I still am today . I think we have a long way to go on the upside with Bitcoin, and Strategy is seen as a way to gain access to that upside. But is it really? Below, we have the 50-day rolling correlation of Strategy’s share price to that of Bitcoin. StockCharts The relationship between these two almost completely broke down at the start of this year, meaning they’re essentially not trading with each other any longer. Let me be very clear; my hold rating is based largely upon this chart. Strategy exists to buy and hold Bitcoin; if its share price decouples from Bitcoin, I don’t want anything to do with it. This company doesn’t have traditional fundamentals because the software business is small and insignificant. The only reason one would want to own this is for the Bitcoin exposure. So long as the correlation is low, I don’t see any reason to bother and would just own Bitcoin in some form (actual BTC, ETFs, etc.). Now, if this correlation picks back up and the two trades together again, I’m happy to reassess, but for now, I’m just not interested. The HODL strategy Strategy branded itself as a buyer and holder of Bitcoin years ago, and its Bitcoin holdings are many times the size of its software business. Given this company exists to buy and hold Bitcoin, it makes a lot of sense to evaluate how much the company has borrowed against what it owns. For what it’s worth, Q4 adjusted EPS came to a loss of $3.20, off from -$1.56 in Q3 and a profit of 56 cents a year ago. The software business produced $121 million in revenue, which was down 3% year-over-year. I say this business is meaningless because the company owns over $40 billion in Bitcoin; a tiny software business makes no difference. Investor presentation The software business saw revenues decline 7% for 2024, although subscription revenue did rise nicely. It operates near breakeven, so again it's not really worth discussing. I have to imagine it's more of a distraction for management than anything at this point. The loss in Q4 was due to a Bitcoin impairment charge of $1.01 billion, which was more than double Q3’s $412 million impairment, and $39M from a year ago. Starting this year, Strategy is changing the way it accounts for its Bitcoin holdings, as we can see below. Investor presentation A gap between the company’s holdings and its carrying value has always existed, but that will change in 2025 with the new adoption of fair value accounting. Basically, whatever the company’s Bitcoin is worth at the end of each quarter will be the carrying value. This is likely to generate a lot of noise with EPS as we go forward, so it may make the company’s earnings reports even less relevant than they already are from an accounting perspective. I won’t necessarily be focused on earnings for Strategy going forward; this again is all about how much Bitcoin holdings are worth against the liabilities the company has taken to buy them. Speaking of, the company held 447.5k coins at the end of 2024, worth $44.1 billion at today’s price. The total acquisition cost of those coins was $30.4 billion, implying a gain of almost $14 billion. Investor presentation That’s real money where I come from, so it’s hard to argue with the strategy. The key is the bottom half of this graphic, which is the funding for these purchases. The company’s capital plan is being aggressively executed as part of its “21/21” strategy. That is, $21 billion in fixed income and $21 billion in equity funding to buy Bitcoin. Investor presentation Here’s how it looks today, with the company using a mix of debt, preferred equity, and common stock issuances to fund Bitcoin purchases. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with this as long as Bitcoin goes higher over time, the issue is that the company’s software business is far too small to generate cash to service or pay down debt, and the company’s Bitcoin holdings obviously don’t pay anything. The risk of holding this stock, very obviously, is that Bitcoin prices decline to the point where the company has forced liquidations to pay down what is has borrowed. I don’t think that’s going to happen anytime soon, but you have to very closely monitor Bitcoin prices if you choose to own this stock as even the faintest threat of this could send the share price reeling. The correlation between Bitcoin and Strategy is low at the moment, but that doesn’t mean it won’t go higher again, particularly if there’s intense selling in Bitcoin. This is easily the largest risk of owning Strategy, so you have to weigh if the potential reward is worth that risk right now. To that end, let’s take a brief look at the company’s capital structure. Investor presentation It has nothing due this year or next year, which is excellent. There is significant equity due through convertibles in every year from 2027 to 2032 to contend with. These are likely to be significant dilution events, but they’re also years away, so it’s immaterial right now, in my view. Wrapping up The company reported $7.6 billion in total liabilities at the end of 2024, so its equity from its Bitcoin holdings is about $36.5 billion according to my calculations from today’s Bitcoin price. The stock is valued at $85 billion, or ~2.3X its tangible book value. This premium has certainly been higher than this before, particularly towards the end of last year. On that basis, is it cheap? It could be, depending upon your perspective. But the question for investors is whether it's worth paying the premium if Strategy's price and that of Bitcoin aren't moving that closely together any longer. Given the breakdown in the correlation between Strategy and Bitcoin, I’m not inclined to want to buy this premium as I don’t have great confidence that we’ll see the stock move up if and when Bitcoin does. For me, Bitcoin exposure directly (or through a fund) makes more sense. I’d be happy to reevaluate if and when the correlation between Strategy and Bitcoin goes higher again, but I’m on the sidelines for now.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-06 13:15:09

Earlier today, He Yongqian, spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce, told reporters during a press conference that China will take “necessary measures” to protect its economy. “In the face of one-sided acts of economic bullying from America, we will firmly protect our own rights and interests,” Yongqian warned. The commerce ministry’s spokesperson was referring to the trade war US President Donald Trump initiated on Tuesday. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian already said on Wednesday that China “deplores and opposes” the US decision to increase tariffs under the guise of the fentanyl crisis. He warned that the steps taken by China are essential for “safeguarding our legitimate rights and interests.” Trump’s administration imposed the 10% tariff as punishment, accusing Beijing of failing to stop fentanyl shipments to the US. The new duties come on top of the existing tariffs of up to 25% that Trump implemented during his first presidency. Beijing wasted no time retaliating, announcing tariffs of up to 15% on US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and various products, set to kick in on February 10. Tariffs slam China’s struggling economy The Trump administration also revoked the de minimis exemption, making it pricier for Chinese e-commerce merchants to ship directly to American consumers. The timing couldn’t be worse for China, which is already dealing with a shaky economy. Goldman Sachs economists said on Monday that the extra 10% tariffs could slice 50 basis points off China’s GDP growth this year, bringing it down to 4.5%. Inflation is another headache. Consumer prices barely grew last year, with inflation rising only 0.2% year-over-year. Goldman now expects inflation to stay weak, rising by just 0.4% in 2025, as US tariffs reduce external demand for Chinese goods. As exports get squeezed, China’s Ministry of Commerce urged Washington to “create a fair and predictable environment for cross-border trade.” The pressure doesn’t end there. Trump has ordered a review of China’s compliance with the 2020 trade agreement signed during his first presidency. The review, due on April 1, could set the stage for even more tariffs. Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS, warned that there’s a lot of uncertainty. “The 10% tariff hike came quickly,” she said, “but we don’t know how much further this will go.” UBS isn’t ruling out additional US tariffs of 60% on some Chinese exports. China braces for currency battles As the trade war escalates, the offshore yuan fell 0.60% to 7.3631 against the US dollar on Monday, its lowest level since Trump’s November victory. The yuan has lost 3.7% since then, but the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is determined to keep things under control. The central bank has been capping the exchange rate since August 2024, allowing the onshore yuan to trade within a 2% range of the daily reference rate. The rate set on Wednesday will be a key signal of how Beijing plans to counter the impact of tariffs. Goldman Sachs analysts expect the PBOC to let the yuan gradually rise between 7.40 and 7.50 per dollar while maintaining tight controls. Exports remain one of the few bright spots, contributing nearly 20% of China’s GDP in 2023, according to the World Bank. Last year, exports to the US climbed 4.9% to $524.6 billion, representing 15% of China’s total exports. But Trump’s latest tariffs are expected to hit this key revenue stream hard. Goldman Sachs economists predict that China’s fiscal deficit will widen by 2.6% of GDP in 2025 as the government rolls out more expansionary policies. Beijing is expected to announce additional measures during its annual parliamentary meetings in March. On Sunday, the Commerce Ministry said it would challenge Trump’s tariff decision at the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling it a “serious violation” of international trade rules. While China’s previous WTO complaints haven’t resulted in immediate relief, Beijing is signaling it won’t sit back and let the US dictate the terms. Economists say Beijing’s response has been relatively measured so far, but that could change, and when it does, the global economy might get caught in the crossfire.

Thanks to community backing and creative narratives, these coins have exploded in value and provided huge returns for short-term investors. However, attention is shifting as cautious investors look for the next collection of coins that are considered ‘underdogs’ but have the possibility of an unprecedented return. Four coins that can turn an $850 investment into a fortune are in the running; these coins are Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Floki Inu (FLOKI). Rexas Finance takes the top spot. The company is building a stardom with an ecosystem focused on impact and longevity. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Millionaire Maker Rexas Finance aims to integrate centralized and decentralized finance (DeFi) through its incredibly complex products and services. Its ecosystem features a decentralized exchange (DEX), which boasts exceptionally rapid transaction processing and low fees, enabling effortless trade. Furthermore, the staking instruments offered by Rexas allow customers to earn passive income by locking in their RXS tokens with a competitive yield claim. Currently in its 12th presale stage, RXS is at a staggering $0.2, which gives early adopters a rare chance to benefit. Rexas Finance’s crowning achievement is its tokenization of an asset feature. This technological advancement allows the purchase of portions of high-value real estate and even luxury goods, previously only available to the richest investors. These features, along with the company’s governance model, which offers token holders a say in the company’s future, put Rexas Finance in a position to scale vibrantly as a community-governed dynasty. The tokenomics of RXS, with a capped 1 billion token supply alongside a successful presale, has undeniably set the project up for success. The presale reasonably distributes the tokens and creates sustainable growth. A target date for release has been set for June 19, 2025, at a listing price of $0.25. Analysts state that following its debut, RXS should soar to new heights within months, reaching $5 before the year ends. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme King With a market cap of $49.46 billion, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the most popular meme coin, currently valued at $0.3347. In other news, the recent ETF filings by REX Shares and Bitwise for Dogecoin could push it to new highs of $15, as some crypto analysts suggest. With Elon Musk's endorsement and claims about Dogecoin, its use is expanding. Even if the growth is not as heightened as upcoming competitors like Rexas Finance, Dogecoin’s constant development and popularity make it a strong candidate for investors looking for slower but reliable profits. Pepe Coin: The New Meme Coin In The Town Pepe Coin takes full advantage of the Internet’s adoration of the well-known meme, Pepe the Frog. This token's community-funded growth and viral strategies have brought it to the center. Their roadmap includes social responsibility projects and partnering to enhance uses and methods for reputation. The PEPE meme coin is notorious for its viral nature, which, combined with the strong community behind it, has seen the coin reach new heights. It shows how a simple idea can become one of the Best New Meme Coins for Massive Return Potential. Floki Inu: The Viking Meme Coin Like other top meme coins, Floki Inu has its roots in pop culture and isn’t stopping at anything lower than the cream of the crop. Floki's unique blend of a DeFi ecosystem introduces DeFi tools that appeal to a broader audience, ensuring the project’s relevance beyond its meme origins. It combines fun with purpose. The innovative marketing that Floki Inu portrays and their ability to stay in the limelight showcase them as true pioneers of the meme coin world. Conclusion Although Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and Floki Inu tokens have potential, Rexas Finance is undoubtedly the key winner in making decade-defining transformations for investors. Its cutting-edge tools, powerful ecosystem, and transparent tokenomics across its robust infrastructure provide a reliable setup for success. RXS is the crypto to invest in for those seeking to change their lives with just $850. With the June launch date fast approaching, there is no better time to seize this opportunity before it becomes the next big crypto headline.

Bulls Enter At Critical Support: Will The Shiba Inu Price Uptrend? SHIB has performed underwhelmingly recently, trading in a downtrend for the past two months. The Shiba Inu price has declined by over 50% in this duration. The downward momentum for SHIB has only increased in the last couple of weeks since the Shiba Inu price dropped below a significant support level after a month-long consolidation. Source: CoinMarketCap Due to the continued decline, SHIB has moved below its long-term 200-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). Today, the Shiba Inu price has recovered slightly with a 4.67% intraday surge, and SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001642. The sell-off has brought the RSI to 36.25, indicating that SHIB is near the oversold region. If the Shiba Inu price falls further, $0.00001162 is solid support, as evidenced by the massive demand from SHIB bulls on Monday at this level. Thus, the price can reverse from here if the bearish sentiment cools and sufficient demand returns. Meanwhile, the latest SHIB burn data has again taken a dip, dropping by over 60% in a single day. Despite this, excitement grew even more after the announcement of the Shiba Inu partnership in the UAE. According to Shibburn on X, the burn rate jumped by 577% on Tuesday but dropped again on Wednesday. This sharp decrease has increased the bearish sentiment in the market. DTX ICO Potential: A Game-Changer in Trading As Shiba Inu faces high volatility, DTX Exchange (DTX) synergy positions itself to solve immediate pain points in the traditional trading exchange market.

39993485,https://nulltx.com/?p=143960,1738848074,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Dogecoin Price Forecast: Can Elon Musk Save DOGE With ETF Approval?,https://nulltx.com/dogecoin-price-forecast-can-elon-musk-save-doge-with-etf-approval/,"Dogecoin price recently suffered a 20% drop before rebounding as the broader crypto market stabilized. Analysts now suggest that DOGE could surge by 89%, fueled by technical indicators and investor optimism. Meanwhile, speculation around a DOGE ETF is intensifying after Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan hinted at the possibility of a Dogecoin ETF, citing its longevity and strong community. As institutional interest in crypto ETFs grows, Dogecoin may see benefits from potential regulatory approval. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) , a high-potential hybrid TradFi and DeFi platform, has already raised over $13 million in its presale, presenting investors with a promising alternative. DOGE ETF Speculation: A Potential Catalyst for Dogecoin Price? Matthew Hougan’s latest remarks suggest that a DOGE ETF is not off the table. He acknowledged Dogecoin’s 12-year history, fair launch, and active community as key factors that could make it eligible for ETF consideration. However, he also stated that DOGE lacks fundamental value beyond its memetic appeal. A DOGE ETF would provide a regulated, institutional gateway for investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin price action without relying on centralized exchanges. With Bitcoin ETFs already attracting over $50 billion in inflows, a similar trend could emerge for DOGE if it secures approval. But institutional adoption remains uncertain, as Hougan cautioned that meme coins with low liquidity and significant insider ownership are unlikely to receive approval. While speculation around a DOGE ETF is growing, Dogecoin price remains highly volatile. Technical indicators now suggest that DOGE could be primed for a major rally, with price targets set at $0.53, $0.706, and potentially $1. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Can DOGE Rally 89%? Following its recent 20% drop, Dogecoin has shown signs of recovery, with analysts pointing to a potential 89% surge if key resistance levels are broken. Source: Tradingview The DOGE price chart indicates a strong support level around $0.262, while mid-range resistance sits near $0.356. A move past $0.483 would confirm bullish momentum, potentially leading DOGE toward $0.706, its 1.618 Fibonacci extension target. If momentum remains strong, DOGE could test the psychological $1 level, a milestone that many investors have been anticipating. Technical indicators further support a potential breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 41, signaling a recovery from oversold conditions. The MACD shows a weak bullish crossover, hinting at an early-stage trend reversal. Historical fractals suggest that Dogecoin price tends to drop below its range before rebounding, aligning with previous breakout patterns. DTX: A $0.16 Altcoin Poised for Growth as DOGE Speculation Grows While Dogecoin price remains tied to speculation about a DOGE ETF, DTX Exchange is making waves as a next-gen trading platform, bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Unlike meme coins, which rely on hype and viral momentum, DTX is built on fundamentals, offering a high-speed, secure, and multi-asset trading ecosystem. DTX operates on the VulcanX blockchain, which demonstrated a capacity of 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) during its testnet, a significant improvement over legacy blockchains. With a fixed token supply of 100 million, scarcity could drive long-term value appreciation, similar to how Ethereum’s supply constraints contributed to its rise. Security remains a priority, with SolidProof auditing ensuring protection against counterparty risks, a growing concern in crypto markets. By combining forex, stocks, crypto, and ETFs into a single trading platform, DTX Exchange is positioning itself as a pioneer in the hybrid finance sector. If DTX Exchange’s adoption accelerates, its price trajectory could mirror early-stage Ethereum and Binance coins, which surged as their ecosystems expanded. Currently in its final presale round, with over $13M raised at $0.16, analysts believe DTX has the potential to outperform meme coins over the long term. What’s Next for Dogecoin and DTX? The fate of Dogecoin largely depends on whether a DOGE ETF materializes and whether institutions show interest in regulated meme coin investments. Market sentiment will also play a critical role, with Elon Musk’s potential involvement acting as a wildcard that could drive additional momentum. However, for investors seeking more stability and long-term value, DTX Exchange presents a high-utility alternative that isn’t reliant on speculation or hype.

Expert Backs Rival With Listing Expected in May 2025,https://nulltx.com/can-new-upgrade-push-cardano-above-1-resistance-expert-backs-rival-with-listing-expected-in-may-2025/,"Cardano (ADA) has undergone a major upgrade to the Plomin hard fork, bringing the network closer to its goal of full decentralized governance. The upgrade went live on 29th January; however, the Cardano price has significantly dropped due to the market crash. It saw some recovery on Monday, but now investors are confused about whether developments can push ADA Cardano price to $1 resistance. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiasts are tracking a new utility altcoin, DTX Exchange (DTX), and comparing it to the early days of ADA. This project stands out due to its unique hybrid trading platform and significant potential to deliver exponential returns. DTX Exchange has reached the final stage of the token presale and is preparing for mainnet listing. Experts believe its solid fundamentals make it a strong contender as a leader in the upcoming cycle. Cardano Price Prediction: Is a Bullish Breakout in Horizon? After the recent massive liquidation event on the crypto market, the Cardano price dropped 40.53% from $0.98 to $0.55. However, the recent ADA price action formed a V-shaped recovery as buyers stepped in at the $0.60 support level. This strong rebound in the Cardano price mainly occurred due to a strong demand zone of $0.55 –$0.60. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.75, with a trading volume of $1.55 billion in the last 24 hours. Courtesy: TradingView The Cardano price performance has been exceptional since November last year, but to formulate such gains, major resistances have to be broken. If ADA manages to hold the current support level, it could form a reversal where it will face resistance at $0.80 and $0.90, and a breakout from these barriers could push it to the $1 psychological mark. Also, if the ADA Cardano price fails to hold current levels, it may lead to another drop. DTX Exchange Hybrid Platform: Revolutionizing Trading DTX Exchange (DTX) has been getting a lot of attention, making it the most discussed crypto project of 2025. It has attracted large players primarily because of its innovative trading platform, which integrates the pioneered hybrid blockchain technology. The DTX Exchange is the first trading platform in the world that can support a variety of over 120,000 different types of assets. So, it is possible to buy crypto, fiat currencies, stocks, and ETFs all in one place without having to go to several different exchanges. This approach helps manage the portfolio effortlessly, and traders can capitalize on different markets. By blending the features of centralized and decentralized exchanges, the platform allows users to enjoy the flexibility of traditional exchanges with the security and decentralization of blockchain technology. Additionally, with an order execution speed of 0.04 seconds, transactions are faster. Users can now trade in different markets with a simple interface and high efficiency. Furthermore, DTX Exchange levels up the game by offering incredible trading tools like 1,000x leverage, which allows access to liquidity of $100,000 with just a small fund of $100. So, traders who want to capture big moves can use the leverage features and increase their profit potential much higher. Recently, DTX launched a non-custodial Phoenix Wallet, which has gone viral due to its crypto-borrowing feature. This wallet has also been named the most secure wallet because of its multi-layer security. DTX Presale Crosses $13.50 Million While the Cardano price is experiencing high volatility, the DTX Exchange presale has achieved continuous milestones in the last few months. In the final stage of the presale, the total raise has reached $13.50 million, and the unique wallets have also reached half a million. This robust performance shows increasing investor confidence in the project. 65% of the tokens have already been sold, and this is the last opportunity to purchase DTX at a discounted price of $0.16. With its pioneered hybrid platform and utility-backed token, DTX Exchange is about to enter the market on solid footing.

With its record-breaking $13.5 million fundraising offering each token at $0.16 in stage 8 now, DTX Exchange is positioning itself as a game-changer. It offers traders a unified platform for trading over 120,000 assets with unmatched transaction speed. Could DTX Exchange be the next crypto giant to rival Shiba Inu and Cardano (ADA)? Let’s find out! Shiba Inu (SHIB) Drops 30%: Can It Recover? Since early February 2025, Shiba Inu’s token has been struggling, falling 30% as the bearish sentiment grew stronger. Shiba Inu is currently trading below its major support levels, indicating a further slump as it tries to retake its 200 EMA. On February 5, SHIB is trading for $0.00001635, down 11.28% over the previous week. The price of SHIB may fall near $0.00001201, a historical accumulation zone, if selling pressure persists. There is little chance of a turnaround given the oversold RSI levels at 33.5. Source: CoinMarketCap Regaining $0.000021 as support is necessary for Shiba Inu to restore bullish momentum. Until then, the daily chart is dominated by lower highs, and the outlook is still bearish. Despite the fact that investors are buying the drop, Shiba Inu has very little chance of generating big returns soon like the emerging project DTX Exchange which is offering massive returns backed by solid technology. Cardano Foundation’s 2024 Report: Will It Revive ADA’s Momentum? Cardano , which fell over 18% to $0.75 in the past week, is under pressure. With trade volume down about 49% and the market worth down to around $26 billion, there have been significant sell-offs in ADA. Source: CoinMarketCap The price trajectory of ADA indicates weakness, even as the Cardano (ADA) Foundation’s 2024 Activity Report highlights development in enterprise adoption and governance. The report highlights the introduction of Reeve, a blockchain accounting tool, a protocol connecting more than 100 blockchains, and new collaborations with the UN and NASA. Amidst Cardano’s (ADA) uncertainties, traders are looking into new initiatives that have significant potential. Currently, in presale, DTX Exchange (DTX) is attracting interest due to its diverse asset range and unmatched transaction speed. DTX Exchange Raises $13.5 Million: A New Crypto Contender Emerges DTX Exchange is a fresh entry in the cryptocurrency market that is stealing all the spotlight through its soon-to-be-launched revolutionary exchange platform. It is introducing the first crypto-native exchange that will give traders access to over 120,000 commodities. These will include stocks, bonds, forex, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and a lot more. This unified trading interface concept aims to save users their time wasted in managing different platforms. It is enabled by their layer-1 blockchain giant, VulcanX. It is a hybrid blockchain that targets the limitation of solely public and private networks, providing top-notch private and secure blockchain solutions. The recent major upgrade for DTX Exchange was the introduction of the Phoenix Wallet custody solution. This wallet allows traders to manage their assets securely without requiring a centralized platform. Additionally, the project is rumored about a potential tier-1 listing in the second quarter of this year, giving it wider exposure. DTX’s innovative offerings coupled with its stellar performance in its ongoing presale have captured traders’ attention all over the world. The presale is currently in its 8th stage, offering each DTX token for only $0.16, and has already raised over $13.5 million. This stellar performance has got the market anticipating that soon it will come in line with crypto veterans Shiba Inu and ADA which are currently facing headwinds from the market’s volatility. Final Thoughts As Shiba Inu and Cardano (ADA) face ongoing struggles, the rise of DTX Exchange is catching the attention of traders and investors worldwide. With its record-breaking presale and unified trading solutions, DTX is proving to be a powerful alternative in the crypto space. If DTX continues its upward trajectory, it could soon challenge the dominance of Shiba Inu and Cardano (ADA), becoming one of the best-performing altcoins of the year.

Table of Contents Yeti Ouro: A bright spot in P2E gaming Ethereum: Navigating short-term uncertainty YETIO’s presale: Seizing the investment moment Conclusion A look at 2025 shows shifts in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum (ETH) faces short-term doubts as investors look for new options. ETH holds a key place in DeFi and smart contracts but now deals with price swings because of rules and market shifts. Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) advances in its presale phase. Yeti Ouro takes a fresh path with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) games and manages to pull in people who seek new chances. Yeti Ouro: A bright spot in P2E gaming Yeti Ouro creates impact through its P2E game Yeti Go, built on Unreal Engine 5. The game combines racing excitement with opportunities to earn YETIO tokens through gameplay and marketplace activities. This way, players take part in the game’s economy. A picture of Yeti Go game – Level 1 The financial structure of Yeti Ouro aims for lasting value. A total supply of 1 billion tokens, along with a 5% burn clause in its contract, creates natural scarcity that helps price growth and ensures project completion, respectively. The current Stage 2 presale offers tokens at $0.017 plus a 10% bonus for new buyers. Stage 2 has reached over 58.6% of its goal, which shows solid interest from investors as Stage 3 draws closer.

The digital asset now deals with market shifts in the short term. The broader economy affects how investors see ETH because of interest rates and financial market problems. Regulatory reviews of staking protocols added more price swings even as Ethereum made technical progress with its Dencun update for better speed. A mix of outside factors creates short-term pressure on Ethereum’s value , but the core outlook remains good. The network serves key roles in decentralized finance next to digital tokens or other blockchain systems. ETH needs better rules from regulators along with more support from big investors through products like ETFs to move up again. The future success of Ethereum depends on solving these challenges while it keeps improving its uses. This path helps the system stay central to blockchain markets. Ethereum price is currently at $2,774 on Coinmarketcap at the time of writing. YETIO’s presale: Seizing the investment moment The Stage 2 presale of Yeti Ouro opens a fresh path for investors. The token price of $0.017 plus a 10% bonus draws new participants to join early. The project’s success shows how people value what YETIO brings to P2E gaming.

Analysts predict that the ROI will be 50x by 2025, which gives investors an extra reason to step into the platform. The value of Yeti Ouro stems from its self-sustaining system where player numbers affect token worth. A smart token structure along with burn rules or supply limits helps create natural growth.

This expansion could significantly improve access to Bitcoin , making it easier for both new and experienced users to buy and sell the digital asset. With over 600 Costco locations , customers will have direct access to Bitcoin in one of the largest retail chains in the country. Costco chose LibertyX for this initiative because some other Bitcoin ATM operators are known for high fees and extra charges . These ATMs will allow people to buy Bitcoin instantly, even if they don’t have a traditional bank account. While some investors argue that fees remain an issue, others believe that the convenience of these machines makes them a valuable option. Bitcoin ATMs have been growing in popularity across the world, providing an alternative way for people to enter the crypto market. The United States leads globally in Bitcoin ATM installations , with nearly 30,000 machines nationwide. Other top-ranking countries include Canada, Australia, Spain, and Poland, while El Salvador, which has made Bitcoin legal tender, is also expanding its network of ATMs. While increasing Bitcoin ATM availability could boost mainstream adoption, its impact on price remains uncertain. Bitcoin recently fell below an important moving average , suggesting that its upward momentum has slowed down. Although it reached a new all-time high just weeks ago, Bitcoin must reclaim a key price level to continue its rally. Market indicators suggest that sellers currently have control, and Bitcoin needs to regain strength before pushing higher. The expansion of Bitcoin ATMs in Costco stores may contribute to a broader acceptance of cryptocurrency, making it more accessible to everyday shoppers. However, whether this move will directly influence Bitcoin’s market performance depends on investor sentiment, regulatory developments, and overall market trends.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-06 13:32:24

33767162,[object Object],1738848856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Tether Is Going Deep Into AI While OpenAI Makes Big Move – Will MIND of Pepe Ride the AI Hype?,https://bitcoinist.com/tehter-rides-ai-hype-openai-makes-moves/,"A few weeks ago, DeepSeek rocked the AI market with a cheaper, perhaps even better Chat GPT alternative. In the aftermath, AI hype took a hit and crypto projects fell, before eventually bouncing back. But only now is the real impact being felt; with DeepSeek a true competitor, western AI companies have stepped up their game, ramped up development, and generally sparked a wave of big moves across the AI world. Tether’s moving to AI, OpenAI is embracing Europe, and there’s a possibility that a new player will enter the game. And in the meantime, crypto AI projects like MIND of Pepe continue to power through a presale, positioning itself to become a major player in the ever-shift AI world. Tether’s Foray into AI – A New Era for Crypto-Driven AI? Tether, best known for the $USDT stablecoin, is expanding into artificial intelligence . By developing AI-powered applications and launching an open-source software development kit (SDK), Tether hopes to pull AI tools into the crypto orbit. Tether claims to be working on: AI Translate AI Voice Assistant AI Bitcoin Wallet Assistant That last app in particular indicates how Tether sees AI and crypto working alongside each other. The upcoming SDK will be built on Bare, a JavaScript runtime developed by Holepunch, and will be designed to run locally on various devices, including embedded systems, smartphones, laptops, and servers. The emphasis on local AI operations takes crypto back to its decentralized roots with an emphasis on user privacy and self-custodial data and money management. Tether’s push into AI also connects machine learning with blockchain ecosystems. By integrating AI-driven automation in crypto transactions, translation, and voice commands, Tether could help bridge vital gaps in crypto adoption. As it stands, $USDT leads the stablecoin market with some impressive numbers, which Tether hopes its AI moves will improve even further. If successful, these developments could set a precedent for other blockchain firms to explore AI-powered services, further boosting the growing crypto AI sector. OpenAI Goes To Europe As the old saying goes, with great power comes great scrutiny. Regulators are keeping an increasingly close eye on AI as systems become more powerful. That goes double for regions with strict data protection laws like the European Union. Not every AI company has been willing to comply, preferring to do most of their business elsewhere. But in response to the growing competition, OpenAI introduced a data residency program in Europe , allowing customers to have their data stored and processed entirely within the EU. To reverse the opening statement – OpenAI is willing to put up with great scrutiny, in the hopes of great power (and more money, we’d wager). The data residency move aligns with GDPR regulations and addresses concerns around data privacy, security, and sovereignty. And the development is particularly significant as AI adoption grows in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and legal services. By providing European clients with localized data management, OpenAI hopes to position itself as a more attractive option for businesses and set the stage for strategic expansion It could set a new standard for AI companies operating globally, prompting competitors to implement similar compliance frameworks. John Schulman Exits Anthropic: What’s Next? John Schulman, co-founder of OpenAI and one of the leading researchers in AI alignment, just left Anthropic , the AI startup he joined in August 2024. Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI employees, positioned itself as a key competitor to OpenAI in the race to develop advanced AI systems, boasting $875M in annual revenue and offering AI model access through platforms like Amazon Web Services. So, why leave? Schulman’s departure could have several implications. The move highlights the intense competition within the AI research community. Schulman’s focus on AI alignment—a crucial aspect of ensuring AI models behave safely and ethically—means that his exit could impact Anthropic’s approach. His departures also underscores how dynamic the AI startup ecosystem has become, especially in the wake of DeepSeek’s big moves. With growing investment and technological breakthroughs, companies are vying for top talent. Will Schulman join another competitor? Or could he launch an entirely new initiative? Either move could have a huge impact on the market. MIND of Pepe: Stage Set for Memecoin AI Agent Token The convergence of AI and blockchain appears increasingly inevitable, with Tether’s AI expansion setting the stage for more AI-integrated crypto applications. One such project is MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , a memecoin-based autonomous AI agent. By launching an autonomous AI agent on X, empowering it to gain insights from the market and social media, and deliver exclusive alpha to $MIND token holders, MIND of Pepe looks set to carry AI and crypto to the next stage of evolution. Imagine a MIND AI agent capable of integrating with Tether’s AI tool suite, seamlessly navigating the world of memecoins to find the best ones to buy , and crypto presales to glean precious market intelligence. Or, as the techmap indicates, imagine a MIND capable of controlling its own tokens and launching new ones. That’s a truly independent AI agent capable of transforming the market, exactly the kind of breakthrough that AI companies from OpenAI to DeepSeek are looking for. The MIND of Pepe presale has already raised over $5M, demonstrating strong investor interest. Check it out if you want to be part of the movement. Crypto + AI: The Future Awaits The crypto + AI combo is just beginning, and, with the US and many other nation states loading up on crypto assets, we might be headed for greater heights. Last, but certainly not least. Do your own research – this isn’t financial advice, and the crypto market is always volatile. Given the high risk profile, invest what you can’t afford to lose. But the AI sector is bouncing back from the DeepSeek incident with renewed energy – and MIND of Pepe loves it.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-06 13:34:16

The game peaked at 176,285 concurrent players on Steam on the second day after it was released. The RPG adventure game is also set to include more content in planned updates. Warhorse Studios had major plans for 2025, with the Czech studio mapping out the grand release of its second-ever major game. The Czech studio planned and released the sequel to its most successful game, Kingdom Come, breaking records from the get-go.

The action-adventure game was released on February 4, 2025, for PlayStation, Xbox Series S/X, and PC. The medieval RGP adventure game also broke the franchise’s Steam player count records set by its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance. The much-anticipated sequel peaked at 176,285 concurrent players on Steam on its second day of availability. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s first-day player count also broke its predecessors’ initial record of 96,069 concurrent players by reaching a day-one peak of 159,351 concurrent players. Industry players predicted that the game would continue its record-breaking run, given its current tally of 115,442 concurrent players on Steam and its positive reception among gamers. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has “ Very Positive ” player reviews on Steam. The role-player open-world game is available in three versions: the Standard Edition, the Gold Edition, and the Collector’s Edition. The game’s Gold Edition will feature three unreleased DLCs and bonus content. Standard Edition players can purchase the DLCs as part of the digital bundle offer. However, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 will not be available for the Saudi Arabian market after it was banned for depicting same-sex romance options, failing to adhere to the country’s media guidelines. The controversy surrounding the game resulted in mixed reactions before its release. Gamers are also set to enjoy more content in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 after Warhorse Studios revealed its development roadmap on January 16, 2025. The developer said it would give free “quality of life” updates, including barbers, a hardcore mode, and horse racing via post-launch updates. The developer also revealed the game’s DLCs, which will be titled “Brushes with Death,” “Legacy of the Forge,” and “Mysteria Ecclesiae.” The DLC will be respectively released in the summer, autumn, and winter of 2025. Gamers react to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s performance Gamers online discussed the newly released game’s record-breaking streak after Warhorse Studios announced the sales figures. Some gamers said that the record-breaking streak was deserved due to the game’s quality. Some gamers praised the game’s narrative, saying that it was very well written and that its performance was great despite the political sentiments surrounding it. The gamers said that they were looking forward to the “anti-woke” crowd listing Kingdom Come: Deliverance as an exception to the “go woke, go broke” narrative. However, another section of gamers downplayed the game’s achievements by saying it was undeserving of the record-breaking run. Some gamers went as far as saying it would lose over 90% of its current players after two months due to its politically divisive content. Some gamers even compared the game to Baldur’s Gate and Monster Hunter Wilds Beta to say that its run was insignificant. Some gamers even said that the game’s performance would have been better if the same-sex content wasn’t included in it.

Not Quite, Says Kaiko Research appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meme coins, the fun and often humorous cryptocurrencies that took the internet by storm, have had a rocky start this year. According to a recent Kaiko report , most meme tokens have struggled, with losses ranging from 10% to as much as 70% since the beginning of the year. But does this mean the meme coin frenzy is over? Not quite. Meme Coins Face Ups and Downs Kaiko’s recent report highlights that while popular meme tokens like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and newer coins have seen significant price drops this year, their popularity hasn’t faded completely. Is the memecoin frenzy losing steam? While most memecoins have lagged the broader market this year-with declines of 10% and 70% YTD—the frenzy is far from over. There continues to be significant demand for new memecoins, symbolised by the shift in exchange listing trends above.… pic.twitter.com/qjfioXNiRz — Kaiko (@KaikoData) February 6, 2025 Last year, these tokens outperformed many other cryptocurrencies thanks to their hype and the chance of making quick profits. This year, despite the volatility, the recent surge in new meme coin launches, particularly on Solana, is evidence that traders continue to engage with these assets, betting on the next viral success. Exchanges and Market Makers Profiting From Memecoins One reason meme coins continue to grow is because they are profitable for exchanges and market makers. The gap between the buying and selling price of meme coins is much higher than for bigger cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP). This allows market makers to earn more from these trades. Exchanges are also taking advantage of it as Meme coin trading brings in millions in fees, and centralized exchanges (CEXs) have been adding them at a faster pace since 2020. While U.S. platforms like Coinbase have been slower to list meme tokens than offshore exchanges, they are catching up. Some meme tokens, such as PNUT, TRUMP, and MELANIA, landed on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase within days, largely due to their hype-driven appeal and connections to prominent figures. Liquidity and Volatility Challenges Kaiko’s analysis warns that the rapid listing of meme coins comes with its own set of challenges. These tokens often experience massive trading volumes that far exceed their available liquidity, especially at launch. For example, the TRUMP token saw $16 billion in trading volume on January 20 nearly 30% of Bitcoin’s daily volume despite having limited liquidity. This mismatch between volume and liquidity can lead to extreme price swings, forcing market makers to widen bid-ask spreads to manage risk. Ultimately, this drives up costs for traders, making meme coins a high-risk, high-reward investment. What’s Next for Meme Coins? Even though meme coin hype has slowed this year, it’s far from over. Their mix of humor, community-driven support, and speculative appeal keeps attracting investors. As exchanges adjust their listing strategies moving from “allowlists” to “blocklists” to better manage new tokens meme coins will likely remain a key part of the crypto world.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|EXCHANGE|SHIB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-06 13:44:07

Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, filed a formal complaint urging a federal probe into US President Donald Trump’s promotion of the meme coin Official Trump (TRUMP). The token launched two days before the new president’s inauguration and soared to a market cap of $15 billion in a single day. The complaint , submitted on Wednesday, calls attention to social media posts by Trump on X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social, which the group claims were used to promote the cryptocurrency and to solicit financial contributions from his supporters. It argues that the posts, resurfacing on January 20 and 21—just days after his inauguration—could violate federal laws that bar the president from soliciting personal gifts.

BlackRock Expands Crypto Offerings to Europe BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to introduce a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. This move follows the firm’s success with its U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has accumulated $58 billion in assets. The new European fund is expected to be based out of Switzerland, with marketing efforts likely to begin this month. The decision to establish the fund in Switzerland aligns with the country's crypto-friendly regulatory environment, which has been attracting numerous digital asset firms in recent years. BlackRock’s Growing Crypto Footprint With over $4.4 trillion in global ETF assets under management, BlackRock has been strategically expanding its crypto offerings beyond U.S. borders. Last month, the firm launched its iShares Bitcoin ETF in Canada, listing it on Cboe Canada under the ticker symbols IBIT and IBIT.U. The fund mirrors the performance of Bitcoin, minus expenses, by allocating nearly all of its assets to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (U.S. IBIT). The European Bitcoin ETP is expected to follow a similar model, providing institutional and retail investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated financial product. Europe’s Evolving Crypto Landscape While Europe already has over 160 crypto-tracking products, their total market value of $17.3 billion remains considerably smaller than the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market, which stands at $116.4 billion, proving that the former still has room to grow. As a result, the European crypto market continues to experience significant regulatory and institutional advancements. Recently, exchanges such as OKX, Crypto.com, and Bitpanda obtained full licenses under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. MiCA introduces strict transparency, disclosure, and governance requirements for crypto entities, including enhanced anti-money laundering measures. Stablecoin issuers must also maintain sufficient reserves to protect investors, reinforcing consumer protection and market integrity across the region. Scope of Similar Products In Europe Despite industry speculation, BlackRock has not released an official statement regarding its European Bitcoin ETP. However, insiders suggest that the firm’s expansion into digital assets aligns with its broader strategy to meet institutional demand. Market analysts believe that this move could encourage other large financial firms to introduce similar products, further integrating cryptocurrencies into the global financial ecosystem.

This model has attracted a cult-like following, with the community often joking about whether the chain “was even real.” But with over $3 billion deposited in pre-launch liquidity pools, it’s safe to say Berachain is very real and gaining serious traction. https://twitter.com/QuentinoAi/status/1887432951648166359 Binance Joins the Party with an Exclusive BERA Airdrop Adding fuel to the fire, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange , is offering an exclusive BERA airdrop for its users.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-largest meme coin in crypto, dropped to a low of $0.00001162 on Monday, marking a 65% decline from its November peak. SHIB’s crash coincided with broader weakness in meme coins. Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has fallen 22% over the past 30 days, while Pepe, Bonk, and Floki have dropped by more than 25%. Shiba Inu’s burn rate has also dropped this week. Shibburn data shows an 88% decline in the burn rate over the last 24 hours. Fewer than 25 million SHIB tokens, currently worth less than $400, have been burned this week. Additional data suggests that Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 network, is underperforming. While total completed transactions are nearing 900 million, the number of network addresses has stagnated at 2.1 million.

ShibaSwap DeFi TVL has dropped | Source: DeFi Llama Additionally, Shiba Inu’s futures open interest has declined in recent weeks, indicating weaker demand. Open interest has fallen to $182 million, down from its year-to-date high of $542 million. Shiba Inu price has formed a death cross SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that SHIB fell from its November high of $0.0000333 to a low of $0.00001162 this week. It then rebounded to a high of $0.000015. The SHIB price has formed a death cross pattern, where the 50-day and 200-day weighted moving averages have crossed. A death cross is a well-known bearish pattern. The last time this pattern appeared in June last year, SHIB fell by over 40%. Shiba Inu has also formed a small bearish pennant pattern. As a result, the coin may drop to the next key level at $0.00001162, its lowest point this week. A decline below that level would indicate further downside, with the next target at $0.00008480, its lowest level in January 2024, representing a 45% drop from the current price.

This lackluster performance has left investors frustrated, raising doubts about the altcoin’s ability to regain bullish momentum. However, the recent decline in exchange netflow on derivative platforms could offer a fresh opportunity for ETH. Rally Setup? CryptoQuant’s latest analysis revealed that Ethereum’s netflow on derivative exchanges has dropped below -300,000 ETH for the first time since August 2023. This significant outflow of ETH suggests several potential market shifts. Firstly, reduced sell pressure is typically a bullish indicator. When ETH exits derivative exchanges, it often signifies traders are either closing leveraged positions or transferring their holdings to cold storage. This decreases, in turn, the immediate supply available for selling, which can support upward price momentum if demand remains stable or increases. Secondly, such outflows can indicate market deleveraging. If caused by the liquidation of overleveraged long positions, this can create short-term volatility. However, this process often leads to a healthier market structure by flushing out excessive risk. On the other hand, if traders are de-risking by exiting positions, it may temporarily suppress buying demand before a new uptrend begins. The current liquidation levels suggest that many short positions could face forced capitulation if ETH’s price rises further, which would create the potential for a short squeeze that might drive prices even higher. Additionally, the broader macroeconomic context is important. Federal Reserve net liquidity has risen from $5.85 trillion to $5.95 trillion. Higher net liquidity typically correlates with increased demand for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors have more capital to deploy. This combination of decreasing exchange netflow and improving liquidity conditions presents a compelling case for a bullish outlook on ETH in the near term. Interest in ETH Despite its recent struggles , buyer interest remains evident. Spot Ether ETFs and ETH purchases by Trump-linked World Liberty Financial highlight ongoing demand. Additionally, Cboe BZX Exchange has proposed options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs, following a similar move by NYSE American. If approved, investors could use options as a cost-effective tool for exposure and hedging in Ethereum-backed ETFs. Meanwhile, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that if ETH holds above $2,500, it could spark a significant rebound, potentially rallying toward $4,000 or even $6,000. This bullish scenario suggests that buyers may step in at this level, driving demand and triggering a sharp price recovery. However, a failure to maintain $2,500 as support would shift the outlook bearish, with the next target dropping to $1,700. Such a decline could lead to increased selling pressure as well as market volatility as traders reassess the altcoin’s short-term trajectory.

Analysts have predicted BTC will see a decisive price move in the coming weeks. While short-term volatility is set to continue, the long-term outlook for the flagship cryptocurrency remains bullish. MicroStrategy Rebrands, Reports Increased BTC Acquisitions In Q4 MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC) , has rebranded to Strategy. The company stated it was almost halfway to its ambitious goal of raising capital as it embarked on a BTC buying spree following Donald Trump’s election victory. Strategy revealed it had acquired 218,887 BTC for just over $20 billion since the end of the third quarter and holds a total of 471,107 BTC on its balance sheet. Speaking about its fourth quarter numbers, CEO Phong Le stated, “We have completed $20 billion of our $42 billion capital plan, significantly ahead of our initial timelines, while leading the digital transformation of capital in the financial markets. Looking ahead to the rest of 2025, we are well-positioned to further enhance shareholder value by leveraging the strong support from institutional and retail investors for our strategic plan.” Strategy shares remained unchanged during extended trading hours. The company unveiled its new name and logo, underscoring its focus on Bitcoin. Strategy had planned to issue $42 billion in securities between 2025 and 2027. With the crypto market rallying, the company bought BTC aggressively, making investors wonder if its plans had changed. Bitcoin Reserve Could Be Weaponized Arthur Hayes, the Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom Fund, has said a Bitcoin strategic reserve could be a net negative for the industry and be used as a political weapon. Hayes added it could even be reversed if Democrats won the 2028 election and decided to sell the stockpile. Hayes stated in a blog post on February 6, “Broadly speaking, many misguided crypto folks wish for the US government to print dollars and purchase Bitcoin as part of a national stockpile [...] I believe these folks are asking for the wrong things. There would be 1 million Bitcoins just sitting there, ready to be sold; it just takes a signature on a piece of paper. It turns a Bitcoin reserve or “national stockpile of shitcoins” held by the US government into a “potent political weapon.” Hayes added that if Donald Trump failed to slow inflation, stop wars, and fix supply issues, Democrats could gain the upper hand, win the House majority, and even punish crypto investors for siding with Trump. However, asset management firm VanEck is optimistic about a Bitcoin stockpile, predicting it could reduce America’s national debt by 35% by 2049. Speculation about a Bitcoin reserve spiked after Trump announced plans for a sovereign wealth fund. Arkham Intelligence Unveils Satoshi’s BTC Vault Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence has unveiled its discovery of $108 billion in BTC held within recognized wallets linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator. The revelation comes sixteen years after Bitcoin’s inception and offers unprecedented insight into Nakamoto’s financial footprint, yet preserves the mystery of their identity. The data reaffirms Nakamoto’s status as the Bitcoin ecosystem’s most elusive architect, with the wallets untouched since genesis in 2009. “Update: $100 billion in Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings now on Arkham. We’ve added an additional 22,000 Satoshi addresses with a total BTC balance of 1,096,354 to the Satoshi Nakamoto entity on Arkham. These are derived from a known mining pattern referred to as the Patoshi Pattern and include the only (known) addresses from which Satoshi spent BTC from.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up for a decisive price move in the coming weeks if some analysts from Bitfinex are to be believed. According to the analysts, BTC could shift as macroeconomic developments unfold, pointing out that the flagship cryptocurrency has been trading within a 15% range since mid-November when its price was around $90,000. Historically, a price range of 15%-20% tends to resolve in either direction within 80-90 days. The analysts added that despite BTC’s correlation with macro conditions, its ability to stay above its pre-election price despite market turbulence highlights its relative strength. BTC is expected to be volatile in the short term, but its long-term outlook remains bullish. “While Bitcoinʼs short-term volatility may continue in response to macroeconomic influences, its long-term outlook remains positive.” Other analysts believe if the US government confirms its plans with BTC , the asset could see a significant spike in value. “The day the US government announces they are buying bitcoin, the price will go up $50,000 in a single 1-minute candle. Do not get caught short.” BTC has seen high levels of volatility since Monday, when it dropped to a low of $97,766 before recovering to settle at $102,064. The price continued to drop on Tuesday, falling 0.69% to $101,362. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as the price rose 2.27% to $103,663. BTC surged to an intraday high of $106,296 on Thursday before dropping back to settle at $104,553. However, sentiment changed on Friday as BTC fell nearly 2% to $102,616. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Saturday as BTC dropped 1.54% to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $101,041. Bearish sentiment registered a substantial increase on Sunday as BTC fell over 3%, slipping below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA to $97,881. Markets collapsed on Monday, and BTC plunged to an intraday low of $91,274. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $101,579, registering an increase of nearly 4%. The rally was short-lived as BTC fell 3.54% on Tuesday, dropping below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA to $97,979. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.34% and settled at $96,668. The current session sees BTC up just over 2% and trading around $98,695. BTC has rebounded during the current session as it looks to reclaim $100,000. A move past this level will indicate buyers have got the upper hand. A close above $100,000 could propel BTC toward $105,000 and possibly retest its all-time high. However, if sentiment reverses, BTC could drop toward $96,000. A break below this level could see the price fall towards $90,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It has dropped for five straight weeks and erased over 65% of value during this time. On the positive side, the Livermore Speculative Chart points to a potential rebound in the next few weeks. A surge to its its all-time high would mean a 190% increase from the current level. However, narrowing the chart further shows that the bullish view has a catch. Pepe Coin Price is Bullish: Livermore Speculative Chart Pepe coin, the third-biggest meme coin in the crypto industry, slumped from an all-time high of $0.00002830 in December to a low of $0.0000080. The coin has a key catalyst that may push it much higher in the coming weeks. Daze , a popular crypto analyst pointed to the Livermore Speculative Chart (LSC), which may see it rebounding since it has hit a crucial support level. The LSC is a chart structure based on Jesse Livermore, one of the top legendary traders of all time. It is based on the concept of a rising broadening wedge chart pattern, which is usually a bearish sign. As shown below, one counts the higher highs and higher lows up to number 7. After that, the coin stages a strong bullish breakout for a while, then drops. Livermore Speculative Chart Daze believes that the Pepe coin price has now moved to the seventh phase, which will lead to a strong rebound. A crucial caveat of this view is that such a rebound may take time since it is based on the weekly chart. Chart formations on the weekly tend to take weeks or even months to complete. Pepe coin price forecast Pepe Price Daily Chart Calls For Caution The longer-term Pepe coin price chart has a bullish catalyst in the form of the Livermore formation. However, the meme coin may have some volatility in the short term since three important things have happened recently. First, the coin has formed a head and shoulders pattern, a popular bearish reversal sign, which explains why it has plunged recently. Second, Pepe has formed a death cross pattern, a popular risky pattern that forms when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. In this case, the two weighted MAs have made a crossover. Weighted moving averages are usually more sensitive than the others because they rely on recent data. Third, the value of Pepe has dropped below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level, where most rebounds happen. Therefore, there is a risk that the coin may have some volatility in the short term. Pepe Coin Price More downside may see it drop to the key support at $0.000006730, the 78.6% retracement level. A rebound, on the other hand, could lead to more upside to the 38.2% retracement at $0.00001784.

Launched on the lines of the traditional Banking’s CIBIL score, the Nettyscore will analyse the borrower’s pas behaviours such as consistency in loan repayments and the times it has gone defaults – making it easy for the lender to decide. It leverages sophisticated pattern recognition, real-time market analysis and predictive analytics to provide lending and borrowing services against Digital and Real-World Assets (RWAs). It allows users to get loans by keeping various assets as collateral such as Profile Pictures (PFPs), art, and gaming assets. It allows users to access liquidity without any need to sell it completely. ] How DeFi lending benefits The potential lenders who are willing to make loan offers can accept the given crypto assets staked as collateral. Funding loans on listed NFTs, lenders can initiate loans instantly on NFTs with set terms. On nettyworth, they can accept and review the loan terms set by the borrower and choose their preferred asset for which they wish to provide a loan for. Once accepted, the loan gets approved and the principal amount offered by the lender gets transferred to the borrower’s account. However , currently, Nettyworth supports lending only for ERC-20 tokens: WETH and USDT. Lenders on NettyWorth have to pay a 4% protocol fee, deducted from borrower-paid interest. The rest goes to the lender with no fee applied if a loan defaults. In contrast to the traditional lending, Decentralized Lending allows anyone to be the lender, thus, skipping the need for middle men and intermediaries. Nettyworth also provides the infrastructure to build their own loan marketplaces by using its XGBoost algorithms. In less time only, it has reached $125M in connected wallet value – highlighting the potential and the need of the development of DeFi lending. By 2026, it aims to reach $500 M in connected wallet value by 2026 Backed by Acacia Digital, Trive Digital, Blockchain Founders Funds, London Real Ventures, Republic, Trive Digital, and Acacia DigitalLender also get a change to earn higher yields on NFT-backed loans than traditional DeFi lending. For example, it offers 55% APR on lending 2 ETH on a 30-day loan which amounts to 0.033 ETH in profit. Lending on NettyWorth is LIVE! You can now start requesting loans against your PFPs, Art and gaming assets. Unlock liquidity without selling! No Liquidations! Request loan offers – quick and easy Lend with confidence using NettyScore, a Web3 credit score … pic.twitter.com/P1egoQavSt — NettyWorth (@nettyworthapp) January 22, 2025 How borrowers can avail loan offers using DeFi Using peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, borrowers can choose to accept the available loan offers from the “My loans” section in the “offers tab”. Making it easy, fast and transparent for borrowers, it transfers the asset as collateral to escrow and is locked in the smart contract until the loan is repayed. However, if the loan is not repayed, lender reserved the right to claim the collateral. Moreover, defaulting on loans will be reflected poorly in the NettyScore. Nonetheless, it frees borrowers from complex processes of identity verification, credit checks, and denial for poor people with no credit history or poor score. “The DeFi market for NFTs and Real-World Assets (RWAs) lacks the scalability needed for long-term growth. NettyWorth bridges this gap by integrating AI and a Web3 Credit Score into DeFi, seamlessly connecting borrowers and lenders through smart AI-DeFi agents and the NettyScore system, which assesses borrowers’ creditworthiness,” said July Grullon, CEO of NettyWorth. Now, as Nettyworth looks forward to more strategic partnerships with key liquidity providers, Define Partners, DeFi lending is poised to scale – revolutionazing the borrowing and lending using Defi and Blockchain.

A Feb. 5 report from Chainalysis revealed a 35% decline in ransomware payments compared to the previous year, signaling progress in law enforcement efforts and a growing reluctance among victims to pay. Meanwhile, a Feb. 4 report from Kaspersky Labs detailed the emergence of SparkCat malware, which targets mobile users by scanning images for crypto wallet recovery phrases. Ransomware Payments Drop 35% in 2024 as Law Enforcement and Victim Refusal Strengthen Defenses The total amount extorted through ransomware attacks saw a sharp decline of approximately 35% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to a report published on Feb. 5 by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis . The report noted a significant shift in the ransomware landscape, as attackers faced increased resistance from victims and greater scrutiny from law enforcement agencies. In 2024, ransomware attackers managed to extract nearly $815 million from victims, a substantial drop from the record $1.25 billion extorted in 2023. This marks the first annual decline in ransomware-related revenue since 2022, showing the growing impact of countermeasures and policy shifts in the fight against cybercrime. The decrease in ransomware revenues is attributed to multiple factors, including: Heightened law enforcement actions: Governments worldwide have been cracking down on ransomware groups through arrests, asset seizures, and disruption of illicit networks. International collaboration: Countries and agencies have enhanced their cooperative efforts, leading to a more effective global response. Growing refusal to pay: More organizations and victims are refusing to meet ransom demands, a trend that has been encouraged by cybersecurity experts and authorities. Cryptocurrency remains the primary medium of exchange in ransomware attacks, but the increasing regulatory scrutiny around crypto transactions has made it harder for cybercriminals to launder funds undetected. With traditional ransomware strategies proving less effective, attackers have begun modifying their approaches to maintain profitability. Chainalysis noted key shifts in tactics, including: Utilizing fresh code repositories to evade security measures. Accelerating ransom negotiations, sometimes initiating extortion attempts within hours of an attack. Diversifying attacker profiles, with threats originating from nation-state actors, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations, lone hackers, and smaller data theft groups. These adaptations indicate that while total ransomware payments are falling, the overall volume of attacks is not decreasing. Instead, cybercriminals are testing new ways to pressure victims into paying. Chainalysis' data suggests that the most significant decline in ransomware payments occurred in the second half of 2024. Payments dropped by roughly 79% compared to the first half of the year, signaling the growing effectiveness of law enforcement and cybersecurity measures. Despite the drop in payments, the number of attempted ransomware attacks actually increased in H2 2024. This suggests that while more victims were targeted, fewer chose to comply with ransom demands, reinforcing the growing trend of non-payment. This pattern highlights a shift in the cost-benefit dynamics of ransomware operations. Attackers are expending more effort on launching attacks but receiving diminishing returns, which may eventually lead to a decline in the number of cybercriminals engaging in ransomware activities. The decline in ransomware payments is consistent with a broader downtrend in cryptocurrency-related exploits, hacks, and scams throughout 2024. December saw the lowest losses of the year, with total stolen funds amounting to $28.6 million, according to blockchain security firm CertiK . The last quarter of the year experienced a significant decrease in major crypto heists: October: $115.8 million in crypto-related losses. November: $63.8 million in losses. December: $28.6 million in losses. CertiK attributes this decline to the absence of major hacks exceeding $100 million in damages, which were more frequent in previous months. A Shift in Cybercrime Strategies for 2025? The evolving landscape of ransomware and crypto-related cybercrime suggests that attackers will continue adapting to overcome increasing obstacles. The drop in payments does not necessarily indicate that ransomware itself is disappearing; instead, it reflects the growing difficulty in successfully extorting victims. As law enforcement improves its capabilities and companies become more resistant to paying ransoms, cybercriminals may resort to alternative methods such as: Targeting smaller organizations with lower security defenses. Using social engineering and deepfake technology to manipulate victims. Exploring alternative payment methods beyond crypto, such as untraceable gift cards or traditional financial fraud. The 35% decline in ransomware payments in 2024 marks a pivotal moment in the fight against cybercrime. With law enforcement crackdowns, global cooperation, and victims' growing reluctance to pay, ransomware groups are finding it harder to profit. However, the battle is far from over. As attackers adjust their methods, cybersecurity defenses must continue evolving to stay ahead. Looking forward, 2025 will likely bring new threats and attack strategies, making proactive security measures more crucial than ever. New Malware SparkCat Targets Crypto Wallets Through Photo Scanning on Mobile Apps In related news, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Labs has identified a new strain of malware, SparkCat, embedded within malicious software development kits (SDKs) used to build apps on Google Play Store and Apple App Store. This malware exploits users' mobile devices by scanning pictures and screenshots for cryptocurrency wallet recovery phrases, which are then used to drain funds without requiring passwords. The discovery, detailed in a Feb. 4 report by Kaspersky analysts Sergey Puzan and Dmitry Kalinin, reveals a sophisticated attack vector that relies on optical character recognition (OCR) to extract sensitive text from users' photo galleries. Once an app infected with SparkCat is downloaded onto a device, the malware: Activates an OCR stealer to scan images stored in the device gallery. Searches for keywords related to cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases, passwords, and other sensitive information. Extracts and transmits data to the attackers, allowing them to restore and empty crypto wallets remotely. “The intruders steal recovery phrases for crypto wallets, which are enough to gain full control over the victim’s wallet for further theft of funds,” Puzan and Kalinin wrote. The malware's adaptability allows it to steal other personal data, including passwords, private messages, and sensitive documents, if they are captured in screenshots. Kaspersky estimates that SparkCat has been downloaded over 242,000 times since its activity was first detected in March 2023. The primary victims appear to be Android and iOS users in Europe and Asia, though the full extent of the infection remains unknown. Unlike traditional malware that typically targets a single app or platform, SparkCat is embedded in multiple apps, both real and fake, across the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. The malware-laced apps come in various forms: Legitimate-looking apps, such as food delivery services and utilities. Fraudulent apps, designed specifically to lure victims, such as AI -powered messaging platforms. Hidden in Plain Sight The malware’s stealth capabilities make it difficult to detect: It is built using the Rust programming language, which is uncommon for mobile apps, helping it evade security scans. It is cross-platform, allowing it to target both Android and iOS users. It uses obfuscation techniques to conceal its presence from malware detection systems. Puzan and Kalinin noted that, on Android, the malware disguises itself as an analytics module called Spark, which interacts with an encrypted configuration file hosted on GitLab. The module receives commands and updates remotely, making it highly adaptable. One of the biggest concerns raised by Kaspersky's report is how the malware ended up in so many apps. The researchers are uncertain whether the developers of the affected apps intentionally embedded SparkCat or if it spread through a supply chain attack—a method where hackers infiltrate third-party SDKs used by developers. “Some apps, such as food delivery services, appear legitimate, while others are clearly built to lure victims — for example, we have seen several similar ‘messaging apps’ with AI features from the same developer,” the report states. While the origin of SparkCat remains unclear, Kaspersky’s researchers found comments and error descriptions written in Chinese within the malware's code. This provides “reason to believe that the developer of the malicious module is fluent in Chinese,” though attribution remains speculative. The malware's behavior also closely resembles an attack campaign discovered in March 2023 by ESET researchers, suggesting that it could be the work of a previously known cybercriminal organization. How to Protect Yourself Kaspersky’s analysts strongly advise users to take proactive measures to avoid falling victim to SparkCat: Avoid storing sensitive information in images – Crypto recovery phrases and passwords should never be stored as screenshots or saved in a phone’s gallery. Use a secure password manager – Instead of relying on screenshots, users should store private information in an encrypted vault. Remove suspicious apps – If an app is behaving oddly, such as requesting unnecessary permissions, uninstall it immediately. Check app permissions – Be wary of apps requesting access to the photo gallery without a valid reason. Stick to verified crypto wallets – Download cryptocurrency wallets only from official websites or trusted sources. The emergence of SparkCat sheds light on the evolving strategies cybercriminals are using to target cryptocurrency users. With the increasing popularity of mobile trading and decentralized wallets, hackers are shifting their focus to mobile devices as a new attack vector. Google and Apple will likely face pressure to enhance security protocols in their app stores, especially when it comes to vetting third-party SDKs. For now, crypto users must remain vigilant, as malware continues to evolve, seeking new ways to exploit human error and security loopholes.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-06 14:00:00

The recent failure to push higher has left the token consolidating, hinting at a possible downward move if buyers fail to regain control. With market sentiment tilting in favor of the bears, traders are bracing for what could be another wave of selling. If bulls cannot generate enough momentum, PEPE may slip further, testing lower support zones in the coming sessions. The battle between buyers and sellers at this level will be crucial in determining the token’s next major move. PEPE Consolidation Near Resistance: A Breakdown Or Rebound? Pepe’s price action remains trapped in a consolidation phase just below a crucial resistance level, indicating market indecision. Its recent failed breakout attempt highlights the strength of sellers in this zone, preventing bullish momentum from taking over. As the price struggles to push higher, the risk of a potential breakdown increases, especially if bearish pressure intensifies. Related Reading: PEPE Recovery Hits A Wall: Can Bulls Smash Through $0.00001313? The price continues to trade below the 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), reflecting that the meme coin is still under negative pressure. This price action suggests that the market sentiment remains tilted toward the downside, as the failure to break above the SMA highlights a lack of buying strength. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending below the 50% threshold, further supporting the bearish outlook. Usually, the RSI’s position below this key level indicates that the selling pressure is currently stronger than the buying, with the market leaning more toward the downside. Further downward movement remains high until the price can break through the 4-hour SMA and the RSI sustains a move below the 50% key level. Crucial Support Zones In Focus As Selling Pressure Rises With selling pressure mounting in the market, $0.00000766 is the initial support level to watch. Historically, this level has proven to be a critical price point, acting as a psychological and technical barrier. If the price can maintain above this level, it could signal that buyers are still holding the line, offering a potential for stabilization or even a rebound. Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise Should selling pressure persist, the $0.00000589 mark will be the next key area to watch. This support level represents a deeper point of defense for PEPE, and its ability to hold might be crucial for preventing a more significant downturn. A drop below $0.00000589 would be concerning, as it can expose the price to a possible extension of the bearish trend, causing traders to reevaluate their positions. However, if the price remains above the $0.00000766 level, it may pave the way for a surge toward the $0.00001152 resistance level as buyers remain in control. A break above this level points to further gains, with the price targeting $0.00001313 and moving above the 100-day SMA.

Price actions may look weak at the moment, but its long-term bullish structure remains intact on the daily chart. After the mid-January rally that saw Ray to a new high of $8.7, the price fell following rejection and managed to close the month well above $7. It lost this level amid rising supply and dipped until the price reached a low of $4.15 earlier this week. A quick recovery from this low brought the price back above the $6 level but later lost grip due to mounting bearish pressure. Currently, it is trading at around $5.5. A further price drop from this trading level could bring us back to the $4 level, which has been a critical support for this market in the past three months. As we can see on the daily chart, several attempts to break through it proved abortive. If by any chance Ray loses this support, it may undergo a short-term correction before regaining strength. But considering the recent sharp rejection there, a fresh buy is expected anytime soon. That should explode the price to a new high. Despite the drops, Ray is still considered bullish on a macro trend. RAY’s Key Level To Watch Source Tradingview The $4.78 level is the closest support for Ray along with the $4.15 level that contained bearish pressure earlier this week. If all these price levels collapse due to huge supply, the $3.43 level is the next support to watch. If the bulls step back to retake the $6.6 resistance, the next push may bring a recovery to $7.92 before breaking out of the main $8.7 high. Key Resistance Levels: $,6.6, $7.92, $8.7 Key Support Levels: $4.78, $4.15, $3.43 Spot Price: $5.5 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

39995039,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-core-remains-unbreakable,1738850970,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/6/39995039.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Core Remains Unbreakable,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-core-remains-unbreakable,"Bitcoin was forged to be unstoppable in a hostile environment, but let’s be perfectly clear: surviving and thriving are two different things. Just because Bitcoin can withstand severe political antagonism doesn’t mean we should want that antagonism, nor does it mean we shouldn’t do everything possible to foster a favorable environment that accelerates adoption. Believing otherwise is a misreading of the core ethos. The brilliance of Bitcoin is that it remains permissionless and decentralized no matter who fights it—but that doesn’t preclude us from working to ensure we have the most beneficial conditions for its long-term success. In fact, public policy responses to regulatory and legislative inquiries have consistently reaffirmed these basics: Bitcoin’s strength is open-source software, self-custody, and a wide distribution of mining and node operators. In other words, it’s not about selling out. It’s about ensuring our governments understand the benefits of Bitcoin’s open design. There’s a difference between “Bitcoin was built for a hostile environment” and “we should want a hostile environment.” Having an adversary-resistant architecture doesn’t demand that we sit back and ignore opportunities to reduce friction, whether in energy policy or everyday user experience. Yes, Bitcoin can and will survive if politicians and regulators turn hostile. But it’s short-sighted to treat hostility as a virtue. Hostility might slow adoption, push development offshore, or scare away everyday users who aren’t ready for that level of conflict. Meanwhile, measured engagement with policymakers can prevent draconian bans, shape balanced regulation, and offer legitimate pathways for institutional capital to flow in— all of which can speed up global usage of Bitcoin. It’s not a betrayal of Satoshi’s vision to say, “We’d like Bitcoin to flourish under transparent, fair laws.” We want people to choose Bitcoin, not be forced into it by some catastrophic breakdown of the legacy system. There is nothing “un-Bitcoin” about encouraging legislation that protects individuals’ rights to use and hold their own BTC, or that supports open-source development. We should be unapologetically active in these political arenas, because ignoring them won’t make them go away. It would only allow others—perhaps with very different agendas—to set the rules in ways that hamper privacy, hamper self-custody, or hamper innovation. The key is remaining vigilant against compromises that undermine the protocol’s integrity. Building relationships with politicians or regulators doesn’t mean we’re begging for favorable carve-outs at the expense of censorship resistance. It simply means we’re making our voices heard. If we see demands for forcing protocol-level changes that are hostile to users, that’s where we must stand firm and say “No” for both practical and ideological reasons. But proactively sharing how Bitcoin mining can stabilize energy grids or how Lightning Network can provide near-instant payments is not a concession of Bitcoin’s ethos. It’s part of a rational strategy to help the public and policymakers understand the real value behind Bitcoin’s existence. Misguided concerns about large mining operations kowtowing to regulatory pressure are not new. The reality is, Bitcoin’s design remains adversary-resistant: anyone can mine if they have the hardware and energy, and anyone can run a full node to enforce the rules, ensuring that no single miner can change the protocol. If some mining pools bend to censorship demands, other pools are attracted by fees to include those transactions. That’s exactly how Bitcoin is designed: routing around censorship with an anti-fragile, decentralized architecture. Ironically, positive regulatory engagement can reduce centralization risks if it opens more states, countries, and smaller energy providers to hosting mining facilities. Diversity of geography and jurisdiction means no single entity or government can easily impose sweeping rules on the entire network. Again, “hostile environment survival” doesn’t mean turning away from pragmatic solutions that help decentralize hashrate. It is true that privacy, scalability, and accessibility remain pressing challenges. This isn’t an either/or proposition: we can both engage with regulators to stave off ill-informed policy and focus on advancing privacy-preserving features and scaling solutions. The key is not to let the everyday politics overshadow the work that needs to be done on second-layer technologies like the Lightning Network or more user-friendly privacy solutions. Developers are actively tackling these issues, from better cryptography to more intuitive Lightning wallets. We should be championing—publicly and politically—initiatives that keep self-custody at the forefront and keep third-party custodians optional. Spreading knowledge of “not your keys, not your coins” at the legislative level isn’t selling out; it’s ensuring that more people (including politicians) actually grasp the fundamental reasons Bitcoin matters. It’s easy to look at the ecosystem—full of corporate players, lobbying efforts, and social media theatrics—and think it has lost its soul. But Bitcoin has always been full of diverse voices, many of which care about short-term profit. That was true in 2011, it was true during the block-size wars, and it’s true now. It hasn’t destroyed Bitcoin. The network’s fundamental robustness ensures that, if you want to hold your own keys and validate your own transactions, nobody can stop you . The central promise of Bitcoin hasn’t evaporated, and participating in policy doesn’t have to mean capitulation. It’s simply another stage in Bitcoin’s evolution, one where we actively shape a better environment for the technology and the people who benefit from it. We should embrace that fight wholeheartedly, defend Bitcoin’s fundamentals, and keep building toward a future where censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer digital money is the global norm—not just a contingency plan for hostile conditions.
