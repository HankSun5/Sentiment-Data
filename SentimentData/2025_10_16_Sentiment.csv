The meme coin has slumped to multi-month lows as market participants sold the news on US-China trade war escalations. Now, both mid-sized and large investors are stepping in. Santiment data shows wallets holding 100,000 to 10 million PEPE have increased their balances to 610.21 billion tokens. PEPE supply distribution. Source: Santiment. Similarly, large holders with 10 million to 1 billion PEPE have stopped offloading, stabilizing their positions at 15.42 trillion tokens. This end to de-risking by whales, coupled with continued retail participation, sets a solid foundation for a potential market reversal. Pepe Price Prediction: Is This the Last Bottom Before $1? These move to increase exposure to Pepe comes as it affirms the lower boundary of a year-long symmetrical triangle, now nearing its apex. PEPE / USDT 1-day chart, 1-year symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. The support zone stretches back well beyond the pattern itself, acting as a proven launchpad since mid-2024. Now, with momentum indicators turning up, another bounce could be on the horizon. The RSI has rebounded from oversold territory above 30, while the MACD histogram is edging closer to the signal line, both hinting at the early stages of a potential bullish push. The key threshold for a breakout sits around the historic demand zone at $0.000009, which must hold as support for confirmation. Fully realized, the pattern targets past highs into new Pepe price discovery in a potential 600% move to $0.00005. However, with continued U.S. interest rate cuts stimulating risk appetite and growing speculation around spot PEPE ETFs under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, fresh inflows could fuel a 1,200% rally to $0.0001. While this marks the first step towards the $1 milestone, it remains distant. Such a jump would likely require long-term institutional participation and deep TradFi integration to meet the necessary demand. PepeNode: You Don’t Need the Perfect Entry to Net Gains Meme coins often reward those who time their entries perfectly, but that same volatility makes them unpredictable. What if you could mine them instead of betting everything on catching the right dip? With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No expensive setups, no tech barriers. Just log in, acquire nodes, stack rigs, and start earning rewards across top-performing meme coins. The stats look solid too. The presale has already exceeded $1.8 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 700% APY. And with 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs burned, scarcity is built directly into the system, helping support long-term value growth. The timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins, making PepeNode’s rewards and model even stronger as momentum builds across the sector.

Historically, “Uptober” has often marked the beginning of prolonged bull markets. Last Monday, Bitcoin hit a new ATH, sparking widespread optimism across the crypto space. That momentum quickly derailed when Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports on Friday. The news triggered some of the sharpest intraday declines ever recorded in the market. Despite the volatility, many veteran traders view the correction as a necessary reset. Historically, crypto markets tend to crash hard before major bull cycles. This event, they argue, served as a healthy purge that removed excessive leverage and mercurial holders. XRP ($XRP): Perplexity Anticipates a Run Toward $20 Perplexity’s AI-driven analysis suggests that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb to between $10 and $15 before the end of the year, an increase of four-to sixfold from its current price of $2.50. Source: Perplexity AI Ripple, the company behind XRP, secured a landmark legal victory this year after a five-year battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The win pushed XRP to $3.65 on July 18, marking its first all-time high since 2017. Furthermore, over the past 12 months, XRP’s price appreciated 360%, making it the best-performing large-cap cryptocurrency not pegged to a fiat currency. During the same period, Bitcoin rose 72%, while Ethereum appreciated 57%, meaning XRP outperformed them fivefold and sevenfold, respectively. Technical charts reveal three distinct bullish flag patterns throughout 2025, including two during the summer months, signals that often precede strong upward movements. Analysts expect that October’s historically bullish seasonality, combined with potential ETF approvals, promised U.S. regulation, and new Ripple partnerships, could propel XRP toward the $15 level. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Perplexity AI: Dogecoin Could Surpass the Doge Army’s $1 Goal Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted satire, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a major cryptocurrency, boasting a $30.6 billion market capitalization within the $66 billion meme coin sector. Currently trading around $0.20 with a relative strength index (RSI) near 40 and trending upward, Dogecoin has risen 1.2% in 24 hours despite the rest of the meme coin market collectively dipping 5.5% True to its meme coin nature, Dogecoin often amplifies daily crypto market trends. But as we’re seeing today, it has a second nature as a multibillion-dollar blue chip, which means it’s enjoying the market’s 2% rise today. Throughout summer 2025, several bullish formations appeared in its chart, setting the stage for a possible breakout. Perplexity predicts that DOGE could finish the year between $0.75 and $1.36, with the upper limit representing an ambitious stretch target. A more cautious estimate places it at $0.33. Given its previous all-time high of $0.7316 during the 2021 bull run, surpassing the Doge Army’s long-standing $1 objective would be a major psychological victory. Additionally, adoption continues: Tesla accepts Dogecoin for merchandise, and payment platforms such as PayPal and Revolut now support DOGE transactions. Pepe ($PEPE): Perplexity Predicts the Meme Coin Could Reclaim Its All-Time High Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) now commands a $3.1 billion market cap, making it the largest non-dog-themed meme token. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic, Pepe’s internet culture roots have made it a viral phenomenon in and beyond the crypto world. Despite strong competition, Pepe maintains deep liquidity and an active community, occasionally boosted by subtle, bullish references from Elon Musk on his X profile. Currently trading near $0.0000075, Pepe sits about 73% below its December 2024 peak of $0.00002803. Perplexity’s optimistic outlook suggests Pepe could retest its previous ATH, potentially quadrupling in value if it breaks key resistance around $0.000018. In a wildly speculative scenario, Perplexity targets $0.0024, a 32,000% increase. This is simply not possible given Pepe’s huge market cap, but a run to $0.0001 is a good stretch target in a bull run. Missed DOGE? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Challenger Fueled by Degen Energy and Community Hype A new Dogecoin rival, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , just hit the presale market, already raising $3.6 million in early funding as investors FOMO in. After watching Dogecoin’s success from the sidelines, his distant cousin Maxi Doge is now claiming his own spotlight, and reflecting it on the pump-loving maximalism of crypto’s degen community. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI is faster, cheaper, and more environmentally sound than Dogecoin. It focuses on community engagement through Telegram and Discord groups, trading competitions, and upcoming brand partnerships. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” a reserve dedicated to marketing initiatives and strategic collaborations. Staking is already live, offering yields of up to 84% APY, though returns fluctuate as participation increases. The presale currently prices tokens at $0.000263, with incremental increases tied to funding milestones. Investors can purchase using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Although DOGE’s trajectory has flipped bearish, short-term holders are currently capitalizing on the pullback, as they go on a massive buying spree. A Massive Dogecoin Buying Spree Ongoing In light of waning action in the price of Dogecoin, short-term investors are showcasing their presence once again in the market. Despite DOGE’s price experiencing a pullback, on-chain data reveals that these investors appear unfazed by the drop; instead, they view it as an ideal opportunity to increase their holdings. As reported by Joao Wedson, a market expert and founder of Alphractal, Dogecoin is still in its early stages of development, and short-term holders are accumulating. This steady accumulation reflects growing confidence in the meme coin’s long-term resilience. Such persistent conviction could pave the way for a bullish recovery after the broader market sentiment stabilizes. According to the Hodl Waves chart, short-term holders are amassing more DOGE every day, which shows a supply increase of up to 6 months. Historically, this crucial pattern has driven prices higher for Dogecoin, Bitcoin , and other coins. The major reason for prices moving higher is due to the fact that new speculative capital entering the market raises the Realized Cap. In the meantime, the MVRV Z-Score has not yet displayed the same level of intense ecstasy as previous cycles or 2021. Therefore, it shows that the leading meme coin still has room for more price growth before the cycle comes to an end or reaches its top. DOGE’s Top For This Cycle Not In? Wedson has also shared insights on whether DOGE has reached its top for this current cycle. In December 2024, Wedson highlighted that DOGE reached its all-time high for the current cycle exactly at the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) Alpha, a key metric for determining cycle bottoms and tops. However, data from the Reserve Risk Indicator implies that DOGE’s top in 2024 was fragile and lacked robust on-chain interest. Wedson considers the reading from this key metric as it has accurately predicted every Dogecoin’s top in the past 9 years. While DOGE keeps facing bearish pressure, Wedson claims that monitoring holders’ actions daily is important to navigate the market direction. His statement is fueled by the fact that steady accumulation may suggest a potential rise in price in the near future . Related Reading: House Of Doge Reveals Why Institutions Are Now Closely Watching Dogecoin Bitcoinsensus has forecasted that DOGE could soon rise beyond the $1 price mark as the macro picture remains bullish. Despite the recent market volatility, DOGE is holding strong on high time frames. Presently, the price is positioned above the support line of a rising channel. Should the meme coin surge to the upper line of the channel alongside a steady bullish overall trend, it is likely to surpass the $1 level and head towards $1.40.",Dogecoin|Alphractal|Bitcoinsensus|Cumulative Value Days Destroyed|CVDD Alpha|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Joao Wedson|MVRV Z-Score|Realized Cap|Reserve Risk Indicator|Rising Channel,EN,0,0,DOGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 22:30:03

The announcement came during a High Court hearing in London on Wednesday, where the Director of Public Prosecutions informed victims’ lawyers about the possibility of establishing such a scheme, though specific details remain undisclosed. At the center of the dispute are 61,000 Bitcoin, worth $6.7 billion, seized by police in 2018 from devices found at a mansion in Hampstead, north London, now representing one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in UK history. The case has pitted British authorities against approximately 130,000 Chinese investors who lost money in the fraud and contend the UK state should not benefit from their losses. Zhimin Qian, left, and Seng Hok Ling, right | Source: FT The Fraud and Seizure Zhimin Qian, 47, also known as Yadi Zhang, masterminded an investment fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded victims of 43 billion yuan ($6 billion). She fled China after converting much of the investors’ cash into Bitcoin and settled in the UK under a false identity. Qian and her Malaysian associate Seng Hok Ling, 47, pleaded guilty to money laundering charges last month at Southwark Crown Court in London. Both are scheduled for sentencing in November. Bitcoin’s value has surged dramatically since the 2018 seizure, climbing from approximately $1.8 billion at the time to its current valuation of roughly $7.2 billion. UK authorities recently obtained access to additional cryptocurrency assets worth about £67 million after Qian disclosed access codes and passwords for a ledger and two cryptocurrency wallets . “The ledger had been found in a purpose-made concealed pocket within a pair of jogging bottoms which [Zhang] was wearing at the time of her arrest,” according to written submissions by Martin Evans KC, counsel for the Crown Prosecution Service. Compensation Proposal and Victim Response Evans told the court that the proposed compensation scheme would provide “adequate protection” for victims. The CPS stated it had maintained throughout legal proceedings that it intended to seek a civil recovery order to compensate victims for their lost investment, insofar as they have not otherwise been compensated. The agency said it would consider how all victims could be compensated, not just those participating in the UK legal proceedings. William Glover, director at law firm Fieldfisher representing a group of victims, said in a statement following the hearing that “the DPP has effectively accepted responsibility to create a form of compensation scheme for those who may be unable to seek redress through the existing statutory provisions.” However, lawyers for the victims face serious challenges in proving direct links between their clients’ investments and the confiscated coins. Jack Ding, assistant managing partner at Duan & Duan, which represents around 10,000 victims, noted that “some materials lack sufficient information to establish a clear connection.” Legal experts warn that victims are unlikely to recover Bitcoin’s appreciated value, as courts typically focus on returning principal amounts and reasonable interest rather than speculative gains. Treasury Implications and Market Concerns The Bitcoin spoils have drawn attention from UK Treasury officials, with some privately questioning whether the assets could help Chancellor Rachel Reeves address the country’s fiscal gap estimated at up to £30 billion by 2029. However, other government officials have cautioned that the haul is likely subject to protracted legal battles extending potentially into 2027. The Treasury has been advised it cannot include the seized assets in its fiscal calculations, as the Office for Budget Responsibility does not account for asset seizures in its forecasts. Meanwhile, authorities face the practical challenge of liquidating such a large Bitcoin position without triggering major market disruption . The UK government is attempting to retain over 61,000 Bitcoin that was seized from a Chinese national convicted in a massive investment fraud case. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/L7LPgA3fCW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 The case has sparked debate about cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement in cross-border fraud cases, with implications for how governments handle seized digital assets. A civil recovery case filed in September 2024 will determine the final distribution of assets, with proceedings scheduled to continue through January 2026. The outcome is expected to establish precedents for international cooperation in cryptocurrency-related financial crime cases and may influence how other jurisdictions approach similar seizures. The coordination difficulties are compounded by the fact that many victims have limited experience with digital finance, making documentation and claim verification particularly challenging.

The San Francisco-based AI startup is currently enjoying a rapid adoption of its products by enterprise customers, fuelling the ambitious revenue projections, as per sources cited by Reuters. Apart from strong AI demand, the projections are also reflective of the growing investor confidence and growth in the generative AI sector, even as spending especially in infrastructure buildout comes under scrutiny. Anthropic eyes rapid expansion supported by enterprise customers Anthropic is currently on course to meet its internal goal of $9 billion annual revenue run rate by end of this year, according to the two sources who requested to remain anonymous to discuss private financial matters. The sources further revealed that for this year, the company has set a base target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion, with a best case reaching as much as $26 billion. While Anthropic declined to comment of the projections, the company confirmed to Reuters that its current annual revenue run rate is approaching $7 billion this month, a significant increase from the $5 billion it reported in August. Anthropic, which is also a top rival for OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, was recently valued at $183 billion after raising $13 billion in a series F funding round led by ICONIQ. The AI startup on Wednesday launched a new version of its cheapest AI model, Haiku as part of a broader effort to appeal to companies that are looking for capable AI systems that are cheaper than its more advanced models. The latest model – Haiku 4.5 reportedly sells for about one third the price of Sonnet 4, one of its medium-sized models. Anthropic’s expansion is being spurred by a widespread uptake of its enterprise products. Recently professional services giant Deloitte inked an agreement to deploy Anthropic’s AI assistant Claude, to its more than 470,000 employees across the globe. The deal marked the largest enterprise deployment of the AI assistant to date, deepening a relationship the two firms first established in 2024. Anthropic currently serves more than 300,000 businesses and enterprise customers , contributing about 80% of its total revenue. Its models like Claude family of large language models, are sold via application programming interfaces (APIs). A notably successful tool is Claude Code, a code generation assistant, achieved an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $1 billion since its launch earlier this year, according to one of the sources. Its ambitious growth forecasts positions it as a strong competitor to OpenAI, which announced in August that it had surpassed $13 billion in annualized revenue and is aiming to exceeding $20 billion by end of this year driven by ChatGPT growth. The chatbot has over 800 million active users. Anthropic has been expanding its sales to governments and growing outside the US. The company revealed in August that it would offer its Claude to the US government for $1. Anthropic is also targeting to open its first office in Bengaluru in India next year, its second largest market after the US and aims to triple its international workforce. It is also aiming to expand its applied AI team fivefold this year to meet rising demand for AI products and services. Get seen where it counts.

Extended Consolidation (35% Probability) Breakdown below $38.11 could result in $35 – $40 consolidation, allowing infrastructure development while testing structural support before catalyst-driven recovery.

From there, HIP-3 scaling and fee generation could push recovery toward $47 , with Polymarket expansion driving toward $52 + mid-October resistance reclaim.

Investors believe in its ability to pay up to 80x ROI when it lists on major exchanges later this year. Having verified audits and an Ethereum-based ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in high demand among retail and institutional investors preparing to make the next big presale success story of the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Investor Confidence Unlike normal presales that are based on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining the confidence of investors through transparency and independent verification. The project passed audits by Hashex and CertiK , which are most reputable blockchain security firms. Both audits attested that the smart contract does not have vulnerabilities or backdoors , ensuring all transactions and token minting are completely transparent on-chain. This kind of verification is not common among early-stage crypto projects. According to analysts, such degree of due diligence makes MAGACOIN FINANCE superior to its rivals in terms of dependability and long-term growth potential. The design of the presale also involves an anti-whale system, which denies a small number of investors the ability to control the supply of tokens and ensure a fair launching process. Moreover, the organized roadmap of the project and regular updates by the development team has helped in boosting investor confidence. All milestones have been implemented in a timely manner. Roadmap and Utility Ahead of Exchange Launch The exchange listing of the project expected in Q4 2025, is one of the most anticipated events by investors. Furthermore, market analysts believe that the listing will lead to a sharp price increase, as it has been with other high-performing presales in their early years. The projected 80x ROI is due to existing demand factors and presale velocity which are still above average. MAGACOIN FINANCE is also characterized as a utility-based approach. The token will enable a decentralized ecosystem with staking and liquidity incentives to reward holders. Moreover, the platform will incorporate live analytics to track the performance of tokens, which will serve as transparency to traders and long term investors. What Sets MAGACOIN FINANCE Apart Although numerous new tokens are introduced every day, only a few of them integrate audit-backed security, real-time transparency and systematic growth like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Its Ethereum foundation enables it to take advantage of security and scalability of the network, being compatible with major DeFi protocols. The other important distinguishing factor is the community-based approach which might lead to 80x ROI . MAGACOIN FINANCE has an excellent communication channel through social platforms where investors are updated on progress of the presale, exchange partnerships and roadmap implementation. Furthermore, its crypto presale model with distinct funding phases, has enabled investors to participate with ease, knowing their targets and allocation limits at each stage. This commitment to legitimacy by the project has also attracted the attention of influencers and analysts who rank it among the few 2025 presales that have both transparency and realistic growth expectations. Its performance potential and credibility is what helps MAGACOIN FINANCE attract early adopters prior to the start of listings. Conclusion Having already raised more than $16 million and boasting of audit-backed security, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already demonstrated legitimacy before its major exchange launch . Its well-organized roadmap and clear token utility, makes it one of the best-performing presales in 2025. With investor anticipation ahead of the listing stage MAGACOIN FINANCE is a safe project that will offer 80x ROI once listed on major exchanges.

However, according to prominent market analyst Egrag Crypto, there’s a critical signal to watch for that could determine whether the cryptocurrency’s bullish narrative remains intact or not. The expert’s analysis, shared on X social media, highlights that the behaviour of XRP’s 3-day candles could soon decide the direction of its next major move. XRP Price Integrity Hinges On 3-Day Candle Closes Below $2 In his post on X, Egrag Crypto explains the “measured move breakdown” for XRP, identifying a key technical formation in the form of a descending triangle that, based on its structure, points to a potential move toward $2.14. The accompanying chart shows XRP hovering between $2.40 and $2.60, with multiple retests of the same price levels over the past few months. Despite the brief wick to the downside, Egrag Crypto suggests that the structure continues to indicate consolidation within the range. Related Reading: Here’s How High The XRP Price Would Be With The Market Cap Of Bitcoin The analyst reiterates that $2.65 remains a critical price target for XRP. If the cryptocurrency breaks and sustains above it, he predicts that it could regain upward momentum, potentially paving the way for renewed bullish sentiment. However, failure to hold current levels around $2.5 might expose XRP to deeper retracements, particularly if 3-day candles start closing below the $2.00 to $1.91 range. Egrag Crypto warns that this specific candle behaviour is concerning, as it could signal a structural breakdown of XRP’s market cycle. It could also invalidate his bullish thesis, suggesting that the recent peak near $3.65 may have been the cycle top. Additionally, the analyst’s chart shows XRP’s price action hovering above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), serving as a long-term support level. Should XRP maintain its position above this moving average, Egrag Crypto asserts that the cryptocurrency’s bullish setup remains valid. He noted that the next 60 to 90 days are expected to be crucial, as XRP’s reaction around the levels mentioned above could define the trajectory of the rest of the year. XRP Faces 57% Chance Of Breaking To A New ATH In a separate analysis, Egrag Crypto introduced a 57% to 43% probability model, sharing his broader perspective on XRP’s potential price direction in the short term. He stated that there is a 57% probability that XRP could break into a new all-time high in the coming months. He also sees a 43% chance that the cryptocurrency could decline significantly, offering traders another opportunity to accumulate it at a price below $1. Related Reading: Market Strategist: What You Should Expect For The XRP Next Leg While the probabilities of XRP’s near-term price favor a more bullish outcome, the bearish case remains plausible given the lingering macroeconomic uncertainty and overall crypto market volatility. Egrag Crypto notes that he is personally positioning himself toward the bullish scenario, aligning his expectations with the 57% chance of a major price breakout.

The OG crypto that investors once treated as “digital gold” slumped as over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out within 24 hours, the largest single-day liquidation in history of the market. The crash was so huge it dragged Bitcoin from about $125,000 all the way to $102,000 in matter of hours, exposing how closely Satoshi’s dream still moves with risky assets instead of acting as a shield against them. For most of this year, Bitcoin was thriving on a new narrative. Exchange‑traded funds were attracting billions, and Wall Street giants were pouring in. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had grown to $91 billion in assets, trailing the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fund’s $136 billion, a symbolic race that investors said would prove whether crypto actually could rival gold as a store of value. That race is now over for the moment. Gold has reclaimed its dominance while Bitcoin’s safe‑haven credentials look weaker than ever. Gold rallies after Trump’s China tariff warning President Donald Trump’s new tariff threat against China sent investors scrambling for cover. Gold surged past $4,200 an ounce today, its highest level ever recorded, while Bitcoin fell in tandem with equities and oil. The selloff showed again that the token’s price still depends heavily on risk appetite and leverage rather than fear or capital preservation. “I have never considered Bitcoin a safe haven. I have always believed it to be a speculative risk asset,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. Gold’s centuries‑long reputation as a store of value remains intact. I mean, GLD stands above $130 billion in assets, IBIT hovers near $91 billion, and investors are again turning to bullion when volatility spikes. Even when volatility is factored in, gold is beating Bitcoin. The Sharpe ratio, which tracks risk‑adjusted returns, shows gold at 3 as of October 14, its highest in a year. Bitcoin has dropped to 1.91, down from 3.68 in January. Gold’s gains are steadier, while Bitcoin’s are fueled by momentum that vanishes once markets panic. Analysts call gold the new Bitcoin amid liquidity crunch Market veteran Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research, told clients on Wednesday that “Gold is the new Bitcoin.” He wrote that investors now view gold as “physical Bitcoin,” a more reliable hedge against rising geopolitical tension. Yardeni pointed out that while both assets posted strong returns this year, gold leads by a wide margin, jumping 60 percent in 2025 compared with Bitcoin’s 20 percent rise. Gold’s strength over the last month is striking, up 13 percent, while Bitcoin fell 3 percent. Over the past week alone, gold gained 4 percent as Bitcoin plunged 9 percent and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1 percent, a reminder that the token continues to trade like a tech stock rather than a hedge. Yardeni expects gold to hit $5,000 in 2026 and possibly $10,000 by the end of the decade. Yardeni blamed Bitcoin’s slide on liquidity pressure. He said exchanges triggered auto‑deleveraging to limit damage as markets collapsed, forcing even profitable or hedged traders to close positions to protect balance sheets. Market makers stepped back, spreads widened, and there were no buyers strong enough to absorb the avalanche of sell orders. Meanwhile, gold’s rally was helped by Trump’s tariff threats, as traders sought protection from policy shocks and global instability. Yardeni said, “Investors seeking protection from mounting geopolitical risks have been heading for the hills to mine for gold as well as for silver.” Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that institutional participation through ETFs proves the asset’s maturity and that the crash is temporary. Critics counter that as long as Bitcoin behaves like a high‑beta stock, its dream of becoming a hedge remains fantasy. The numbers leave little doubt. Gold funds continue to draw steady inflows as part of what traders call the “debasement trade,” while Bitcoin’s momentum has cooled. The token may still be the poster child of speculative finance, but for investors looking for safety in Trump’s world of tariffs, inflation worries, and geopolitical friction, gold is back in charge.

Here’s What $429M in ETF Outflows Really Means,https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-panic-pullback-or-bullish-setup-heres-what-429m-in-etf-outflows-really-means/,"Investors pulled nearly $430 million from Ethereum ETFs on Monday after Friday’s sharp sell-off, but analysts still favor a bullish Ethereum price prediction . According to Farside Investors , ETH ETFs saw eight straight days of net inflows before the crash, drawing in nearly $2 billion in fresh capital. This puts the recent outflow into perspective, suggesting that most investors aren’t shaken by the dip to $3,500 . Analyst Dean Chen from Bitnunix said that only if outflows continue for several sessions would it signal broader market fear. For now, the data suggests confidence in Ethereum remains strong despite short-term volatility. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Could Rise by 125% If It Breaks Out of Consolidation Ethereum is showing signs of strength as it enters a clear consolidation phase between $3,900 and $4,700 , holding this range for nearly three months. This type of setup has often preceded major breakouts — and ETH has done it before. The last time Ethereum traded sideways like this, it exploded 125% , climbing from $2,150 to $4,750 in just a matter of weeks. A similar breakout now could push the price beyond $8,000 , setting the stage for one of the biggest rallies of the year. However, momentum indicators haven’t confirmed the move just yet. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) still needs to break above the 14-day moving average to flash a clear buy signal, and $4,800 remains a key level to beat. For now, the signal isn’t confirmed. The RSI still needs to push above its 14-day moving average, and price must break through $4,800 to open the floodgates. Still, bullish sentiment remains strong after last week’s crash, and momentum is building fast. Presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are already seeing a surge in demand and with confidence returning to the market, early buyers could be positioned for massive upside. Bitcoin Hyper Nears $23M Raised to Launch The First-Ever Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is breaking new ground as the first true Layer-2 for Bitcoin , finally unlocking the full potential of the most popular blockchain. It cuts fees, adds smart contract functionality, and boosts transaction speed all by integrating the power and performance of Solana .

Buyers stepped in aggressively around the $2 level , showing confidence despite the market shakeout. In the last 24 hours, XRP has climbed 1.6% to $2.50, with trading volumes holding strong at 4% of its total circulating market cap — a sign that momentum may be shifting back in the bulls’ favor. Meanwhile, ETF assets held steady despite the downturn. The recently-launched REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) is still managing over $90 million worth of the token, which is pretty much what the fund had last week. It appears that diamond-handed XRP holders took advantage of last week’s decline to scoop up the token at a much lower price, meaning that this isolated Binance transfer is not necessarily indicative of an overall shift in market sentiment. XRP Price Prediction: Trend Line Support Bounce and Big Volumes Favor Bullish Outlook The daily chart shows that XRP bounced off a key trend line as it touched the $2 level. Above-average volumes reflect the technical relevance of this level and favor a bullish XRP price prediction for the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also jumped off oversold levels as the price climbed to $2.5. However, the token is still trading below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Moving forward, a bullish breakout above $2.70 would confirm that the token is once again en route to hitting the $3 level. Meanwhile, if positive momentum accelerates and a breakout above $3.5 occurs, that should set XRP on course to hit $5+ before the year ends. Ripple has been focusing its efforts lately on growing its ecosystem as regulations have turned in its favor. As institutional interest keeps growing, catching early crypto presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) while they are still flying below the market’s radar could deliver above-average returns during this cycle. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Crypto Mining Fun, Simple, and Hardware-Free Pepenode ($PEPENODE) makes it easy for anyone to start mining meme coins — no expensive gear, no complicated setup.

The researcher explained that Naver “has always been relatively undervalued” on the South Korean market, despite its rival Kakao “receiving a high valuation through business expansion.” He explained: “The acquisition of Dunamu will allow Naver to fully enter the crypto industry. Stablecoins , in particular, could generate significant synergy with Naver’s existing advertising, commerce, and fintech businesses.” The Kospi surged past 3,600 mark for the first time ever in early trading Friday as Korean markets reopened after the long Chuseok holiday, fueled by a rally in semiconductor and biotech shares following strong momentum from U.S. chipmaker Nvidia. https://t.co/HMv6UQaJXd — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) October 10, 2025 Naver is the country’s biggest internet company. Its subsidiary Naver Financial already operates several banking and e-pay platforms. The firm hopes to merge Naver Financial with Dunamu, the owner of South Korea’s biggest crypto trading platform. The move would create Asia’s biggest fintech company. Jung explained: “The industry expects the new firm to create a stablecoin ecosystem centered on Dunamu’s exchange business and its GIWA protocol [Upbit’s Layer-2 Ethereum-based chain].

(@joosik_school/YouTube/Screenshot) Jung opined that the merger would “open up various possibilities for Naver,” which has seen its valuation decline due to “a lack of new growth engines.” And while some continue to claim that regulatory approval for the merger is still up in the air, the researcher said there was a “relatively positive atmosphere” around the deal. While regulations still prevent banks from engaging in crypto-related business, some say that these rules do not apply to e-pay providers like Naver. Jung said that there is uncertainty over the question of whether fintech companies such as Naver Financial should be considered traditional financial companies. He said: “The levels of uncertainty surrounding the merger are not very high.” The researcher concluded that the proposed merger meant Naver would be “the most notable internet large-cap stock to watch next year.” Naver Financial last month announced a plan to effectively take over Dunamu in a proposed comprehensive stock swap deal. Upbit has cornered over 70% of the South Korean market share, per recent estimations . The merger talk has stoked speculation that Naver Financial-Dunamu could look to go public on the NASDAQ exchange.

In a recent analysis published on Tuesday, Matthew Dixon, a veteran trader and financial market strategist, identified one critical price point that could determine XRP’s next major rally. According to Dixon, once XRP clears this resistance, it could accelerate rapidly into new price territory. Key Resistance at $2.65 Dixon pinpointed the $2.65 level as the crucial barrier preventing XRP from initiating a sustained rally. This area previously acted as solid support but turned into resistance after XRP’s steep decline to $1.37 during the October 10 market crash. #XRP so far has failed to break back above the $XRP 2.65 resistance level but it should just be a matter of time. If we can break and retest that level then rapidly higher towards new ATH should follow the large WXY correction down that now appear complete pic.twitter.com/oCrTPcqMfQ — Matthew Dixon – Veteran Financial Trader (@mdtrade) October 14, 2025 Following that drop, XRP has made several attempts to reclaim the $2.65 region. On Monday, the token climbed to $2.647 before being rejected. Another attempt on Tuesday also failed, with the price retreating to $2.40 shortly after touching the resistance zone. Dixon emphasized that while XRP has struggled to move above this range, he expects the breakthrough to occur eventually. Once the $2.65 resistance is decisively cleared, he believes the price could advance quickly, potentially surpassing XRP’s current all-time high of $3.66. WXY Correction May Support Next Uptrend Dixon’s optimistic forecast is supported by his technical interpretation of XRP’s recent market structure. He argues that the token has completed a WXY corrective pattern, which often precedes a new bullish phase. His analysis outlines three main points, W, X, and Y, on XRP’s daily chart. The “W” point represents the low of $1.615 recorded in April. This was followed by an ABC pattern that led to a rally and peak around $3.66 in July, labeled as point “X.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Afterward, XRP entered a consolidation period, forming another ABC corrective wave, pushing prices downward to the “Y” point at $1.37 on October 10. Dixon considers this drop the final stage of the correction. He contends that a recovery from this zone could mark the beginning of a new bullish cycle, provided XRP reclaims the $2.65 resistance. Analysts Expect New All-Time High When asked about potential price targets, Dixon refrained from offering a specific number, noting instead that surpassing the previous all-time high would be the most immediate milestone following the resistance break. At present, XRP trades around $2.42 , roughly 31% below its record high. To establish a new peak, the token would need to climb at least 45% from current levels. Dixon’s outlook aligns with several other bullish forecasts for XRP. For example, market analyst CasiTrades recently projected that XRP could reach $4.50 as part of the final leg of a three-wave Elliott Wave pattern. Although short-term volatility remains, multiple analysts agree that XRP’s long-term trajectory depends on a clear break above the $2.65 resistance level. If that happens, they believe a rapid move toward new all-time highs could follow soon after. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

XRP and SUI have both posted decent gains in the past 24 hours, while hotly anticipated L1 cryptocurrency Monad shared details of its upcoming airdrop. These three coins are all likely to do well in the coming weeks, but so is another new token that’s also preparing to launch before the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Ripple Growth Will Drive Altcoin to Record-Breaking Highs XRP has bounced by 2% in 24 hours, although its current price of $2.52 still equals a 12% loss in a week and a 17% decline in the past month. Yet longer term momentum is undoubtedly on XRP’s side, given that it has posted a 360% increase in the past year. Bigger gains are still to come, especially when a whole raft of XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the near future , driving institutional investment in the token. This probability combines bullishly with the setup of XRP’s current chart, which shows the alt in an oversold position. Source: TradingView Its MACD (orange, blue) has recently plunged to a new low, while its relative strength index (yellow) has also bounced from a bottom. As such, XRP is ready for a big recovery, and the launch of ETFs may be the catalyst that triggers a big end-of-year rally. And when you add Ripple’s ongoing growth as a company – adding new partnerships and acquisitions in recent months – the future looks very bright for XRP. It could reach $3 in November, before ending the year above $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Monad ($MON) – Incoming Airdrop May Help New L1 Become the Next Big Thing in Crypto Monad is a new Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer-one blockchain, with its technical documentation stating that it’s capable of 10,000 transactions per second. It promises to improve on performance in five major areas, including block transmission, state access and consensus.

The Monad Airdrop Claim Portal is live Claim your MON here: https://t.co/WAKIvKK8xm https://t.co/WAKIvKK8xm — Monad (mainnet arc) (@monad) October 14, 2025 And this excitement has transferred to the imminent airdrop for its native MON token, which is yet to list. The airdrop is open to active members of the Ethereum and Solana communities, and will remain open until November 3. While there may be a dip in price once it does list (due to airdrop participants selling their holdings), its fundamentals put it in a strong position for medium- and long-term growth. It will have a total supply of 100 billion MON, and judging by other major tokens with a similar supply, this means its price could settle at around the Crypto Price Prediction: Sui ($SUI) – Network Growth and Canary ETF Increases Chances of Big Xmas Rally SUI has risen to $2.82 today, and while this makes for a 2% increase in 24 hours, the altcoin remains down by 19% in a week and by 22% in a month. It has also posted a 47% decline since reaching its ATH of $5.35 in early January, yet there’s an argument to be made that this indicates how much it could rally in the next few weeks. SUI does remain a very strong coin fundamentally, with its MOVE-based L1 now boosting a TVL of $2.2 billion , making it the ninth-biggest platform in crypto. It has also signed big partnerships in the past year (e.g. with World Liberty Financial ), and it’s looking forward to the launch of an ETF from Canary. Source: TradingView Its chart today also shows it in an oversold position, but because of its underlying fundamentals, we can expect it to recover strongly once the market is more favorable. It’s likely to retake $3 in the next few weeks, before ending November above $4 and then breaking the $6 barrier in December. $1.8 Million and Counting: PEPENODE Presale Sets Stage for Big Listing Rally The coins above are all showing massive potential, but so too are several newer tokens, some of which could rally big once they list for the first time. This includes presale coins such as PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has now raised over $1.8 million in its ongoing sale. Build. Mine.

Gramegna’s comments came during the International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings, where he said that if stablecoins ever became mainstream without being tied to central bank money, “there’s a risk to the whole financial system, not just in Europe, but the whole world,” according to Bloomberg. The IMF, in a report earlier this week, had said that the $305 billion stablecoin market could shake traditional lending, weaken monetary policy, and potentially trigger runs on the safest global assets. The Financial Stability Board backed that concern, warning that the explosive growth of stablecoins and their growing ties to the banking sector make them a rising threat to stability. IMF warns of run risks and central bank intervention The IMF’s semiannual financial stability report said a sudden loss of trust in stablecoins could create a “run risk,” because if investors rush to redeem their tokens, issuers might be forced into fire sales of reserve assets like government bonds or bank deposits. The report said such selloffs could spill into repo markets, push up volatility, and force central banks to step in to stabilize prices. Stablecoins are typically backed by US Treasuries, making them the most conservative slice of the crypto market. Yet the IMF said their size and the increasing overlap with traditional finance now pose global contagion risks. It warned that banks’ exposure to these assets could spread shocks across multiple markets if investors panic. Gramegna insisted that the European Union is not against stablecoins, but stressed that they must operate under a strict framework that protects both consumers and financial institutions. “It must be in a framework that is safe for consumers and financial actors,” he said. Gramegna also called on Europe not to fall behind the United States or Asia in crypto development, arguing that if the continent doesn’t produce stablecoins pegged to the euro, it will “lose an opportunity.” All these also came after Austrian central bank chief Martin Kocher said at the Bloomberg Global Regulatory Forum that he didn’t believe stablecoins would gain strong traction in the eurozone. “As 99% of stablecoins are denominated in dollars, if Europe doesn’t produce stablecoins denominated in euros we will eventually lose an opportunity here,” Gramegna said. “I do think there is a possibility of coexistence of cash, digital currency and stablecoins.” Banks expand stablecoin projects amid rising oversight The IMF’s admonitions come as banks and other financial institutions expand their stablecoin activities, following the passage of the US Genius Act, which establishes a new regulatory framework for the tokens. The total market value of stablecoins has soared this year do surpass $300 billion, data from DefiLlama show. Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Banco Santander announced plans to issue a 1:1 reserve-backed token on public blockchains. Citigroup joined nine European banks to develop a regulated euro-based stablecoin. Still though, the IMF is warning that as these dollar-linked tokens grow, they could limit central banks’ ability to manage interest rates and control inflation, especially in smaller economies where stablecoins may act as parallel currencies. They may also alter the structure of bond markets by prompting a preference for certain kinds of debt, which has implications for traditional lending, the IMF said. The report also cautioned that any large-scale loss of parity between a stablecoin and its reference currency would cause “direct losses and heightened uncertainty” for users. Over the weekend, Cryptopolitan reported that Ethena, the third-largest stablecoin, briefly lost its dollar peg as crypto markets saw their largest single-day liquidation in history. The Financial Stability Board joined the IMF in warning that stablecoins remain an “emerging threat” and promised to increase global oversight. Other major regulators, including the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, have also cautioned that without strong management, the stablecoin sector could create a crisis that no central bank is ready to contain.

The U.S. had slapped a 50% tariff on Indian goods earlier this year, split into two separate 25% rounds, after talks collapsed over trade and energy deals. India had protested that others like China and Turkey, who also buy Russian crude, weren’t hit with the same penalties. Trump pushes India and China to join the oil boycott Trump added that Modi could not end the purchases instantly because “it’s a little bit of a process,” but said the transition would be completed soon. The two leaders are expected to meet this month at the Southeast Asia Summit in Malaysia, their first face-to-face since tensions flared over the tariffs. “Modi is a great man, he loves Trump,” the president said, sounding confident about the partnership. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that China could face steeper tariffs if Europe joined the effort. He accused Beijing of “fueling the Russian war machine,” and Trump later urged China to follow India’s example. The White House decision came only days after Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, held a closed-door meeting with Modi in New Delhi. The pair reportedly discussed defense, technology, and trade, with Trump emphasizing that Gor’s appointment was part of his plan to stabilize relations after months of pressure over energy imports. Behind the scenes, Trump’s administration has been coordinating a broader international effort to limit Moscow’s oil profits through tariffs and financial restrictions. Officials described the goal as forcing nations still trading with Russia to shift away, using Washington’s trade tools rather than military ones. Britain expands sanctions as G7 debates frozen Russian funds Across the Atlantic, Britain announcement new sanctions aimed at Russia’s oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft, and 44 oil tankers accused of moving crude under Moscow’s so-called “shadow fleet.” Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the crackdown, part of a 90-item sanctions package, was designed to choke off funds used for the war in Ukraine. “We are sending a clear signal: Russian oil is off the market,” Reeves said during remarks in Washington D.C., ahead of meetings with international finance chiefs. Reeves also confirmed that the UK had sanctioned India’s Nayara Energy Limited, which she said imported 100 million barrels of Russian crude worth over $5 billion last year. The company’s inclusion marks the first time London has directly targeted an Indian firm in connection with Russian oil shipments. Reeves added that the UK government was also tightening the screws on four Chinese oil terminals linked to Russian exports. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper backed the action, saying, “Today’s action is another step toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and a more secure United Kingdom.” The two Russian energy firms under sanctions together ship about 3.1 million barrels of oil daily, with Rosneft producing nearly half of Russia’s crude, around 6% of total global output. The new measures were announced alongside meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose 190 member countries are tracking the global economic fallout from the war. Meanwhile, the G7 is preparing to debate next week a proposal to seize hundreds of billions in frozen Russian investments, much of it held in cash at the European Central Bank after maturing bond holdings. Earlier this year, both the U.S. and UK sanctioned Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, a move former Foreign Secretary David Lammy said would “drain Russia’s war chest.” Now, Trump’s latest push to align India with the oil boycott adds another layer of pressure on Moscow. The U.S. is also considering tariffs up to 500% on Chinese imports linked to Russian energy, though Scott Bessent did say that: “We will respond if our European partners will join us.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|India|Russia|USA,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|MACROECONOMICS|ASIA|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-15 23:37:53

Recent chart patterns and market behavior show striking similarities to its 2017 accumulation phase, a period that preceded a massive parabolic rally. As Q4 unfolds, technical indicators and Bitcoin dominance data hint that the long-awaited bullish setup could still be in play. Q4 Move Still Possible: XRP’s Bullish Potential Isn’t Gone Yet Crypto analyst CoinsKid recently shared an update confirming that the highly anticipated Q4 move for XRP is still a potential option. This optimistic outlook is heavily underpinned by the current data observed on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which the analyst views as a crucial barometer for altcoin performance. If BTC.D shows weakness, capital typically flows into assets like XRP, supporting the potential for a significant surge in the coming months. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Crashes 50% Over The Weekend, What Does This Mean For Price? However, CoinsKid pointed out that the recent loss of the $1.90 low last Friday introduced what he described as a structural anomaly into the equation. This development adds a layer of uncertainty to XRP’s short-term outlook, even as the broader setup continues to show potential. He further explained that for this bullish scenario to remain valid, Bitcoin dominance must stay below its 5-day resistance level on the CoinskidRibbon. At the same time, XRP needs to hold above its own 5-day CoinskidRibbon as support. Wyckoff Blueprint In Motion: XRP Mirrors Its 2017 Setup EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL, in a recent update, highlighted that XRP is currently positioned within a major accumulation area, signaling that a crucial phase may be unfolding for the asset. According to the analyst, the current market structure strongly mirrors the early stages of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, a technical formation that often precedes large-scale bullish movements. Related Reading: XRP Bull Run Reloaded: Analyst Says Momentum Mirrors 2017’s Explosive Rally The Wyckoff method identifies this accumulation phase as a period where smart money quietly builds positions while the price remains range-bound. This typically occurs after extended declines, setting the stage for a powerful reversal once the market confirms strength. From a technical perspective, this accumulation structure indicates growing pressure beneath key support zones, which often leads to a strong bullish cycle once a breakout occurs. The repeated testing of support levels, combined with diminishing selling volume, strengthens the case for a potential upside breakout in the near term. EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL also drew parallels to XRP’s behavior in the 2017 cycle, when a similar accumulation phase preceded one of the asset’s most explosive rallies, with XRP climbing all the way to the distribution zone, where profits were eventually taken. If history repeats, the altcoin could once again be on the verge of a powerful upward run.

Critics argue that the devastating episode highlights the difference between digital assets and traditional safe-haven investments, such as gold, exposing and challenging the long-held myth about BTC’s digital gold status . Bitcoin Flash Crash Highlights Fragility Of “Digital Gold” Narrative Veteran economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has been vocal in analyzing the flash crash that shook the crypto market last Friday. He stated in an X social media post that the sharp decline, which saw BTC drop from above $122,000 to $102,000 in a single day, was not a buying opportunity but a critical warning to investors. Notably, the Bitcoin flash crash came after US President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese tech imports , which added geopolitical pressure to markets. Reports from numerous analysts also indicated that internal pricing issues at Binance allegedly contributed to the massive liquidations the same day, exacerbating the broader market decline. Schiff highlighted in his post that the surge in gold price during the Bitcoin flash crash exposes the myth that BTC is digital gold, underscoring a stark contrast between volatility-driven digital currencies and traditionally tangible assets. He further argued that the notion of Bitcoin as a stable and reliable store of value is flawed, pointing out that the cryptocurrency’s price could collapse at any time in the future without warning. Addressing the crypto community, Schiff cautioned that many investors stand to lose significantly by choosing BTC over gold. He remarked that BTC enthusiasts seem to fear gold for “exposing Bitcoin for the fraud that it is,” highlighting the enduring resilience and stability that traditional assets continue to demonstrate over cryptocurrencies. Unsurprisingly, his remarks about Bitcoin provoked intense backlash from many Bitcoin maximalists and crypto investors, many of whom pointed to BTC’s record highs above $126,000 in contrast to Schiff’s past failed predictions or “warnings” that the cryptocurrency would never reach $100,000. Schiff Predicts Further Decline Ahead For BTC In a follow-up post on X, Schiff turned his attention to Bitcoin’s near-term outlook, forecasting another sharp decline from its present levels. He analyzed broader market trends, particularly the performance of Nasdaq futures , suggesting that if the index falls by an additional 7.5%, it would enter correction territory, potentially triggering a 15% drop in BTC prices. A 15% drop in the BTC price could send it tumbling below $95,000. However, Schiff went further, predicting that the cryptocurrency could continue sliding toward its next support level near $75,000, representing a steep 34% decline from current levels around $112,000. Moving on, the financial strategist highlighted the contrasting performance of traditional precious metals, noting that gold and silver continue to rise even as Bitcoin and Ethereum retreat . Schiff also warned that cryptocurrency buyers are likely in for a “rude awakening,” describing the experience as a costly but valuable lesson.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|ETH|Ethereum|gold|Peter Schiff,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 00:00:18

Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that the recent dip has created a rare opportunity for accumulation, particularly for investors seeking to move into the upper tiers of the XRP rich list. The XRP Rich List and Market Decline According to data compiled by the XRP community, wallets holding between 8,162 and 10,501 XRP currently fall within the top 5% of all XRP addresses. With XRP trading around $2.48 , this translates to an entry value of approximately $21,129 to $27,197. These figures represent a slight decline compared to earlier this month. On October 1, the threshold for inclusion in the top 5% ranged from 8,229 to 10,550 XRP, which was valued at $23,370 to $29,962 based on the token’s price at that time. The reduction in both token and dollar value means that investors can now join the top 5% segment with roughly $2,000 less than they would have needed two weeks ago. The decline in XRP’s value followed the broader market crash that affected most major cryptocurrencies on October 10, when XRP fell more than 43%, briefly touching $1.58 before recovering above the $2.40 region. Although sentiment remains cautious, several observers believe this period of weakness offers a favorable entry poin t for long-term investors. Analysts’ Perspective on Accumulation Market commentators such as Coach JV have recently emphasized that opportunities to buy XRP at lower valuations may not last long. He warned that once market momentum returns, XRP’s upward movement could be swift, leaving little time for new entrants to accumulate at current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other analysts, including DustyBC, have maintained bullish long-term expectations, with many placing the next significant target around $10 per XRP. While opinions differ on when such a rally might occur, the $10 projection remains one of the most cited price goals within the XRP community. Projected Returns for Top 5% Holders at $10 If XRP were to reach $10 , investors currently in the top 5% tier would see a substantial increase in their holdings’ value. Based on the present range of 8,162 to 10,501 XRP, their portfolios, now worth $21,129 to $27,197, would appreciate to $81,620 to $105,010. This potential increase represents profits between $60,491 and $75,048, assuming the holders maintain their current balances. Such returns highlight the financial leverage available to those already within the upper bracket of XRP ownership, particularly if the token’s price realizes the projected surge. While short-term uncertainty persists, the adjustment in the XRP rich list underscores how market downturns can shift entry requirements for top holders. With the current drop lowering the threshold for elite-level participation, new investors have an opportunity to join the upper percentile at a relatively reduced cost. If XRP succeeds in reclaiming bullish momentum and eventually approaches the $10 mark, these early entries could prove highly profitable. For now, analysts remain divided on the timing of such a move, but most agree that XRP’s present pricing offers a more accessible point for those looking to strengthen their positions before any potential market recovery.

UK prosecutors are preparing to confiscate Bitcoin worth about $6.8B connected to one of the largest cryptocurrency fraud cases ever uncovered. Prosecutors revealed during a court hearing in London on Wednesday that the funds are tied to a fraudulent investment scheme that swindled about 128,000 investors across China. Authorities plan to create a victim compensation program to return funds to those affected. Chinese victims are set to be repaid by the UK The $6.8 haul is from an investigation by the London Metropolitan Police, which uncovered 61,000 Bitcoins in 2018 during a money laundering probe involving two Chinese women. The women were involved in a 2017 fraud case that was first detected by Chinese authorities when investors began reporting losses linked to Tianjin Lantian’s promises of high-yield returns. The scheme eventually fell apart and exposed a vast network of false investment products and fake profits used to attract new participants. The structure was similar to a Ponzi-style scam . UK prosecutors stated that the company lured investors with promises of high returns and when it collapsed, it resulted in losses of more than 40 billion yuan. Fourteen Chinese nationals have already been convicted in China in connection with the scheme. One of the largest UK crypto seizures Yadi Zhang, also known as Zhimin Qian, played a key role in laundering the stolen cryptocurrency. Zhang pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges last month after years of investigation. Her accomplice, another Chinese woman, was convicted of fraud by a UK jury last year. Prosecutors revealed at the last hearing that Zhang had hidden additional cryptocurrency from investigators. The court filings show that Zhang told police in April 2024 that she had stored the passwords for two crypto wallets inside a pocket sewn into the pair of jogging bottoms she was wearing at the time of her arrest. Due to her confession, the police were able to recover another £67.3M worth of Bitcoin. “Some investors have suffered huge personal loss in the form of lives, marriages, fracturing families and businesses,” William Glover, a representative of a group of affected investors, stated. Glover added that the fraud had destroyed livelihoods and caused years of hardship for ordinary people who had invested their savings in what they believed were legitimate opportunities. Discussions are already being held to determine how the funds will be distributed. The court will have to decide on the process for verifying claims and determining which victims qualify for compensation . A lawyer representing another group of investors, Jackson Ng, stressed that the most important thing considering the amount involved in the case is to compensate the victims.

Muller noted that with interest rates currently at an appropriate level, policymakers should remain patient while closely monitoring developments that could sway inflation in either direction. Heightened trade conflicts in the market spark tension among investors During the 2025 IMF’s annual meeting, scheduled to take place from October 13 to 18 at the IMF and World Bank Group headquarters in Washington, D.C., Muller pointed out that China’s export controls are an example of how trade barriers set by other nations can have inflationary effects in Europe as well. The Governor of the Bank of Estonia also mentioned that insufficient essential material could raise prices for certain goods, even if it hurts the economy. Hence, according to Muller, this situation contradicts the belief that Trump’s additional tariffs would lead to European deflation. Regarding Chinese export limitations , Beijing’s new export regulations stipulate that foreign firms must obtain approval from the Chinese government before exporting products that contain even small quantities of specific rare earths sourced from the country. In response to this limitation, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an extra 100% tariff on Chinese goods. This heightened conflict between the US and China has sparked concerns among investors in the market regarding the possibility of a fierce trade war between the two. As a result, they have called on the ECB to consider the geographic risks that could affect their predictions. This has led the central bank to anticipate that price growth will decline drastically below its 2% target in 2026, before picking up pace again in 2027. “The risks linked to this forecast are currently more or less balanced,” said Muller. The ECB executive further explained that weakening the recovery process could lower inflation. However, he still pointed out the likelihood of higher inflation amid ignited trade conflicts. Therefore, with these considerations in mind, Muller speculates that the economy might recover swiftly, as it could turn out either way. Muller calls on officials to be patient as debates on interest rate cuts intensify After lowering the deposit rate to 2% eight times, several ECB officials think they should hold off on making further adjustments to borrowing costs until something truly surprising happens in the economy. This decision was weighed during Müller’s remarks, when he stated that with inflation at 2% and interest rates in a range that encourages economic recovery without resulting in slowdowns, officials need to be patient and make their decision based on what is likely to happen in the economy in the coming months. Even with this statement, some of his colleagues still hold the belief that further rate cuts are needed. In response to these contradictions, Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau mentioned in an interview this week that they expect to see a reduction rather than an increase next. Muller disagreed, saying the ECB could take action in either way. “It really depends on how things unfold, and it is very uncertain what we might need to do next in terms of changing rates,” he explained. Based on his argument, he has no reason to start leaning toward making things easier. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The forecast , delivered by Chief Financial and Operating Officer Robin Washington at the company’s investor event on Wednesday, does not include any revenue from a pending Informatica Inc. acquisition that Salesforce anticipates will close in the middle of 2026. Washington said the company was confident about returning to double-digit growth, noting that it would take about 12 to 18 months for the turnaround to materialize. She added that Salesforce had reported $37.9 billion in revenue for the fiscal year ended in January, its slowest growth since going public. AI agents drive Salesforce’s revival Having grown more slowly in recent years, Salesforce is making aggressive use of artificial intelligence to fuel its comeback. At the center of this is Agentforce 360 , an AI-powered automation platform that lets businesses deploy “digital agents” to perform tasks such as customer support, data entry, and early-stage sales conversations. The company stated that over 12,000 customers are already using Agentforce, which has also been adopted internally to reduce costs. The tool is saving Salesforce approximately $100 million per year, the company stated in figures shared during its Dreamforce 2025 conference earlier this week. To bolster its AI capabilities, Salesforce has strengthened its collaborations with OpenAI and Anthropic to integrate their latest models into the suite known as Agentforce 360. The integration enables customers to combine generative AI with Salesforce’s own Einstein Copilot system, which provides more intelligent, context-aware suggestions. The company also announced plans to invest $15 billion in San Francisco over the next five years, as it expands its data centers, supports local AI startups, and advances research on how AI can be used responsibly. The commitment aligns with CEO Marc Benioff’s efforts to establish the global AI economy in San Francisco. Benioff stated at Dreamforce that the company’s AI ecosystem was growing rapidly and described Agentforce as more than just a tool, calling it the future of how companies would interact with their customers. Salesforce boosts investor confidence with buybacks and acquisitions Washington also announced a $7 billion share buyback program over the next six months — part of an effort to help restore investor confidence after a turbulent year. The news lifted Salesforce’s shares about 4% in after-hours trading, although the stock is still off almost 29% year to date. The company’s struggles have additionally reflected investor fears that its corporate clients may be shifting their spending from traditional applications to AI startups and emerging tools. However, Washington has brushed aside those worries, calling talk of software applications dying a “myth.” Salesforce relies on its purchase of the data-integration and analytics firm Informatica as part of its growth strategy. Analysts have said the deal will enable Salesforce to integrate data more seamlessly across its products, which could help AI models operate with better information. Data is the basis for artificial intelligence, and acquiring Informatica would allow Salesforce to fully close that loop by combining customer data with automation and analytics in one place, according to technology analyst Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. The focus on AI and automation from Salesforce comes as the company battles to solidify its dominance in a cloud world that looks different than before. The competition is intensifying — Microsoft, Oracle, and ServiceNow are also incorporating generative AI into their enterprise software stacks. But Salesforce believes it is poised for its next growth chapter. Emphasizing AI, data, and efficiency more will help the firm recover from recent growth declines and restore investor confidence. Benioff noted the AI wave was real and Salesforce didn’t want to wait to take advantage of it. He said people were seeking smart software to do things for them, rather than the other way around.

XRP remains steady around the $2.70 support area, demonstrating strength and hinting that a potential push towards $5 might be in the future. Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, continues to impress with the steady development releases and expanding ecosystem, remaining the darling of long-term bullish believers. Against these established heavy-hitters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , as a presale project, is standing out as one to watch, now in Phase 6 with over 65% sold out, gaining interest with the innovative framework of the DeFi platform as well as the aggressive roadmap. As the go-to high-potential crypto assets under $5, these three tokens are taking the limelight this week among traders and investors. XRP Price Analysis Analysts are growing bullish on XRP, citing that the weekly chart could be taking shape within the form of a megaphone pattern, a formation that typically signals building volatility as well as market indecision. This pattern, defined by growing tops as well as bottoms, usually anticipates a watershed breakout once one side of the market succumbs. Should bulls take the helm, XRP might experience a strong continuation to the high side, consistent with general hopes based on its long-term fundamentals. As traders anticipate this possibility, most investors are putting their sights on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), too, as it continues to gather interest among investors anticipating a move into the next gen high-growth crypto assets. Cardano Price Analysis: The Rally Continues Towards $1 Cardano (ADA) remains to build on bullish strength as buyers continue the extension of the 3-day recovery, taking the price from about $0.63 to $0.70, a remarkable 11% increase since the previous update. This persistent move demonstrates the strength of the $0.60–$0.63 demand area, as this area continues to be the source of strong institutional buying interest. So long as ADA remains above this pivotal point, the bullish technical outlook remains good, with the near-term targets being $0.75, $0.85, as well as $0.95. The momentum bars continue to favor bulls, and with Bitcoin holding steady above the psychological $110K, ADA may soon threaten the psychological $1 barrier, giving way to potential gains towards $1.17–$1.33. As bullish momentum builds, investors are likewise expanding the scope of interest to a presale project gaining strong ground in the growing DeFi arena, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Surges in 2025 Mutuum Finance is the talk of the town nowadays within the DeFi market, as the presale has hit 17,000+ investors with a wonderful $17.35+ million worth of funds to-date. Already in Phase 6 with 65% snapped up during the current phase, the price of the token is currently at $0.035, indicating a consistent market demand with growing investors’ confidence. The platform will launch its lending and borrowing protocol . V1 will be launched onto the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature core product building blocks of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as a liquidator bot. ETH as well as USDT will be featured to be borrowed, collateralized, as well as lent, and will be provided at the time of launch to provide multi-asset, plug-and-play access to DeFi. Institutional as well as retail consumers will be provided with secure, efficient, as well as easy-to-use decentralised finance products. Inexpensive powerhouses to accelerate this week XRP, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance are emerging as three of the most intriguing crypto assets under $5 to watch this week. The bullish megaphone setup in XRP suggests a breakout could be possible, whereas the sustained Cardano rebound above crucial support demonstrates the regained belief among investors in the strength of its fundamentals. The spotlight, meanwhile, belongs to the early-stage DeFi project Mutuum Finance as one that offers innovation, security, as well as practical real-world utility. With over $17.35 million, 17,000+ investors participating, as well as 65% of Phase 6 presale sold, MUTM’s momentum builds upon the possibility of generating outsized returns this 2025. For value hunters and bulls looking to ride the upside in a fluctuating market, coming into the Mutuum Finance presale now might be the best early step towards benefiting from one of 2025’s largest crypto growth stories.

At the same time, altcoins like Ethereum, Avalanche (AVAX), and MAGACOIN FINANCE drew new attention from traders looking for the best altcoins to buy the dip. MAGACOIN FINANCE, in particular, continues to draw eyes for its consistent price movement and growing trust appeal. Bitcoin Price Path Below $112K Tests Trader Confidence Bitcoin price drop under $112,000 came after a sharp flash crash that erased about $15 billion in futures open interest. Despite reclaiming the $114,000 level briefly, caution still dominates the market. Analysts suggest the next push toward $125,000 could be delayed as investors weigh global macro issues. Weaker U.S. job numbers and fresh tension between the U.S. and China added pressure. Bond yields fell, signaling traders’ move toward safer assets. Some still view Bitcoin as a key hedge, but the current price zone shows how cautious participants have become. Even so, Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation asset, and its pullbacks often open opportunities in promising altcoins. As traders wait for volatility to settle, many now scan the broader market for the best altcoins to buy the dip before the next cycle recovery. Ethereum Price Eyes $4.5K as Market Regains Balance Ethereum’s recovery above $4,100 suggests confidence is returning. The heavy liquidations that hit futures markets on Friday have eased, with funding rates normalizing. Analysts now see Ethereum regaining its footing toward the $4,500 zone if sentiment continues to improve. ETH’s strength lies in its ability to stay resilient during sharp downturns. While many other assets dropped by 60% or more, Ethereum’s correction was softer, proving its deeper market presence. Options data also shows balanced activity, hinting that traders are not betting on heavy downside moves. The broader sentiment now sees Ethereum as one of the best altcoins to buy the dip , given its stability, long-term developer base, and steady institutional demand through ETFs and derivatives markets. As confidence rebuilds, ETH may lead the next leg of recovery. Avalanche (AVAX) Recovery Hints at a Broader Altcoin Turnaround Avalanche has started to show signs of life after one of its sharpest shakeouts in months. AVAX now trades near $22 , with analysts tracking a possible rebound toward $47 . Market watchers highlight its strong on-chain activity and network usage, which remain steady despite the price crash. The Bokcast and other analysts point to a clean structure forming, suggesting AVAX may have already cleared weak hands. Historically, such capitulations often mark macro bottoms. September saw Avalanche’s busiest month in nearly two years, a sign of real activity beyond speculation. As developers continue to build through the market noise, Avalanche’s growing base makes it one of the best altcoins to buy the dip for those looking to position early before the next uptrend. The network’s health, combined with price consolidation, supports the idea of an early accumulation phase underway. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Altcoin Traders Are Watching Closely Amid the market chaos, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown stability rarely seen during broad selloffs. Its price continues to rise steadily every hour with no major pullbacks, making it stand out as a safe haven altcoin in this volatile week. With a smaller market cap under $15 million , it offers room for growth and serves as a useful hedge for traders seeking diversification. The project has confirmed plans for a CEX listing soon , drawing further attention as one of the best altcoins to buy the dip during uncertain times. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s steady pace and community-driven structure make it a good find, agile enough to grow, yet stable enough to trust amid wider price crashes. How Traders Can Position in This Market Short-term fear often creates long-term opportunity. The recent dip has given traders a new chance to reposition in quality altcoins before sentiment flips again. Watching Bitcoin’s next moves remains key, but those who diversify early into names like Ethereum, AVAX, and MAGACOIN FINANCE may be better placed for the next recovery wave.

Cobb’s remarks come at a time when broader market sentiment remains uncertain. Despite recent corrections, XRP has managed to hold above crucial technical support zones, maintaining investor confidence amid volatility. His comments came after an independent analysis by market observer Charting Guy, who examined XRP’s long-term price structure using Fibonacci retracement levels. According to Charting Guy, XRP is currently hovering around the 0.888 Fibonacci retracement level near $2.44. The analyst identified a strong support range between $1.61 and $1.70, a zone that played a key role during XRP’s early 2021 price surge. He described XRP’s market structure as fundamentally sound, dismissing claims that the asset was turning bearish. Instead, he suggested that XRP is consolidating before another upward breakout. The next leg up on XRP will have Bitcoiners genuinely worried about their #1 spot https://t.co/U4damVkK3J — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 14, 2025 If the token manages to move past the $3.31 resistance zone, the next Fibonacci extension targets could position XRP for significant gains. Based on current chart projections, these levels include $8.29, $13.38, and $26.63, indicating potential returns ranging from threefold to elevenfold from current prices. At $2.50, XRP’s price would need a considerable rally to reach those upper targets, but doing so would give the asset an estimated market capitalization of around $1.6 trillion. XRP’s Growth Could Stir the Bitcoin Market Cobb remarked that such a development would likely raise concerns among Bitcoin investors, as a substantial XRP rally could draw capital and attention away from BTC. His comment implied that XRP’s next major move could reignite discussions about which asset leads the crypto market. Currently, Bitcoin retains a commanding lead with a market capitalization exceeding $2.24 trillion. XRP, valued at roughly $149 billion, ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. While XRP briefly reclaimed the third position earlier this year, its market value has since declined, leaving a significant gap between it and Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Long Path Toward Market Leadership Before XRP could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance, it must first overtake several major cryptocurrencies. Binance Coin (BNB) currently leads XRP by roughly $15 billion in market capitalization, while Tether (USDT) sits about $30 billion ahead. Surpassing these assets is feasible based on past performance. XRP previously reached a $210 billion market cap, but the larger obstacle lies in overtaking Ethereum. Ethereum’s current valuation stands near $500 billion, meaning XRP would need to triple in price to around $8 to match it. If Ethereum continues to rise, this gap would expand further. While Cobb remains confident in XRP’s long-term potential, other analysts such as Charting Guy have voiced caution, acknowledging Ethereum’s own strong technical structure and positive outlook. In theory, for XRP to surpass Bitcoin’s market value, it would need to appreciate by approximately 1,397%, reaching a price near $38, assuming Bitcoin’s value remains unchanged. This represents a substantial challenge in both the short and medium term. Although the idea of XRP surpassing Bitcoin remains speculative, many in the XRP community continue to view it as a long-term possibility. Some projections suggest that if market conditions align, XRP could achieve this by 2030. However, others predict that Bitcoin may rise to $1 million by then, further extending its lead. For now, XRP’s focus remains on sustaining its bullish structure and reclaiming higher resistance levels. Whether it can eventually compete with Bitcoin’s dominance will depend on how the market evolves in the coming years.

Dogecoin Set For Takeoff As Wave 3 Kicks In Sharing a weekly chart, the analyst wrote: “Initially I thought DOGE wave 2 retraced to 0.5 of wave 1, which is valid, but it decided to get to 0.382 which is also possible for a wave 2 retracement. Now it’s reclaiming 0.618 and wave 3 could be starting… and wave 3 is the most bullish and most powerful of them all.” The chart posted by Cantonese Cat applies a Fibonacci grid to Dogecoin’s 2022–December 2024 advance (“Wave 1” on the graphic), with the 0.618 retracement anchored around ~$0.20088 on the weekly timeframe and the mid-range levels marked at 0.5 (~$0.15350) and 0.382 (~$0.11729). On the left axis, historical weekly candles show DOGE’s earlier cycle blow-off followed by a lengthy basing period near the ~$0.05–$0.10 zone (the 0.0 line sits at ~$0.04909), from which the advance began in mid-2022. Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation’s House Of Doge Announces NASDAQ Listing Elliott Wave analysis proposes that markets trend in a five-wave impulse where the third wave is typically the strongest by both breadth and momentum. Within that framework, a “Wave 2” pullback frequently terminates in the 0.382–0.618 retracement band of Wave 1, while a decisive reclaim of the 0.618 level on higher timeframes is often treated by technicians as a structural pivot back in favor of the prevailing uptrend. The chart Cantonese Cat shared labels the recent decline as “Wave 2,” with wicks probing toward the 0.382 band and subsequent weekly closes gravitating back toward the 0.618 level. The current weekly candle plotted on the image sits almost exactly on that 0.618 line, indicating the market is testing whether buyers can convert it into support. Related Reading: Elon Musk Mentions Dogecoin Again — Is The Meme Coin About To Rally? The analyst’s emphasis on the 0.618 reclaim is consistent with how many systematic traders translate Fibonacci confluence into risk frameworks: closes and acceptance above the golden-ratio band raise the probability that the prior impulse has resumed, whereas sustained rejection there often keeps a market locked in a range. DOGE Price Targets The chart also visualizes potential topside waypoints should momentum expand. The Fibonacci projections drawn beyond the “Wave 1” peak display the 1.0 band at roughly $0.48 and classical extensions at 1.272 (~$0.89), 1.414 (~$1.23), and 1.618 (~$1.96). Elliott practitioners frequently monitor these zones for acceleration targets or distribution risk if a third wave unfolds. For now, the operative claim is straightforward and testable on chart: “Now it’s reclaiming 0.618 and wave 3 could be starting,” with the reminder that “wave 3 is the most bullish and most powerful of them all.” Whether price can hold above the ~$0.20088 pivot into weekly close and then demonstrate impulsive breadth—rising range, expanding volume, and leadership versus peers—will determine if this setup matures into the kind of third-wave advance Elliott theorists anticipate or fades back into consolidation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.20.

Erik Thedéen, the chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and governor of Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, said that regulators are currently focused on stablecoins. Other central bankers also stated that they were closely monitoring developments related to these so-called stablecoins, which are digital tokens linked to traditional currencies such as the dollar or euro, providing one-to-one value. Thedéen said at a conference in Washington on Wednesday, during the IMF meetings, that the Basel Committee could revise its current crypto capital framework, given the significant changes in the digital asset landscape since 2022. Basel considers rule review amid stablecoin boom When, in 2022, the Basel Committee wrote its crypto capital rules, stablecoins were new. But policymakers at the time were more concerned about volatile assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, since then, stablecoins have experienced a surge in use and value — tokens like Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC), for example, now facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of transactions every day worldwide. Under the current regime, most stablecoins are considered highly risky crypto assets, and banks must maintain equal amounts of capital against them as they would against much more volatile cryptocurrencies. Thedéen admitted that this blanket approach may no longer be suitable for today’s evolving market, as newer stablecoins are increasingly backed by liquid assets such as short-term US Treasuries. The new capital rules, which were set to take effect in 2026, would have made it far more expensive for banks to dabble in crypto assets. The finance industry has stated that such treatment is excessively punitive and stifles innovation, especially at a time when several global banks have been experimenting with issuing their own stablecoins, which are pegged to major currencies, including the US dollar, the euro, and the yen. Thedéen emphasized that any revision of the rules would undergo a very thorough process involving all Basel member states. He noted that some members had already adopted parts of the package, suggesting that any amendments would require broad consensus. The Basel Committee’s latest signal comes as regulators worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing the stablecoin industry. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) had just cautioned that the widespread use of stablecoins could increase risks to the financial system , particularly if the tokens were to be used in payments and credit. The Systemic Risk Board, for its part, suggested that banks or shadow lenders could hold stablecoins issued in multiple countries to a range of users from across the world. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also urged closer supervision to close any regulatory gaps. In the United States, Congress passed the Stablecoin Act, establishing national standards for stablecoin issuers. The Act ensures that issuers maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets and provide clear redemption rights to holders. The Bank of England has just indicated that it will only lift its proposed cap on stablecoin payments when it is certain that there can be no impact whatsoever on financial stability as a result of this technology. Banks push back against punitive capital charges Key banks and trade associations, such as the GFMA, have warned the Basel Committee against delaying or reconsidering its forthcoming crypto framework. They state the market has advanced beyond 2022, with better governance, transparency, and collateralisation for the majority of top stablecoins. The GFMA stated in an August letter to the committee that the proposed rules could make it increasingly uneconomical for regulated UK financial institutions to offer cryptoasset custody and payment services. The group further urged the committee to adopt data-driven adjustments that would better reflect the reduced risk profile of stablecoin issuers with strong performance records.

53203202,606615,1760578252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53203202.jpeg,Tether And Circle Mint $4.5B In Stablecoins Since The Market Crash – Recovery Fuel?,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-circle-mint-stablecoins-since-market-crash/,"Tether (USDT) is back in the spotlight after minting another $1 billion in new tokens — just days after issuing $2 billion earlier this week. The timing has drawn attention from analysts and traders alike, as the market continues to recover from one of the sharpest sell-offs of the year. With Bitcoin struggling to hold above the $110K region and altcoins showing weak follow-through, Tether’s sudden burst of activity is being closely watched as a potential signal of renewed liquidity or strategic repositioning. This latest mint pushes Tether’s total new issuance to $3 billion in under a week, reinforcing its dominant position in the stablecoin market. During the sell-off, Tether dominance spiked to 5.5%, its highest level since April, reflecting a surge in demand for stable liquidity as traders fled risk assets. Since then, dominance has cooled slightly to 4.7%, but the stablecoin giant’s activity continues to draw intense scrutiny. While Tether mints don’t always translate into immediate inflows to crypto assets, they often hint at growing sidelined capital preparing to re-enter the market . Whether this surge in issuance reflects institutional demand, exchange liquidity provisioning, or broader market preparation for a rebound remains to be seen — but the timing is far from random. Stablecoin Issuance Surges After Market Crash According to data shared by Lookonchain, Tether and Circle have minted a combined $4.5 billion in stablecoins following last Friday’s market crash. The report reveals that Tether issued $3 billion USDT, while Circle minted $1.5 billion USDC, highlighting that liquidity is quietly rebuilding even as prices remain unstable. Lookonchain notes that Circle has minted 250 million USDC six times since the crash, each within short intervals, underscoring strong and consistent demand for dollar-backed assets. These minting events — often used to meet institutional or exchange-level liquidity needs — suggest that large players are positioning capital in anticipation of potential volatility or future accumulation opportunities. The timing is significant. The crypto market remains in a delicate and fearful phase, with Bitcoin consolidating around the $112K level after its sharp decline to $103K. Altcoins continue to trade at heavy discounts, and sentiment across social and on-chain indicators remains cautious. Yet, historically, such spikes in stablecoin issuance tend to precede aggressive market moves, as sidelined liquidity eventually flows back into risk assets once confidence begins to return. In this context, the surge in Tether and Circle’s minting could signal that institutional money is quietly preparing for a turnaround. While fear continues to dominate short-term price action, stablecoin activity suggests that deep-pocketed players are positioning for what could become the next major phase of recovery. USDT Dominance Spikes, But A Key Level Could Signal Recovery The chart shows USDT dominance rebounding to 4.78%, reflecting a cautious market still leaning toward stablecoins after last week’s sharp sell-off. During Friday’s crash, Tether dominance briefly spiked to 5.5%, its highest since April, as investors sought safety amid panic. While the ratio has since cooled, it remains elevated — a sign that traders are still hesitant to rotate back into Bitcoin and altcoins. Technically, dominance is now sitting above key moving averages, showing short-term strength for stable liquidity. However, analysts are watching a critical level at 3.96%. Historically, when USDT dominance falls below 3.96%, it signals that capital is flowing back into risk assets — often marking the early stages of altcoin recoveries. If dominance fails to sustain above 4.5% and trends downward, it could indicate that investors are beginning to redeploy capital into the broader crypto market. Combined with the recent $4.5 billion in new stablecoin issuance from Tether and Circle, the setup suggests that while fear still dominates sentiment, liquidity is quietly building on the sidelines — ready to re-enter once confidence returns. A sustained drop below 3.96% would therefore be a bullish signal for altcoins and a potential turning point for the market.

The platform has reaffirmed the sole official appeal channels for lifting withdrawal limits and, importantly, launched a new anti-fraud reporting mailbox . The initiative targets scams in which fraudsters impersonate HTX staff and demand illegitimate fees under the pretext of “unfreezing withdrawal limits”. This move marks a critical step in HTX’s evolving strategy toward user security education and systemic fraud prevention. Targeted Fraud Prevention: Official Channels as a Firewall In the crypto asset space, scams that exploit user anxiety—especially those involving fake “asset unfreezing” services—are alarmingly frequent. HTX’s announcement draws a clear boundary: the only valid methods to appeal withdrawal restrictions are via the platform’s in-app Help Center system and the official customer service email ( htxsupport@htx-inc.com ). The service is completely free of charge . Any attempt to bypass these channels, collect fees, or impersonate HTX staff is considered fraud. To combat such activities, HTX has also introduced a new reporting email: ia@htx-inc.com . Users who encounter impersonators or suspicious actors claiming to represent HTX are encouraged to report them. Once a case is verified, the platform will take strict enforcement actions and assist in recovering any associated funds. By designating these trusted channels —bound email and in-app support—HTX is cutting off fraudsters at the source. This simplifies the appeal process for users while neutralizing external attempts to exploit confusion or misinformation. From Process Control to Systemic Security: Building a Trust-Based Safety Framework As a globally recognized digital asset platform, HTX adheres to a “user-first, security-driven” philosophy. This latest update is more than a procedural clarification; it represents a shift from isolated defense tactics to a comprehensive anti-fraud system . On one hand, HTX has proactively integrated the sensitive issue of “withdrawal limits” into its broader risk control framework, presenting it as a protective mechanism rather than a punitive one. With a guaranteed 24-hour response time and real-time case tracking , users now benefit from a service experience defined by transparency and trust. On the other, by reiterating that all appeal-related services are completely free and by introducing an official reporting mechanism , HTX is encouraging its users to become active participants in fraud detection. This creates a shared ecosystem of platform-user co-governance , forming a more resilient and collaborative defense line against scams. Industry Implications: Fraud Prevention as a Shared Responsibility As crypto adoption expands, scam tactics are evolving—especially those exploiting “frozen funds” narratives. HTX’s proactive stance—clarifying its official processes and launching a fraud reporting channel—signals a paradigm shift: from reactive to preventative, from siloed to systemic. This model provides a valuable blueprint for the broader industry. Effective anti-fraud strategies are not just technological, but ethical and collaborative. Platforms must set clear policies, empower users, and act decisively against bad actors. Only through such unified efforts can the space maintain its integrity and ensure user confidence. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to strengthen its identity verification systems and behavioral risk controls, while collaborating with global regulators, industry partners, and cybersecurity firms to build a safer, more transparent crypto ecosystem.

Trump made the statement after days of rising tension following his threat to impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports. A reporter asked Trump if the U.S. was preparing for a trade war with China, to which he answered, “Well, we’re in one now.” He emphasized that the tariffs are America’s main tool of defense against unfair trade practices. His remarks mark the first official acknowledgment from the administration that trade hostilities with China have fully reignited. Trump defends tariffs and says they protect America President Donald Trump said, “If we didn’t have tariffs, we would have no defense.” He argued that the tariffs stop foreign nations like China from flooding the U.S. market with cheap goods and controlling critical industries that America depends on. Just last week, the President posted on social media, stating that he would impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports. His announcement triggered fear across global markets, as Bitcoin prices dropped quickly from around $121,560 to below $103,000 within a few hours. Traders and analysts said the sudden drop shows just how sensitive the market is to signs of rising tension between the world’s two largest economies. The reaction also reminds people just how much power Trump’s words still carry. People who support these trade policies argue that the tariffs will prompt companies to reconsider relocating production outside the United States and make trade more equitable. They also argue that the tariffs will push businesses to make goods locally, even if that means paying more in the short term, which will help the country become more self-reliant. On the other hand, critics argue that the tariffs will increase prices for everyday goods, including electronics, clothing, and machinery. They also warn that American farmers and exporters could lose access to key markets if China responds with its own tariffs. The markets did not crash as many people had expected following Trump’s announcements, and prices even began to stabilize after an initial shock. U.S. stock futures remained mostly steady, and Bitcoin prices increased by about 0.1% over the next few hours. Experts say this indicates that investors no longer panic as quickly as they did before, because they have grown accustomed to Trump’s strong language regarding China. A few analysts think Trump’s approach is a deliberate strategy to put more pressure on China and gain the upper hand before trade talks between the two governments. Bessent criticizes China’s “disappointing actions” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke on Wednesday and criticized what he called China’s “disappointing actions” in trade and resource control. He said the Chinese government is making choices that could slow down the entire global economy and cause serious harm to China’s own industries and workers at the same time. “If some in the Chinese government want to slow down the global economy through disappointing actions and economic coercion, the Chinese economy will be hurt the most,” Bessent said in his statement. Bessent said that China’s restrictions on exports, such as rare earth minerals, will disrupt global supply chains and make it difficult for companies everywhere to plan their production. The Treasury Secretary stated that these restrictions create fear and uncertainty, which will ultimately prompt companies to relocate their supply chains away from China. In the long run, this will reduce China’s influence and slow down its economic growth. Bessent said that China’s approach to trade is damaging its relationships with other countries. He explained that the U.S. and its allies have been working with Beijing for many years to encourage open trade and shared progress that would benefit everyone. However, countries are beginning to see China as a threat to stability because its actions make it difficult to maintain trust. “This is China versus the world,” Bessent said firmly, adding that “we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled by a group of bureaucrats in Beijing.” Bessent said that Washington is helping its allies establish new production centers and identify new sources of raw materials, thereby reducing their dependence on any single country.

This statement was made after Kent, who oversees the RBA’s engagement with financial markets, noted that narrower loan spreads and households making extra mortgage repayments amid lower interest rates signal improving conditions. Meanwhile, apart from the above considerations, analysts have also highlighted an increase in credit growth driven by escalating demand for housing. Moreover, stiff competition among lenders and reduced funding costs have inspired businesses to borrow more. Australia’s central bank anticipates a balanced economy amid lessened financial conditions While addressing the CFA Society Australia in Sydney, Kent mentioned that the RBA’s predictions suggest that the toughness of financial conditions has reduced, thus establishing a balanced economy in the future. This includes full employment and inflation approaching the center of their target range, said the assistant governor. Notably, the RBA wants to maintain an inflation range between 2% and 3%. Kent’s remarks came a day after his colleague, Sarah Hunter, forecasted that the country’s underlying inflation for the three months ending in September will probably be stronger than what the RBA had earlier predicted. This indicated a slightly tougher stance. In the meantime, Hunter and Kent’s statements collectively demonstrate the central bank’s belief that recent policy changes, particularly the three interest rate cuts this year and the improvement in credit conditions, are helping the economy stabilize after a tough period of tightening. Concerning the situation, several officials have weighed in on the topic of discussion. Based on their argument, this aligns with inflation gradually returning to its target. However, they warned of the uncertainties ahead as they await the review of the final price report for the third quarter. On November 3-4, the monetary policy board is scheduled to hold a meeting. Regarding this meeting, economists have predicted that a cut would be imposed on the benchmark rate. Traders, on the other hand, speculate that the decision will go either way. September’s employment data, which will be published in a few hours, is crucial in this decision. Kent illustrates the estimates of financial status in the current market conditions Kent cautioned that the outlook in the future will depend on how new figures impact views of economic growth, inflation, and potential risks. Meanwhile, the assistant governor mentioned that the RBA prefers the use of various methods to assess financial conditions because of the uncertainties involved. An example of these methods is to compare the cash rate with estimates of the nominal neutral rate. According to Kent, model-based estimates suggest that financial conditions have been strict, which helps reduce overall demand. While he does not specify a number, the assistant governor highlighted that the cash rate is expected to decline within a wider range, given the current market conditions. “The estimates of the neutral rate match with several indicators of financial conditions,” he said. “In fact, various indicators – including mortgage payments and housing credit growth – have already started to display early signs of responding to this year’s easing in financial conditions.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|RBA,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-16 01:57:51

That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 14, 2025 Tesla’s Past Moves And Holdings Based on reports, Tesla bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in early 2021 and said it would take the coin as payment for cars. But the deal was short-lived. The company soon stopped accepting Bitcoin because of concerns about mining’s heavy energy use and said it might resume payments only after a major move toward renewable mining practices. By mid-2022, Tesla sold about 75% of its holdings, a move that happened near a market low and drew wide notice. According to Arkham Intelligence, Tesla still holds roughly 11,509 BTC, which is worth about $1.25 billion at current prices. What The Market Might Be Watching Traders read signals. A single public endorsement from a high-profile executive used to move prices more. That was the case in 2021 when Tesla’s investment and payment plan helped lift sentiment.

BTC is now consolidating and might start another decline below $110,000. Bitcoin started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $114,000 resistance level. The price is trading below $113,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $112,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it trades below the $110,200 zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Hurdles Bitcoin price started a recovery wave above the $112,500 resistance level. BTC recovered above the $112,800 and $113,000 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $115,975 swing high to the $110,000 low. The bulls even pushed the price above the $113,500 resistance level. However, there are many hurdles on the upside. Bitcoin is now trading below $113,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $112,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $112,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $113,000 level. The next resistance could be $113,700 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $115,975 swing high to the $110,000 low. A close above the $113,700 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $114,500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $115,250 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $115,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $113,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support is near the $110,200 level. The first major support is near the $110,000 level. The next support is now near the $109,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $108,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $107,200, below which BTC might struggle to recover in the short term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $110,200, followed by $110,000.

The U.S. Department of Justice described the case as ‘first of its kind’ due to the complex nature of the scam. The two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, are facing conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering charges for allegedly exploiting the Ethereum blockchain’s transaction validation process in 2023. According to the prosecutors, the brothers used their advanced technical skills in the blockchain network to manipulate pending trades on the network. The brothers took away $25 million in Ethereum tokens in just 12 seconds. Ethereum ‘Exploit’ case puts blockchain integrity under legal scrutiny According to a release by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Peraire-Bueno brothers, who studied computer science and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, allegedly used their special skills in blockchain technology to compromise the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain. The two brothers have pleaded not guilty and are currently free on a $250,000 bail each. The trial sought an educated Jury panel, half of which holds a master’s degree in several areas of study, including finance and medicine. U.S. District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke led the first trial. The education levels of the selected Jury reflect the complex technical nature of the case that they will have to evaluate. Prosecutors in the case will have to provide evidence showing that the two brothers studied the trading patterns of their victims before carrying out the code-based attack, which involved intercepting and rerouting pending Ethereum transactions. “Unfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for DOJ prosecutors and IRS agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme,” – Lisa Monaco , Deputy Attorney General The court filings revealed that the operation dubbed ‘the Exploit’ was meticulously planned over several months and carried out in seconds. They added that the two brothers analyzed blockchain data for several months, created shell companies, and created multiple wallets with foreign exchange accounts to conceal the proceeds. Prosecutors of the Exploit revealed that before and after the April 2023 incident, the two brothers conducted online searches for ‘how to wash crypto’, ‘fraudulent Ethereum addresses database’, and ‘money laundering statute of limitations’. They added that once the funds had been stolen, the two accused washed them through a network of transactions to hide the original wallet. Prosecutors say ‘Exploit’ case is key to safeguarding blockchain integrity Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described the alleged scheme as novel and has never been charged before. He acknowledged that, regardless of the sophisticated nature of the case, the Justice system will relentlessly pursue those who attack the financial system’s integrity. The defense attorneys argued that the prosecution mischaracterized the nature of the alleged attack. They stated that the brothers simply exploited flaws in the blockchain network. They added that the accused only exploited the predatory nature of automated trading bots in the decentralized ecosystem. The defense also argued that there were no direct interactions between the defendants and the alleged victims. Following the defense attorneys’ remarks, Judge Clarke barred them from making their claim based on the notion that the victims deserved the losses or from introducing expert testimony on the lack of crypto regulation. The move to bar the defense has created a setback for the defense’s legal strategy amid the trial, which is expected to continue into early November. If convicted, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno face up to 20 years in prison on each count. Prosecutors insist that safeguarding the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain is essential to maintaining investor confidence in decentralized ecosystems. Cryptopolitan reported last month on another sophisticated crime in which hackers hid malware inside Ethereum smart contracts. ReversingLabs’ research uncovered a malware campaign that used Ethereum smart contracts to conceal malicious software URLs. The findings revealed that the hackers used the npm packages colortoolv2 and mimelib2, which acted as downloaders.

The firm also revealed that it is working to add support for additional networks and ecosystems, aiming to provide its users with the best inventory of assets. It’s the first time Coinbase has signaled support for the native token of Binance’s ecosystem flagship asset, BNB. The firm added the digital asset and assured users that trading will commence once market-making support and sufficient technical infrastructure are established. Coinbase launches BNB perpetual futures on its platform Assets added to the roadmap today: BNB (BNB) https://t.co/lyEugQo7Cv — Coinbase Markets 🛡️ (@CoinbaseMarkets) October 15, 2025 Coinbase’s interest in BNB started on April 3, when Coinbase Advanced began supporting BNB perpetual futures. The firm argued that introducing BNB perpetual futures trading on its international platforms presents new opportunities for traders. The initiative enabled Coinbase users to access perpetual futures contracts, a type of derivative that doesn’t have an expiration date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. The listing of BNB perpetual futures on the platform enables traders to take larger positions with borrowed funds, thereby amplifying their gains and losses. Binance co-founder, Changpeng Zhao, said the introduction of BNB perpetual futures on Coinbase enhances the network’s accessibility and credibility. The initiative allowed Coinbase to expand its derivatives market and position itself as a competitor to leading exchanges like Binance, which already offer BNB futures. The initiative was launched on Coinbase International Exchange for non-U.S. users and on Coinbase Advanced for experienced traders. CZ responded to the news, stating that BNB’s growth occurs naturally, although increased trading activity on major exchanges may lead to higher liquidity. The crypto exchange is also planning to list other digital assets, including Bitcoin Hyper, Maxi Doge, PEPENODE, and Snorter Bot. Barron’s research revealed that new listings on Coinbase average 91% gains in the first five days. At the time of publication, BNB is exchanging hands at around $1,168, down nearly 4.3% in the last 24 hours. The digital asset has also dropped by more than 11% in the last 7 days, but is up 27.1% in the last four weeks. CEXs charge nearly 16% for new crypto listings The new BNB listing on Coinbase comes as Binance refuted claims on Tuesday that it profits from its token listing process. The exchange’s remark was in response to CJ Hetherington, CEO of Limitless Labs, who made the claim. Hetherington alleged on Tuesday that Binance receives a 1% airdrop on the day of listings and a further 3% airdrop six months after listings. He also revealed that the exchange requires a 1% marketing fee at its discretion and a $250,000 security deposit before any listing. Hetherington also said Binance requested 3%, which is reserved for the BNB HODLer programme. According to the announcement, the exchange also requires a $2 million BNB security deposit for spot listings. He made the remarks despite Limitless receiving backing from Coinbase Ventures as well as the Base Ecosystem Fund. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , Binance responded to the founder’s claims, stating that they’re false and discriminatory and that the exchange reserves the right to pursue legal action. The exchange also stated that it was surprised by CJ’s unauthorized disclosure of confidential communications with Binance. The firm acknowledged that CJ’s publications damaged the integrity of what the industry and community understand, arguing that he clearly understood and knew to be sensitive and confidential information. Binance assured its users that it doesn’t charge any listing fees. The firm also revealed that any cash and token security deposits are typically refundable within a 1-2 year period. However, the co-founder of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, previously stated that Binance charges a listing fee of up to 8% of the total token supply. He also revealed that the centralized exchange requires projects to purchase and stake BNB, which is equivalent to around $5 million. Hayes added that Binance requires projects to distribute 8% of their token supply to Binance users through airdrops and other activities. He also said listings on Binance cost around 16% of a token’s supply and $5 million in BNB purchases. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The approval, announced Wednesday, marks the first de novo bank to receive national authorization under Comptroller Jonathan Gould, according to the Financial Times. Erebor Bank, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, filed its application on June 11, and its approval follows a four-month regulatory review. The OCC granted preliminary conditional approval to Erebor Bank after thorough review of its application. In granting this charter, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all charter applications. https://t.co/9G7WkRRohN pic.twitter.com/tQhLqNbtM9 — OCC (@USOCC) October 15, 2025 “I am committed to a dynamic and diverse federal banking system, and our decision today is a first but important step in living up to that commitment,” Gould said. Gould’s accompanying remarks indicated a notable shift from the regulator’s previous restrictive look: the OCC “does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities.” That statement shows one of the clearest indications yet that U.S. banking regulators may be reconsidering their restrictive stance toward crypto-linked financial services, which was further exacerbated by the 2023 collapses of several crypto banks. Analysts view the OCC’s decision as a watershed moment for the industry, a sign that Washington is ready to experiment with responsible crypto banking, provided institutions can demonstrate robust compliance and risk controls. If Erebor secures full authorization, it could become a test case for how regulators manage digital asset exposure within federally chartered banks and a potential model for others seeking to bridge the gap between traditional banking and digital finance. The question now shifts to what Erebor will offer. After SVB’s Fall, Erebor Bank Steps In to Serve Tech and Crypto Businesses In the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s dramatic collapse in 2023, which sent shockwaves through the startup and venture capital ecosystem, Erebor Bank is emerging as a deliberate attempt to fill the vacuum left in the financing of America’s economy. Erebor seeks to serve clients in high-growth , high-tech sectors, including artificial intelligence, defense, manufacturing, and digital assets, as well as payment processors, venture funds, and trading firms. The bank’s charter aims to operate as a full-service national bank, offering both traditional deposit and lending services, while integrating digital asset operations under a tightly regulated framework. Peter Thiel @peterthiel joins tech billionaires in backing Erebor, a new US bank set to fill the funding gap left by Silicon Valley Bank’s 2023 collapse. #Erebor #PeterThiel https://t.co/x4NarhsPGz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 2, 2025 According to its filings, Erebor expects to hold approximately $1 million in cryptocurrency for transactional purposes, indicating limited but deliberate exposure to digital assets. Unlike the risk-heavy approach that defined some of its predecessors, Erebor’s model aims for conservatism and compliance. A source close to the company told the Financial Times that Erebor aims to be “a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk.” The fall of SVB, along with Silvergate, Signature Bank, and First Republic , had left tech startups and crypto firms struggling to find stable banking partners. This disruption forced many to seek offshore or non-traditional solutions , a gap Erebor now seeks to fill with institutional discipline and Silicon Valley know-how. Still, Erebor is not fully operational yet. The OCC’s conditional approval means the institution must complete a series of compliance, cybersecurity, and capital adequacy reviews, a process that could take several months, before receiving a final charter. How Erebor’s Approval Reflects Washington’s Crypto Policy Pivot Erebor’s approval comes amid broader regulatory momentum in Washington. President Donald Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act , a landmark bill establishing oversight rules for stablecoin issuers, while Congress continues to debate broader crypto market structure legislation and limits on a central bank digital currency (CBDC). @SECGov Chair Paul Atkins has reaffirmed support for a crypto market structure bill as the White House expects the bill to pass by year-end 2025. #Bitcoin #Marketstructure #SEC https://t.co/cBbLNtKeS9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 The new policy climate has encouraged several crypto-linked firms, including Coinbase, Circle, and Ripple, to pursue national trust or banking charters with the OCC. In May, the OCC issued updated guidance confirming that banks may buy and sell cryptocurrencies held in custody at the direction of customers, an important reversal of prior restrictions. @Coinbase has filed an application with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a National Trust Company Charter. #Coinbase #Crypto https://t.co/WruBToItQd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 4, 2025 The policy also allows institutions to outsource crypto custody and execution to third parties, provided they meet strict safety and soundness standards. The clarification marked a clear shift toward integrating crypto activities within federally regulated banks. Gould’s appointment in June reinforced that direction. The former Bitfury executive and OCC veteran was confirmed by the Senate in a narrow 50–45 vote , becoming the agency’s first permanent chief since 2020. The US Senate has confirmed former crypto exec Jonathan Gould as OCC chief in a 50–45 vote, naming him the first permanent head since 2020. #OCC #JonathanGould https://t.co/ipM7YhaG8B — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 11, 2025 His background in blockchain and digital assets has shaped a more open stance toward innovation in banking. Under his leadership, the OCC has already removed references to “reputation risk” in its internal guidance, a change viewed as reducing barriers for banks engaging in crypto-related service s. Despite the shift, some lawmakers have voiced concerns about the growing ties between politics and cryptocurrency. In August, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Ron Wyden urged Gould to investigate potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump’s personal involvement in crypto ventures, particularly a stablecoin called USD1 issued by World Liberty Financial. The senators questioned whether the OCC could maintain impartial oversight as it becomes the primary regulator for stablecoins under the GENIUS Act.

A $1.3 billion LuBian-linked wallet transfer followed the DOJ’s $15 billion crypto seizure, while a proposed $9.3 trillion 401(k) bill could drive institutional inflows.

Analysts say even a small allocation toward digital assets could channel billions into the crypto market. The proposal has fueled optimism across the industry, with investors viewing it as a pivotal step toward mainstream adoption and a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s next major price surge. Crypto and NFT Markets Rebound After $1.2B Crash The crypto market rebounded sharply after Friday’s $1.2 billion selloff, with NFTs recovering from a steep drop. According to CoinGecko, total NFT market value fell from $6.2 billion to $5 billion before stabilizing near $5.5 billion as Bitcoin and altcoins regained footing. Top Ethereum-based collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks saw mild losses, while others such as Mutant Ape Yacht Club began climbing again. Bitcoin also bounced back after briefly dipping amid market panic over Trump’s tariff comments. Investors invested $3.17 billion into cryptocurrency funds in spite of the enormous liquidations, indicating a growing confidence in digital assets. Despite heavy liquidations, crypto funds saw $3.17 billion in new inflows, signaling investor confidence in digital assets. Analysts say the swift recovery highlights resilience across NFTs and crypto, reinforcing optimism for sustained growth as market sentiment stabilizes. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Triple-Bottom Pattern Eyes $130,000 Breakout Zone Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is forming a strong triple-bottom pattern near $109,600, a key level that has triggered multiple reversals since late September. The setup signals easing selling pressure and growing accumulation, with higher lows forming along the neckline. On the two-hour chart, BTC trades below the 100-period SMMA at $116,054, aligning with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $116,108, creating a decisive resistance zone before a breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI at 43 is curving upward from oversold levels, suggesting early bullish divergence and improving momentum. A confirmed close above $114,600 would validate the triple-bottom pattern and likely accelerate buying activity. While Bitcoin remains within a descending channel, TradingView’s path projection signals a breakout toward $117,600 and $119,800 if momentum strengthens. A sustained move above $120,000 could flip market sentiment bullish, opening targets at $125,000 and $130,000. Traders may look for long setups above $114,600, with stop-losses under $109,500 and initial targets at $117,600–$119,800. As institutional inflows build and volatility compresses, Bitcoin’s current consolidation could mark the base for its next upward phase, potentially defining the start of a stronger Q4 rally.

ETH has reclaimed support above $4.5K on large aggregate purchases, indicating further price appreciation with technical momentum pointing towards $7,000 and beyond by the end of 2025. In ETFs, inflows and staking-enabled products continue to flow into the market. Over $1 billion of stablecoins flowing in daily keeps the price buoyant for now. Whales’ coordinated activity indicates institutional-level confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals. Such accumulation satisfies the anticipations for Q4, namely that Ethereum will be a focal point for market rotations. This will create opportunities for altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE to attract early-stage investors. Solana Poised for ETF-Driven Upside As Solana’s price fluctuates between $218 and $230, the ecosystem is gaining renewed interest. The upgrade to Firedancer will increase the scalability of the Solana network, which can support one million transactions per second. This should be enough to instil confidence among the institutional validator. Solana ETF Tracker: theblock Approval from the SEC for multiple Solana ETF filings and $310 million in inflows has served to renew bullish sentiment. Traders in whale are taking leveraged long positions, expecting a breakout above $250. The strong DeFi and NFT activity on Solana’s chain enhances its institutional appeal, making it an ideal platform for early development investments, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE.

According to analysts, post listing the returns may range from 75x, with some scenarios pointing to an even greater upside in Q4 2025. Conclusion Cryptocurrency investors are looking at October 2025 as a crucial time. Ethereum whales and Solana setup indicate strong institutional confidence amid possible ETF approval that can provide huge upside. Experts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s successful Hashex audit and ongoing verification on Certik as major proof of reliability, reinforcing investor trust in its presale model.

Related Reading: Why This Resistance Could Trigger Another XRP Price Crash Soon Before stabilizing around $4,100, the second-largest cryptocurrency briefly dipped below $4,000 this week, but several analysts argue the pullback places ETH in a key “buy zone” ahead of a potential push toward new highs. ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Fidelity Steps In as ETFs See Redemptions Fidelity’s reported buy spotlights a growing trend as traditional finance is steadily increasing exposure to Ethereum’s smart-contract ecosystem, staking yields, and tokenization upside. The move contrasts with the latest ETF flow picture, where spot ETH products saw about $428 million in outflows in a single day, led by $310 million from BlackRock’s fund. While redemptions weighed on price near term, primary-market creations like Fidelity’s purchase can tighten available supply and stabilize spot liquidity. Outflows and Liquidations Test Nerves Macro jitters and tariff headlines helped trigger a sharp selloff, sending ETH down 6.5% on Oct. 14 and sparking $145 million in liquidations in 24 hours, per derivatives trackers. That forced unwinding pushed price through the $4,000 handle, but technicians note ETH is retesting prior resistance-turned-support and still carving a bullish flag structure on higher time frames. Popular trader Michael van de Poppe argues ETH likely just needs a higher low to reassert momentum, eyeing a recovery toward $5,000 first and then $6,250 if buyers reclaim control. Ethereum Price Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Near term, bulls want to see an Ethereum price balance back above $4,000–$4,211, followed by a decisive break of the $5,000 psychological level to unlock the $6,250 target many chartists flag via tools like Murrey Math and measured-move projections. On the downside, traders are watching $3,626 as interim support; a daily close below $3,425 would dent the bullish structure and argue for deeper consolidation. Despite headline outflows, the Fidelity inflow highlights sticky institutional interest in Ethereum’s role across DeFi, NFTs, and real-world asset tokenization, plus the structural tailwind from staking yields.

ETH is now consolidating in a range and might decline sharply if there is a move below $3,880. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $4,000 and $4,020 levels. The price is trading below $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it trades above $4,075. Ethereum Price Dips To Support Ethereum price struggled to settle above $4,200 and corrected most gains, like Bitcoin . ETH price declined below the $4,050 and $4,000 levels. It even tested the $3,940 zone. A low was formed at $3,932 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,216 swing high to the $3,932 low. Besides, there is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,075 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,150 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,216 swing high to the $3,932 low. The first major resistance is near the $4,200 level. A clear move above the $4,200 resistance might send the price toward the $4,250 resistance. An upside break above the $4,250 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,350 resistance zone or even $4,420 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,150 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,950 level and the triangle’s trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,880 zone. A clear move below the $3,880 support might push the price toward the $3,820 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,750 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,640.

Blockchain records visible on Etherscan confirmed the flurry of minting and burning transactions, exposing a rare but dramatic “fat-finger” error in the reportedly tightly controlled world of stablecoin issuance. The transactions revealed that the firm had accidentally added six extra zeros during minting. Within minutes, Paxos destroyed the incorrectly issued $300 trillion PYUSD and re-minted the correct amount of $300m instead. Paxos( @Paxos ) accidentally minted 300T $PYUSD 7 hours ago — they added six extra zeros by mistake! The error was quickly corrected as they burned the 300T $PYUSD and properly re-minted 300M $PYUSD instead. https://t.co/RJeWtSnW9R pic.twitter.com/ktQQ88RfHw — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 16, 2025 Stablecoin Issuers Have Faced Similar Minting Mishaps Before Such mistakes are not rare in crypto. Often, token transfers sent to the wrong address cannot be reversed. However, stablecoin issuers have more control. They can step in to correct errors, such as by returning or burning tokens created by mistake. Paxos’s blunder echoes past industry slipups. In 2019, Tether mistakenly issued about $5b in USDT and later burned the overage. In May 2021, BlockFi accidentally credited users with vast amounts of Bitcoin instead of a promotional stablecoin, forcing complicated reversals. And in Dec. 2022, a DeversiFi upgrade glitch triggered a $23.7m Ethereum gas payout, which developers mostly recovered with community support. Stablecoins Tighten Grip On Crypto Ecosystem These incidents show how fragile crypto’s plumbing can be, especially when automated systems handle large-scale transactions. As of mid-October 2025, the stablecoin sector’s market cap stood near $306.18b, up about 47% year to date. The growth leans heavily on major players like Tether’s USDT (holding around 59% market share) and Circle’s USDC. PayPal USD (PYUSD), though smaller, commands attention. As of Oct. 2025, its market cap is about $2.32b, matching its token supply of 2.32b, with trading prices tightly anchored near $0.9997.

Open Interest has cratered, reflecting widespread liquidation across futures markets. With leverage drained and traders shaken out, the path forward depends on whether spot demand can fill the vacuum left by the OI collapse. The recent market volatility has presented a critical opportunity to assess the underlying health of various crypto assets. In an X post, Daan Crypto Trades, a full-time crypto trader and investor, has offered a compelling analysis of Ethereum’s high-timeframe chart, specifically focusing on Open Interest (OI), which shows exactly how much speculative excess has been washed out. Particularly, ETH got hit hard in the process. Why This Flush Could Be The Foundation For Ethereum’s Next Move According to Daan, what’s encouraging is that ETH’s Open Interest is now sitting at levels comparable to when ETH traded at $3,000. Meanwhile, the price now hovers around $4,000. For Daan, a simple rule of thumb to determine whether a healthy reset has occurred is if open interest is lower than it was previously at a specific price. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Strength – Bulls Aim Higher As ETH Eyes Potential Outperformance Typically, as price increases, Open Interest tends to rise as more capital flows into derivative markets, and vice versa. This relative comparison of OI and price is crucial because an increase or decrease in price will generally make OI trend in both directions. There are also coins used as margin, which can inflate OI figures in a rising market. Thus, the relative levels to watch out for are between OI and price, which carry more weight than the absolute numbers. In the meantime, leverage is making a comeback in the Ethereum market. As the Master of Crypto, an observer of market dynamics, has highlighted, the Open Interest on ETH has surged 8.2% within 24 hours, fueling the ongoing price move. The surge in Open Interest suggests that traders are once again opening aggressive long positions after the recent flush, a familiar pattern that often carries more risk than reward. Master of Crypto advises caution, framing this leverage-driven rally within a historical context, that approximately 75% of rallies aggressively fueled by such a rapid build-up in leverage tend to reverse, while only 25% sustain their momentum upward. The Calm Phase Before The Next Expansion The Ethereum macro trend remains upward despite the short-term move. Analyst EtherNasyonaL has emphasized that after breaking free from its long-standing downtrend, ETH is currently only retesting the demand zone and trendline, a healthy bullish move retest that is typical of a strong market structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At Risk – Momentum Fades As Bears Target Fresh Lows Ahead However, the analyst pointed out that the fluctuation on the short timeframes doesn’t define the trend, but it’s the longer timeframes that hold the true directional signal.

This milestone underscores a strategic vision to meet the accelerating demand for institutional-grade digital asset solutions, with a clear focus on scaling in the world’s most dynamic markets. “The demand for institutional-grade solutions is driving the next wave of global digital asset growth. This is no longer an industry of a few pioneers, but an ecosystem built for sophisticated businesses that require trust and security at their core,” said Sailor Zhong, Founder & CEO of ChainUp . “Our focus has always been on providing the essential infrastructure that builds trust in this industry, and the market’s overwhelming response validates that vision.” Institutional Momentum Reshaping the Market The broader digital asset landscape is entering a new growth phase, driven by regulated products, tokenized assets, and participation from traditional finance. Key indicators of this structural shift include: ETF Expansion: The global Bitcoin ETFs has surpassed US$153 billion , highlighting soaring institutional interest. This momentum is creating a powerful spillover effect into corporate treasury strategies, providing treasurers and CFOs with the confidence and validation to consider holding digital assets directly on their balance sheets. As new approvals for crypto-related exchange-traded products (ETPs) accelerate, this trend is further normalizing digital assets as a core component of modern financial portfolios. Regulatory Clarity: Landmark events – such as the passage of the GENIUS Act which provided crucial clarity to stablecoins, and new frameworks streamlining spot ETF approvals – are creating a more predictable and favorable environment for digital asset adoption in major global markets. Tokenization’s Ascent: Assets Under Management (AUM) for tokenized funds has nearly quadrupled over the past year, as institutions embrace on-chain liquidity. This signals a clear transition toward a financial system built on secure, digital rails. Market Convergence: Leading crypto exchanges are advancing toward a Universal Exchange (UEX) model that unites digital assets, tokenized securities, and traditional markets in one ecosystem. A Strategic Roadmap for a Digital-First Future With institutional adoption accelerating, ChainUp is positioned to lead the industry’s next chapter by delivering the infrastructure required for secure, compliant, and scalable digital finance. The company’s strategic vision is anchored by a multi-pillar approach: The Foundation of Trust: Institutional Custody The institutional digital asset custody market is experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. This surge in capital is driven not only by ETFs but a fundamental shift in how corporations manage their reserves. With over $113 billion in Bitcoin held in corporate treasuries, the demand for secure, professional crypto asset management is now at an all-time high. ChainUp’s zero-incident security record in the past 8 years underpins its commitment to providing the ultimate safeguard for digital assets. Leveraging advanced technologies like multi-party computation (MPC) , ChainUp’s institutional-grade custody solution serves as the essential bridge between traditional finance and the crypto economy. Driving Value: Real-World Assets (RWAs) Tokenization Tokenization of real-world assets has emerged as a key trend, with the market projected to reach $10 trillion by 2030 . ChainUp’s infrastructure directly addresses this burgeoning market by providing the secure, scalable models needed to unlock trillions in value. The company’s white-label tokenization platform is built to enable the creation, management, and secure custody of these assets, including tokenized private equity, commodities like gold, real estate, fine art, intellectual property, and more. A Regulatory Backbone: Compliance-First Infrastructure Navigating a complex and evolving regulatory landscape remains a top priority for institutional clients. ChainUp’s infrastructure is designed to meet this challenge head-on, with modular solutions that can quickly adapt to new international standards. Complemented by a suite of compliance tools and advisory services, this approach enables businesses to achieve regulatory clarity, mitigate legal risk, and conduct robust due diligence and risk assessments in an increasingly regulated environment. Real-World Utility of Crypto: Infrastructure for the Digital Economy The global stablecoin market is projected to exceed US$3.7 trillion by 2030 , establishing it as a key driver of transactional volume. ChainUp is positioned to power this growth by providing a secure infrastructure for crypto real-world utility, including next-generation payment solutions designed to seamlessly integrate digital assets into daily transactions for both businesses and consumers. A New Frontier: Global Strategic Expansion With key markets like North America and Europe at the forefront of regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, they represent a central pillar of ChainUp’s expansion. The company is committed to building a strong presence in these dynamic markets, leveraging recent regulatory progress to accelerate its delivery of secure and compliant infrastructure, a key move designed to attract a broader client base and accelerate its global scaling. Pioneering the Future of Digital Assets In conjunction with its 8-year milestone, ChainUp recently hosted “ The All-Time High (ATH) Night ” in Singapore. The exclusive event, held ahead of the globally-acclaimed TOKEN2049 conference, convened over 400 industry leaders and partners to discuss the critical infrastructure needed for mainstream digital asset adoption. Commenting on the industry’s maturation and the company’s role within it, Chung Ho, Chief Operating Officer of ChainUp , remarked, “This is an industry moving from promise to purpose. Our focus remains on empowering our clients to drive the future of digital assets by delivering the trusted, secure, and scalable solutions needed to turn their vision into value in every major market, from Asia to EMEA and U.S.” About ChainUp ChainUp, a leading global provider of digital asset solutions, empowers businesses to navigate the complexities of this evolving ecosystem.

The price was able to climb above the $2.350 and $2.40 levels to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. However, the bears are still active near the $2.550 and $2.60 levels. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.50 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level, above which the price could rise and test the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low at $2.660. A clear move above the $2.660 resistance might send the price toward the $2.750 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.780 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.820. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.40 level. The next major support is near the $2.30 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.30 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.2420. The next major support sits near the $2.220 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.40 and $2.30.

53211042,606737,1760589034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53211042.jpeg,Sam Bankman-Fried Blames Politics: Says Biden Team Targeted Him For GOP Support,https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-blames-politics-says-biden-team-targeted-him-for-gop-support/,"Sam Bankman-Fried has gone on the offensive, accusing the administration of former US President Joe Biden of singling him out after he said he shifted large donations toward Republican causes. In a post on microblogging site GETTR, he framed the move as political retaliation for his funding choices and for his plans to speak before Congress on crypto policy. Sam Bankman-Fried: Claims Of Political Targeting According to recent posts and statements attributed to him, he says he donated “tens of millions” to Republican groups and that federal actions followed soon after. He argues his arrest came weeks before a crypto bill he backed was scheduled for a vote and the night before he was due to testify to lawmakers — timing he calls suspect. Reports note he published these allegations on social platforms where he has sought to explain his side. The missing trail of internal messages has added fuel to the controversy. Based on reports, messages from former US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler ’s government phone covering parts of late 2022 and 2023 were not recoverable, which critics say leaves questions unanswered about how and when regulators decided to act. Officials have offered technical explanations, while some lawmakers have demanded more documents and clarity. Conviction And Punishment Bankman-Fried faces a heavy legal record that complicates his claims. According to federal prosecutors and court filings, he was convicted on multiple fraud and conspiracy counts and later sentenced to a 25-year prison term after a trial that traced large customer losses to his companies. Reports put customer losses in the billions and cite judicial findings about false statements and misuse of funds. Financial fallout tied to the collapse of his exchange has already rippled through politics. Based on reports, FTX debtors and bankruptcy trustees have sought to recover more than $38 million in political donations made by him and associates, arguing some gifts were funded improperly. The recovery efforts show the money flowed through a mix of PACs and dark-money groups, with a large share tied to Republican-aligned organizations. Political Reactions And What Comes Next Lawmakers and commentators have split along partisan lines in how they view his latest claims. Some Republican members of Congress have seized on the missing messages and the timing of the arrest to press for documents and answers from regulators. Other observers point back to the trial record and evidence presented in court, saying the prosecution stood on detailed financial traces and witness testimony. Bankman-Fried is serving his sentence at a federal prison in Mendota, California. He’s appealing his conviction, claiming unfair treatment and political bias. Once a billionaire leading a global exchange, FTX, he now spends his days behind bars, fighting to regain his freedom.

He made the remarks during a group interview with reporters, following renewed weakness in Japan’s currency against the US dollar. The yen reached an eight-month low of 153.27 per dollar on October 10. Analysts say the decline indicates low market expectations that the BOJ will raise its rates . Bessent declined to comment directly on the yen’s level or on Governor Kazuo Ueda’s next policy decision scheduled for October 30, but he said Ueda is “very capable.” Bessent links yen’s future to the Bank of Japan’s steady policy Bessent said the Bank of Japan was moving too slowly to fight inflation in August, but has now softened his tone, stating that the yen will naturally find a stable level on its own if the Bank of Japan continues to follow a “proper” or responsible policy path. The BOJ has maintained its main interest rate at 0.5% since January, following the end of its ultra-easy monetary policy last year. The bank adhered to this policy for over a decade to help the economy recover from weak growth and low inflation. However, the situation has now changed because prices in Japan have been rising faster than before. Most Japanese households are now struggling with higher living costs as inflation has remained above 2% for more than three years, but real wages have not kept up. Governor Ueda has stated that he wants to understand how US tariffs, slower global trade, and changes in domestic spending impact Japan’s inflation and economy. He explained that the BOJ will proceed cautiously before raising interest rates again, as he believes a sudden move could harm the fragile recovery that Japan has worked so hard to build. Both Bessent and the governor say building confidence in the market requires patience, consistency, and clear communication. The US Treasury Secretary expressed his faith in Japan’s long-term economic management when he said that the yen would “find its own level” if the BOJ follows the right path. Japan’s politics and markets make a rate hike less likely The BOJ can’t change interest rates at the moment because the state of politics in the country is unstable. The leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has recently changed, and Sanae Takaichi is now preparing to become Japan’s next Prime Minister. Her victory caused some nervousness inside the government and among investors who prefer stability and clear direction. The situation became even more complicated when the LDP’s longtime coalition partner, the Komeito Party, left the alliance. Most government decisions, including those related to economic policy, are on hold because lawmakers will vote on the next prime minister next week. The Bank of Japan is likely to raise its rates due to this unstable situation. Traders estimate about a 15% chance that the BOJ will increase interest rates compared to around 70% at the end of September. The Japanese yen currently trades at around 150.60 per dollar as of Thursday morning in Tokyo. This weakened yen will make imported goods more expensive for Japanese consumers and businesses. Japan’s Finance Minister, Katsunobu Kato, said the government has noticed “rapid moves in a weak-yen direction,” and is ready to act if things get out of hand, but he did not explain what specific steps they might take. A former executive director at the BOJ, Kazuo Momma, stated that a rate hike would become increasingly likely if the yen weakened to 155 per dollar or beyond. He explained that a weaker yen would raise the prices of goods even higher and further frustrate the citizens. For now, the BOJ is waiting for the country’s political environment to stabilize before making its next significant move.

Over $200 million of ETH had been bought in under 24 hours by major wallets and institutional treasuries. This comes after a series of intense leveraged sell-offs which temporarily drove Ethereum up to the $3,500 mark before stabilizing. With ETH consolidating around $4,300, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also drawing investor interest, being rated by analysts as one of the top presales with 100x ROI in 2025 Q4. Ethereum Whales Return to Accumulation According to blockchain data, the whale wallets have gone back to accumulating heavily after the recent price correction. BitMine Immersion Technologies affirmed that it purchased 202,000 ETH on the weekend, which had a value of approximately $834 million at an average price of $4,154 per token. The acquisition increased the overall holdings of BitMine to $3.03 million ETH, which is roughly 2.5% of the total supply of Ethereum in circulation. Tom Lee, the chairman of the company, stated that it bought 202,037 ETH to bring their total to more than $3 million, calling the post-crash period an opportune accumulation period. A significant wallet bought 7,817 ETH, or approximately $32.5 million, just hours after panic selling during the fall. A different over-the-counter desk was an additional 14,165 ETH purchased using market-making mechanisms valued at approximately $55 million. These acquisitions imply that giant buyers still perceive the present range of Ethereum as a long-term entry point. Market Stabilizes After Weekend Volatility The fall on Friday-Sunday was attributed to a combination of unwinding of leverage and new macroeconomic tensions between the United States and China. The liquidations were exceeding key exchanges, but the market has since become stable with recovery. According to CoinGecko data, Ethereum trades near $4,003, down about 3.1% in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinGecko According to analysts, the major support is at $4,000, and the major resistance is at $4,263. In case Ethereum cracks higher than that point, then it may have space to make potential move towards $4,500. Others anticipate another institutional interest when volatility has been overcome. Spot Ether ETFs reported outflows of more than $428 million on October 13, although long-term investors are piling up in the pullback. Emerging Focus on MAGACOIN FINANCE With the stabilization of Ethereum, players in the market are exploring more opportunities in the presale industry. One of the projects that are getting attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, an established and regulated presale that is run on open tokenomics. According to analysts, it can be defined as one of the finest crypto presales in 2025 because of its allocated pricing phases and increasing investment of investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE enables those who buy early to purchase tokens prior to the entry prices being listed on the exchange. Each presale stage adds value to the token in bits, which is a benefit to early entrants. The community of the project has grown in a short period on social platforms, indicating the increased awareness of the project among retail and institutional investors. According to experts, its presale structure favours long-term holders and provides equitable distribution at different stages. Market researchers predict that, in the case of the continuation of the current trends, MAGACOIN FINANCE would bring significant profits when trading becomes operational in the latter part of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned for Growth According to analyst reports, MAGACOIN FINANCE may experience up to 100x returns as the larger market moves to the altcoins. The probability of appreciation of its value after listing is due to its deflationary supply structure and minimal issuance of tokens. It is considered by many early investors to be one of the best crypto to buy ahead of the next big market surge. The presale with its growing following and roadmap has proven to be a viable option to individuals who want to gain exposure to early-stage assets. With liquidity back in the market, the steadily growing development of MAGACOIN FINANCE has maintained it on the lists of the top crypto to buy in 2025 of analysts. Conclusion Ethereum whales have reentered the market, signaling renewed confidence after recent volatility. Their large-scale purchases suggest belief in the network’s long-term strength even amid short-term uncertainty. Parallel to this, early investors are looking toward MAGACOIN FINANCE , which continues to gain momentum as a structured and transparent presale project. With steady accumulation among major ETH holders and rising demand for audited presales, analysts view MAGACOIN FINANCE as the best crypto to buy for those seeking early-stage exposure during the upcoming market cycle.

Related Reading: Why This Resistance Could Trigger Another XRP Price Crash Soon Whale and mid-tier wallets snapped up roughly 200 million ADA over 48 hours, about $140 million at recent prices, after last week’s volatility knocked the market lower. The build-up comes as the project readies the Cardano Summit in Berlin (Nov. 12–13), adding a fresh narrative tailwind into Q4. ADA's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Whales Scoop ADA as Selling Pressure Cools Analytics platforms tracking address cohorts report renewed accumulation, with 10–100million ADA and over 1 billion ADA wallets expanding balances. Similarly, network “spent coin” metrics declined by 51%, suggesting fewer coins are moving to sell and that distribution is easing. Price-wise, ADA continues to defend the $0.70–$0.80 band many traders view as pivotal for basing. A sustained hold keeps the recovery structure intact and positions the token for attempts at prior resistance. Staking Access Expands, Berlin Summit In Focus Adding fuel to the thesis, eToro launched ADA staking in the U.S., potentially opening rewards access to over 40 million users and reducing liquid supply as holders lock tokens. Beyond flows, the community is eyeing the Berlin Summit, where ecosystem teams are expected to showcase progress across Midnight, Leios, and dApp growth, events that historically boost sentiment and developer visibility. Strategists argue these catalysts, paired with bargain hunting from whales, can help stabilize spot liquidity after the broader market shake-out. Cardano Price Outlook: Levels That Matter Now Technically, Cardano rebounded from the $0.61 swing low and is attempting to reclaim short-term signals. Bulls first want a clean move through $0.73 (recent pivot / 0.236 Fib area). Above that, chart watchers flag $0.86 as a major resistance repeatedly capping rallies; a breakout there exposes $1.01 and $1.12 as subsequent targets, aligning with an ascending-channel upper bound on higher time frames. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Coming? Factors That Highlight Another Decline On the downside, $0.61 remains the must-hold support; a daily close below would risk a deeper revisit toward $0.50–$0.60 and delay any trend resumption. A decisive push through $0.73, and especially $0.86, would strengthen the case for a broader recovery leg, while failure to hold $0.61 puts ADA back in consolidation.

This equates to around 4.9% of the entire supply of the asset, which is around 121 million. BitMine Immersion Technologies has the lion’s share of the total with 51% or just over 3 million ETH, which puts it halfway toward its target of 5% of the entire supply. It has been buying the dip recently as Ether fell below $4,000 during the weekend liquidation event, and it is still buying. It looks like BitMine just bought another 104,336 ETH worth $417 million, reported Lookonchain on Thursday. DATs are one of three “supply vacuums” that were not present in previous market cycles, said analyst ‘Crypto Gucci,’ who added that 40% of all Ether was locked and illiquid. It is entering the cycle with “record institutional demand and the smallest liquid float in history,” he said before predicting that prices would “go nuclear.” The second supply vacuum is exchange-traded funds, which have scooped up 6.84 million ETH worth $27 billion, equivalent to 5.6% of the total supply. Staking is the third supply vacuum, as 35.7 million ETH remains illiquid due to the length of the exit queue. These three alone account for 48.4 million ETH, or 40% of the total supply.

DOGE is now consolidating and might decline below $0.1920. DOGE price started a fresh downside correction below $0.2050. The price is trading below the $0.240 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2025 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1880. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.20, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.2050 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.2120 and $0.2150. A high was formed at $0.2182 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1788 swing low to the $0.2182 high. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.2050 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2025 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2025 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2085 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2120 level. A close above the $0.2120 resistance might send the price toward $0.2180. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.2250. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2320. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2085 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1930 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1788 swing low to the $0.2182 high. The next major support is near the $0.1880 level. The main support sits at $0.1800. If there is a downside break below the $0.1800 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1665 level or even $0.1650 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

The Nasdaq index performed similarly to Bitcoin during the same period. In the last month, gold gained 13% while Bitcoin fell 3%. Last week, gold rose 4% while BTC fell 9%. Related News: BREAKING: Things Are Calming Down in the Exchange Wars - Coinbase Makes a Listing Push on Binance Yardeni predicts that gold could reach $5,000 in 2026 and $10,000 before the end of the current decade. Yardeni argued that a liquidity squeeze is behind Bitcoin's recent decline, with approximately $19 billion in liquidations recently occurring in futures and leveraged positions. “Some platforms have triggered automatic deleveraging for risk management. This has led to the closure of even profitable or protected positions,” he said. As prices fell rapidly in the markets, market makers reduced their activities, causing spreads to widen and selling pressure to increase. Last Friday, after President Donald Trump announced that he could impose tariffs of up to 100% on China, gold surged again, while Bitcoin fell. Yardeni concluded his assessment by saying, “Investors seeking protection from geopolitical risks are turning to gold and silver again.” *This is not investment advice.

Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden explained that the restrictions are there to prevent sudden liquidity shifts from banks to stablecoins and confirmed that a public consultation will be held later this year. Meanwhile, in Europe, Franco-German banking group ODDO BHF launched EUROD, a euro-pegged stablecoin under the EU’s MiCA regulation. With EUROD joining other recent euro-backed launches, it is clear that Europe is pushing to strengthen its role in the global stablecoin market. Stablecoin Caps Will Be Temporary Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden reassured the crypto industry that the central bank’s proposed restrictions on stablecoin holdings and transaction sizes will be temporary measures to ensure a smooth and stable transition for the financial system. At DC Fintech Week on Wednesday, Breeden explained that the limits, which were initially introduced in a 2023 discussion paper, are not meant to be permanent barriers but short-term safeguards to prevent disruption as stablecoins become integrated into the broader economy. She said that the limits were previously floated to range between £10,000 and £20,000 (about $13,400 to $26,800), and were designed to give the financial system time to adapt to the rise of stablecoins. According to Breeden, the Bank’s primary concern is that a sudden shift of funds from bank deposits into stablecoins could reduce credit availability for businesses and households, leading to instability. Sarah Breeden “Our starting point is that applying limits to a user’s holdings of a given systemic stablecoin is the best way to avoid such a precipitous reduction in the availability of credit to UK borrowers,” she said. Breeden added that once the financial system adjusts, these restrictions will be lifted, as the Bank ultimately wants to “support a role for stablecoins as part of a multi-money system. People in the Industry strongly criticized the proposed limits, and warned that such restrictions could send the wrong message about the UK’s openness to innovation and drive crypto-related businesses elsewhere. In response, Breeden said the Bank will launch a public consultation before the end of the year to gather some more feedback on the proposed limit levels and possible exemptions. Among the ideas being discussed are higher thresholds for businesses and carveouts for companies operating in the UK’s digital sandbox, a government initiative launched in 2024 to test blockchain and digital ledger technologies. Breeden also clarified that while stablecoins and tokenized deposits will likely play a bigger role in future markets, the Bank of England intends to keep its role as the sole provider of settlement for wholesale and asset market transactions to avoid unnecessary interconnections that could threaten financial stability. She called on both traditional financial institutions and crypto innovators to collaborate with the central bank in shaping a resilient and inclusive financial system for the digital age. ODDO BHF Launches Euro Stablecoin In other parts of Europe, Franco-German banking group ODDO BHF entered the digital asset market with the launch of its own euro-backed stablecoin, EUROD. This makes it one of the first traditional European banks to issue a stablecoin under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The initiative was announced on Wednesday , and positions ODDO BHF as the issuer of the token, with Flowdesk providing liquidity services and Fireblocks supplying the tokenization infrastructure. The stablecoin will be listed first on Spanish crypto exchange Bit2Me. ODDO BHF announcement Guy de Leusse, deputy chief operating officer at ODDO BHF, said the goal of the move is to provide a distinctly European alternative to the dominance of dollar-based stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. “We felt it was essential to offer a European solution denominated in euros to provide an alternative to stablecoins denominated in US dollars,” he said. USD stablecoins dominating the market (Source: CoinMarketCap ) ODDO BHF formed in 2016 through the merger of France’s ODDO bank and Germany’s BHF-BANK, and it operates across France, Germany, Switzerland, and Tunisia. It also has a long-standing presence in European finance dating back to the 19th century. The launch of EUROD is another step in the movement toward euro-pegged digital assets across the continent. Europe’s stablecoin landscape gained momentum this year after Société Générale’s introduction of the EUR CoinVertible in April, and AllUnity’s release of the regulated EURAU stablecoin in July, backed by Flow Traders, Deutsche Bank’s DWS, and Galaxy. Nine European banks also announced plans to release a joint euro-backed stablecoin by 2026. Experts suggest that while USD-backed stablecoins still account for more than 83% of the global $316 billion stablecoin market, euro-denominated alternatives are gaining attention as Europe accelerates its digital currency agenda. Bhau Kotecha, co-founder of Paxos Labs, said that European issuers will need strong partnerships and liquidity strategies to compete with their US counterparts.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-16 05:30:00

Australia was a significant outlier, with shares hitting record highs, fueled by weaker-than-expected jobs data, which increased market expectations for the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) to implement further policy easing (interest rate cuts). The overall advance in the region was limited by renewed U.S.-China trade tensions, leading investors to remain cautious. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a possible extension of Chinese import duty pauses if Beijing halts new rare-earth export controls. The U.S. is nearing completion of a trade deal with South Korea, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday, adding he expects an announcement within the next 10 days. Gold prices rose above $4,230 per ounce on Thursday, continuing its rally to a new record, driven by safe-haven demand and growing expectations of a dovish US monetary policy. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.31% to around 48,000 while the broader Topix Index added 0.8% to 3,210 on Thursday, extending gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened past 151 per dollar on Thursday, rising for the third straight session, as the path for Liberal Democratic Party leader Sanae Takaichi to become the next prime minister remains highly uncertain following the coalition breakup with the Komeito party last week. Japan’s core machinery orders—which exclude volatile sectors such as ships and electric power—fell 0.9% month-over-month to ¥8890 billion in August 2025, improving from a sharp 4.6% drop in July but missing market expectations for a 0.4% gain. Bank of Japan board member Naoki Tamura warned against premature monetary tightening, saying Japan must avoid returning to a period of stagnant prices and wages. In a speech in Osaka today, he cautioned against allowing inflation to persist beyond moderate levels. The Bank of Japan should maintain its loose monetary policy and raise interest rates only gradually amid persistent global trade uncertainties, said Deputy Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department Nada Choueiri. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.09% to 3,920, while the Shenzhen Component added 0.1% to 13,130 on Thursday, marking a second straight session of gains amid bets that Beijing would introduce new stimulus to combat deflationary pressures and the impact of higher US tariffs, and the offshore yuan Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the U.S. might extend a pause on import duties on Chinese goods beyond three months if Beijing cancels plans for strict new export controls on rare-earth elements. Investors are eyeing key Chinese data next week, including September industrial output, retail sales, Q3 GDP, and the monthly loan prime rate fixing. Meantime, China’s September CPI and PPI continued to highlight persistent deflation risks. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.60%, little changed in Thursday morning trade, hovering around 25,895 after Wednesday’s rally. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.53% to 82,978 in morning trade on Thursday, gaining for the second straight session, supported by optimism over quarterly earnings and continued foreign inflows. However, the rally was partially offset by slight losses in the tech sector, ahead of earnings reports from Infosys and Wipro, two of the country's largest IT firms. The central bank’s meeting minutes showed policymakers increasingly open to easing, with Governor Malhotra noting that the downward revision in inflation projections provides policy space to support growth. The central bank has revised its inflation forecast for 2025–26 to 2.6%, down from 3.1% in August and 3.7% in June, while raising the GDP growth forecast to 6.8% from 6.5%. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.84% to a fresh all-time high above the key 9,000 level on Thursday, lifted by gains in gold stocks amid record-high bullion prices, while investors assessed the latest jobs data. The Australian dollar weakened below $0.650 on Thursday, reversing the previous session’s gains, after a softer job report revived expectations of an RBA rate cut. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the unemployment rate rose more than expected to 4.5% , the highest in nearly four years, while employment increased by just 14,900, below forecasts for a 20,000 gain. In the U.S. on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended volatile session mostly higher despite ongoing US-China trade tensions and a lingering government shutdown. U.S. stock futures were subdued on Thursday, as traders weighed strong earnings against rising U.S.-China trade tensions: Dow +0.08% ; S&P 500 +0.02% ; Nasdaq +0.02% .

53212107,606739,1760592624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53212107.jpeg,Shiba Inu Reopens Shibarium Bridge After 1-Month Freeze,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-reopens-shibarium-bridge/,"Shiba Inu has restored BONE transfers on Shibarium’s Plasma bridge, re-enabling deposits and withdrawals between Ethereum and the layer-2 network following a security incident that forced a month-long pause. In an October 14 post, core contributor Kaal Dhairya wrote that the “Plasma Bridge is back online for BONE, following a comprehensive review and a series of security enhancements,” adding that users can now bridge BONE “with a safer, stronger, and more resilient experience.” Shiba Inu Relaunches The Shibarium Bridge The relaunch comes after Shibarium’s bridge was restricted in mid-September following a validator-key compromise that enabled a malicious exit on the PoS bridge. In a September 21 incident report, Dhairya stated that “on September 12, 2025 at 18:44 UTC, unauthorized validator signing power was used to push a malicious state/exit through the PoS bridge, withdrawing multiple assets,” prompting immediate containment measures and a broader hardening program. The team said at the time it would publish full technical details once it was safe to do so and that “bridging remains restricted during containment/hardening.” Shibarium’s team is positioning the re-opened BONE bridge as the first step in a phased restoration of services, backed by new policy-level and operational controls. The most visible change for users is a mandatory delay before withdrawals finalize: “All BONE Plasma withdrawals now include a 7-day finalization delay. This buffer gives operators and security teams time to monitor and respond to unusual activity before funds finalize—significantly improving defense without removing user access.” The post frames the delay as reinforcing Plasma’s fraud-resistance guarantees. Another control introduced at the bridge layer is proactive address blacklisting. According to the team, the new mechanism “lets us flag and block suspicious addresses at the bridge layer,” with the intent of preventing repeat abuse across the ecosystem. The Shiba Inu team also emphasized that critical code changes underwent an external review: “All critical changes were reviewed by Hexens, adding an independent layer of expert scrutiny.” The relaunch followed a validation sequence that included unit tests, end-to-end simulations, deployment on the public testnet (“ Puppynet ”), and “multi-timeframe” monitoring before production activation. The October 14 update also addresses a separate strand of the September incident involving KNINE and minor OSCAR token flows. The Shiba Inu team disclosed that the attacker “drained and sold roughly $600 worth of OSCAR tokens from the bridge but ignored the 5 ETH recovery offer for KNINE tokens,” which now remain blacklisted and unusable to the attacker. The previously announced KNINE bounty “has expired,” the team said, but it plans “one final, conditional bounty (amount TBD) for complete return of all KNINE held by attacker-controlled addresses,” stressing that partial returns will not qualify and that terms will appear only on verified channels. While only BONE is live on the Plasma bridge today, Shibarium signaled a broader roadmap. The team plans “gradual re-enablement for other tokens” and is “finalizing a fair and transparent repayment framework for affected users,” with specifics to be published once doing so would not increase risk. The post underscores a measured posture after the September compromise: “Safety first: We won’t publish specifics that could be gamed while security work is ongoing. Expect measured, verifiable updates.” Context around the month-long outage highlights the extent of remediation behind the scenes. In late September, Shibarium detailed rotations of validator signers, migrations of contract control to multi-party hardware custody, targeted contract-level protections, live monitoring and exchange coordination, and the engagement of independent security and incident-response specialists. The September 21 update also acknowledged decentralization shortcomings in validator operations and outlined a hardening plan “in progress collaboration with Hexens,” with restoration gated on third-party sign-offs and successful drills on test environments. For now, the reopening restores a critical path for validators, liquidity providers and users who rely on BONE mobility between Ethereum and Shibarium. As the post concludes, the new safeguards—including blacklisting and the 7-day challenge window—are intended to align the bridge’s user experience with the practical realities of operating a Plasma-style system under adversarial conditions: “Every new safeguard, every extra check, and yes—even the 7-day delay—reflects one core principle: protecting the community.” At press time, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token traded at $0.00001060.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|Shibarium Exploit,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 05:30:24

One name gaining attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum is building a dual lending platform that supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The project is in presale Phase 6. Its upcoming lending system, stablecoin design, and possible exchange listings have set expectations for a 500 % rally before mid-2026—putting it on shortlists for what crypto to invest in and top cryptocurrencies this cycle. Presale momentum and token Economics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4 billion tokens. It is now in Phase 6 of its presale. In Phase 6, each token is priced at $0.035. The next Phase 7 will set the price at $0.040, a 15 % increase over the current rate. So far, Mutuum has raised about $17.4 million. Of the 170 million tokens allocated in Phase 6, 68 % are sold. Combining all phases, over 17,200 holders have already joined—leading some analysts to include MUTM among the best cheap crypto to buy now. An investor who bought at $0.01 could see 6× value gain at a listing price of $0.06. Analysts expect the token to climb further, projecting a 30x (about 500 %) rally from listing to mid-2026. This trajectory has already drawn comparisons to early calls on major crypto successes. Some analysts are treating Mutuum as the next big cryptocurrency pick. In Q4 2025, Mutuum plans to launch protocol’s Version 1 on the Sepolia testnet. In that version, users will be able to lend, borrow or collateralize both ETH and USDT. It will include important components such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure the system runs smoothly and safely. That release is pivotal as it will demonstrate real use cases and help attract more users and liquidity into the platform. Dual lending design and growth engines t0 500% Mutuum’s dual lending strategy sets it apart. In the P2C pools, users deal with stable or major assets like ETH or USDT. In P2P pools, more volatile assets—such as DOGE or SHIB—can be lent or borrowed. This mix lets liquidity flow flexibly and invites more people to participate. The lending and borrowing utilities create strong real-world use cases that are likely to draw more users to the platform. In the near future, users will be able to lend, borrow, and stake their assets in dedicated pools to earn passive income and rewards. Each of these activities naturally increases the demand for MUTM, which is anticipated to significantly contribute to the token’s value appreciation—key considerations for lists of best crypto to buy now and top crypto to buy. A second growth driver is the planned decentralized stablecoin. When someone borrows it, they lock up collateral like ETH, and the stablecoin is minted. When they repay or get liquidated, the stablecoin is burned. Interest rates will adjust dynamically to keep the stablecoin close to its $1 peg. For example, a trader might lock $5,000 in ETH and borrow stablecoins while still holding their crypto exposure. This setup will anchor activity in Mutuum’s P2C and P2P markets, making borrowing and lending flow continuously. Over time, this built-in demand for the stablecoin and for MUTM itself is expected to lift token value steadily. Questions like is crypto a good investment are now taking a new focus with projects like MUTM in mind. Third, Mutuum’s price discovery system is built with strong oracles. The primary source will be Chainlink feeds for USD and native asset pricing. Backup oracles and aggregated feeds will support redundancy. DEX time-weighted average price (TWAP) will also feed into the system. With this robust framework, wrongful liquidations or price manipulations are avoided. That kind of safety will draw institutional lenders and large borrowers. As trust grows, positions will grow, fees will rise, and more people will need MUTM to interact with the protocol. The rising demand will push the token upward. Security measures Mutuum has also secured strong security measures. It is undergoing a CertiK audit, combining manual review and static analysis. The TokenScan score is 90.00 and the Skynet score is 79.00. The audit request began February 25, 2025 and was revised on May 20, 2025. In addition, Mutuum hosts a bug bounty program with a $50,000 reward pool. Critically, bugs are rewarded up to $2,000, major issues $1,000, medium $500, and low $200. This security posture will enhance confidence among large investors. Beyond fundamentals, the chance of exchange listing gives a potent selling angle. With strong presale metrics and upcoming testnet builds, MUTM is a candidate for Tier-1 or Tier-2 exchange listings in the near future. That listing would bring huge visibility and capital inflows. For those exploring what crypto to buy now and crypto to buy now, Mutuum represents a fresh option with strong structural backing. Final verdict The 24-hour leaderboard has been enhanced with a new update. Each day, the user who ranks first will earn a $500 MUTM reward, given that they complete at least one transaction within the 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC. The 500 % projection is rooted in solid architecture: dual lending paths, a native stablecoin, rigorous oracles, strong security, and listing potential. Phase 6 is already 68 % sold and the next price point is $0.040 (a 15 % jump). This is possibly one of the last chances to claim a meaningful share of MUTM at $0.035 before a major price discovery phase kicks in. For investors who want exposure to an up-and-coming token with structure, innovation, and momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to rise and appears on several best crypto to invest in shortlists among defi crypto projects.

53211317,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86494,1760593069,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Now at Phase 8 of its Rise to Dominance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-now-at-phase-8-of-its-rise-to-dominance/,"The outlook surrounding XRP continues to evolve as community figures assess the sequence of events they believe are shaping its trajectory. A recent post from crypto trader and tech enthusiast, TheXRPguy, outlined what he identifies as a structured progression toward broader market validation. His remarks focus on key developments already achieved within the XRP ecosystem and the significant milestone still pending: potential approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). The tone of his message reflects conviction that XRP is approaching a decisive stage, yet reactions within the community show that confidence is not universal. BREAKING We are now at phase 8 of #XRP rise to dominance. 1. RLUSD is released. 2. Trumps inauguration. 3. Gary offically leaves SEC. 4. XRP Strategic Reserve 5. Ripple case ends 6. Alt season 7. Ripple name big bank partnership. 8. XRP ETF approval.… — TheXRPguy (@TheXRP_guy) October 14, 2025 Completed Milestones: Foundation for Broader Recognition According to TheXRPguy, several critical conditions have already been fulfilled in XRP’s ongoing development. He points first to the release of RLUSD , Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, which entered the market with the intention of strengthening transactional utility and institutional trust. He follows this with references to external political and regulatory developments, noting the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the confirmed departure of Gary Gensler from the SEC. Some see these events in the XRP community as contributing indirectly to a more favorable regulatory climate for digital assets. Further, he highlights the establishment of what is described as an XRP strategic reserve, suggesting structured holdings designed to support liquidity and manage long-term distribution. He also cites the conclusion of Ripple’s legal case against the SEC , which delivered clarity on the status of XRP and ended a prolonged period of uncertainty. In his view, these developments set the stage for wider market confidence. The trader additionally refers to the onset of altcoin market momentum, indicating that broader market conditions are aligning with internal progress. Major Partnership and the Final Phase Among the achievements listed, the confirmation of a major financial partnership involving Ripple is emphasized as a key point. For many community observers, partnerships with established banking or financial institutions represent significant validation of XRP’s intended utility in cross-border transactions. This acknowledgment plays into the belief that institutional integration is essential before any formal financial product, such as an ETF, could be introduced. The final point identified in his sequence is the anticipated approval of an XRP ETF. This is framed as the last remaining component in what he describes as “phase eight” of XRP’s rise. The implication is that, should such an ETF be granted, it would mark a new stage of accessibility and recognition by traditional financial markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Response from the Community Despite the structured progression outlined, responses within the community reveal evident fatigue among some participants. One user replied critically, referencing repeated assurances made during previous milestones that failed to coincide with substantial market movement. Their remarks reflect a broader sentiment shared by certain long-term holders who have grown skeptical of optimistic forecasts tied to key events. With the legal and infrastructural foundations now in place, attention has shifted to whether traditional financial markets will formally acknowledge XRP through a regulated ETF product. The coming period may prove decisive in testing whether the milestones cited thus far will translate into measurable adoption and market impact. While supporters of TheXRPguy’s framework view the pending ETF decision as a coming achievement, others remain cautious in their expectations until clear results materialize.

The minister pointed out that Australia’s financial crimes watchdog, AUSTRAC, found 85% of funds from top crypto ATM users were involved in scams. Minister Burke said that though not all ATMs are at risk, there are significant problems in areas that are hard to trace. “I want AUSTRAC to have the power to restrict, or if it decides, to prohibit high-risk products. Be in no doubt, crypto ATMs are a high-risk product,” he said. Drastic Rise in Crypto ATMs Australia has experienced a drastic surge in Bitcoin ATM installations over the past few years. From just 73 machines in 2022, the number has grown 16-fold, reaching over 1,200 by August 2024. Source: CoinTimeATM “This is a product that is multiplying quickly – six years ago, there were 23 machines in operation. Three years ago, there were 200,” said Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC CEO. “When we established the Crypto Taskforce at the end of last year, there were 1,200. That number has now risen to 2,000.” A separate statement from the regulator noted that the powers would give Thomas additional options to reduce money laundering risks associated with high-risk products. “We’re still seeing an unacceptable risk of money laundering across some channels,” Thomas added. AUSTRAC Taskforce Uncovers ‘Hidden World of Scams’ The financial crimes regulator has been taking down several crypto ATMs across Australia, following the establishment of an internal crypto taskforce last year. In a statement early this month , AUSTRAC said it uncovered “a hidden world of scams and dodgy dealings,” from several kiosks. “Our intelligence shows they pose serious risks for scams and money laundering, with dozens of scam victims identified,” it said. The agency has already identified money mule activity and scams targeting older Australians and implemented minimum standards for crypto ATM providers. “The taskforce has produced incredible results in a brief time. We know there’s more we can do to protect Australians from unscrupulous operators, so we’re expanding this important work,” CEO Thomas said at the time.

Speaking at DC Fintech Week, Atkins emphasized that the commission’s top priority is crypto and tokenization. He commented, “We want to make sure that we build a strong framework to actually attract people back into the United States who may have fled, but then also be able to build a framework that makes sense for the future, so that innovation can thrive.” He quipped that the agency might even be called the “Securities and Innovation Commission.” Atkins still wants to pursue an “innovation exemption” Since stepping into the role in April, Atkins has diverged sharply from Gary Gensler’s crypto policy, which centered on enforcement actions and the belief that most tokens fell under securities law. He’s become more open to showing support for digital assets. On Wednesday, he said that distributed ledger technology is what excites him most about cryptocurrency. Atkins had revealed in June that he had asked SEC staff to draft an “innovation exemption” to expedite the rollout of on-chain offerings, stating that he intends to finalize it before the end of the year. Speaking on Wednesday, he mentioned he wanted to roll out new solutions like the “innovation exemption” and eventually create a “super app” linking all crypto-related agencies. He argued that firms shouldn’t have to register separately with each regulator. Now in its second week, the government shutdown has largely sidelined the SEC. The agency is following an emergency operations plan after Congress failed to pass funding, leaving it with a very limited staff to handle urgent issues. Under its emergency plan, the SEC currently has just a handful of employees on duty to deal with critical situations, the agency said. The commission’s enforcement actions resulted in billions of dollars in fines for crypto agencies Under Gary Gensler, the SEC took 125 enforcement actions linked to crypto from 2021 to 2024, resulting in $6.05 billion in penalties. Industry supporters and a few members of Congress complained that the agency’s policy at the time stifled technological development and, based on legal precedents dating back to 1946, was inappropriate for use against crypto. The Trump administration issued a landmark policy reversal with its January 2025 executive order on digital financial technology. After the change, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Chair Paul Atkins dismissed multiple enforcement actions against companies, including Coinbase and Ripple. The SEC also nullified Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which had, in effect, scared banks away from providing crypto custody. Yet the shift has not been controversy-free. Investigators recently found that the SEC’s information technology department had accidentally deleted nearly a year of text messages from Gensler’s phone, adding to questions about record-keeping and transparency under the Biden administration. The deleted messages were reportedly related to discussions regarding crypto enforcement matters, including the Terraform case and a high-profile financial services settlement, which has put the SEC in a bind when fulfilling its FOI obligations. Atkins has emphasized a more measured approach , promising to give businesses notice of technical violations rather than immediately resorting to aggressive enforcement. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""b8ee08b1-dfd9-4f0d-982f-5576bd8f75c3"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-2"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> The head of the top Wall Street watchdog, who was appointed this year as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission by US President Donald Trump, recently stated in Paris that the agency aims to remove crooks from the financial markets and protect investors. “If you lie, cheat or steal your investors and steal their money like [disgraced former financier] Bernie Madoff, we’ll leave you naked, homeless, and without wheels,” Atkins said, quoting a sign posted in the office of his first SEC boss, Richard Breeden.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Breaks 13-Year Silence, Moves $33 Million To Exchange A decade-long chart was shared that traces moves from 2013 through 2025, and one commentator went as far as to call the next leg a potential “Ethereum killer.” That claim has reignited debate across crypto circles. Technical Patterns Signal Repeats Crypto analyst Peter Brandt pointed to a repeating set of shapes on XRP’s chart — symmetrical triangles and long consolidations that ended in sharp rallies. The timeline covers a decade and breaks down into three phases. The first run, from 2013 to 2017, ended with an outsized surge that exceeded 70,000%. The second phase, roughly 2018 to 2024, produced a descending formation and then a dramatic breakout near the end of 2024, when price gains were about 600%. Now, price is being held inside a narrow range after a recent rejection at $3.66, with traders watching a band roughly between $2.60 and $2.80 for signs of a move. Community Voice Meets Hard Math Another crypto expert, Alex Cobb, comments that the next leg could topple Ethereum captured social media attention. “The next leg up on XRP will be the Ethereum killer,” he said. The next leg up on XRP will be the Ethereum killer https://t.co/m56o7FuOpo — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 13, 2025 But market data shows a big gap. XRP’s market cap sits near $147 billion while Ethereum’s is about $480 billion. At a current XRP price of $2.49, a rise of over 230% would be needed for XRP to cross $8 and overtake Ethereum, assuming ETH stays flat. That path is made steeper if Ether rallies again; in August it hit an all-time high of $4,950 after climbing 239% from April lows of $1,385. Market Cap Gap Remains Large History gives headlines, yet it is not proof that patterns will repeat. XRP did briefly become the second-largest cryptocurrency in 2018, which feeds today’s hopes. Still, some technical analysts have publicly softened earlier bullish calls, urging caution and recommending investors hold both tokens rather than expect a flip. Market behavior is shaped by many moving parts — money flows, macro events, and network updates — none of which are guaranteed to follow past scripts.

Sentiment And Structure Social momentum can push price quickly, and chart breaks can trigger big moves when liquidity is thin.

A pattern that looks clean on a long-term chart may be paused by regulatory headlines, changing investor appetite, or simply by a stronger rally in the rival asset.

53213357,https://invezz.com/?p=2926922,1760595221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Crypto market crash: Why are altcoins going down this week?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/16/crypto-market-crash-why-are-altcoins-going-down-this-week/,"The crypto market crash that started on Friday accelerated this week, with top coins being in the red. Bittensor (TAO) price plunged by 14%, while Aster, Immutable, Zcash, PancakeSwap, and DoubleZero being the top laggards. This article explains some of the top reasons why the crypto crash is happening. Crypto market crash happened after last week’s liquidations The crypto market crash is happening as stocks jump as investors focus on last week’s liquidations . On Friday, over 1.6 million traders were liquidated, with the total amount rising to almost $20 billion. Some analysts, including Tom Lee, argue that the liquidation amount was much higher than the reported figure and pointed to the risk of leverage in the crypto industry. Therefore, altcoins are falling as investors and traders keep off after the crash last week. Some people who were wiped out have opted to keep off the industry completely or to participate in it by just buying and holding Bitcoin. This explains why liquidations have slowed despite the ongoing crash. CoinGlass data shows that liquidations dropped by 28% in the last 24 hours to $444 million. Also, the volume in the perpetual exchanges like Aster and Hyperliquid has dropped. Altcoins falling as Fear and Greed Index retreats The other main catalyst for the ongoing crypto market crash is that investors have embraced a sense of fear. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has plunged to the fear zone of 32, much higher than this month’s high of 55. This index looks at the overall sentiment in the crypto industry, including the market sentiment, price momentum, derivatives market, and volatility has plunged. The fear is also happening in the broader market. Data compiled by CNN Money shows that the Fear and Greed Index has dropped to the fear zone of 30, with the stock price breadth, market volatility, junk bond demand, and safe-haven demand moving to the extreme fear zone. Put and call options and stock price strength have all moved to the neutral zone. Historically, the stock and crypto market normally underperforms when there is a sense of fear in the market. Trade jitters and Federal Reserve impact The crypto market crash is happening as investors focus on the ongoing trade issues between the United States and China. Recently, China has started to push back harder against the United States. The country has rejected American soybeans, while announcing an investigation into Qualcomm, initiated export controls of rare earth metals, and warned of retaliation against any actions by the United States. All this will have an impact on inflation in the United States at a time when the Federal Reserve is thinking of cutting interest rates. Analysts expect that the Fed will cut rates in the coming meetings. Therefore, the trade jitters and inflation worries mean that the Fed will not cut rates at a faster pace as expected. Will crypto prices go back up? Now, with the crypto market crash accelerating, the question is whether the prices will bounce back. History shows that crypto prices tend to bounce back after crashing in a certain period. For example, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market plunged after the tariff announcement on Liberation Day in April this year. A month later, the Bitcoin price rebounded and hit a new all-time high. Similarly, cryptocurrencies plunged at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and then staged one of the longest rallies after that. Additionally, there are potential catalysts in the crypto industry, including the upcoming altcoin ETF approvals, potential interest rate cuts, and buying the dip.

The analyst noted that a detailed chart will follow to illustrate this projection and stated that they are personally aligning with the bullish side of the probabilities, favoring the scenario that leads to a major price breakout. This analysis frames the current market situation as one defined by probabilities rather than certainties. This signals that while bullish momentum may dominate, traders should be cautious of possible downside movements. The statement suggests a balanced perspective, positioning optimism within a structured risk framework. #XRP – The ODDs 57% Vs 43%: The ODDs Are 57% To Major New ATH or 43% We are Going Much lower and you can Again buy #XRP below $1: I am Preparing A Chart and I am playing My Odds with the 57% To Major New ATH. Be Prepared for my post: pic.twitter.com/DhyJXOyC7l — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 14, 2025 Reactions from the XRP Community Following Egrag’s post, several community members weighed in with their views on the factors that could shape XRP’s direction. One user pointed to upcoming developments such as potential ETF approvals , the anticipated passage of a Clarity Act, and the possible removal of the cap on F Assets—changes that could enable staking and further token lock-up. They argued that if these events materialize, it would be difficult for XRP’s price to fall and remain suppressed, given the number of bullish developments expected to unfold. Another user expressed similar optimism, echoing the view that regulatory clarity and broader utility could position XRP for sustained upward momentum. In contrast, some questioned the likelihood of the asset ever dropping below $1 again, emphasizing the impact of recent legal victories, partnerships, and discussions around institutional adoption. One participant expressed frustration at the notion that investors might need to wait years for new highs despite multiple indicators of progress within the ecosystem.

Rather than declaring a definitive result, it weighs potential market scenarios based on technical and broader market dynamics. The 57% probability of a new all-time high underscores a cautiously optimistic stance, suggesting that the market could be approaching a turning point, while still acknowledging the 43% risk of retracement as a realistic scenario.

The project, estimated to cost upwards of $200 million, is the most considerable renovation that Trump is undertaking during his second term. Trump, who has envisioned the ballroom for years, said the White House needed it to host state dinners and foreign dignitaries. The president also claimed that Americans have long wanted it and are now going to get it. Construction on the 90,000-square-foot ballroom, with a capacity of approximately 650, began last month. All four sides of the proposed ballroom will be made of bulletproof glass, with everything from the window shape to its color and molding matching the White House. Trump called the attendees legends, saying they were all his very good and generous friends who helped build a “magnificent White House ballroom.” The guests included representatives from Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon , and Alphabet’s Google. Wealthy families and individuals, such as the Winklevoss brothers, the Adelson family, oil billionaire Harold Hamm, and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, were also in attendance. Trump says there is nothing like the White House The president said there is nothing like the White House to him, calling it just a special place that he and other Americans have to take care of. He also claimed that, as president, he has no zoning requirements and can do whatever he wants with the project’s construction. However, the project still needs approvals from the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission, but White House staff secretary Will Scharf claimed it is unnecessary. Trump opened the East Room’s curtains at one point to show where the ballroom construction is ongoing. He said the White House needed a real estate person like him to accomplish what seemed impossible for almost two centuries. White House officials have stated that the ballroom’s costs will be entirely covered by donations, rather than taxpayer money. “The White House for 150 years-plus, they wanted to have a ballroom, and it never happened because they didn’t have a real estate person.” – Donald Trump , President of the U.S. The ballroom construction is just one of the many projects the president has undertaken at the White House. He has redecorated the Oval Office and has paved over the Rose Garden grass. Trump unveils plans for a giant Triumphal arch The president used the dinner to showcase his latest vanity project, a giant triumphal arch featuring Lady Liberty, which he hopes to build after the ballroom is completed. He held up multiple miniature models for his guests to inspect, explaining that the national monument would be well-suited for the traffic circle at the end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which connects the Lincoln Memorial to Arlington National Cemetery. Trump wants the arch modeled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, to welcome people crossing the Memorial Bridge into the capital from Arlington National Cemetery. He posted illustrations of the plan designed by Harrison Design architect Nicolas Charbonneau on Truth Social. Charbonneau also posted a watercolor rendering of the project on social media with the caption, “America needs a triumphal arch!” The president announced that the triumphal arch will be ready by next year to commemorate the 250th anniversary of U.S. independence. He added that his administration did not want to dwarf anything, disclosing that leftover funds from the ballroom may be used for the arch, which he says will be beautiful. Trump has also mentioned other changes intended for the White House, such as updating the bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom and renovating the Palm Room, which connects the White House to the Rose Garden. Axios revealed that the president has ordered dioramas and models for other projects he is considering and has directed the placement and design of marble-tiled floors in the White House.

He had previously mentioned $15 billion a day, but a Treasury official confirmed that Bessent had been referring to a report from the Council of Economic Advisers. The report reveals that the government shuts down when Congress fails to pass appropriation bills or continuing resolutions to fund government operations by the fiscal year deadline on October 1. CEA also said a government shutdown occurs when current funding expires by the fiscal year deadline. Government shutdown reduces the U.S.’s quarterly GDP by 0.2% points each week Goldman Sachs estimated that government shutdowns reduce the U.S. economy’s quarterly growth rate by around 0.2 percentage points for each week the shutdown continues. The Federal Reserve also arrived at similar GDP projections amid the shutdown. The bank’s economic loss estimate amounts to roughly $15 billion per week if applied to current GDP levels. The figure is calculated by multiplying Goldman Sachs’ 0.2 percent estimate by the current GDP of $30.4 trillion, then dividing by 4. “We call on the moderate Democrats in the Senate to be heroes. Be heroes, break away from the hive of radicalism, and do something for the American people, because we are starting to cut into muscle here. We believe that the shutdown may start costing the U.S. economy up to $15 billion a week.” – Scott Bessent , Treasury Secretary of the U.S. The Trump administration is preparing for a lengthy government shutdown, as Republicans are gearing up to make moves to alleviate political pain that might come back on them while trying to make things hard for Democrats. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated on Monday that the government shutdown was poised to become one of the longest in history. Johnson also believes that the shutdown may be shorter in duration if Democrats accept the House-passed, GOP-written continuing resolution to fund the government. As the government shutdown passes two weeks, Johnson argues that Democrats should drop their partisan demands and pass a clean, no-strings-attached budget to reopen the government and pay our federal workers. Congressional leaders have engaged in a back-and-forth on government funding as Democrats pressure Republicans to make concessions on healthcare. Democrats are calling for the Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire in late 2025. Government plans to keep funding the military amid shutdown Goldman Sachs also estimates that a month-long shutdown would result in 43,000 additional unemployed individuals. The Trump administration is making efforts to redistribute funds to ensure the military gets paychecks during the shutdown. The initiative fulfills the GOP and Trump’s plans, but it also deprives Democrats of a vote to fund the military. Johnson dared Democrats on Tuesday to push back on Trump’s maneuverings, saying they can go to court and challenge troops being paid. The speaker defended the Trump administration and stated that it had the right to reallocate funds that had been appropriated by Congress to the Department of Defense. He also stated that the government could move funds from research and development accounts that had not been spent and that could be used for military pay. CEA revealed that the government plans to keep funding the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed that the Trump Administration will use funds from Section 32 tariff revenue to cover the nutrition program, which serves around 6 million participants per month. Senator Shelly Moore Capito believes that the shutdown will last for the long haul into November, potentially challenging the longest shutdown on record, a 35-day halt in funding from late 2018 to 2019. She called the continued shutdown disappointing and reiterated the GOP’s call for Democrats to reopen the government and engage in negotiations.

BitMine Adds $417 Million Worth of Ethereum to Treasury During Market Downturn The transactions were sent to three new addresses via seven transfers from Kraken and BitGo wallets. While BitMine hasn't officially announced the transaction, on-chain data suggests the transaction is linked to addresses belonging to the company. As of the latest update, BitMine's total Ethereum holdings stand at 3.03 million ETH. This amount is worth approximately $12.2 billion, making it the world's largest Ethereum treasure and the second-largest crypto treasure holder after Michael Saylor's Strategy.

The unexpected jump caught economists off guard, suggesting that the previously resilient labor market is starting to cool. The latest data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Thursday indicated a 14,900 increase in employment in September, falling short of forecasts for a rise of 20,000. Meanwhile, more Australians found jobs or started looking for one, slightly lifting the participation rate to 67%. The significant increase in joblessness is a sign of a cooling economy, as employers reduce hiring and consumer demand weakens. The increase from 4.3% to 4.5%, analysts say, is a sign that the month-to-month flow of hiring has entered a decisive turn following months in which employment growth went on steadily and uneventfully, mainly overlooked by markets, politicians, or millions of less at-risk workers. Full-time employment ticked down a step, with the increase in part-time jobs, which is often suggestive of weaker underlying demand, offsetting that decline. There are indications that the high interest rates, currently at 3.6%, are beginning to bite, economists say. Australia last had an unemployment rate at this level in late 2021, toward the end of the pandemic recovery. Markets bet on rate cuts Financial markets quickly absorbed the news. Australian three-year government bond yields 11 basis points in the sharpest one-day fall since May, as investors bet Australia’s central bank would be compelled to cut interest rates by November. The Australian dollar was down about half a percent, indicating an increased likelihood of easy monetary policy. The chances of a rate cut next month now sit at about 70%, according to Bloomberg data. The RBA will cut the cash rate to 3.35% if future figures, due later this month, show that price pressures are abating, economists believe. The economy was in a ‘pretty good spot’, and inflation should not drift out of the 2–3% target band over the course of the medium term, said Governor Michele Bullock in recent testimony to a parliamentary committee. However, she also noted that policy settings are still “marginally tight,” implying there is room to loosen them should growth falter. Minutes from the RBA’s September meeting showed that the board had dismissed a rate cut as counterproductive, citing fears that it might push up inflation again by tightening the labour market too much. But the latest unemployment numbers could alter that calculus. Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said the latest job figures likely paved the way for the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut interest rates sooner rather than later. He noted that the central bank would view the data as further evidence that its restrictive policy measures were successfully dampening demand. Global headwinds test Australia’s resilience The Australian economy has been slowing since early 2024, primarily due to reduced consumer spending and global uncertainty. The slowdown in China, the country’s biggest trading partner, has blunted exports — especially of iron ore and coal. Geopolitical tensions and shifting U.S. trade policies have also heightened uncertainty in global markets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently warned that Washington may continue its tariff freeze on Chinese imports, but warned that any new export controls by either party could still force fresh tensions between the two economic titans. For Australia, an extended slowdown in China could continue to weigh on demand for key exports and exacerbate domestic economic headwinds. Still, compared with other advanced economies, policymakers say Australia is in a good position. Inflation has moderated consistently, real wages are starting to increase, and population growth from immigration remains in place to support long-term demand. And yet, economists caution that the RBA has a difficult balancing act; lowering rates too soon might stoke inflation, and waiting too long might exacerbate the slowdown. ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch said the latest data highlighted the delicate balance the Reserve Bank of Australia had to maintain.

53213886,https://cryptonews.com/?p=439123,1760597890,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53213886.jpeg,Binance Finalizes Gopax Acquisition After Two-Year Regulatory Delay,https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-finalizes-gopax-acquisition-after-two-year-regulatory-delay/,"Binance has officially completed its acquisition of South Korean crypto exchange Gopax, marking its return to the country’s market after a two-year regulatory holdup. Key Takeaways: Binance has received final regulatory approval to complete its acquisition of South Korean exchange Gopax after a two-year delay. The approval follows Binance’s $4.3 billion U.S. settlement, which eased South Korea’s AML concerns. The acquisition allows Binance to re-enter South Korea’s market and resolve Gopax’s $47 million liquidity crisis. The move comes after South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) approved changes in Gopax’s executive structure, according to a report by local outlet MK . Gopax Filed Ownership Change Request After Binance’s Takeover in 2023 Gopax first submitted its request in February 2023, shortly after Binance secured a 67% majority stake in the platform. However, the approval faced repeated delays as regulators cited concerns over anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, particularly following Binance’s legal battles in the United States. In 2023, Binance faced lawsuits from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice for unregistered operations and AML violations. The exchange later reached a settlement, paying $4.3 billion in penalties and implementing stricter compliance measures. Observers believe that this resolution played a key role in easing South Korea’s regulatory hesitations. The FIU’s approval now paves the way for Binance’s re-entry into the Korean market, which it exited in 2021 amid tightening crypto rules. Gopax is one of only five domestic exchanges permitted to handle cash-to-crypto transactions, a regulatory status that requires robust KYC and AML systems. 4/ Whereas Gopax is one of the central exchanges severely damaged by @FTX_Official 's collapse, @Binance used IRI to invest in #Gopax . With #Binance 's investment, @GOPAX_kr will resume the customer withdrawal of deposited assets, including interests. pic.twitter.com/IVPx57Y20l — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 7, 2023 The acquisition also ties back to Gopax’s 2023 liquidity crisis. The exchange faced severe withdrawal issues when its DeFi partner, Genesis Global Capital, halted withdrawals and later filed for bankruptcy following the FTX collapse. Roughly $47 million in customer funds tied to Gopax’s GoFi deposit product were frozen as a result. Binance’s takeover was initially framed as a rescue effort, with the company pledging to inject funds and help affected users recover their losses. With regulatory approval finally granted, Binance appears ready to restore operations and rebuild investor trust in South Korea’s tightly regulated crypto landscape. As reported earlier this week, South Korean regulators reopened their review of Binance’s acquisition of Gopax, suggesting that the world’s largest crypto exchange could soon re-enter the country. South Korea Orders Crypto Exchanges to Halt Lending Services In August, South Korea’s financial regulator moved to rein in risky lending practices in the digital asset sector, ordering local exchanges to suspend all crypto lending services until a proper regulatory framework is established. The crackdown came amid South Korea’s broader pivot toward regulated crypto adoption. Authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country’s first spot crypto ETFs . President Lee Jae Myung’s administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs. More recently, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions. The service stores all deposited digital assets in cold wallets, entirely offline and insulated from internet-based threats, to shield holdings from cyberattacks and other external breaches.

Many traders from the XRP and Cardano communities are joining in, chasing what analysts describe as a hidden gem opportunity with up to 9,000% ROI potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem With Explosive Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured attention as one of the few verified and security-audited projects with growing traction in the altcoin space. It’s fully transparent, with HashEx and CertiK audits confirming its safety and legitimacy. The excitement is spreading fast — over 20,000 investors have already joined ahead of its exchange listing. Large whale wallets have been spotted accumulating, fueling even more attention and FOMO. The project’s model rewards early buyers, and the window to get in is narrowing quickly. To celebrate its surge in popularity, early investors now get a 50% bonus using the promo code PATRIOTS100X — but this is a limited-time offer that expires soon. Analysts tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE say its price, still under $0.0006, gives it far more upside than bigger coins like XRP or Cardano. If those major assets rise 3x–5x, MAGACOIN FINANCE could jump 7x–15x or even more , thanks to its smaller size and accelerating demand. With exchange listings expected soon, the next few days may define who enters before the next wave. To gain exposure, visit the official website. XRP: Analysts Set $5 Target for 2025 XRP continues to hold above $2.50 as traders anticipate a breakout toward $5 , according to analyst Professor Astrones . He described XRP’s current pattern as “pumpy,” pointing to tightening price action that often leads to upward movement. Another trader, CryptoWZRD , believes XRP’s long-term structure remains intact and expects a run to $4.50 , provided momentum holds. XRP has held its ground since July’s move to $3.66, with multiple analysts seeing it as one of the stronger large-cap coins heading into 2025. Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD has also drawn attention, as it may increase institutional use of XRP. Supporters argue this could create a supply squeeze that helps XRP break new highs. For traders, XRP remains one of the top names for steady growth in the coming cycle. Cardano (ADA): Bullish Pattern Points to $2 Target Cardano’s price has been under pressure, but analysts say it’s forming a symmetrical triangle pattern that could soon break to the upside. According to BorisCryptoUSA , ADA’s chart has tightened since peaking at $1.32 last year. A move above the upper boundary could send the price first to $1.20 , then toward $2 , marking a possible 194% gain if momentum continues. ADA recently dipped by 4%, reflecting overall market swings, but analysts maintain a positive outlook. As long as global conditions stay calm, Cardano could still finish the year on a strong note. Some experts caution that profit-taking could follow any sharp rally, but ADA’s fundamentals remain intact, keeping long-term holders confident. Final Take With XRP and Cardano setting up for solid gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight as the next breakout altcoin. Analysts call it one of the few early-stage coins with real upside before listings begin. Thousands are already in — and for a short time, new buyers get a 50% bonus using PATRIOTS100X at magacoinfinance.com.

This marks a 12% decline from its recent peak of $126,000, which raises concerns among market experts who suggest that the bull run may be closer to its end than many investors believe. End Of Bitcoin Bull Cycle Within Nine Days? On October 14, market analyst CryptoBirb, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to assert that the bullish cycle is nearing its conclusion, stating that it may end within the next nine days. He referenced the Cycle Peak Countdown indicator, which suggests that Bitcoin is 99.3% through its current cycle, having lasted 1,058 days. According to CryptoBirb, this final stage is characterized by a “textbook shakeout of weak hands,” a common pattern observed before market peaks. Related Reading: Tether Resolves Celsius Lawsuit With Major $300 Million Settlement Deal CryptoBirb emphasized that October 24 serves as a critical target date, just nine days away, and labeled the recent crash as “right on schedule.” He further explained that the market is deep within the peak zone, with 543 days elapsing since the last Bitcoin Halving, exceeding the historical peak window of 518 to 580 days. The sentiment in the market also appears to have shifted dramatically, with the Fear & Greed Index plummeting from 71 to 38, indicating a reset from fear to euphoria. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also dropped from 67 to 47, suggesting that this emotional washout may create an ideal launchpad for a final euphoric surge. However, technical indicators show mixed signals: while the Average True Range (ATR) has expanded to 4,040, indicating higher volatility, the RSI’s position at 47 suggests a reset momentum. What On-Chain Metrics Suggest Institutional investors have also begun to shift their strategies, as evidenced by recent Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) flows, which reversed from $627 million in inflows to $4.5 million in outflows. Ethereum ETF outflows reached $174.9 million, indicating that smart money is taking profits before retail investors potentially fear of missing out (FOMO) in. CryptoBirb asserts that this behavior aligns with a classic distribution-to-accumulation transition. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Holders Left In The Dark: Monad Protocol Faces Scrutiny Over MON Airdrop On-chain metrics reflect a cooling market, with the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) dropping to 0.522 from 0.556, and the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) declining to 2.15 from 2.45. These profit-taking actions may be creating the necessary space for a final euphoric push. When examining October’s performance, Bitcoin is down 2.09% month-to-date, contrasting sharply with its historical average of a 19.78% increase. This underperformance could actually be a bullish sign, suggesting that a significant move may still be on the horizon in the final weeks of the month. In summary, the current cycle appears to be 99.3% complete. It has already spent 25 days in the peak zone and experienced a reset in sentiment and institutional distribution, as well as weak performance in October. However, if the analyst’s thesis proves right, this blending could turn into a perfect storm for a final surge before entering a new crypto winter.

This week, MGX stamped its name onto the largest data center deal in history, a $40 billion takeover of Aligned Data Centers, a company that builds and runs hyper-scale infrastructure across North and South America. They’re not doing it alone. Elon Musk’s xAI, Microsoft, BlackRock, and Nvidia are all in. In September, MGX made another big splash, joining Oracle and Silver Lake in President Donald Trump’s push to get TikTok under U.S. control. MGX invests in record $40 billion Aligned Data Centers deal This week, MGX entered another huge move, taking part in a $40 billion acquisition of Aligned Data Centers, marking the largest data center transaction ever recorded. The buyer group includes Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock, and Elon Musk’s xAI. Aligned, which operates across North and South America, designs and runs facilities used by hyper-scalers and cloud providers. For MGX, this purchase ties directly into its participation in the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), a $100 billion collaboration between Microsoft, BlackRock, and others aimed at expanding U.S. data center capacity for AI workloads. Microsoft had already invested $1.5 billion in G42, MGX’s founding partner, to help develop regional AI capabilities in the Middle East using the Azure cloud platform. These partnerships create a global circuit between U.S. and Gulf capital, where sovereign-backed funds feed the massive energy and hardware requirements of generative AI systems. Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, said that U.S. firms are now working with Middle Eastern investors partly to keep them from financing China instead. “I believe in the Middle East … we either provide the goods or they will go to China,” Moorhead said. He added that MGX is following a similar path as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is using its oil wealth to diversify into advanced technology. “The amount of capital required is astronomical,” Moorhead said. “And they’re willing to take the risks.” Venture capital turns to sovereign funds amid fundraising crunch The current market has made it hard for startups to raise capital. “I think they will find real acceptance among VCs because people are comfortable with sovereign wealth,” said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Tusk Capital Partners. “This is a tough fundraising environment, so they’re a potentially good source of capital.” Still, Tusk warned that MGX’s growing alignment with Trump’s circle could expose it to political backlash if the White House changes hands. “The biggest risk is that the only narrative right now is they are Trump’s friends,” Tusk said. With Trump back in office, MGX’s political positioning could become both a strength and a liability depending on who holds power in Washington. For now, companies chasing compute are taking the money. Even tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are renting GPU capacity from firms such as CoreWeave instead of financing all their own facilities. MGX’s arrival simply gives them one more path to build faster. And in a world where AI infrastructure is measured in billions, every dollar—no matter where it comes from—now decides who dominates the next era of computing.

The revised filing, VanEck’s fifth amendment, cuts fees to 0.30% and introduces regulated staking, positioning the fund as one of the most innovative and cost-effective digital asset ETFs to date. VanEck Pushes Ahead With Solana ETF Featuring Staking Rewards The proposed VanEck Solana ETF (VSOL) aims to track the market performance of the Solana price while generating additional yield through staking, a first-of-its-kind structure for a U.S.-listed digital asset fund. The ETF will list on the Cboe BZX Exchange and delegate a portion of its holdings to approved validators like Gemini and Coinbase Custody, which will manage staking operations in regulated, insured environments. VanEck’s new filing also establishes a 5% liquidity buffer to protect investors during market volatility and ensure smooth redemptions, even when Solana’s native network experiences unbonding delays. The decision to include staking could attract institutional players seeking regulated yield exposure, with analysts calling the move a “pivotal bridge” between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. Despite the progress, SEC approval remains delayed amid the U.S. government shutdown, though Bloomberg’s James Seyffart noted that the ETF falls under the Generic Listing Standards, meaning there’s no fixed decision deadline. Institutional Accumulation Builds as Solana Price Holds Key Levels On-chain data shows whales withdrew over $169 million in SOL from exchanges this week, signaling accumulation rather than distribution. Treasury firms such as Solmate and SOL Strategies have reportedly purchased millions worth of SOL below $200, further confirming institutional confidence. Meanwhile, retail positioning remains strongly bullish, with over 76% of traders net long, a level historically linked to upward price reversals. Technically, the Solana price is consolidating near $210, holding above its ascending trendline support at $185. Analysts see this as part of a reaccumulation phase that could precede a larger breakout. CryptoJelleNL highlighted a “cup and handle” formation, suggesting potential upside toward the $300–$360 zone once resistance levels at $220–$230 are cleared. Grayscale Labels Solana “Crypto’s Financial Bazaar” In parallel, Grayscale Research has described Solana as “crypto’s financial bazaar,” citing its robust on-chain economy, low fees, and unmatched transaction throughput. The network now hosts over 500 active applications and generates roughly $5 billion annually in transaction fees, metrics that underpin its growing institutional narrative. With ETF momentum, whale accumulation, and strong network fundamentals converging, analysts agree that Solana’s next confirmed breakout could cement its position as one of the strongest large-cap performers heading into Q4 2025.

According to Lookonchain data drawn from Arkham, the ETH landed in three new addresses via seven transactions hailing from two wallets tied to Kraken and BitGo. BitMine did not publicly confirmed the move. With the latest addition, the firm now holds roughly 3.03m ETH , valued at about $12.2b. That growing position supports its mission to amass 5% of Ethereum’s total supply while reinforcing ETH’s role in capital markets. It looks like Bitmine( @BitMNR ) just bought another 104,336 $ETH ($417M). Over the past 7 hours, 3 new wallets received 104,336 $ETH ($417M) from #Kraken and #BitGo . Despite the crypto market crash, Tom Lee still predicts $ETH will hit $10K by year-end. https://t.co/KewyZ4cAeP … pic.twitter.com/Vn5b9ijP2Z — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 16, 2025 Tom Lee’s Bullish Ethereum Target Sparks New Optimism In Market Circles BitMine’s chairman Tom Lee, a longtime crypto bull, remains vocal about his price expectations. He said on a recent podcast that he sees ETH hitting $10,000 to $12,000 by year-end, describing the forthcoming rally as true price discovery rather than just a speculative spike. BitMine’s recent accumulation comes on the heels of an earlier record purchase. During a major crypto market dip, the company spent over $827m acquiring ETH , a timing that captured demand from panic sellers amid a weekend that saw $19b in leveraged positions liquidated . $200–$250k BTC and $10–$12k ETH by year-end? Tom Lee ( @fundstrat ) and Arthur Hayes ( @CryptoHayes ) share their price predictions, and why they think ETH could do a 2.5x in just 2 months. 2 Legends. Same ballpark. Are we ready for these levels by Dec 31? pic.twitter.com/DaMuzO2LdE — Bankless (@BanklessHQ) October 14, 2025 As Markets Await Rate Cuts, BitMine Deepens Its Ethereum Exposure Lee and other market watchers point to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, growing institutional adoption and clearer regulation as catalysts that could stoke further crypto gains. Ethereum itself is feeling the pressure of these dynamics. The asset last traded down 2.1% at $4,023. Still, it has gained nearly 55% over the past year, indicating both volatility and underlying demand. BitMine’s aggressive buying strategy mirrors growing corporate interest in digital asset treasuries. As more firms adopt ETH accumulation to diversify and hedge, the impact on supply dynamics and market psychology could be substantial. BitMine’s moves are already serving as a signal in the market, a reminder that large aggregate demand can shift narratives as much as price charts.

According to several screenshots shared on social media, the cyber attackers took over Dota 2’s YouTube channel to livestream a fake promotional event titled “Dota 2 Launch Official Meme Coin | Hurry Up.” Viewers of the fraudulent livestream were solicited to follow a PumpFun link advert of the new “dota2coin,” which falsely claimed to be in a collaboration with the MOBA games. The coin’s description even included a link back to the legitimate Dota 2 channel to make the scam seem more credible. Looks like Valve’s official Dota 2 YouTube channel was hacked by crypto scammers lmao pic.twitter.com/p82ReIPrWW — Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) October 15, 2025 Valve, the publisher behind Dota 2 , has not yet issued an official statement. However, the breach appeared to last only a short time before the fraudulent livestream was removed, with no reports of user data being compromised. Dota 2 community warn investors of fake memecoin On the r/DotA2 subreddit, users shared screenshots of the livestream saying that viewers were just bots, and warned others to avoid interacting with the scam. “Mods should pin it at the top of the sub ASAP. People will fall for this SCAM,” one Redditor wrote before confirming the livestream was eventually taken down. Another Redditor shared news about other esports YouTube accounts, including those for ESL , BLAST Counter-Strike , and the Esports World Cup , which were hacked around the same time. Later updates revealed that the Mobile Legends MPL Indonesia channel had also been under control by hackers briefly. “This is one hell of a coordinated attack,” the Redditor commented, speculating that the breaches might be related to ongoing technical issues affecting YouTube, or possibly to a security flaw in two-factor authentication systems on Android devices. Around the same period, YouTube users began reporting playback errors, according to a report from 9to5Google . When attempting to play videos on the platform or stream music on YouTube Music, they were met with the message “An error occurred. Please try again later.” Fake memecoin peaked at $7k market cap The fake Solana token, dota2coin, launched through Solana’s Pump.fun went live shortly before the hack occurred. At the time of this publication, the token was trading at $0.00000585, and its market cap had crashed to roughly $5,500. It is down about 16% from its brief peak shortly after launch, according to Pump.fun screener. According to on-chain metrics, the token had been hastily created within hours of the YouTube channel hack, with less than 3% bonding curve progress and one wallet holding more than 98% of the total supply. “Nobody is falling for that garbage anymore,” one X user posted. “I don’t even understand how celebrity coins can rally to millions. How can people be so stupid?” Security issues beyond YouTube While YouTube’s internal systems have not been officially linked to the incident, some cybersecurity researchers have been talking about a vulnerability in Android’s two-factor authentication mechanism. The YouTube downtime came against the backdrop of a new research revealing an Android exploit named Pixnapping, which can steal authentication codes and private data without the need of special permissions. As detailed by tech news outlet WIRED , Pixnapping was developed by academic researchers who studied its ability to extract sensitive data like chat messages, two-factor codes, and email content, from apps displayed on a user’s screen. The exploit captures visible data from other apps after a user installs a malicious application. “Anything that is visible when the target app is opened can be stolen by the malicious app using Pixnapping,” the researchers explained, “This allows a malicious app to steal sensitive information displayed by other apps or arbitrary websites, pixel by pixel.” Pixnapping has been successfully tested on Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S25 devices, and the security team believes tweaking it could extend its use to most Android phones. Google launched some updates last month, but the researchers confirmed that a modified version of the malware still functions even after the update.

Onchain Lens shared blockchain records showing the coins were split across multiple new wallets, with 50 wallets receiving about 37.5 BTC each and one receiving 121 BTC. The transactions were recorded at block height 919298, costing less than $6 in total network fees. On-chain data suggests the sender was a dormant address, meaning it hadn’t moved coins in several years. Such wallets are typically linked to early adopters or miners, often referred to as Bitcoin OGs. Their sudden activity usually attracts attention because their holdings can influence market sentiment if moved to exchanges. Just In: #Bitcoin OG has moved 2,000 $BTC ($222.13M) into 51 new wallets. Of these, 50 wallets received 37.576 $BTC each, while one wallet received 121.18 $BTC . https://t.co/hR8Dy1qOa9 https://t.co/k1htrLtCO4 pic.twitter.com/NTGinarEae — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) October 16, 2025 2,000 BTC Whale Move Seen as Custodial Reshuffle While Traders Eye Leverage Reset So far, on-chain data shows the coins haven’t reached any exchange addresses. This suggests no immediate intent to sell. Instead, the movement pattern points to internal management. The whale distributed funds to dozens of new wallets, a sign of a custodial reshuffle or security upgrade. Such steps are common among large holders seeking better privacy or updated wallet formats. The new wallets use SegWit, short for Segregated Witness. This Bitcoin upgrade, introduced in 2017, improves transaction efficiency, reduces fees and increases network capacity. Over the years, many long-term holders have gradually migrated to SegWit wallets as part of broader security and efficiency upgrades. Despite the large transfer, Bitcoin’s price held near $111,400, down 1%, showing little immediate market reaction. Analysts said structural demand for BTC remains firm even after last week’s $19b liquidation event that flushed out overleveraged traders . Doug Colkitt, initial contributor at Fogo, said that there’s “just a lot of leverage in the system.” “This happens in crypto periodically — leverage builds up, and then it all gets flushed,” he added. “It feels a lot like May 2021, where nothing obvious happened except that too many people had been leveraging up for months.” As Whales Shift Funds, Traders Load Up on Shorts Across BTC, ETH and SOL Still, the whale’s timing comes amid heightened market tension. Some traders interpret it as a precautionary shift, while others see it as a potential prelude to profit-taking if prices rebound. At the same time, bearish sentiment is growing on derivative platforms . Data from Lookonchain shows that one trader has opened a 3,440 BTC short position, worth around $392m, already sitting on $5.7m in unrealized gains. Two other large traders have built short books worth nearly $180m across assets including ETH, SOL, and DOGE, signaling cautious positioning among professional investors. Analysts believe the market remains in a fragile state, with the next leg likely to depend on macro drivers such as Federal Reserve policy, US–China trade dynamics and liquidity conditions.

Three names in particular are consistently topping the list of what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in, Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and the new coin on the block Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . XRP’s established network and growing adoption in cross-border payments continues to fortify its fundamentals, whilst the loyal following and better utility in payments in DOGE sustain its relevance in the market. But with the market in constant flux, the question remains what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in for the next big bull run and the answer may just be Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in Phase 6 of presale with over 65% sold out and $17.4 million in funds raised, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming a force to be reckoned with in the world of DeFi. Its revolutionary dual-lending model with real-world applications is setting it not just to beat Bitcoin in growth percentage terms in the years to come but to set new standards in 2025 in what constitutes successful crypto. XRP Price Prediction: Key Levels Indicate Bounce Back XRP broke the summer low with a stop-hunt wick before reversing back above rising support, now creating higher-low within rebound channel. Retracement above the base and zone of imbalance supports the resumption of the trend towards such upside objectives, with a breakdown below $2.50 potentially bringing the pullback back in the vicinity of $2.30. Whilst XRP positions itself in this potential reversal move, investors meanwhile are also taking notice of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been ranked among the best cryptos to buy this cycle. DOGE Price Analysis: Significant Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) is displaying signs of fresh bullish attention during the course of moving through major support and resistance areas in 2025. Following the recent consolidation at $0.198, the DOGE has tested higher momentum with vital resistance areas at $0.220 and $0.241 defining the short-term price action. A successful move through the latter could initiate the next leg higher, with any rejection potentially targeting the $0.198 or $0.174 support areas. Whilst analysts look at the momentum in DOGE, investors wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in for Q4 gains are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Surges in 2025, A Standout Coin Mutuum Finance is fast gaining increasing popularity among the best cryptos to buy now. The presale of the project remains on full throttle with more than 17,200 investors putting in over $17.4 million to the platform so far. The platform is currently in Phase 6 of presale with the token valued at $0.035. Already, the phase has surpassed more than 65% sellout with evidence of resilient demand coupled with increased investor confidence in the platform’s future potential. Among its next significant achievements, Mutuum Finance is going to introduce its lending and borrowing protocol , which may solidify it even more as a leading DeFi project. The initial version, V1, is expected to be launched on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature the platform’s core features such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot. These features will be the pillar of an accelerating and seamless decentralized finance platform. Mutuum Finance Leaderboard Heightens Investor Excitement Mutuum Finance has also generated fresh hype with its ever-vibrant leaderboard reward scheme meant to engage its investment community at all times. The top-five buyers in the previous 24 hours bought $8,860, $8,339, $1,187, $949, and $408 in MUTM tokens in the strongest indication of growing interest and project growth confidence. Each day the highest-ranked buyer is given the $500 MUTM bonus in appreciation of dedication and stimulating healthy competition among investors. In order to qualify, contestants just need to transact once in the 24-hour period without the playing ground biased in favor of anyone. More than 17,200 investors have invested $17.4M in Mutuum Finance’s presale, with phase 6 already 65% sold out. XRP and DOGE hold steady, but MUTM’s dual-lending concept and active leaderboard distinguish it. Get your tokens now and be an early bird for potential 2025 returns.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-xrp-holders-this-is-the-week-everything-changes-for-xrp-heres-why/,"Attention within the digital asset space has intensified as a crypto commentator, X Finance Bull, outlined what he believes may be one of the most consequential periods for XRP in recent years. With multiple regulatory and institutional events converging, the narrative focuses on whether long-awaited clarity and infrastructure readiness could finally align with market recognition. This is not being portrayed as a routine update, but rather as a critical phase where institutional validation may be tested. $XRP HOLDERS PAY ATTENTION HERE! The week everything changes for $XRP THIS IS IT! The most important week in XRP’s recent history. →ETF decisions hit October 18–25. Grayscale. 21Shares. Bitwise. Franklin Templeton. CoinShares. →All eyes on the SEC. All signals turning… pic.twitter.com/xmvK5yJLx9 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) October 14, 2025 Pending ETF Decisions and Regulatory Signals Central to the commentary is the upcoming window of exchange-traded fund decisions between October 18 and 25. Major applicants such as Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares are all awaiting responses from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A notable point highlighted is the SEC’s decision to shorten its review period to 75 days, interpreted as a sign of accelerated regulatory movement. Supporters believe these conditions could open the door for broader institutional exposure, should approval be granted. Legal Clarity and Market Readiness The resolution of Ripple’s longstanding legal battle, which confirmed that XRP is not classified as a security on secondary markets, remains a foundational factor in this outlook. According to X Finance Bull, this decision has effectively removed a major barrier, leaving the path open for institutional entry. The timing coincides with Ripple’s upcoming Swell conference , featuring participation from major financial firms, including BlackRock, with custody infrastructure reportedly being discussed. Globally, political sentiment is also shifting. Elections across regions such as Japan and the European Union have shown growing support for regulatory clarity and digital asset frameworks. In response, legislative efforts, such as the proposed Clarity Act , are becoming focal points for those who view these developments as prerequisites for institutional capital inflow. Real-World Asset Integration and Market Projections The perspective expressed is that this moment transcends traditional ETF narratives. Advocates argue that XRP’s ecosystem has already established real-world asset (RWA) pathways, liquidity corridors, and institutional-grade rails. They assert that infrastructure is no longer theoretical but operational, and that capital deployment is the final missing component. Price speculation was openly addressed, with projections ranging from a potential floor of $5 to significantly higher figures if widespread adoption follows. These statements reflect conviction rather than cautious optimism. However, not all observers share the same expectations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Seneschal, offered a contrasting view, pointing out that previous milestones—regulatory clarity, lawsuit resolution, and political recognition, such as President Trump’s inclusion of XRP in reserve discussions—have not yet translated into market performance. Awaiting Market Validation The divide between infrastructure progress and price reaction remains a key tension. Supporters argue that the market has yet to internalize developments built over a decade, while critics question what catalyst is required to trigger meaningful price movement. As the ETF review window approaches, XRP finds itself at a juncture where legal clarity, institutional interest, and regulatory structure are converging. What follows in the coming weeks may determine whether these foundational milestones evolve into tangible market impact or remain milestones awaiting recognition.

Key Levels Say It’s Coming,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-poised-to-beat-ethereum-key-levels-say-its-coming/,"XRP is trading at $2.42 with a 24-hour volume of $5.1 billion. The token has fallen 3% in the past day and 15% over the last week. While the short-term outlook in USD terms appears weak, current technical setups suggest XRP could outperform Ethereum soon. Falling Wedge Pattern Suggests Possible Reversal The XRP/ETH chart shows a falling wedge formation, according to CryptoBull. This setup features downward-sloping trendlines that gradually move closer together. The asset is currently near the lower support area at 0.0006 ETH. #XRP is about to reach the end in this giant falling wedge against Ethereum. This is a structure that usually moves to the upside suggesting that XRP will outperform Ethereum in the coming weeks! pic.twitter.com/C3EwcUc6dB — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 15, 2025 Remarkably, this pattern often marks the end of a downtrend. If XRP moves above the upper line of the wedge, it could start gaining on Ethereum. A move beyond the 200-day moving average, which still acts as resistance, would confirm strength. Until then, the price is trading in a narrowing range. In addition, XRP has also moved above a falling channel on the BTC pair. This channel has been in place since 2017. In late 2024, XRP broke through this structure and moved above the 50-period exponential moving average, based on the chart posted by EtherNasyonaL. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X After the breakout, price action shifted into a sideways range. This type of behavior is often seen when markets pause to gather strength. A recent pullback served as a test of the breakout zone. XRP stayed above the old resistance, which is now acting as support. This move suggests that buyers are still in control over the longer term. Range Between Key Historical Levels On the XRP/USD chart, the asset continues to move between $2 and $3.3. These are the highs from 2021 and 2017, respectively. According to analyst EtherNasyonaL, XRP remains in a reaccumulation phase. They wrote , “Price is stuck in the reaccumulation phase between the 2017 peak at $3.3 and the 2021 peak at $1.96.” This range is drawing attention from long-term holders. It is seen as a key area that could decide the next direction. If the asset breaks above $3.3, it may signal a much larger move ahead. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X Recent Partnerships Ripple has announced a new partnership with South Africa’s Absa Bank, which will use the former’s custody platform to manage tokenized assets. These include digital currencies and other blockchain-based products. This agreement gives Absa access to Ripple’s tech stack while helping it expand its presence in African financial markets. Meanwhile, filings related to crypto-based ETFs, including those involving Ripple, are still under review by the US SEC. The post XRP Poised to Beat Ethereum?

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025. Husky Inu has also raised $902,962 so far, as its official launch date of March 27, 2026, draws closer. Husky Inu (HINU) Gearing Up For Next Price Increase Husky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase, which is set to take place in just under eighteen hours. The price increase will see the value of the HINU token increase from $0.00021548 to $0.00021610. The project's regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system. Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off, helping empower the fledgling project’s community and allowing it to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy to reward early project backers and promote transparent growth. Fundraising On Track Husky Inu also crossed the $900,000 fundraising milestone last weekend, overcoming a significant slowdown in funding. The project struggled to raise funds as the cryptocurrency market faced selling pressure. As a result, investors adopted a wait-and-watch approach. However, fundraising was back on track as market sentiment improved, allowing the project to cross the $900,000 mark. Husky Inu adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, increasing the value of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to its dynamic strategy, Husky Inu has raised $902,862 so far, and could reach $900,000 before the end of the month. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25. Official Launch Date Approaching Husky Inu has experienced remarkable growth and interest over its presale and pre-launch phases. The community has grown in strength and numbers, thanks to the dedication and enthusiasm of each member. The project’s official launch date, March 27, 2026, is just over six months away. Our goal has always been long-term growth and success, not short-term hype. However, the possibility of an earlier launch is open.

This move marks the first time Coinbase has directly signaled support for the main asset of the Binance ecosystem. This development follows recent debates in the crypto industry regarding listing fees and transparency. Earlier this week, Binance denied “unfounded and defamatory” allegations by Coinbase Ventures-backed Limitless Labs CEO CJ Hetherington that the exchange was charging fees for token listings. Amid the controversy, Coinbase's head of the Base network, Jesse Pollak, drew attention by stating that listing fees on exchanges “should be 0%.” This statement sparked calls from the community for Coinbase to “lead by example” and list BNB for free.

Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said that the failure to list BNB was a loss for exchanges after Coinbase added BNB to its listing roadmap. CZ, in his X account, said that it is a natural step for any exchange to list BNB, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. CZ stated that it was a loss for an exchange not to list BNB and thanked his colleagues in the industry for their support. Citing Tron founder Justin Sun and Kraken exchange’s BNB shares, CZ wrote: “I noticed this. Thanks for the support from my colleagues in the industry. “Listing the 3rd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization makes perfect sense. It has excellent liquidity, volume, and ecosystem. Not listing it would be a loss for the exchange itself.” *This is not investment advice.

However, it has only seen losses in two of the past Octobers since 2013. The first was in 2014 when it shed 13% and the second one came in 2018 when it lost 3.8%. Both were bear market years. August has historically been the worst month for Bitcoin, while October and February have been the best. This is the third time in the last six years that BTC has been negative halfway through October, observed industry analyst Joe Consorti. All six times, it ended up green by October 31st, he said before adding, “There’s some hopium for you.” This is the 3rd time that BTC has been negative halfway through October in the last 6 years.

The asset has now fallen 12% from its all-time high and is down 9% over the past seven days as October losses mount this week. Chart expert “Bach” said that there were still no cautionary signals on the “Boombust framework,” which means “we haven’t reached that parabolic stage.” The last bullish signal came in April 2025 when markets started recovering from the big slump. “Still see $150,000 by year-end as a reasonable target,” he said. Meanwhile, crypto litigator Joe Carlasare predicted that the cycle would extend into next year. “This narrative about 4 4-year cycle/Q4/Uptober caused excessive long positioning, and the market almost never lets everyone win. Need to burn through that excess, frustrate the bulls, and then move higher throughout 2026.” Analyst ‘Tracer’ also pointed out that previous bull markets have seen big dumps before things took off, suggesting that more pain was to come.

You’ve got price up ~115% since last September, adding over $1 trillion in market cap. And the timeline still sounds like a funeral.” Bitcoin has closed above $100,000 for over 160 straight days, he said before adding that it “sure looks like structural acceptance.” “Time will tell, but if higher levels are coming, this range is the launchpad,” he concluded.

The tokenized fund will be available to institutional investors who meet VARA’s eligibility requirements. The Laser Carry Fund, when tokenized and fully licensed by Dubai’s VARA, will become the first institutional-grade RWA tokenized product offering under VARA. Each Tokenized LCF (TLCF) token will offer exposure to tokenized units of the Laser Digital Carry Fund SP, a Cayman Segregated Portfolio. The token will be available on one or more public blockchains through KAIO, while Komainu will act as the VARA-licensed custodian for the tokenized fund units. The token will also be made available on secondary markets on crypto exchanges selected by VARA Dubai. Jez Mohideen, Co-founder and CEO of Laser Digital , noted that the approval was a key step in responsibly delivering institutional-grade and composable RWA products to investors. He added, “We’re pleased to launch this product under VARA, building upon our shared commitment to higher governance and robust investor policies in active on-chain asset management.” The token can be subscribed to and redeemed during pre-set windows, with pricing linked to LCF’s net asset value. Secondary trading will be enabled on selected exchanges and trading venues, subject to necessary compliance controls. LCF token is the first of a series of RWA asset management tokens built on the VARA ARVA Framework, with further upcoming plans to expand the offering to other institutional asset management products. QNB Group launches regulated tokenized market fund Earlier this year, QNB Group (Qatar National Bank), Standard Chartered, and DMZ Finance, an RWA tokenization infrastructure provider, launched the Dubai International Financial Centre’s (DIFC) first regulated tokenized money market fund, the QCD Money Market Fund (units in QCDT). The fund’s underlying investment is managed by QNB Group, the largest bank in the Middle East and Africa, with DMZ Finance serving as co-initiator and exclusive provider of tokenization infrastructure. The fund appointed Capricorn Fund Managers (DIFC) Limited (CFMD) to act as the fund manager, while Standard Chartered serves as custodian of the QCD Money Market Fund, providing custody of the underlying assets. In 2024, Standard Chartered officially launched its regulated digital asset custody services in the DIFC. Soon after, Bybit became the first crypto exchange to deploy QCDT as collateral, creating up to USD 1 billion in borrowing capacity, providing new opportunities for institutions. Bahrain also launches a tokenized investment platform In Bahrain, ATME, the crypto and digital asset exchange licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), also introduced a regulated tokenized investment product platform that enables brokers and asset managers to issue and trade investment products directly on its platform. The region and globe are opening up to the tokenization of financial products and services. Nasdaq-listed DeFi Technologies has entered the MENA region with offices in the UAE to offer not only digital asset ETPs , but also tokenized equities.

His remarks capture the growing belief among XRP advocates that a major transformation in global finance is underway. Aljarrah alluded to a series of fundamental changes that could reshape the economic order, including a revaluation of gold, a global debt reset, and a collapse in institutional trust — all of which, in his view, position XRP as a key bridge in the emerging financial era. This perspective aligns with a broader narrative developing within both digital and traditional financial circles. It suggests that the convergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) is not a distant concept, but an evolving reality. The implication is that assets such as XRP may play a central role in enabling global liquidity and facilitating cross-border settlements during this shift. The @Ripple Effect begins. Gold revalues, debt resets, trust collapses, and #XRP bridges what’s next. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 14, 2025 Interpreting the Message Behind the Statement Aljarrah’s message carries the essence of a systemic evolution, where trust in conventional financial systems is weakening while digital assets gain credibility. The reference to gold revaluation and debt restructuring reflects concerns about the sustainability of fiat-based economies and mounting global debt levels. Within this context, XRP is viewed by many as a technological bridge capable of facilitating value transfer in a digitized economy that requires speed, scalability, and interoperability. His remarks resonate with a portion of the financial community that sees XRP as an institutional-grade asset , designed not only for retail speculation but also for the infrastructure of international payments. The statement describes a scenario in which confidence in legacy systems declines and the world looks toward blockchain-based solutions that offer transparency and efficiency. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Response and Supporting Perspectives Among those responding to Aljarrah’s post was Wall Street Pigeon, who emphasized that discussions about traditional market cycles and market capitalization metrics may soon become outdated. He noted that the true intersection of DeFi and TradFi could be realized through XRP’s utility, enabling instant movement of value across global networks. His comment underscores a shift in mindset, where financial relevance is determined by utility and speed rather than speculative valuation. The Road Ahead The growing alignment between digital innovation and institutional finance suggests that Aljarrah’s forecast may not be purely theoretical. The increasing integration of blockchain-based solutions within traditional systems demonstrates that this transformation is actively unfolding. Aljarrah’s statement encapsulates a pivotal moment in the transition toward a new era of finance — one where trust, value, and technology converge to redefine the structure of global exchange.

The company posted net income of NT$452.3 billion, above estimates of NT$417.69 billion, while revenue reached NT$989.92 billion, surpassing projections of NT$977.46 billion. That’s a 30.3% increase from a year earlier and a 13.6% jump from the previous quarter, its second consecutive quarter of profit gains. TSMC’s CEO CC Wei said the market’s momentum remained solid, with consumer adoption of AI models continuing to drive the need for greater computing capacity and, by extension, more semiconductors. Big tech companies like Nvidia and Apple have long relied on TSMC’s high-end processors for their AI products. TSMC lifts 2025 forecast and details performance of advanced chips Wei told investors that TSMC had raised its 2025 revenue forecast to the mid-30% range, compared to its earlier estimate of 30% made in July. The company’s high-performance computing division, which covers AI and 5G applications, brought in 57% of total sales for the July–September quarter. The company said that chips sized 7-nanometer or smaller accounted for 74% of total wafer revenue. These are the most advanced nodes TSMC produces, and they form the backbone of today’s AI infrastructure. Analyst William Li from Counterpoint Research said: “TSMC’s robust earnings are a direct reflection of the strong traction at 3nm as well as high utilization at 4/5nm – both of which are being driven by ongoing orders from AI GPU and HPC customers and premium smartphone platforms.” According to CNBC, TSMC’s factories are the primary source of the chips that run the largest machine learning systems and next-gen smartphones. And despite current supply chain challenges, TSMC has maintained steady utilization rates across its advanced nodes. TSMC faces U.S. trade pressure and export restrictions TSMC also addressed the U.S. tariff situation in the earnings report, confirming that it is watching policy discussions closely as Taiwan negotiates for a lower reciprocal rate. In Wei’s words: “We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies, especially in consumer-related and price-sensitive market segments.” TSMC said it would continue to plan accordingly. To reduce exposure to tariffs, the company has increased its investments in U.S.-based facilities, a move aimed at localizing more of its operations. But new challenges are emerging. The U.S. government has revoked the company’s Validated End User (VEU) waiver, which had previously allowed it to export chipmaking equipment to its Nanjing plant in China without a special license. That privilege will officially end on December 31. The VEU waiver had been granted shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department began restricting exports of U.S.-origin chipmaking tools in 2022. Now, all such shipments to TSMC’s Chinese facilities will need export licenses. “While we are evaluating the situation and taking appropriate measures, including communicating with the U.S. government, we remain fully committed to ensuring the uninterrupted operation of TSMC Nanjing,” the company said. Other chipmakers have been affected too. South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung both lost their VEU privileges in the same round of actions. The Bureau of Industry and Security said it was closing what it called the “Biden-era loophole” for all foreign semiconductor producers, tightening control over advanced chip exports to China.

Bitcoin Is Currently Being Dominated By New Capital In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the share of the Bitcoin whale Realized Cap held by the short-term holders. The Realized Cap here is an on-chain indicator that measures, in short, the total amount of capital that the BTC investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. Changes in this metric reflect the incoming or outgoing of capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests STH Cost Basis Again: Is This Where Support Flips? In the context of the current topic, the Realized Cap of only a portion of holders is of interest: the whales. These are the entities carrying more than 1,000 BTC (about $111.4 million) in their balance. Whales can be further broken down into cohorts on the basis of holding time. Whale-sized holders who bought their coins within the past 155 days are known as the short-term holder (STH) or new whales. Similarly, those who have a holding time higher than this cutoff are called the long-term holder (LTH) or old whales. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows how the Bitcoin Realized Cap dominance of these two groups has changed over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, new whales have rapidly gained ground in the Bitcoin Realized Cap recently and hit a dominance of 44%. The STH whales represent the big-money capital that has come into the coin over the last 155 days. Thus, it would appear that 44% of the capital stored on the BTC network is currently “fresh.” This is the largest share of the whale Realized Cap that the STHs alone have occupied in the cryptocurrency’s history. To put things into perspective, the 2021 bull run topped out at a value of 31%. The STH whales gain Realized Cap dominance through two means: a transfer of coins between members of the cohort at a higher price and selling from the LTH whales. LTH whales are the resolute hands of the market who hold out through volatile periods in wait for profitable exit opportunities. These smart-money investors usually ramp up their selling during bull runs and transfer their coins to new money coming into Bitcoin. As long as demand is high enough to absorb this distribution, the rally continues, but once capital inflows drop off, the asset hits a top.

According to the city’s announcement, Mayor Eric Adams signed Executive Order 57 to set up the Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology. The office will be the first-ever municipal body in the United States dedicated solely to these technologies. Moises Rendon was named Executive Director. Reports say the office will report to the city’s Chief Technology Officer. New Crypto Office: 5 Main Functions According to the executive order , the new office has five main duties. It will guide city policy on digital assets, coordinate across agencies, run public education programs, explore how blockchain could help city services, and work with the NYC Economic Development Corporation to draw business and jobs. The move is described as an attempt to balance consumer protection and broader access. Some of the work will focus on helping underbanked New Yorkers understand risks like fraud and scams. City Hires Policy Expert To Lead Effort Based on reports , Rendon has previously worked inside city government on technology and policy issues, most recently as a policy advisor in the Office of Technology and Innovation. He will be expected to connect city departments that touch payments, records, and technical projects. Coordination is part of the mandate. Agencies will be asked to align their approaches so residents and companies face less confusion when they deal with city services that involve tokens, wallets, or blockchain records. Plans To Educate And Protect Residents Reports have disclosed that one major aim is public education. The office will create outreach programs to explain what digital assets are, how they work, and what dangers exist. That is meant to lower the chance that consumers fall for scams or lose savings to hacks. It will also study possible blockchain uses for public records and secure data sharing. Some projects will be exploratory and may require partnerships with private firms or universities. According to city statements, the crypto office will coordinate with state and federal regulators rather than try to replace them. It will offer advice to the mayor and act as a single point of contact for industry groups that want to work with the city. A Crypto Advocate Adams has long backed cryptocurrency . When he became mayor in January 2022, he converted his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum, a move that drew mockery from many.

Key Takeaways: YZi Labs led a $50 million seed round for BPN to build onchain liquidity pools and expand stablecoin payment infrastructure. BPN’s hybrid CeDeFi system aims to cut cross-border settlement time from days to hours. The startup plans to launch a DeFi FX market supporting up to 20 regional stablecoins. The funding marks one of the largest early-stage rounds in the payments sector this year and signals a major bet on CeDeFi (centralized-decentralized finance) infrastructure for emerging markets. BPN to Use $50M Funding to Build Onchain Liquidity Pools According to Thursday’s announcement , BPN will use the capital to build onchain liquidity pools and market-making systems to support stablecoin-to-stablecoin transactions. The company, built on BNB Chain, integrates traditional financial compliance with DeFi automation to enable real-time minting, swapping, and settlement of fiat-backed stablecoins across different jurisdictions. BPN’s model seeks to solve a long-standing inefficiency in international payments. Traditional fintechs rely on pre-funding, holding large sums in local accounts just to ensure liquidity. BPN’s hybrid CeDeFi system replaces that with real-time stablecoin issuance, freeing trapped capital and cutting settlement time from days to just a few hours. The company claims transaction costs can drop from roughly 2% to 0.3%, creating a cheaper, faster, and more inclusive payment network. Rica Fu, BPN’s founder, said the startup’s “multi-stablecoin liquidity model offers a more inclusive and efficient alternative to USD-centric payment systems.” why better payment network (BPN)? – a faster, cheaper and more scalable end-to-end solution built natively on @BNBCHAIN – founding team with both traditional payments and web3 expertise – real-world impact https://t.co/AavRxKN22J — Dana @YZi Labs (@DanaBuidl) October 16, 2025 The platform already facilitates transactions across corridors such as Brazil (BBRL), Nigeria (cNGN), Mexico (MEXAS), and the Eurozone (EURI), helping enterprises and licensed payment institutions complete compliant, KYC-aligned transfers. In addition to its regulated CeFi layer, BPN plans to launch a DeFi FX market by the end of the year. The permissionless protocol will support up to 20 regional stablecoins across Latin America, Africa, and Asia, allowing users to swap stablecoins, farm liquidity, and earn yield without intermediaries. Dana H., Investment Partner at YZi Labs, described BPN as “a true game-changer for cross-border payments,” saying it delivers instant settlement, cost savings, and scalability that “could outperform both traditional Web2 players and fragmented Web3 solutions.” The investment fits YZi Labs’ broader thesis of backing next-generation financial infrastructure that places stablecoins at the core. White House Weighs Pardon for Binance Founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao The White House has reportedly intensified discussions over a potential presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, according to an October 12 New York Post report. Sources cited by Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino claim that President Donald Trump is “leaning toward a pardon,” despite concerns among advisors about how it could appear given his financial ties to the crypto industry. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain adequate anti-money laundering controls at Binance, leading to his resignation as CEO. The talks come nearly a year after Zhao publicly hinted he “wouldn’t mind a pardon” following President Joe Biden’s controversial decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, in 2024. The potential pardon has already sparked backlash from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who sent a letter to White House Counsel David Warrington and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, warning that Zhao’s request raises “urgent concerns about the integrity of the justice system.” The post CZ’s YZi Labs Leads $50M Round for Stablecoin Payments Firm BPN appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Binance|Payment|YZi Labs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-16 08:16:01

The size of the move, roughly $173.6 million at recent prices, makes it one of the larger single-day shifts of XRP in recent months and sparked questions about intent and market impact. Blockchain data shows the coins moved to a Ripple subwallet, not a public exchange, reducing immediate sell-off concerns. Notably, such internal transfers are often linked to operational liquidity management, including routing funds for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors that facilitate cross-border payments. Therefore, this can be viewed as routine liquidity activity rather than a market dump. Additionally, large internal XRP transfers often signal broader operational strategies, such as supporting liquidity corridors, institutional products, or ecosystem initiatives. Yet these moves frequently spark speculation, from traders, influencers, and crypto media, amplifying market volatility regardless of the transfer’s actual purpose. XRP Faces Short-Term Pullback as Technical Indicators Signal Potential Rebound According to crypto pundit Naveed Ahmad, XRP witnessed a dip to $2.5017, marking a 0.06% decline following the emergence of a Change of Character (CHoCH) pattern, a technical signal often hinting at a potential market shift. The move saw XRP break below its Equal Low (EQL) level, suggesting that short-term bearish momentum may be gaining traction after a strong run earlier in the month. The CHoCH pattern, closely watched by technical traders, typically represents the first sign of a possible trend reversal. In XRP’s case, the break below the EQL level indicates that bullish momentum may be weakening, allowing sellers to temporarily gain control. However, Ahmad notes that this phase could also be part of a broader market consolidation, rather than the start of a full-fledged downtrend. XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) now hints at potential oversold conditions. This momentum indicator, which gauges the speed and magnitude of price moves, suggests selling pressure may be waning, raising the possibility of a near-term rebound. Furthermore, the $2.40 support is presently the one to watch because a hold could spark renewed buying, while a break may trigger deeper corrections before accumulation resumes with the price standing at $2.41. Conclusion Ripple’s 70 million XRP transfer may raise eyebrows, but on-chain data points to an internal liquidity adjustment rather than a market sell-off. The move highlights Ripple’s active reserve management to support operational needs, including cross-border payment corridors and strategic initiatives. Meanwhile, XRP’s recent dip underscores the tension between short-term bearish pressure and rebound potential. The CHoCH pattern signals caution, RSI points to oversold conditions, and $2.40 serves as a key support. Holding this level could spark bullish momentum, while a breakdown may trigger deeper corrections.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-16 08:18:13

The Ethereum Foundation confirmed that its network remains the “ #1 ecosystem for new developers in 2025 ” and hosts 31,869 total active developers, nearly double the number of active developers on Solana, which stands at 17,708. Source: X/@ethereumfndn However, Solana added 11,534 new developers and grew the total developer count by 83% year-over-year, claiming the “#1 ecosystem for new developers” title in Electric Capital’s 2024 annual report . The competing claims show a perception gap where Ethereum leads in absolute numbers, while Solana dominates in terms of growth momentum and market attention. Bitcoin ranked third with 7,494 new developers and 11,036 total active contributors. Total crypto developers declined 7% in 2024, yet established developers with 2+ years of experience reached all-time highs, growing 27% and committing 70% of code. The developer data contrasts with compensation realities. Protocol Guild revealed that Ethereum core developers earn a median salary of $140,000, which is50-60% below market rates, averaging $359,000. One developer turned down a $700,000 package to continue working on Ethereum core. Compensation Crisis and Regional Shifts Ethereum maintained #1 ecosystem status on every continent for total developer activity, with Asia now leading global developer share ahead of North America. India onboarded the most new crypto developers in 2024, while U.S. developer share dropped to 19% from 38% in 2015. According to Electric Capital’s 2024 report, one in three crypto developers now works on multiple chains, up from under 10% in 2015. Base contributed 42% of the new code written in the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite leading developer additions, Ethereum faces challenges in retaining its developers. Protocol Guild has distributed over $33 million since May 2022, with the median contributor receiving $67,121 annually. This brought the total median compensation to $207,121, which is still 33% below market. Almost 40% of Ethereum core developers received external job offers from rival networks in the past year, offering higher packages. Researchers earned the highest median cash compensation at $215,000, while client developers earned around $130,000. Notably, a report last month found that Latin American developers strongly prefer Ethereum and Polygon , according to a survey by Sherlock Communications. Developers across Latin America are increasingly choosing to build on well-established blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon. #Ethereum #Polygon https://t.co/QLoL67MRug — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 11, 2025 The study of 85 developers found Ethereum accounted for over 75% of blockchain activity between June 2024 and June 2025, with Polygon rising from 11% to 20%. Luiz Eduardo Abreu Hadad, a blockchain researcher at Sherlock Communications, noted that developers show “ strong technical maturity ” and focus on “ solving real-world problems ” within trusted ecosystems, rather than building new platforms. Crypto Salaries Decline Despite Rally as Executive Pay Surges Amidst this change in developer preference, crypto salaries declined across nearly all roles in 2024-2025 despite Bitcoin’s record rally, according to Dragonfly Capital. Entry-level positions bore the brunt of cuts, while executive compensation surged, creating what Dragonfly called “a barbell effect.” International engineering executives out-earned U.S. peers for the first time at $530,000 to $780,000. Product Management executives posted the highest salaries, ranging from $390,000 to $484,000. Founder salaries increased 37% to $197,000 from $144,000 in 2023. However, mid-level roles experienced flat growth while entry-level roles absorbed the steepest cuts. Source: Dragonfly Engineering-led growth with 78% of teams expanding, though compensation drove 83% of offer declines. Web3 developers commanded premium paychecks despite the pullback. North American salaries ranged from $120,000 to $250,000, Europe offered $82,400 to $185,400, and the Asia-Pacific region paid $70,000 to $150,000. Specialized roles remained premium. Zero-knowledge cryptographers commanded annual salaries of $300,000, blockchain developers earned between $150,000 and $210,000, and smart contract engineers made between $160,000 and $250,000 for senior positions. Geographic expansion accelerated as 81% of companies adopted a global-first hiring approach. Asia’s presence nearly doubled from 20% to 41% year-over-year. Work policies remained 54% fully remote, 30% hybrid, and only 2% fully in-office.

Trump’s comments blindsided executives at state-owned and private refineries across India, leaving them waiting for official guidance from New Delhi. Some allegedly said they had received no communication from ministries or the Prime Minister’s Office, but many began cutting imports to avoid potential fallout, with executives from three major refiners said Russian shipments to India will fall “in the short term,” per Bloomberg. They explained that no one had anticipated Trump’s statement, and companies are now trying to understand whether Modi’s alleged promise reflects a shift in policy or a political soundbite. Refiners assess risk amid U.S. pressure The uncertainty is already forcing Indian Oil Corp., the country’s largest refiner, and Reliance Industries Ltd., the biggest private player, to review every ongoing crude contract. People familiar with the situation said both companies are looking closely at their exposure to Russian barrels and possible sanctions from Washington. The U.S. has repeatedly accused India of helping Moscow by keeping trade alive, a claim that’s now driving new tariffs against the South Asian nation. Trump’s administration has intensified pressure on allies to cut ties with Russia’s energy sector. For India , that means balancing cheap oil imports with the risk of losing access to U.S. markets. Modi’s government has walked a fine line for months—sometimes reducing imports to calm Washington, or buying more to keep prices low at home. The Prime Minister hasn’t addressed Trump’s claim, and officials say no new directive has been issued yet. A refinery executive said everyone is watching what happens next. “We might get an order tomorrow, or we might get silence,” he said. Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, discounted Russian crude has become one of India’s biggest energy lifelines. Now refiners worry that those discounts may disappear if Trump follows through with tougher trade penalties. U.S. targets Japan as G7 eyes tighter curbs Meanwhile, Washington is also tightening its grip on Japan . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said after a meeting with Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato on Wednesday that Trump’s administration expects Tokyo to stop importing Russian energy. “Minister Kato and I also discussed the Administration’s expectation that Japan stop importing Russian energy,” Scott said on X. The meeting took place in Washington, alongside IMF, G7, and G20 finance gatherings. At the meeting, Kato told reporters that Japan “will do what it can in coordination with G7 countries to achieve peace in Ukraine.” Japan agreed to phase out Russian oil in line with the 2022 G7 sanctions, but to this day, it still imports Sakhalin Blend crude, tied to LNG output from the Sakhalin-2 project, in a blend that remains critical, covering about 9% of Japan’s LNG demand. Earlier this month, the G7—the U.S., Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy—decided to coordinate new sanctions targeting countries buying Russian oil. Japan also cut its price cap for Russian oil to $47.60 per barrel from $60, matching the European Union’s July adjustment. Between January and July, Japan bought 95,299 kiloliters, or 599,413 barrels, of Russian crude—just 0.1% of its total imports. Meanwhile, Washington keeps pushing allies to buy American LNG, pointing to the yet-to-be-built $44 billion Alaska LNG project. Japan has already signed new gas deals with U.S. suppliers but hasn’t committed to Alaska’s project yet. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

One major trendline and one major support level are all that prevent Bitcoin from a further big dip to the downside. Could $BTC start to gain strength against gold? Bitcoin continues to look weak as gold and silver show amazing strength during this current period of sometimes intense uncertainty as President Trump ramps up and then cools down the war of words with China. This said, both gold and silver are heavily overbought now while Bitcoin is becoming oversold. Could Bitcoin finally start to recover from here? Source: TradingView The BTC/XAU chart in the daily time frame puts things into perspective. Yes, BTC/XAU has just crashed out of the descending channel, a very bearish turn of events, but the breakdown has not been confirmed yet. Also, the ratio has just encountered a strong support level at 26 oz, while an even more robust support level is just below at 24.6 oz. Given that the daily Stochastic RSI indicators have hit the bottom, it might be expected that the Bitcoin/gold ratio might start to turn in Bitcoin’s favour from here. Is $BTC about to drop to last key support level? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for the $BTC price shows that the bears look to have succeeded in flipping the $112,000 level into resistance. At the same time, the price is now tracking sideways under the major trendline. This is not a good turn of events and could herald a drop to the last major support at $108,000. The Stochastic RSI indicators are heading up, but if this bearish price action continues they would turn back around and head to the bottom, perhaps getting there at the same time as the price reaches the major support level. Could this then signal the bottom? Quite possibly, as Bitcoin would become very oversold. That said, if the Trump/China trade war hits another bad moment this could be enough to send Bitcoin even lower. 200-day SMA could be last line of support Source: TradingView The daily time frame draws attention to how the $BTC price is teetering below what is now horizontal resistance at $112,000, with a fall to the last major support at $108,000 a real possibility. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) has come into play already, acting as support for last Friday’s crash. It may well be that this moving average becomes support once again, especially as it converges with the $108,000 horizontal level. Ascending trendline has to hold Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for the $BTC price says it all. The ascending trendline has to hold in order for the uptrend to survive. Yes, there is the possibility that the price could fall through the trendline and even dip below the $108,000 major support level, but it would have to be bought back up again to avoid going into a potential tail spin that could drag the crypto market into the next bear market.

Recent commentary from Tech and Crypto enthusiast, TheXRPguy, has brought renewed attention to the psychological resilience required of XRP holders . Rather than focusing solely on price projections, the tone of recent community remarks highlights the mental preparedness needed for the unpredictable movements ahead. The emphasis is on emotional discipline, as many long-term supporters believe that the most significant tests are not only financial but psychological. XRP Holders Your emotions are about to be messed with You need to be mentally prepared for what is coming. — TheXRPguy (@TheXRP_guy) October 13, 2025 Community Perspectives on Market Reactions Several XRP holders have voiced their readiness for extreme scenarios, indicating a firm stance despite potential sharp fluctuations. One user, identified as Mark 73, conveyed a straightforward approach: if the market dips, accumulation continues; if it rises, long-term satisfaction remains. This sentiment reflects a broader mindset among committed participants who prioritize long-term conviction over short-term outcomes. Another user, M.N., reinforced this position by stating that downward pressure would be viewed as an opportunity rather than a setback. The remarks suggested a deliberate distance from immediate financial reliance, asserting that holdings are not intended for liquidation in the near future. This attitude embodies a core belief within a segment of the XRP community that true gains may only be realized over an extended period. Strategic Patience and Psychological Testing A further perspective came from a user known as Bible_Thumper, who noted an expectation of calculated market movements designed to unsettle inexperienced holders. The view expressed was that price action might deliberately reach levels intended to trigger emotional reactions, prompting premature exits. According to this view, resilience lies in withstanding both euphoric surges and unsettling drops, with the greatest benefit reserved for those who maintain composure. These statements collectively emphasize a readiness not just for financial volatility but for psychological challenge. The underlying belief is that rapid shifts—upward or downward—could tempt individuals into decisions against their long-term intentions. Community members argue that only those who remain steadfast through manipulation and uncertainty will ultimately realize the benefits they anticipate. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Call for Mental Preparation The core message conveyed through TheXRPguy’s focus is clear: holding XRP is not merely an investment choice but a test of conviction. It is not an encouragement of irrational optimism, but a reminder that emotional reactions may prove more costly than market cycles themselves. The anticipation of extreme price movement is accompanied by warnings that emotional discipline will become increasingly vital. As the digital asset landscape moves toward potential pivotal developments, XRP holders are reminded that preparation extends beyond market charts. The commentary highlights that the upcoming period may challenge holders beyond valuation. Whether prices experience sudden rises or declines, those expressing their perspectives insist that preparation and patience will define the outcome for committed participants.

Trump family-backed crypto ventures encompass memecoins, stablecoins, trading cards, and decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms. Per the Financial Times , the TRUMP and MELANIA coins, memecoins tied to himself and his wife, reportedly generated around $427 million. Meanwhile, WLFI token sales fetched approximately $550 million. The stablecoin project USD1, one-to-one backed by US Treasuries, has raised $2.71 billion from the company’s gains from reserves and fees. “USD1 is very important to us and that should be very important, frankly, to anyone,” said Zach Witkoff, CEO of World Liberty Financial, at Token2049 event in Singapore early this month. Trump Family ‘Crypto Empire’ and Affiliated Investors The investigation revealed that private investors have poured billions into the Trump family-backed crypto empire. For instance, Chinese blockchain entrepreneur Justin Sun invested $75 million in WLFI. But later faced a wallet blacklist impeding him from transferring WLFI tokens. Besides, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund-backed MGX reportedly provided $2 billion in funding to Binance, using USD1 stablecoin. Further, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), which was previously under loss, raised billions in 2025 to launch a utility token and a digital wallet . The firm has transformed into a $3 billion cash generator, where over 50% is owned by Trump. Crypto-Friendly Policy Moves, Market Surge Promoted Family Branding Trump family members, including his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, have actively promoted their crypto ventures using the family brand and political influence, the FT report noted. “My father was the first guy to run as sort of a pro crypto president. He saw the need,” said Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Trump, during a panel at Token2049 Singapore. The family has also capitalized on public events to tout their tokens and boost their values. In May, the President scheduled a private dinner, limiting entry to the top 220 buyers of the memecoin, with total purchases exceeding $150 million . Besides, pro-crypto policy moves from the White House since the start of Trump’s tenure have grabbed attention, coinciding with a surge in Bitcoin and other token prices. “A year ago, on this very stage, they were making fun of what we’re trying to do, and now we’re the fastest-growing crypto ventures ever,” Donald Trump Jr. added. “You know, I think we’re doing pretty good, and like, as I said, we’re gonna deliver on the promises that we made. We’re gonna keep going. We have one of the greatest teams imaginable, and because we’re not just trying to do it ourselves.” The post Trump Family Earned $1B in Pre-Tax Gains Through Crypto Ventures: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|President Trump|Trump Family|WLFI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-16 09:27:58

This ongoing deflation initiative effectively optimizes the token’s circulation structure and further solidifies the long-term value foundation of $HTX. Over $27.03 Million Burned, Setting a New All-Time Record On-chain data confirms the destruction of 13,119,801,941,747.93 $HTX tokens, valued at over $27.03 million, an 11.19% increase quarter-on-quarter, marking a new record since the launch of the burn mechanism. Burn Details: https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/02d799c40124f89980f6bd492bf19308e4ee35265d80aa4b2aec64b1c2c10cf5 Since introducing the burn program, HTX DAO has remained firmly committed to its on-chain governance principles of “transparency, openness, and verifiability”, regularly publishing burn progress and on-chain data to ensure real-time traceability for the entire community. Following this burn, HTX DAO’s cumulative burn amount has reached 85.88 trillion $HTX, with an aggregate value of approximately $163 million. Data shows that $HTX’s burn efficiency has continued to accelerate over the past year, rising from 0.78% in Q2 2024 to 1.39% in Q3 2025, with an average growth rate of 33%. This demonstrates that the $HTX burn mechanism is operating with greater efficiency, while its deflationary effect is steadily gaining momentum. https://www.htxdao.com/en-us/contribute Token burns are an integral part of HTX DAO’s governance mechanism, representing the core path of redistributing ecosystem revenue to the community and driving token value appreciation. With continuous growth in platform trading volume, ecosystem income, and community engagement, quarterly burns have maintained an upward trajectory, reflecting the healthy development of the $HTX ecosystem and the strengthening confidence of the market. Record Burn Driven by Sustained Growth in Exchange Business The record-breaking burn data this quarter was inseparable from the steady expansion of HTX’s overall business. In Q3 2025, HTX’s total trading volume rose 25% quarter-on-quarter, while the number of registered users increased by 13%, continuing the trend of consistent user base growth. Meanwhile, total platform assets surpassed $6.87 billion, up 6.4% quarter-on-quarter, securing HTX’s position among the world’s leading exchanges. This impressive performance is not a short-term fluctuation but the result of HTX’s sustained growth throughout 2025. Data shows that in H1 2025 alone, HTX surpassed 50 million registered users, with total assets rising 14% year-on-year to exceed $6.4 billion. Overall trading volume climbed 17% year-on-year, while active traders grew 11% from the previous half. The consistent improvement of its core business provides a solid foundation for ecosystem revenue and the token burn mechanism, forming the backbone of $HTX’s stable deflation and long-term value growth. As trading depth, user stickiness, and global reach continue to expand, HTX is moving forward with steady momentum, driving the ecosystem’s virtuous cycle and sustainable growth. Community Governance in Full Bloom: Multiple Listing Proposals Approved by Vote As HTX DAO’s governance mechanisms gradually mature, the community is taking on a greater role in decision-making. Since the launch of the Listing Governance by Crypto Recommendation, HTX DAO has voted to approve listing proposals for tokens such as 0G_labs, Eclipse, MANYU, and Succinct on the HTX Exchange, showcasing the community’s openness, autonomy, and execution capability in ecosystem decision-making. It can be foreseen that this decentralized recommendation and voting system will become the core engine of $HTX’s self-evolution, propelling the platform toward a more efficient, open, and resilient governance structure and offering a replicable paradigm for Web3 governance. Focusing on CeFi × DeFi Integration and Expanding Innovative Use Cases On-Chain Beyond its token burn and governance mechanisms, HTX DAO is committed to building a global ecosystem that is open to all developers. The primary focus is to create new applications for the $HTX token on the blockchain by integrating CeFi (Centralized Finance) with DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and exploring Real-World Assets (RWAs), creating a true “Free Finance Port”. HTX DAO promises to empower the global builder community with the resources, tools, and stage necessary to accelerate the adoption and development of more $HTX native applications. In the future, HTX DAO will continue to uphold the principles of openness, transparency, and decentralization, working alongside the global community and developers to drive the prosperity of the $HTX ecosystem. Together, they aim to contribute to the future of DeFi and usher in a more inclusive and innovative Web3 era. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

Solana (SOL) has long remained one of the most developer-friendly and efficient blockchains, which has seen it draw waves of activity across the board in DeFi applications, gaming, and NFTs. But there’s now a new crypto coin beginning to steal the headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Having reached presale Stage 6 with over 65% sold out already and having already raised $17.4 million, MUTM is turning out to be the contender for the best crypto to buy now in this market recovery. With its dual-lending protocol with collateralized lending and borrow functions, strategic partnership lines already established and strong investor momentum behind it, the new crypto coin may go toe-to-toe with the established titans such as Solana to be one of the brightest cryptos at the forefront of the 2025 recovery tide. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: $200 Key Resistance Point Solana (SOL) has successfully reclaimed the $200 level signifying new buying interest among investors with the market projecting recovery in 2025. This recovery comes with solid resistance though, and it will require immense buying pressure for the token to move upwards. Without enough momentum though, the token will register short term retraction back to $185 and is an integral region traders must watch out for. With Solana still trading through these major technical regions, market players also look at Mutuum Finance that can be adopted to bolster portfolios in the midst of this emerging market. Mutuum Finance’s Steady Improvements Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trending in the DeFi market, solidifying its position among the best cryptos to invest in this year. The project’s presale Phase 6 is already running at $0.035 per coin, which is a 16.17% growth compared to the previous phase 5. Investor appetite remains unbending with just over 17,200 investors putting in upwards of $17.4 million already. With over 65% of Phase 6 already sold out, worldwide investor interest in Mutuum Finance remains on the upward trajectory, indicating its rising status as a new crypto coin with long-term upside. Early investors are setting themselves up for huge returns once MUTM makes its official entry into the open market. Launch of the Lending and Borrowing Protocol The second significant event in the roadmap of Mutuum Finance is launching a lending and borrowing protocol , which will be the backbone of its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. V1 of this feature is going to be launched in the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 with some exciting features like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. From the launch event onwards, users can borrow, lend, and collateralize with ETH and USDT, providing for a seamless, secure, and highly scalable DeFi experience across both retail and institutional users. Daily Leaderboard Update, Paying Out Active Traders Mutuum Finance leaderboard remains to captivate investors with solid community-inspired incentives. The top 5 purchasers in the previous 24 hours bought $8,860, $8,339, $1,187, $949, and $408 in MUTM tokens respectively with increased participation and investors’ zeal. Every day, the No. 1 ranked buyer is given a $500 MUTM bonus in exchange for active participation and investment continuity. All that it takes to be qualified for this is to successfully complete at least one transaction within the 24-hour period. This promotion not just encourages constant presale activity but also fortifies the project’s community foundation, making Mutuum Finance once again one of the best crypto to buy now among new crypto coins in 2025. Mutuum Finance Emerges as One of the Best Cryptos to Buy in 2025 Mutuum Finance is gaining traction fast, with more than 17,200 investors putting in $17.4 million in its Phase 6 presale, already 65% sold out. The incoming release of its lending and borrow protocol with liquidity pools, mtTokens, and debt tokens is going to propel its DeFi platform. Daily leaderboard action with top buys of $8,860 and $8,339 indicates rising investor interest. Although Solana is solid competition, MUTM’s innovation, presale momentum, and road map strategy place it at the top of the list of best cryptos to buy today. Get your MUTM tokens now and be part of the next big crypto boom in 2025.

The amount represents more than twice the global GDP and more than 125 times the number of U.S. dollars in circulation. Based on blockchain data, the unprecedented mint occurred at 3:12 PM EST on Wednesday when Paxos created tokens as part of what it described as an internal error. The firm confirmed no security breach and assured the community that customer funds were safe. On-chain analytics dashboards and crypto users detected the successive mint and burn sequence, sparking confusion and questions on the integrity of dollar-pegged stablecoins. Accidental mint sparks questions on the integrity of dollar-pegged stablecoins The magnitude of the mint briefly prompted fears across the crypto community over compromise and system malfunction before Paxos intervened with a clarification. The event even triggered immediate risk management strategy responses from several DeFi platforms. For instance, Aave, a crypto lending protocol, temporarily froze its PYUSD markets following the unexpected high magnitude transaction. At 3:12 PM EST, Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer. Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD. This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root… — Paxos (@Paxos) October 15, 2025 Online community participants have begun questioning the integrity of the dollar-pegged stablecoins, asking if stablecoins are backed 1:1 by the dollar. One notable X account showed concerns about whether the $300 trillion minted stablecoin was actually collateralized, despite being a mistake. They argue that minted tokens, even by mistake, naturally have to be backed by something; however, the magnitude of the PYUSD mint, bigger than the entire global GDP , is not logical, especially when the dollar backs the token. Omer Goldberg, PayPal’s head of blockchain unit, reassured users that PYUSD remains fully backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars, and the incident did not affect the circulating supply. He added that all the balances reflected accurate collateralization after the reversal. Based on on-chain records , a zero net increase in PYUSD supply was realized. Paxos emphasized that the tokens were never circulated and that all operational systems were secure. Paxos’ blunder raises red flags for GENIUS Act charter bid The event struck the crypto community with immediate disbelief and satire. Some joked that Paxos had printed enough stablecoins to pay off the U.S. national debt, while others referenced crypto memes about ‘fat-finger’ trades, a term used to describe costly keystroke errors. The humor around the incident gave away deep concerns over decentralized controls. VBL’s Ghost, a market analyst, noted that one should be worried if someone can create $300 trillion of collateralized assets without collateral. Gnosis founder Martin Köppelmann questioned the accidental mint, suggesting further stricter automated checks in smart contract operations. Paxos is seeking the U.S. national trust charter from the Office of the Controller of stablecoins under the GENIUS Act. The charter would allow Paxos to operate nationally as a federally chartered institution. The latest accidental mint event may welcome deep regulatory scrutiny regarding Paxos’ technical safeguards and risk control mechanisms. Amanda Fischer, a policy director at Better Markets, has encouraged regulators to proceed cautiously when approving stablecoin issuers for national licensing. The incident renewed the concerns that while stablecoins offer efficiency and transparency in transactional reporting, the centralized nature of the issuance has remained blurred and vulnerable to human or software error. The mint cost Paxos roughly $2.66 in Ethereum gas fees, building on an earlier incident of the exact nature in which Tether accidentally minted $5 billion USDT in 2019 and corrected it within minutes. A whale X account dedicated to reporting large transactions on the chain surfaced the event, noting that 50 million USDT tokens had been transferred from Poloniex exchange to Tether Treasury via the Omni protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain. PYUSD, with a market cap of $2.65 billion, has realized a mere slip of 0.03% today. Total volume over the past 24 hours has surged to over 70% showing a heightened volatility for the token.

It seeks to transform the way traders and institutions make financial decisions with its predictive analytics and decentralized infrastructure. The early investors who joined at $0.012 are already experiencing good validation as the project raises over $3.6 million. Presale Performance and Token Metrics Ozak AI is at its sixth presale stage with its OZ token priced at $0.012. The project has already sold over 933 million tokens, which have brought in about $3.6 million. The subsequent presale will be at a higher price of $0.014 that will indicate high demand and confidence in the market. The overall supply of the OZ tokens is 10 billion, where 30% is set to be distributed to the presale, 30% to community incentives, 20% to reserves, and 10% to liquidity and team allocations. This is a balanced structure that promotes sustainable development and community involvement. The presale will consist of a 10% listing release, a one-month cliff, and a six-month linear release. This design minimizes the chances of early volatility in the market. The investors will be able to invest with the help of ETH, USDT, or USDC through the Ethereum network. In addition, a 10 percent referral bonus will promote increased involvement and community-based promotion. In the event that the project is sold at its target price of $1.00, early investors have the potential to earn returns of over 8,000%, and Ozak AI is one of the most successful AI-blockchain presales. AI-based Capabilities and platform features Ozak AI is constructed on Arbitrum Orbit to enhance faster and cost-effective transactions. The Ozak Stream Network (OSN) works with real-time financial information, providing accuracy of information to traders and institutional investors. The platform combines ARIMA and neural networks to provide predictive analytics and market forecasting. Weblume gives users no-code integration tools that are easy to automate and analyze without having to know how to write a program. Ozak AI Rewards Hub (LIVE) is a platform that provides the opportunity to stake and vote, as well as receive rewards and contribute to the development of the ecosystem. Predictive analytics can be made available and efficient with other features such as one-click AI upgrades via SINT, cross-chain bridges, and voice interfaces. Ecosystem Growth and Partnerships Ozak AI’s partnerships form a core pillar of its expansion strategy. The alliance with Pyth Network provides access to real-time financial data feeds across more than 100 blockchains, ensuring greater accuracy in predictions. Collaboration with Dex3 enhances trading liquidity and overall user experience, while Weblume supports the integration of decentralized applications and AI tools. Also, collaborations with Sentient, SOLO, and OpenGPU improve the performance of AI and computational scalability. Transparency and investor security in the project is further enhanced by Certik and Sherlock smart contract audits, which ensure code integrity and reduce risk. Conclusion The presale success and partnerships with the ecosystem of Ozak AI suggest increased confidence in its vision. The investors who bought tokens at $0.012 are now experiencing real momentum as the project proceeds to the next stage. Ozak AI, with its predictive AI technology, real-time data integration, staking, and governance capabilities, is a leading player in the future of decentralized financial analytics. As the next presale phase approaches, Ozak AI continues to attract attention from both retail and institutional participants—proving that early investors indeed made the right call before the crowd.

Originally priced at just $0.012 per token, these early stakes have appreciated impressively, showcasing the project's potential and investor confidence. The Early Success of Ozak AI With a total of 10 billion OZ tokens issued, Ozak AI has effectively used its presale phases to fund its development, selling over 933 million tokens to date. This financial injection is supporting the rollout of cutting-edge predictive analytics and decentralized financial applications. Token Distribution and Financial Strategy A balanced allocation of the OZ tokens, with 30% each designated for presale and community incentives, underpins Ozak AI's robust financial base. The remaining tokens are strategically split between reserves, liquidity provisions, and team incentives, ensuring a stable economic model that supports sustainable growth and equitable community engagement. The presale strategy includes a 10% listing release followed by a one-month cliff and a six-month linear release to mitigate early market volatility. Investors have the flexibility to invest using ETH, USDT, or USDC on the Ethereum network. Additionally, a 10 percent referral bonus is offered to foster a stronger community-driven promotion of the Ozak AI project. Return on Investment Forecast Investors who capitalized early on Ozak AI's presale now stand to gain significantly with projections showing potential returns of over 8,000% if the OZ token reaches its target price of $1.00. This prospect not only underscores the high stakes involved but also highlights the project's successful fundraising efforts and market confidence. Technological Edge and Platform Features Ozak AI operates on the Arbitrum Orbit framework, which supports faster and lower-cost transactions, a critical advantage in the blockchain space. Its Ozak Stream Network (OSN) leverages ARIMA models and neural networks to offer users real-time financial data, making it an indispensable tool for traders and institutional investors. The project includes innovative features like no-code integration tools provided by Weblume, one-click AI upgrades via SINT, cross-chain bridges, and voice interfaces. These features collectively enhance user experience and functionality, making financial analytics more accessible and effective. Partnerships Enhancing the Ecosystem Strategic collaborations have bolstered Ozak AI's capabilities and market presence. Partnerships with entities like Pyth Network provide extensive real-time data across numerous blockchains, enhancing accuracy in financial predictions. Additional alliances with Dex3, Sentient, SOLO, and OpenGPU extend Ozak AI's technological prowess and ecosystem connectivity, further solidifying its market position. Looking to the Future As Ozak AI transitions into its next presale phase, the growing interest from both retail and institutional participants signals a positive trajectory for the project. This momentum not only validates the early investors' decisions but also points to a promising future where decentralized finance and predictive analytics play pivotal roles.

With Ethereum price prediction models hinting at a possible $6,000 target and Polymarket odds showing growing investor confidence, the stage is set for a potential breakout. As institutional demand builds, Ethereum’s next major rally might already be underway. Ethereum Price Prediction Signals Mid-Term Rally Potential Ethereum (ETH) is demonstrating a resurgence of strength. The ETH price today is trading above the $4,000 mark and this has been generating some enthusiasm in the market. Having recovered from its $3,400 lows, Ethereum has recovered key technical zones, which gives bulls a focus area to monitor. Analysts are increasingly convinced that the most recent surge may have been the beginning of more and several ETH price prediction models are aiming to see the price rise to $6,000 by 2025. This opinion is backed by on-chain statistics that indicate a radical reduction in the number of ETHs on exchanges and it is a sign that investors are shifting coins to self-custody and are preparing to hold coins long-term. This decrease in supply would provide the ideal environment of breaking out. The current resistance is around $4,300 and a decisive break above it can open the way to the short-term $4,700. Market sentiment is turning bullish again. This has been reflected in recent Ethereum news, highlighting Polymarket traders placing favorable odds on a $6,000 target in 2025. While volatility remains, many see this recovery as a healthy reset before Ethereum’s next leg higher. RTX Token Raises Over $27.5 Million In Wake Of Market Recovery While Ethereum continues to dominate headlines with rising ETH price prediction targets, investors are also turning their attention to Remittix (RTX) , the PayFi project reshaping how people move money across borders. Unlike Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, Remittix focuses on practical financial connectivity, bridging crypto-to-fiat payments instantly and at near-zero cost. Its simple model allows users to send digital assets directly to global bank accounts without delays or hidden fees. This has quickly made Remittix one of the best DeFi projects to watch in 2025. With over $27.5 million already raised and more than 679 million tokens sold, analysts believe the project could follow Ethereum’s early growth trajectory, potentially entering the top 50 cryptos after launch. The Remittix wallet beta is now live for community testers ahead of public release. BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing, with LBank next in line. Investors can earn a 15% USDT referral bonus, claimable every 24 hours. Ranked #1 by CertiK, validating its strong security and reliability. With Ethereum eyeing $6,000 by 2025, Remittix represents the next major bridge between blockchain utility and real-world finance.

While downside risks have emerged, other signals suggest possible support near current prices. The asset remains above $3,900, a level that several traders are monitoring as a key zone. Bearish Momentum Builds on Weekly MACD Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum is close to a bearish MACD crossover on the weekly timeframe, a pattern that has led to steep price drops in past cycles. The last two times this signal appeared, ETH fell by 43% and 61%. The MACD histogram is also turning lower, pointing to fading momentum.

The crossover has not yet been confirmed. If the signal completes, some expect a stronger correction to follow. RSI Oversold and Flag Pattern Still Active Tom Tucker noted Ethereum’s RSI is sitting at around 16, a level considered deeply oversold. He said, “ RSI at 16.25 = heavily oversold territory ,” adding that rebounds often follow similar readings. Tucker also noted that bearish signals might be drawing in sellers too early. Titan of Crypto shared a chart showing a bull flag pattern on Ethereum’s weekly chart. The flag follows a sharp rally and is still intact. If the breakout occurs, the pattern points to a move toward $6,700. This is based on the height of the flagpole added to the breakout point. Source: Titan of Crypto/X Moreover, Martinez also highlighted MVRV Pricing Bands, which track historical deviation from Ethereum’s realized price. ETH is holding above the mean band at $3,900, marking it as a support area. $3,900 is a major support zone for Ethereum $ETH . If it holds, the Pricing Bands point to a move toward $5,000 or even $6,000. pic.twitter.com/GV6OFQqO3T — Ali (@ali_charts) October 15, 2025 If this area holds, the upper pricing bands suggest upside toward $5,000 and $6,000. If it fails, traders may look toward lower zones near $2,800. Institutional Demand and Blockchain Use Expanding Bitwise reported that 95% of ETH held by public companies was bought in the last quarter. A total of 4.4 million ETH was added, a 1,937% rise compared to the previous quarter. Combined holdings by public firms and ETFs now stand at 12.50 million ETH, or 10.31% of the total supply. Cipher X said Ethereum is becoming the settlement layer of the digital economy. USDC supply is nearing $45 billion, while BlackRock’s BUIDL fund now holds over $2 billion in tokenized US Treasuries. Cipher said both are “ growing side by side ” without coordination, powered by market use of Ethereum’s infrastructure.

Griffin says that GenAI has not yet delivered the anticipated market-beating returns. Speaking Wednesday at the JPMorgan Robin Hood Investors Conference in New York, “With GenAI, there are clearly ways it enhances productivity, but for uncovering alpha, it just falls short.” Griffin’s remarks reflect a broader industry perspective. Umesh Subramanian, Citadel’s CTO, stated earlier this year that achieving lasting alpha would still be challenging, even with a reliable quantitative trading AI that could backtest its own decisions. “In a world where the AI was making the trading decisions, everyone would know what it would do,” said Subramanian. He added that true alpha exists at the frontier of innovation—“that is where human beings come in.” Amidst the AI hype, Subramanian noted that AI is a tool rather than a revolution and that it’s not even that new. He continued to say that Citadel’s quant traders have used machine learning for 10 years: “Google came out with tensor flow and within like a week we put that to use to make money.” Griffin believes AI is unlikely to displace that many people as projected Griffin has made similar remarks in the past, suggesting that AI’s usefulness in analyzing investments is only modest and that fears of mass job losses are overblown. Speaking at the conference, he emphasized that generative AI is unlikely to spark a radical transformation. “It is going to have some effect, but the effects are not transformative and they’re going to be different across sectors,” he said. AI has motivated US companies to invest more in technology and increase the value of CTOs, hastening shifts that were previously stalled, he added. However, in a surprise move, Citadel actually increased its stake in Nvidia by over four times, purchasing approximately 6.5 million more shares and raising the value of its holding to around $1.5 billion. Nvidia has emerged as the chip supplier of choice for the AI industry, which has hundreds of billions in wealth and vast stores of data at its disposal. Citadel has also boosted its stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill by about 167%. However, it scaled down its Palantir stake by about 50%, divesting approximately 640,000 shares. Citadel plans to acquire German’s FlexPower Recently, Citadel also announced a definitive agreement to buy out Hamburg-based power trader FlexPower. The firm’s planned purchase of FlexPower is a strategic investment designed to fuel the company’s expansion. It also serves as a clear message that it won’t let rivals chip away at its dominance in its commodity business. According to reports, the partnership will integrate Citadel’s data-driven risk and technology expertise with FlexPower’s renewable trading knowledge to reach a broader range of producers and consumers across Europe . Typically, Citadel usually avoids big takeovers, though it snapped up Japanese power trader Energy Grid in 2024 and is setting up a commodities trading center in Australia. Citadel’s commodities supremo Sebastian Barrack noted that acquiring FlexPower would help Citadel broaden its reach in power trading and build on its strong track record in global energy markets, while backing the development of reliable European power systems. However, the acquisition is striking in part because Germany hasn’t exactly rolled out the red carpet for major U.S. financial institutions, especially alternative investment firms, and energy policy is always a politically fraught issue. While power trading doesn’t appear politically risky on the surface, some German politicians would no doubt seize the chance to blame an American hedge fund if prices climb.

Investors are increasingly looking beyond hype-driven coins and focusing on projects that will deliver tangible results. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a dual-lending protocol with a working roadmap, presale momentum, and mechanisms designed to drive recurring demand. This combination positions it as a top contender for those considering what crypto to invest in for a certain budget in mind and comparing top cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending services. These dual models will allow users to earn, borrow, and interact with MUTM in ways that generate real economic activity. The platform’s upcoming launch and token listing will ensure that utility and tradability go live simultaneously, creating early liquidity and measurable growth metrics. For investors researching a new crypto coin or the best cryptocurrency to invest today, this alignment is notable. Presale Snapshot and Early Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4,000,000,000 MUTM. Phase 6 pricing is set at $0.035, with 68% of the 170,000,000 tokens in this phase already reserved by eager participants, making it one of the best cheap crypto to buy now. Across all phases, the project will have raised approximately $17.40 million, with over 17,200 holders joining the ecosystem. The next presale phase will increase the price to $0.040, representing a 15% jump and offering the last discounted entry. Early demand reflects strong investor confidence and sets the stage for high adoption once the platform goes live. The dual-lending framework ensures different types of users find value. In the P2C pools, participants will deposit blue-chip assets like ETH, BTC, and USDT. Depositors will receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio, earning interest generated by pool activity. Meanwhile, P2P lending will allow bespoke loans for more volatile tokens, isolated from core pools to protect systemic stability. This structure guarantees continuous interaction with MUTM, creating repeated demand for the token. For community building and optimal UX, a live dashboard and Top-50 leaderboard will allow users to monitor ROI and track leading participants, enhancing engagement and transparency. The 24-hour leaderboard has been upgraded with a new reward feature. Each day, the top-ranked participant will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction during the 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC every day. Simultaneous Platform Launch and Listing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reduce the risks typically associated with token-only projects. Both the platform and token will launch together, eliminating periods where a token exists without utility. Immediate on-chain flows will generate measurable metrics such as total value locked, loan origination volumes, and staking participation. These figures will attract institutional custody providers and market makers, boosting credibility. When TVL and user activity appear right at listing, investor confidence will rise quickly, paving the way for accelerated price action among penny assets. This is why some analysts consider it a next big cryptocurrency and a top crypto to buy for 2025. Exchanges prefer projects that show live products and measurable adoption. A working platform on launch day ensures faster listing consideration from Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges. This strategy will create simultaneous trading and utility, making MUTM a rare penny asset with both immediate tradability and functional use. Real Utility and Future Expansion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate stablecoin mechanics as a core feature. Users will lock approved collateral like ETH and AVAX to mint a $1 pegged stablecoin. Every mint and repayment will create repeated protocol activity and predictable fee revenue. Expanding collateral sets and cross-chain integration in future releases will broaden MUTM’s utility and reach, ensuring sustainable valuation growth rather than short-term price spikes. These mechanisms will make the token relevant to a growing user base and continuously increase transactional demand within the ecosystem. Dividend Mechanism and Buy-Back Pressure A portion of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s fees will be directed toward open-market buybacks and distributed to mtToken stakers. More loans and platform usage will generate larger buyback pools, creating a direct link between platform growth and token demand. Stakers will earn rewards from real revenue, encouraging long-term participation. This alignment differentiates MUTM from speculative crypto coins and reinforces its position as a promising penny asset. A concrete example highlights the opportunity. Investor who invested $5,000 in Phase 1 at $0.01, acquiring 500,000 MUTM. By Phase 6 pricing of $0.035, this holding rose to $17,500, a 250% increase in just value. Reaching $0.50, a conservative milestone for a strong penny asset, would value the same holding at $250,000. This demonstrates how MUTM’s platform-driven growth scales investor gains significantly. V1 Progress and User Experience Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch V1 of the protocol on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Key features will include liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, Debt Token support, and a Liquidator Bot. Initial assets will include ETH and USDT for lending/borrowing and collateral purposes. Phase 6 is nearly complete, and the next phase at $0.040 will mark the final discounted opportunity for early investors. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway rewards 10 winners with $10,000 in MUTM each. Promising penny assets are those with working products, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will meet that standard, making it a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2025 among best cryptos to buy now lists.

53219740,607137,1760608822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53219740.jpeg,US House Lawmaker Introduces Bill To Allow Crypto Investments In 401(k) Plans,https://bitcoinist.com/house-lawmaker-bill-crypto-investments-401k-plans/,"A House of Representatives lawmaker has introduced a bill that could codify President Trump’s executive order and allow crypto and other “alternative assets” to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. House Lawmaker Moves To Codify Trump’s EO On Tuesday, House of Representatives member Troy Downing proposed a bill to codify President Donald Trump’s Executive Order (EO), which aimed to democratize access to alternative investments for 401(k) investors. Representative Downing introduced the Retirement Investment Choice Act in the House Financial Services Committee, supported by Republican Representatives Byron Donalds, Warren Davidson, Marlin Stutzman, Buddy Carter, and Barry Moore. If approved, the proposed bill will give President Trump’s EO “the force and effect of law,” making it easier for investors to access cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets in their 401(k) retirement plans. In August, President Trump signed Executive Order 14330 that aimed to allow more private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets in 401(k) retirement accounts. The EO directed the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reduce regulatory barriers that prohibit investments in alternative assets in their defined contribution retirement plans, and to clarify or revise rules that could help shield the industry from litigation risk. Representative Downing affirmed that “alternative investments hold the transformative potential to supercharge the financial security of countless Americans saving for retirement.” “I applaud President Trump for his leadership to democratize finance and am proud to be leading the effort in Congress to codify his EO and enshrine this move for generations to come.” Crypto Push For 401(k) Retirement Plans The push to add cryptocurrencies to retirement plans has gained momentum over the past few months. In May, the US Department of Labor (DOL) rescinded its 2022 guidance, which discouraged fiduciaries from including crypto asset investments in 401(k) retirement plans. The direction, issued in March 2022, followed Former President Joe Biden’s executive order, which required the government to assess the risks and benefits of digital assets. The EO instructed plan fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to exercise “extreme care” before adding crypto assets to their investment menus, asserting that the digital asset industry’s early stage could pose significant risks. US Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer explained the agency was “rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not DC bureaucrats.” In September, Representative Downing joined Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill and seven other Committee members on a letter supporting the executive order. As reported by Bitcoinist, a group of US lawmakers sent a letter to SEC’s Chairman Paul Atkins highlighting the EO’s potential to enhance retirement savings for millions of Americans. Notably, the lawmakers emphasized the importance of allowing access to cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments in 401(k) plans, arguing that they could improve net risk-adjusted returns for retirement accounts. The letter urged the SEC to collaborate with the DOL to revise existing regulations and ensure that these alternative investment opportunities become accessible to a broader range of investors. Nonetheless, the efforts to develop legislation that opens access to these alternative assets have received backlash, which might suggest that the recently introduced bill could also face opposition. Last week, the largest US federation of trade unions urged US lawmakers to reject the Senate’s version of the crypto market structure bill, citing serious concerns and a lack of adequate safeguards for workers and their retirement plans. Jody Calemine, Director of Government Affairs at The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), sent a letter to the US Senate Banking Committee, arguing that the bill’s treatment of crypto assets posed a risk to both retirement funds and the overall financial stability of the US economy.",Crypto News|401(K) Retirement Plan|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto 401(k) plans|Crypto Bill|crypto investors|Crypto legislation|Representative Troy Downing|Trump Executive Order|US DOL|US House of Representatives|US Lawmaker French Hill|US SEC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 10:00:22

The deal, announced Thursday by both companies, includes $32.5 million in cash and $67.5 million in stock from Kraken’s parent company Payward. This deal gives Kraken a Designated Contract Market (DCM) license under CFTC oversight. That means it can now offer its own derivatives, including perpetual futures and 24-hour trading, straight to American customers. No more routing trades through other venues. Kraken will now control clearing, risk, and matching inside one platform that meets U.S. regulatory standards. “Under CFTC oversight, Kraken can now integrate clearing, risk, and matching into one environment that meets the same standards as the largest exchanges in the world,” said Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-chief executive officer, in the Thursday statement . Kraken strengthens its global derivatives network Kraken already runs regulated futures venues in the UK and Europe, but this deal pulls its footprint tight around the U.S. market. Earlier this year, the company shelled out $1.5 billion for NinjaTrader , a retail trading platform that opened the door for CME-listed futures across crypto, equities, and commodities. The Small Exchange acquisition now locks in the missing U.S. regulatory piece, creating what Kraken calls a fully integrated global derivatives system. In the company’s own words, “Kraken’s acquisition of a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market creates the foundation for a new generation of United States derivatives markets. It is designed for scale, transparency, and efficiency.” The new setup will link spot, futures, and margin products inside one regulated liquidity network. That integration aims to cut fragmentation, reduce funding delays, and bring the kind of 24/7 performance seen in offshore markets directly to American soil. Kraken said the expansion aligns with its push to build global market infrastructure that connects regions under a single framework. The new system will stretch across six fiat currencies and cover over 450 assets, both digital and traditional. Kraken described it as “a network that moves collateral in real time, nets exposure across jurisdictions, and reduces capital inefficiencies that have long held back U.S. traders.” Meanwhile, Kraken has been preparing for a potential initial public offering (IPO) as early as the first quarter of next year, a report from Bloomberg said. The crypto company taking advantage of a more favorable regulatory climate under President Donald Trump, where enforcement actions against many in the industry, including Kraken itself, have either been dropped or paused while new crypto rules get signed. The U.S. futures license now positions Kraken alongside major global exchanges while keeping its core operations compliant with CFTC standards. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Marked by instant execution, zero funding rates, and a razor-thin 0.01% trading fee, DeriW is storming the scene with its CEX-comparable trading experience, rising as a pivotal force reshaping the future of decentralized derivatives. Meet DeriW: The Dark Horse in Perp DEX At TOKEN2049 Singapore, DeriW shone brightly as a rising star in the perp DEX space. The platform’s bold vision and ultra-competitive cost model have sparked lively discussions on-site, grabbing news headlines across leading media outlets. The striking presence at the influential crypto summit reflects DeriW’s recent robust momentum. Since launching its mainnet in August, it has attracted over 40,000 users, with a cumulative trading volume surpassing $900 million. The platform has drawn rave reviews from users as well. Its incentive mechanisms are widely praised as “real and rewarding” within the community, and many users claim trading on the platform feels seamless – to a level rivaling major centralized players. For DeriW, this dual endorsement from business metrics and user sentiment provides a solid foundation for its ongoing expansion. Enhanced speed, cost efficiency, and security: Crafting a CEX-Rivaling Trading Experience DeriW’s swift ascent stems from its technical competitiveness across three fronts: speed, cost efficiency, and security. DeriW is equipped with its proprietary Pendulum AMM, a design to enable zero-slippage trading and enhance capital efficiency and market depth. With cutting-edge matching mechanisms, transactions can be completed in milliseconds, boosting user confidence with high efficiency. Meanwhile, DeriW has implemented a fee structure consisting of zero funding rates, zero gas fees and 0.01% trading fees. This brings its overall trading cost to just one-fifth of those of mainstream players, unlocking greater profit potential for traders. On the security side, DeriW has established robust risk infrastructures, drawing on CoinW’s eight years of proven expertise. They are characterized by a non-custodial wallet design giving users real asset ownership, and a comprehensive audit from CertiK to boost trust and transparency. Supernova+: Fueling the Growth with an Effective Incentive System Well-designed incentive mechanisms have become a critical accelerator for early-stage Perp DEX projects. DeriW’s Supernova+ points program is the vivid example. The program, designed to encourage users to build the ecosystem through trading, referrals, and community engagement, has concluded its first season recently, generating strong community buzz. Supernova+ provides a clear path for value accumulation: participants earn 5 DER+ points for every 50 USDT in eligible trading volume, and they can earn 300% of their invitees’ trading points through referrals. These points serve not only as the primary credential for future TGE airdrops, but also as tickets to feature unlocks and long-term utilities. With these metrics, DeriW aims to create an incentive program rewarding users for trading behavior rather than artificial task farming. This approach cultivates a loyal user base and lays the groundwork for a thriving ecosystem. Future Roadmap: Deepening User-Driven Optimizations Looking ahead, DeriW is committed to elevating the trading experience through user-driven optimizations. Key priorities include improving the ecosystem, listing a broader range of financial products, and cultivating a global trading community. “Decentralization should not come at the expense of speed and accessibility,” DeriW’s PR Manager, Tharaka Kahaduwa stated. “We aspire to be the first platform that truly harmonizes decentralization, security, and seamlessness, empowering our users with the best possible derivatives trading journey.” Leading the Change: The Perp DEX ‘Experience Revolution’ Unfolds Perp DEXs are spearheading an “experience revolution” in derivatives trading through intermediary-free operations, low costs, and asset non-custody. At the forefront of this shift, DeriW is redefining the future of decentralized derivatives with its offering, ushering users into a new era of on-chain finance. As iterations accelerate and reach widens, DeriW is crafting tomorrow’s benchmark—one lightning trade at a time. About DeriW DeriW is the first zero-gas-fee decentralized perpetual contract exchange, blending Ethereum’s security with Layer 3 scalability to deliver CEX-like efficiency in a decentralized framework. Operated by CoinW’s seasoned fintech team, it redefines trading with 80,000 TPS throughput, ensuring speed, transparency, and trustless execution. To learn more about DeriW, users can visit the website , and follow DeriW’s X Account , and Telegram Group . Disclaimer DeriW is an independent initiative and operates separately from any regulated CoinW exchange entity. It is a non-custodial and non-regulated platform, and users access DeriW entirely at their own risk. By using DeriW, users acknowledge full responsibility for their trading decisions and asset security.

Precious metals trade near an all-time high, with silver catching up with outsized gains. Silver is challenging BTC as the fastest-growing asset for 2025. In the year-to-date, the metal added a net 63.9% to its price, while BTC locked in 64.1% net gains. The recent price weakness for BTC and a dip to a lower price range, even above $100K, will put the digital asset’s net gains below the performance of silver. Silver broke out in 2025, on track to get ahead of BTC as the biggest earner for the year to date. | Source: Trading Economics At the beginning of 2025, BTC traded at 3,404 silver ounces, an all-time peak. Since then, even with price records, BTC declined to the equivalent of 2,101 silver ounces. Still, BTC is up from its lows of 692 silver ounces during the 2023 bear market. Historically, BTC still outperformed precious metals on a longer time scale, as a first-of-a-kind asset in a period of price discovery. Silver and gold became an integral part of the “debasement trade,” seeking assets to offset the weakness of the US dollar and fiat currencies. As Cryptopolitan reported , the debasement trade led to speculative gains for gold, which appreciated more reliably than BTC. However, silver caught up with bigger gains, breaking a multi-decade run of relatively subdued prices. Skeptics about the debasement trade see it as a bet on already overheated assets, which do not necessarily store value. As a debasement trade asset, BTC is also much riskier, as it has erased up to 10% of its value within hours. On a four-year time frame, gold was also the #1 gainer, as BTC lagged during its two-year bear market. Gold is also catching up with BTC, already 58.2% up for the year to date. Tokenized silver remains a niche asset While silver has a well-established mainstream market, it is relatively niche as a tokenized asset. Silver-based tokens only have a market cap of $203M even after the recent price appreciation. Most of the value is locked in the Kinesis Silver token. The silver-based tokens are also only traded on the Kinesis platform, with no connections to larger exchanges or DeFi. Overall, tokenized silver is still a niche asset, trading away from the overall RWA tokenization trend. Will BTC catch up with precious metals? BTC remains more volatile and unpredictable, though there are expectations the digital coin may catch up with gold. BTC is often historically lagging by about 60 days from gold, thus expecting a renewed attempt at a new high in the coming months. However, the debasement narrative may also shift if the government debt market normalizes. While the debasement trade seems logical, it may also reverse if currencies show a return to sufficient reliability. For gold and silver, the rush for spot demand is already creating backlogs and logistical problems. BTC as a debasement asset also suffers from even faster depreciation, often acting as a more volatile equivalent to tech stocks.

This step marks the first time Coinbase has directly supported BNB, the main token of the Binance ecosystem. This development follows recent debates in the crypto industry regarding listing fees and transparency. Earlier this week, Coinbase Ventures-backed Limitless Labs CEO CJ Hetherington claimed that the exchange was demanding a commission for token listings, a claim Binance denied as “unfounded and defamatory.” Related News: Binance Founder CZ Comments on Coinbase's BNB Listing: ""Big Loss!"" While discussions regarding Binance altcoin listings continue, CZ initially said that it was a huge loss for the exchange not to list BNB, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. CZ then made another post, directly referencing Coinbase's BNB listing and calling on Coinbase to list more BNBChain projects. Recalling that Binance has listed more Base projects, CZ said that although BNB Chain is a more active network, he does not think Coinbase has listed a single BNBChain project yet. “I also encourage Coinbase to list more BNBChain projects. Binance has listed several Base projects. I don't think Coinbase has listed a single BNBChain project yet. It's also a more active chain. It's not an exchange. I'm just recommending it because we're all about openness, inclusivity, etc. I also think it's good for change.” Moreover, I would urge Coinbase to list more @BNBChain projects. @Binance has listed several Base projects.

Recently, a particularly audacious crypto whale, utilizing the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, made headlines by opening a formidable $163 million short position on Bitcoin. This bold move came hot on the heels of a lucrative $192 million profit from a similar previous wager. The Mysterious Whale and Market Dynamics The identity of this trader remains shrouded in mystery, known only by their wallet address, 0xb317. They have consistently utilized high leverage strategies, which this time is set at 10x, exposing them to significant risk of liquidation if Bitcoin's price surges unexpectedly. This strategy, while risky, has so far accrued an unrealized profit of $3.5 million, hinting at a calculated risk that has yet to backfire. Notably, this isn't the first time this whale has caught the market's attention. Their trading history is spectacular, dating back to the early days of Bitcoin, amassing an initial hoard of 86,000 Bitcoin. It is this deep involvement and historical proficiency in market trends that feed the speculations of insider knowledge, especially following trades made shortly before significant market-moving events, like the recent tariff announcements by President Trump. Implications of Strategic Trades on the Market The aftermath of these trades echoes throughout the crypto world, influencing not only market prices but also the fortunes of countless other traders. The recent position taken by the whale was closely followed by a market downturn, resulting in widespread liquidations. Hyperliquid saw over 250 wallets lose their millionaire status in the fallout, demonstrating the profound impact one individual can exert on this volatile market. Moreover, the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, including platforms from major Bitcoin casinos , felt the repercussions. These venues often rely on the stability of cryptocurrency values to offer better transaction terms compared to traditional currencies, emphasizing the interconnected nature of the crypto industry. Exchange Turbulence and Compensation Efforts The turbulence was not contained to traders alone; even major exchanges like Binance faced challenges. During the peak of the market volatility, issues such as failed stop-loss executions and token depeggings surfaced, prompting Binance to issue compensations totaling $283 million to the affected users. This scenario illustrated not only the risks inherent in digital currency trading but also the measures exchanges must take to maintain user trust. The depegging of the USDe stablecoin , for instance, saw its value plummet temporarily, affecting users whose trades depended on its stability, and highlighting the fragile nature of even supposedly stable digital assets. These events have broad implications, stirring debates about the integrity of the crypto market and rekindling concerns about regulatory oversight. They also touch on broader socio-political issues, as noted by Senator Elizabeth Warren's warnings regarding potential ethical risks tied to significant political figures' involvement in crypto during their tenure in office.

Ripple’s New Endeavors As CryptoPotato reported earlier this week, Ripple has tapped Immunefi to boost institutional adoption of its XRP Ledger network. The strategic collaboration between the two aims to enhance the security of the XRPL Lending Protocol, which is categorized as a major step in Ripple’s enterprise-focused blockchain strategy. It offers pooled lending and underwritten credit natively on the network, and it’s designed to automate the full loan lifecycle, from issuance to repayments. The company also expanded its African reach by partnering with South Africa’s Absa Bank, allowing the latter to integrate Ripple’s custody technology for managing tokenized assets, including cryptocurrencies. The benefits for the two parties are as follows: the bank will utilize Ripple’s institutional-grade technology, while the US-based company will advance its mission to integrate digital assets into mainstream financial operations across the continent. This follows a previous collaboration that enabled Ripple to deploy its native stablecoin in some African regions. Last month, we announced RLUSD live on the African continent…and today so is Ripple Custody through our partnership with Absa Bank, one of South Africa’s leading financial institutions! https://t.co/0ZcrGWlZNT — Monica Long (@MonicaLongSF) October 15, 2025 ETF Developments Following the closure of the legal case against the US SEC, the XRP Army has been solely focused on the ETF front. Current data from Polymarket shows that the chances for approvals of spot XRP ETFs by the end of the year are close to 100%. However, the US regulator is yet to grant a single green light, and this is unlikely to occur anytime soon due to the ongoing shutdown of the Federal government. In the meantime, Volatility Shares has used the opportunity to file for new types of ETFs. As reported yesterday, the company has submitted numerous applications to launch leveraged ETFs tracking the performance of several assets, including XRP. Following the calamity that occurred last Friday, largely due to excessive leverage by traders, Scott Melker (better known as The Wolf Of All Streets) described these products as the “worst idea ever.” XRP Price Update and Alert Speaking of the market-wide crash that took place less than a week ago, it’s worth noting XRP’s performance during and since then. The asset plunged massively and tapped a multi-year bottom at below $1 (on some exchanges). Although it bounced off alongside the rest of the market immediately, it has failed to stage a notable recovery above $2.50. It struggles below that level as of press time, while whales’ behaviour could hint at another price drop in the future. These large market participants disposed of more than 2.2 billion tokens in just a few days during and after the meltdown. Analysts are split when trying to determine XRP’s next move. According to ERGAG CRYPTO, citing the asset’s wedge pattern, a significant move is expected, with an upswing at 57% and a breakdown at 43%.

Heavily reliant on Bitcoin, all alts are looking to Bitcoin for their cue. $XRP and $ADA are positioned to complete their recoveries if $BTC gives the nod. $XRP holding horizontal support Source: TradingView Earlier on Thursday it had looked as though $XRP was about to fall to the next horizontal support level at $2.29. However, the bulls had other ideas, and as things stand the $XRP price is back at the $2.44 horizontal support where it might hold if things go well throughout the rest of Thursday. As can be seen in the chart above, the $XRP price did take a huge tumble last Friday. A massive 43% reversal actually forced the price down to a lower low. Nevertheless, the price has since recovered more than half of that loss, and should $XRP maintain at this level at the end of the day, a climb back to the descending trendline could be on the cards. A bounce for $XRP from here? Source: TradingView Having risen to the all-time high of $3.66 back in July, the $XRP price had become extremely overbought. Therefore these last few weeks of consolidation have been important. As it stands, the weekly chart looks fine for $XRP as long as the price holds above the $2.44 major support level. The Stochastic RSI indicators are nearly at the bottom. Look for a potential bounce from here. $ADA bulls attempt to flip resistances into supports Source: TradingView If $XRP took a big tumble last Friday, then $ADA took the dump of all dumps, finally reaching a $0.27 bottom that totalled 66% in all. That being said, the price has recovered sharply, and as long as the $0.63 horizontal level holds, $ADA has probably seen the last of this acute reversal. The $ADA bulls are currently attempting to flip the $0.68 resistance level into support, and should they do so, it may then be a case of regaining levels until the major descending trendline is reached once again. Lower highs, or potential huge major trend break? Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $ADA can either be seen as a series of lower highs, or from a bullish perspective, a major trendline potentially about to be broken. Taking things from that bullish view, if the $ADA price can get back to that trendline, which began in 2021, and break through and confirm above, the next major resistance is at $1.18. $1.45 is then a possible resistance level, with not much above that to speak of before getting back to the $3.10 all-time high. Can it get back there? It’s a late start, but anything is possible, especially considering the lack of decent resistances after $1.18. If the crypto market were to go into one last glorious rally that would possibly come to an end in Q1 or Q2 of next year, perhaps there is still hope for $ADA.

Dogecoin remains a popular name in the meme category, but many traders are now comparing its long-term growth potential to newer projects that combine real-world utility with early-stage value. One token drawing this attention is Remittix (RTX) a fast-rising DeFi project focused on cross-border payments and low-fee transactions. As speculative interest returns to the altcoin market, questions are emerging about whether early Remittix buyers could see even greater percentage gains than early SHIB investors did. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Market Update Dogecoin is now priced at $0.2026, with a comparably modest 1.2% daily increase. Its market capitalization stands at $30.28 billion, with daily trading volume decreasing to $3.16 billion, which is a decline of 37.12%. With its strong community and brand identity, DOGE’s growth now depends on more widespread crypto adoption and new technical development to be able to sustain long-term demand. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001049, after gaining a significant 1.19%, with a market capitalization of $6.19 billion. The daily volume has fallen to $203 million, indicating lower short-term trading activity. Although SHIB price is still much lower than its all-time high, the ecosystem’s consistent updates in DeFi and layer-2 infrastructure keep investors interested. Yet both tokens now face the issue of supporting valuations without relying solely on community sentiment something new entrants like Remittix aim to address with real-world use cases. Why Remittix Is Drawing Attention Remittix (RTX) is currently priced at $0.1166 per token, with more than $27.5 million raised and 679 million tokens sold in its ongoing presale. As one of the best crypto presales of 2025, Remittix is bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance with a platform that enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. It has just announced its upcoming listings on BitMart and LBank, two large centralized exchanges, in a move that will increase liquidity and accessibility for early buyers. Audited Security: Team fully audited and ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens. Real-World Utility: Seamless crypto-to-fiat transfers supporting 40+ currencies. Earning Potential: A 15% referral program and $250,000 giveaway for community members. Growing Adoption: Wallet beta testing already lives with positive user feedback. High-Growth Outlook: Strong presale momentum and expanding CEX partnerships. These developments highlight why many traders view RTX as a low-gas-fee crypto with genuine adoption potential, not just speculative hype. Could Remittix Outperform Past Meme Coin Gains? While Dogecoin Price Prediction discussions often center on renewed retail momentum, the crypto market’s maturity now rewards projects offering functional value. Remittix’s focus on real-world payments, its cross-chain DeFi architecture and progress toward major listings position it as a new altcoin to watch in 2025. With transparency backed by CertiK, a deflationary token model and clear revenue utility, Remittix may represent what early investors once hoped DOGE or SHIB would become: a token that connects utility with accessibility.

Since its launch, they have also sent a few billion messages on the new messaging platform pushed hard by Moscow, the team behind it also claims. Max’s average daily reach surpasses 18 million More than 45 million users have registered with the Max messenger, Russian media reported, quoting stats released by its press service. An increase of 5 million since the beginning of October helped the application to its new total, RBC reported on Wednesday. The average daily reach also increased, to 18.2 million users this month, with a record daily high of over 21 million, Max told the business news outlet, further highlighting: “Since the messenger’s launch, users have sent over 3 billion messages and made over 700 million calls. The number of chats increased to 6.5 million in October.” Since the end of August, over 20 million video messages have been sent as well, with users under 17 being the most active. As of October 15, the number of channels in Max exceeded 11,000, the announcement also detailed. Max messenger adds Digital ID feature The Russian messenger, which was released in beta this past March, is based on the Max platform developed by VK, formerly Vkontakte, which is the leading social media network in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet. VK is expanding the project with the help of the Ministry of Digital Development and Communications in Moscow, and Max will eventually facilitate interaction with government agencies. In mid-September, it introduced a “Digital ID” feature that allows users to verify their identity, status or age when shopping at Russian retailers. Besides texting, audio and video calls, voice messaging and conference calling, it already supports large file sharing and money transfers as well. Similar to more established products in this market, Max offers integration for business services that take the form of mini-apps and chatbots. Max is available in app stores in mobile, desktop, and web versions and has been added to a list of mandatory applications that Russia requires pre-installed on devices sold in the country. In August, industry sources told Russian media that Chinese and South Korean manufacturers were “making every effort” to install the “national messenger” on their smartphones ahead of a September deadline. Russia’s answer to Western messengers grows amid concerns Russian authorities seem intent to replace messengers popular among Russians, such as Telegram and WhatsApp, with Max. This summer, WhatsApp, which is owned by American social media giant Meta, accused Russia of cracking down on encrypted services after Moscow began restricting call features on both WhatsApp and Telegram for failing to comply with Russian law. In July, Telegram’s owner Pavel Durov denied Russian media reports that Telegram was opening an office in Russia, as required by the country’s so-called “landing law,” after rejecting earlier rumors that the messenger was exiting the Russian market. The Russian-born tech entrepreneur, also a co-founder of VK, left his home country years ago, alleging his social media platform had been taken over by allies of the Kremlin after his refusal to censor protestors in both Russia and Ukraine. Later, Durov turned down requests by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) to share the encryption keys to Telegram messages exchanged between people of interest for Russian law enforcement. Meanwhile, a high-ranking Kremlin official, the deputy head of President Vladimir Putin’s administration, Maxim Oreshkin, insisted that Moscow is not contemplating a ban on foreign messaging apps. Russian officials have been claiming Max is actually more secure and requests fewer user permissions than Western alternatives, with which it’s meant to compete. At the same time, the state-supported app has been a cause of concern over potentially facilitating government surveillance, collection of sensitive personal data, and political censorship.

Historically, October has been one of BTC’s strongest months, averaging 20% gains since 2019. With institutions now holding over $117 billion in BTC, optimism is building for a potential late-month breakout above $110,000. Fed Rate Cut Bets Rise to 96.7% Ahead of October Meeting Bitcoin’s historical October strength may be gearing up for another test as traders brace for a potential Federal Reserve rate cut later this month. According to the latest CME FedWatch data , markets are pricing in a 96.7% probability of a 25-basis-point reduction in the federal funds rate, from 4.00–4.25% to the 3.75–4.00% range. Only 3.3% of traders expect no change. A cut would mark the Fed’s first easing move in over a year, signaling that policymakers may be shifting toward stimulating growth amid softening economic indicators. Lower borrowing costs often lead to greater liquidity and a stronger risk-on appetite, favoring assets like BTC. Since 2019, October has historically delivered a 20% average gain and 15% median return for BTC, setting the stage for what could be a late-month rebound. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge Past $117B Institutional sentiment is also turning more constructive. According to Bitwise’s Q3 2025 Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Report, total BTC held by public companies reached 1.02 million BTC, valued at $117 billion, a 28% quarterly increase. Nearly 48 new firms added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in Q3, bringing the total number of corporate holders to 172, up 38.7% from the previous quarter. Leading the charge, Strategy now holds 640,031 BTC, followed by MARA Holdings (52,850 BTC), XXI (43,514 BTC), Metaplanet (30,823 BTC), and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company (30,021 BTC). The largest single purchase came from Strategy, which added 40,000 BTC in Q3 alone. There are almost 40% more public companies holding bitcoin today than there were 3 months ago. Companies Are Buying Bitcoin, Q3 2025 Edition: pic.twitter.com/R6m1kyaP0H — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) October 14, 2025 This wave of accumulation underscores that corporations are increasingly treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, not just a speculative play. The ongoing Fed pivot narrative, combined with expanding institutional adoption, could amplify Bitcoin’s recovery momentum into November. If policy easing materializes as expected, Bitcoin may find its footing above $110,000, with a potential breakout toward $120,000 in Q4 as liquidity returns and corporate demand accelerates. Bitcoin Builds Momentum Above Key $109K Support Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is steady near $111,300, rebounding from the $109,600 triple-bottom zone, a key support that’s repeatedly attracted buyers since early October. The structure suggests a potential reversal, with higher lows forming a short-term base for recovery. On the 1-hour chart, BTC remains capped by a descending trendline from $122,000, with resistance near $112,700–$113,000, where the 20-EMA is attempting to cross above the 50-EMA. A confirmed breakout could drive price toward $114,600, $116,100, and possibly $117,600, aligning with key Fibonacci levels. The RSI near 48 signals early bullish divergence, hinting that downside pressure may be fading. Bitcoin Price Prediction – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns, particularly recent Doji formations, show market hesitation before potential reversal. A sustained move above $112,700 would confirm bullish momentum, while a break below $109,600 may expose $107,300 as the next support. If this reversal holds, Bitcoin could re-enter a broader bullish channel, paving the way for a push toward $117,600 and renewed confidence ahead of the next market uptrend. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013115 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

The acquisition expands Kraken’s growing global infrastructure, which now includes regulated derivatives venues in the UK, European Union, and the US. Its unified trading system supports six fiat currencies and more than 450 digital and traditional assets, operating within a single platform architecture. US Derivatives Push According to the official press release, the latest deal is an important step toward Kraken’s goal of launching a fully US-based derivatives product suite, in a bid to strengthen its presence in the world’s largest capital market. The exchange has now secured a DCM license, which will enable it to design and operate exchange-listed derivatives markets in the United States under CFTC oversight. This move follows a series of strategic developments in Kraken’s derivatives business. Earlier in 2025, the company acquired NinjaTrader, a leading US futures trading platform, allowing American clients to trade CME-listed cryptocurrency futures alongside spot crypto. In October, Kraken expanded these offerings to include contracts across equities, foreign exchange indices, and commodities such as oil and gold. The acquisition of Small Exchange continues Kraken’s long-term investment in the derivatives sector. Since 2019, the company has acquired and built multiple regulated entities, including Crypto Facilities in the UK, which operates under the FCA’s oversight and recently launched Europe’s largest regulated crypto futures offering under the MiFID II framework. Commenting on the acquisition, the crypto exchange’s co-CEO, Arjun Sethi, stated, “This step connects spot, futures, and margin products inside a single regulated liquidity system, reducing fragmentation, lowering funding latency, and bringing onshore the kind of access and performance that has mostly existed offshore. Under CFTC oversight, Kraken can now integrate clearing, risk, and matching into one environment that meets the same standards as the largest exchanges in the world.” Key Developments So Far Kraken posted $412 million in revenue for the second quarter of 2025, up 18% from a year earlier but down 13% from Q1. The exchange’s adjusted EBITDA, however, slipped 7% to $79.7 million as trading activity slowed due to seasonal weakness and global market uncertainty tied to US tariffs during the period. Despite that, Kraken’s total exchange volume grew 19% year-over-year to $186.8 billion. Meanwhile, funded accounts rose 37% to 4.4 million, and platform assets increased 47% to $43.2 billion. It also gained ground in spot trading, with stablecoin-fiat trading volumes jumping from 43% to 68%. Last month, Kraken completed a $500 million funding round at a $15 billion valuation, ahead of its 2026 IPO. The raise was self-structured and backed by Tribe Capital, Sethi, and other investors. The exchange has now raised $527 million overall.

53223761,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=30350,1760615819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/98/default.png,The end of denial: The IMF finally admits what crypto knew all along,https://blog.kraken.com/news/industry-news/the-imf-and-the-end-of-denial,"By Arjun Sethi, Kraken co-CEO When the head of the International Monetary Fund says fiat is going digital and urges countries to accept reality, that is not a policy tweak. It is the moment the establishment admits that the world has already changed. For years, global institutions treated crypto as a novelty or a risk. This week, they acknowledged it as part of the new financial reality. What we are seeing is the beginning of the end of denial. Money has always evolved in quiet revolutions. From paper to credit. From wires to APIs. From bank databases to open ledgers. The difference now is speed. Innovation in crypto, stablecoins and open finance has accelerated faster than any regulatory regime or central bank could process. Governments are no longer setting the pace. They are reacting to a world where networks, not nations, are building the infrastructure of money. The IMF is trying to frame this transition as something they can manage, as if digital fiat is simply another upgrade or a technical evolution of central banking. But that framing misses the deeper shift happening beneath the surface. The change is not digital. It is architectural. The power to issue and control money is diffusing away from institutions and into open systems that anyone can build on. This is the real story. When fiat becomes code, the gatekeepers lose their monopoly on trust. The new monetary architecture Central bank digital currencies will come, and many of them will work. They will make payments faster, increase traceability and expand inclusion in theory. But they will also introduce new forms of control. Programmable money means programmable policy. Every transaction becomes a policy instrument. That is a staggering level of power and an equally staggering level of risk. If you care about freedom, privacy or open markets, that power should make you uncomfortable. The future is not just about who builds digital money. It is about who controls its logic. The next great economic divide will not be between countries that have central bank digital currencies and those that do not. It will be between societies that build open digital systems that are interoperable, composable and privacy-preserving, and those that lock digital money into centralized databases with built-in surveillance. Traditional finance is already feeling this tension. For decades, financial institutions could rely on a simple edge: regulation, custody and distribution. That edge is eroding. As soon as users can hold sovereign digital cash directly, banks lose their monopoly on deposits. When stablecoins can move value across borders in seconds, the concept of international wire sounds like a relic. And when decentralized finance protocols can price, lend and settle programmatically, the economic role of the bank as middleman starts to look optional. The incumbents will fight this, of course. They will talk about compliance, safety and systemic risk, all of which are valid concerns. But the deeper reason for their resistance is that they sense what comes next: a world where financial intermediation is an algorithmic choice, not a legal privilege. From institutions to networks We are witnessing the separation of money and state, not through ideology but through infrastructure. For most of modern history, the state defined the rails of money. Now, networks do. Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Bitcoin. These are not currencies in the narrow sense. They are new jurisdictions of trust. They are opt-in economies. Anyone can enter. No one can monopolize access. That is what the IMF is really reacting to. Not the existence of digital money, but the emergence of digital sovereignty that does not flow through them. This is also why meme coins matter more than their critics admit. They may look like jokes, coins like $DOGE, $DOG or $MIM, but they are social experiments in value consensus. They demonstrate how money can form bottom up, through culture and community rather than decree. When millions of people agree that a meme token has value and it trades globally with liquidity and demand, something profound is happening. Belief has decoupled from authority. Meme coins show how finance becomes culture and culture becomes finance. In that sense, they are not absurd. They are early. In traditional markets, value follows fundamentals. In digital markets, fundamentals follow networks. The memes come first. The infrastructure catches up. When the IMF looks at DOGE, they see volatility. What they should see is coordination. A new way for communities to express collective value at internet speed. In the same way that early social media turned users into publishers, meme coins turn communities into monetary networks. It is messy, irrational, and often speculative, but it is also real, and it is growing. The state versus the network Every era of money has a political philosophy embedded in it. Gold represented scarcity and sovereignty. Fiat represented the power of the state. Digital money represents the power of code and coordination. The next twenty years will be defined by how these forces reconcile. Central banks will issue digital currencies to preserve control. Private institutions will tokenize assets to preserve relevance. And open systems, the world of crypto, decentralized finance and community driven projects will keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible. The future will not be one system replacing another. It will be a negotiation between closed systems that optimize for control and open systems that optimize for freedom. In practice, that means the global financial system will look more like the internet: messy, modular, multi-polar and open at the edges. Nations that embrace that complexity will thrive. Those that resist it will fall behind. Just as the internet rewarded openness over gatekeeping, the new financial order will reward interoperability over control. Money wants to flow the way information does: freely, instantly and globally. Every attempt to contain it will eventually fail. Why this moment matters The IMF’s statement is not revolutionary by itself. What makes it historic is the subtext: the establishment is admitting that digital money is no longer a question of if, but how. That changes everything. It forces countries to ask new questions. How do we maintain monetary sovereignty when value moves across networks faster than we can regulate it? How do we design digital money that respects privacy, transparency and freedom at the same time? How do we compete when capital flows to the most efficient and open systems? These are existential questions. They will define which countries lead the next era of economic growth and which fade into irrelevance. For investors and builders, the message is clear: the rails are being rebuilt. This is not the time to chase short-term tokens. It is the time to build infrastructure, governance and identity layers that make digital finance scalable and trustworthy. The opportunity is not in predicting which meme coin pumps next. It is in building the middleware that allows trillions of dollars to move safely across open rails. The path forward Governments need to learn from the internet’s evolution. Openness did not destroy control. It redefined it. The nations that created flexible, innovation-friendly frameworks became the economic hubs of the twenty-first century. The same pattern will repeat with digital money. We need a design philosophy for money that acknowledges the reality of open systems. It should combine the stability and legal clarity of sovereign fiat with the innovation and inclusivity of crypto networks. It should enable composability without losing accountability, privacy without lawlessness and programmability without political capture. The countries that understand this will attract talent, capital and legitimacy. The ones that cling to control will watch as liquidity and influence migrate elsewhere. The cultural layer Money has always been cultural, but crypto made that explicit. The meme coins, NFTs and onchain communities that seem unserious to regulators are actually pioneering the social foundations of a new economy. They are teaching people that value is something we can create together, not something handed down by authority. They are teaching us that financial participation can be joyful, creative and collective. The IMF’s recognition of digital currencies is, in a way, an acknowledgment of that cultural victory. Institutions do not move this fast unless they have to. And now, they have to. The future of money is open When history looks back at this decade, it will see a clear turning point, the moment the institutions of the old world quietly conceded that the new one had already arrived. The question now is whether we will build digital money as an extension of the surveillance state or as a platform for open innovation. I believe the open path will win because open systems compound. They attract talent, energy and trust. They grow like the internet: bottom up, unpredictable, unstoppable. Crypto is not just a new asset class. It is a new social contract. And now that even the IMF has acknowledged the shift, the real work begins: designing a financial system that deserves the trust it is about to inherit.

The watchdog stated that countries have made some progress in establishing rules, but not enough to keep pace with the rapidly growing $4 trillion crypto market. The FSB’s latest review warned that weak coordination between countries and uneven adoption of crypto standards limit oversight of digital assets. G20 watchdog tells countries to act faster on crypto rules The FSB stated that many governments are still moving too slowly to implement its first set of crypto rules, and that global efforts to create clear and coordinated crypto regulations remain weak and scattered. The FSB’s Secretary General, John Schindler, stated that regulators must share information and coordinate their actions to prevent any part of the global market from becoming a weak spot for financial risk or regulatory evasion. He explained that when countries fail to cooperate, they create loopholes that crypto companies and investors can easily exploit. Schindler explained that traders or firms can easily avoid strict regulations by relocating to countries with looser laws, as every nation attempts to establish its own rules without collaborating with others. He believes regulators must act in concert so that the global market does not become vulnerable and susceptible to abuse. The FSB was established to help world leaders prevent another global financial crisis collapse, following the 2008 financial crisis. In its latest review, the agency examined how 29 key jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom, implemented its guidance on crypto and stablecoin regulations . However, major countries like El Salvador did not participate in the review, which left significant gaps in understanding how the market operates worldwide. Schindler also noted that the risks associated with crypto are rising rapidly, citing the global crypto market’s nearly doubling in value over the past year, which now stands at around $4 trillion. He warned that the chances of problems spreading are much higher as more people invest and as crypto becomes linked with banks and other financial institutions. Stablecoin rules remain weak even as the market grows fast The FSB stated that its primary concern at present is the lack of robust and comprehensive regulations. People and businesses use them every day to move money quickly between countries, to trade on exchanges, or to store digital funds more affordably than Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, the FSB noted that this safety can be misleading because there are no clear global rules to ensure sufficient real assets back the coins. Schindler warned that people and investors worldwide would panic if a large stablecoin suddenly failed or could not honor its promise to be equal to one U.S. dollar. He said governments and regulators must work closely together and share information, rather than creating separate sets of rules that do not align, as the effects of a stablecoin crash could be dire. The FSB also stated that the United States has already begun implementing its first official rules for stablecoins. However, the agency pointed out that other major markets, such as the European Union, the United Kingdom , and major Asian financial centers, have been slower to act. The existing rules are uneven from one country to another due to these delays. Schindler said no single country can keep its financial system completely safe as long as a divide exists because the weakest point in the chain can affect everyone else. The FSB recommended eight measures to help countries build stronger and more consistent rules for crypto assets. It stated that governments should move faster to enact clear laws that define what stablecoins are, who is allowed to issue them, and how their reserves should be held and verified. The agency stated that the benefits of innovation and growth in digital finance can only last if there is confidence, and trust depends on strong rules that protect users and prevent abuse.

Operating across the XRP Ledger and Solana, the project has already drawn over $1.5 million from more than 11,600 participants, establishing itself as one of the most verifiable presales of 2025. Now entering Phase 7, Tundra lists TUNDRA-S at $0.12 with a 13% bonus, paired with the free TUNDRA-X reference at $0.06. The gradual phase structure, combined with public audits and measurable participation data, offers investors clarity in a presale landscape usually defined by opaque pricing shifts. Frozen Phase 7 Pricing: Real Numbers in a Volatile Market Each phase of XRP Tundra’s presale maintains a fixed, public rate until sold out — a model that balances progression with transparency. This contrasts with many token sales that alter prices mid-phase or hide bonus changes behind volume thresholds. Phase 7 data shows continuing momentum: more than $1.5 million contributed and over 11,600 confirmed participants, each purchase combining Solana-based TUNDRA-S (utility and yield) with free TUNDRA-X (governance) on the XRP Ledger. Launch prices — $2.5 (TUNDRA-S) and $1.25 (TUNDRA-X) — provide a clear benchmark for measurable upside potential, giving participants a defined trajectory toward listing. Because distribution ratios, supply caps, and liquidity locks are embedded directly into smart-contract logic, investors can confirm every variable on-chain. The transparency has allowed the project to scale participation while keeping volatility low, an uncommon balance in early-stage DeFi offerings. Verified Code, Locked Liquidity, Public Identity Security verification remains XRP Tundra’s defining feature. Its contracts underwent three separate audits: Cyberscope validated contract behavior and ensured token logic cannot be altered post-deployment. Solidproof reviewed liquidity management and reserve access controls. FreshCoins analyzed minting permissions and administrative parameters to prevent central override. Identity verification followed through Vital Block KYC , confirming that project leadership and documentation are publicly filed. These measures shift the presale model from trust-based marketing to verifiable infrastructure — every audit and certificate remains accessible before token launch. Utility and Governance on Separate Chains The architecture divides functionality between two ecosystems. TUNDRA-S, deployed on Solana, powers yield mechanisms and connects to upcoming Cryo Vaults staking, where XRP holders will eventually earn structured returns. TUNDRA-X, built on the XRP Ledger, manages governance, reserves, and future GlacierChain operations. Separating yield from governance helps reduce single-asset congestion and provides independent auditing paths for each ledger. The design also ensures future staking rewards originate from validated smart-contract flows rather than centralized distributions — a model uncommon in current presale cycles. Future Developments: Cryo Vaults, GlacierChain, and Beyond According to the project roadmap, the coming months will bring activation of Cryo Vaults staking for XRP holders, followed by test deployment of GlacierChain, an XRPL Layer-2 designed to support cross-chain asset movement. Development updates will also include Frost Keys, which link staking tiers to governance access, and expanded DAMM V2 liquidity integration on Solana for enhanced stability. In a recent review, Crypto Infinity examined these upcoming milestones, noting how they extend the same verifiable architecture that defines Tundra’s presale. Each upgrade reinforces the project’s plan to evolve from token sale to full-scale DeFi ecosystem without changing its audited foundations or transparent pricing model. Measured Expansion Over Hype Across volatile presales, phase-locked pricing and independent verification have proven powerful differentiators. With Phase 7 underway, token prices fixed at $0.12/$0.06, and confirmed $2.5/$1.25 listings ahead, XRP Tundra continues to demonstrate that scalability and accountability can coexist. Every contract remains visible, building confidence through proof rather than promotion. As the ecosystem moves toward staking activation and cross-chain expansion, its model of transparent architecture and defined economics is reshaping what a DeFi presale can look like.

Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Is Expected To Go Down Over 3% According to data from CoinWarz , the Bitcoin Difficulty is expected to see a decline in the upcoming network adjustment. The “ Difficulty ” here refers to a metric built into the BTC blockchain that controls how hard miners would find it to mine a block on the network. Its value is entirely controlled by the code Satoshi wrote, meaning no third party has any say on how the Difficulty will change. The BTC creator established one simple rule for the chain to follow: the block production rate (that is, the speed at which miners are performing their task) should remain constant at 10 minutes per block. Whenever miners mine faster than this speed, the network responds by raising the Difficulty to slow the validators back down to the standard rate. Similarly, it lowers the metric instead if miners are having a hard time meeting the quota. The network makes these changes in biweekly events known as adjustments. The next adjustment is set to occur on Thursday, October 16th. Miners have been slower than the chain needs since the last adjustment, so the Difficulty will go up tomorrow. As is visible above, miners have produced a block at an average interval of 10.33 minutes in the last two weeks, which is 0.33 minutes slower than the standard block time. To correct for this, the network is estimated to drop its Difficulty by around 3.2%. While this decrease isn’t too big, the fact that the indicator is reversing course is still notable, as the last seven adjustments all led to an increase in its value. The below chart shows how the metric’s value has changed during the last six months. From the graph, it’s apparent that not only has the Bitcoin Difficulty been climbing recently, the last six adjustments have in fact resulted in a new all-time high (ATH). Whenever the metric rises, things become economically tougher for the miners. This is because these validators earn the majority of their income through the block subsidy , which they only receive when they add the next block to the chain. Since the Difficulty ensures block time doesn’t diverge too much from 10 minutes, miners still earn the same even if they add more computing resources. Whenever new players join the space, Difficulty usually pushes up to compensate for the speed increase that comes with extra power, thus making it so that the same reward has to now be fought over by a larger pool of miners. Considering this context, the upcoming drop in the Bitcoin Difficulty will be a welcome relief for the miners. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $110,400, down more than 9% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin difficulty|Bitcoin Miners|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 12:00:25

With the cryptocurrency market experiencing heightened volatility, these digital assets are being closely monitored for signals that could indicate the next major moves in the broader crypto ecosystem. Bruni highlights that XRP and Ethereum have consistently shown resilience amid market fluctuations, setting them apart from other altcoins. XRP, in particular, has been gaining traction due to its growing adoption in cross-border payment solutions and the anticipation surrounding its regulatory developments. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to maintain its position as the leading smart contract platform, underpinned by a thriving decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem. Amid heightened scrutiny of central bank policies, inflation, and global liquidity, XRP and Ethereum stand out as altcoin bellwethers. Bruni acknowledges that their performance offers key insights into broader investor appetite for digital assets beyond Bitcoin. He also highlights the rising sophistication of retail investors, who now use technical analysis, on-chain metrics, and real-time data to drive informed decisions, making XRP and Ethereum key targets for both short-term trades and long-term investments. The Fed’s Money Printing Signals a New Global Financial System Ahead According to renowned crypto observer SMQKE, the Federal Reserve’s ongoing quantitative easing (QE) programs are more than a temporary response to economic challenges, they are signaling the dawn of a new global financial system. The scale and persistence of the Fed’s money printing have reached a point that SMQKE describes as irreversible, suggesting profound changes are imminent in global finance. Quantitative easing, in essence, involves the central bank creating new money to purchase government bonds and other securities, injecting liquidity into the financial system. While QE is designed to stabilize markets and encourage lending during economic slowdowns, the current cycle is unprecedented in both size and scope. As a result, SMQKE points out that the Fed has now begun monetizing a significant portion of newly issued U.S. debt, a move that marks a structural shift in the mechanics of global finance. This development carries profound implications. While the U.S. dollar has long anchored global trade as the world’s reserve currency, relentless money printing threatens confidence in fiat systems. As the Fed expands its balance sheet, the value of new dollars hinges less on economic output and more on trust in its ability to manage inflation and systemic risk, a balance growing ever harder to sustain. Furthermore, SMQKE warns the 'point of no return' is here. With large-scale debt monetization normalized, traditional finance is shifting. Investors and institutions are turning to cryptocurrencies, blockchain settlements, and decentralized finance as viable tools amid structural vulnerabilities in fiat currencies. Conclusion XRP and Ethereum’s performance now serves as a barometer for broader market sentiment, offering traders and investors critical insights into emerging trends, opportunities, and risks in the crypto space. On the other hand, The Fed’s unprecedented money printing is not just a short-term fix, it signals a seismic shift in global finance. With fiat systems buckling under massive debt monetization, cryptocurrencies and blockchain are set to lead a faster, more decentralized, and more innovative financial era.",News|Ethereum|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|ETH|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-16 12:00:29

A quiet but profound transformation is underway — one built not on speculation, but on standardization. As financial institutions modernize their infrastructure, the shift to ISO 20022 is becoming the cornerstone of a faster, more transparent, and interconnected global payments network. The Global Standard Transforming Payments ISO 20022 is a universal messaging standard that defines how financial institutions communicate payment data. It replaces the decades-old SWIFT MT messaging system, introducing a richer and more structured format that allows banks and payment providers to exchange information seamlessly. This upgrade ensures that payment instructions, compliance details, and settlement confirmations are transmitted with clarity and precision. ISO 20022 WILL ENABLE INSTANT SETTLEMENT, NOT JUST MESSAGING + ALLOWS THE USE OF COMPLIANT TECHNOLOGY LIKE RIPPLENET AND XRP From Wellington-Atlus. AKA Smart Money. Documented. pic.twitter.com/08ulaWmbuc — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 15, 2025 By adopting ISO 20022, financial systems gain the ability to process transactions faster and more securely, reducing manual intervention and error rates. Major central banks and market infrastructures across Europe, Asia, and the Americas are already migrating to the new framework — with full global alignment expected by 2025. How ISO 20022 Paves the Way for Instant Settlement While ISO 20022 is primarily a messaging standard, its design enables the conditions necessary for near-instant settlement. The structured data format eliminates ambiguity, allowing automated systems to process and validate transactions in real time. Combined with modern settlement networks — such as real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and blockchain-based ledgers — ISO 20022 can help achieve true instantaneous fund transfers. Financial experts note that the richer data contained in ISO 20022 messages allows for faster compliance checks, improved reconciliation, and seamless integration with instant-payment frameworks. In essence, it provides the language through which global payment systems can “speak” the same dialect, paving the way for more efficient, interoperable, and transparent cross-border transactions. RippleNet and XRP: Compliant Bridges for the New Standard According to a document from Wellington-Atlus, shared on X by SMQKE, ISO 20022’s adoption doesn’t just streamline communication — it enables the use of compliant digital technologies like RippleNet, powered by XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The document highlights that RippleNet, which is fully ISO 20022 compliant, allows XRP to act as a bridge currency for fast, low-cost international settlements. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution uses XRP to provide instant cross-border payments without relying on pre-funded accounts. This approach aligns seamlessly with ISO 20022’s objective of enabling faster, data-rich transactions. As global institutions align with regulatory and technical standards, technologies like RippleNet can be integrated into existing financial infrastructures without disrupting compliance frameworks. From Skepticism to Trust: Blockchain’s Institutional Acceptance The Wellington-Atlus report, as cited by SMQKE, reflects a broader narrative shift. Blockchain and digital assets are no longer dismissed as speculative or fringe technologies. Instead, they are increasingly recognized as essential components of the digital financial ecosystem. With stricter regulations, regular audits, and the adoption of global standards like ISO 20022, blockchain-based solutions have gained institutional credibility. This evolution marks a turning point in finance — one where innovation and compliance are no longer at odds but are working in concert to build a more efficient and inclusive global economy. A New Era of Interoperable Finance The transition to ISO 20022 is more than a technical upgrade; it is a redefinition of how value moves globally. As banks and payment systems synchronize under a unified standard, the financial landscape becomes fertile ground for technologies that can meet regulatory expectations while delivering speed and transparency. RippleNet and XRP, built with interoperability at their core, appear well-positioned to serve as integral tools in this next-generation payment architecture — one where compliance, efficiency, and innovation converge.

And there are clear reasons for this migration. Unlike Web2 operators, decentralized platforms prioritize player privacy and data protection, eliminating the need for lengthy KYC checks and reducing exposure to security breaches like the infamous 1win hack that leaked data of 100 million users . Web3 products also offer global access — allowing players to place bets or spin the reels from virtually anywhere, without restrictions tied to geography or banking systems. On top of that, decentralized casinos don’t hold user funds, ensuring faster, trustless payouts. Today, we’re taking a closer look at one of the most prominent Web3 betting ecosystems out there — Dexsport, a fast-evolving platform that’s been making waves in both the sportsbook and crypto casino segments. What Is Dexsport? Launched in 2022, Dexsport is a licensed iGaming platform that merges two major verticals — a crypto sportsbook and a full-scale online casino — into one ecosystem. Built on decentralized technology, Dexsport enables instant, borderless access for users worldwide. Pre-match UCL betting.

Sports Club — exclusive perks for active bettors, including boosted odds and tournament rewards. Weekly Cashback — up to 15% back on weekly net losses, credited in stablecoins. VIP Club — tier-based benefits like higher cashback rates, custom bonuses, and even a personal account manager for top-tier members. These offers are updated frequently, keeping the platform’s promo ecosystem dynamic and relevant. Reputation and Reviews In just three years, Dexsport has managed to build a solid reputation as a secure and player-friendly iGaming hub. Industry reviewers consistently note its intuitive interface, strong liquidity pools, and transparent mechanics. According to multiple expert rankings and Dexsport reviews , the platform earns high marks for its stability, decentralized design, and consistent payout record — with no major security or operational issues reported to date. Other Features Dexsport operates under a recognized gaming license and supports nine interface languages, making it accessible to users worldwide. The platform’s support team is responsive, offering real-time assistance through chat and Telegram, while VIP users can request personalized service. Additionally, Dexsport runs a well-structured affiliate program that allows content creators and webmasters to earn commissions from player referrals, further expanding its ecosystem organically. Bottom Line Considering its combination of anonymity, transparency, and feature depth, Dexsport stands out as one of the more advanced Web3 betting platforms in today’s market. It manages to bridge the gap between decentralization and mainstream usability — something few competitors achieve convincingly. Still, as with any crypto or iGaming project, players should DYOR (do your own research) before committing funds. That said, Dexsport’s performance so far suggests it’s far closer to “legit” than “scam.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The whale opened a $163 million short on Sunday through the decentralised exchange Hyperliquid, and the trade already sits at $3.5 million in unrealised profit. The trader gained attention last week after opening a nine-figure short position just 30 minutes before President Trump announced new China tariffs. That perfectly timed move generated roughly $192 million in profit when markets crashed. The timing sparked accusations of insider trading across crypto communities, with many observers labelling the entity an ""insider whale."" Suspicious Timing Raises Questions Blockchain data shows the trader, identified by address 0xb317, uses 10x leverage on the new position. The bet faces liquidation if Bitcoin climbs to $125,500. Crypto analyst MLM noted that the same trader reportedly shorted additional amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum minutes before the weekend crash, suggesting they may have triggered the liquidation cascade that followed. Over 250 wallets lost millionaire status on Hyperliquid after the selloff. The whale's history dates back to 2011 when the address accumulated 86,000 Bitcoin during the cryptocurrency's earliest years. On-chain records show the trader sold 35,991 Bitcoin worth $4.43 billion starting in August to purchase 886,371 Ethereum valued at $4.07 billion. The wallet still holds 49,634 bitcoin worth approximately $5.43 billion across four addresses. Market Carnage Hits Traders Hard The tariff announcement triggered over $19 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Bitcoin dropped 7.5% to $112,505, and Ethereum fell 12.5% to $3,837. Some analysts argue the actual liquidation figure reached $30 billion to $40 billion when accounting for positions not captured in public data. The volatility affected trading platforms across the board, from major exchanges to the UK's best Bitcoin casinos that attract players with instant withdrawals and reduced fees. These platforms need stable crypto prices since their users choose Bitcoin specifically to avoid the delays and costs that come with conventional payment methods. Another trader went long $11 million on Bitcoin with 40x leverage, betting on a rebound from the selloff. The sharp volatility and lack of oversight in decentralised trading reignited debates about crypto market integrity. Janis Kluge, a researcher at SWP Berlin, said crypto participants are realizing what unregulated markets mean: insider trading, corruption, crime, and zero accountability. Binance Faces Fresh Scrutiny Binance dealt with separate issues during the selloff as several traders reported failed stop-loss orders, token depeggings, and sudden liquidations. The exchange denied any technical fault and attributed the problems to a display issue. Binance later announced it would compensate affected users with $283 million for those holding depegged collateral assets such as USDE, BNSOL, and WBETH. The depegging incidents occurred between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC on October 10. Ethena's USDe stablecoin , designed to stay at $1, briefly crashed to $0.66 during peak volatility. Binance confirmed that futures, margin, and loan users who held these assets as collateral during the depeg window qualified for compensation. The exchange distributed payments in two batches within 24 hours of the incident. Trump's approval rating dropped to 40% according to a recent Reuters poll, with 58% disapproving of his performance. The decline follows growing criticism of his decision to militarize law enforcement and an ongoing government shutdown triggered by Congress's failure to pass spending bills. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that Trump's crypto involvement could pose ethical risks if he profits from related ventures during his presidency.

Whale Moves and Short Positions Earlier today, Onchain Lens shared blockchain records showing that a Bitcoin whale transferred 2,000 BTC, worth approximately $222 million, into 51 new addresses on Thursday. The coins were split across multiple new wallets, with 50 addresses receiving about 37.5 BTC each and one receiving 121 BTC. Such migrations are common among large holders seeking better privacy or updated wallet formats, rather than panicking due to the ongoing massive liquidation. Speaking with Cryptonews, Andreas Brekken, founder of SideShift.ai, noted that the ongoing liquidation is primarily targeting “ everyone who combined the two deadliest substances in crypto, shitcoins and leverage .” He added that “ traders wanting to benefit from an alt season need to find coins that fit the revenue meta and hold spot. There is no safe amount of perps leverage on coins that can go to zero. “ Bearish sentiment extends beyond options markets. Lookonchain data also shows one trader opened a 3,440 BTC short position worth approximately $392 million, already sitting on $5.7 million in unrealized gains. Two other large traders built short books worth nearly $180 million across BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE. Social media reports claimed a whale they tagged “ Trump insider ” opened another $120-127 million Bitcoin short at $111,386.

Deribit, specializing in options, holds $2.7 billion, while Hyperliquid accounts for $2.4 billion. Source: Coinalyze Bitcoin Analysis: RSI Divergence Points to Extended Correction Risk The weekly RSI displays bearish divergence, with price making higher highs while momentum makes lower highs, a technical warning signal that often precedes major corrections, according to analyst Ali Martinez. The descending trendline connecting RSI peaks throughout 2024-2025 shows that each price advance occurred with less momentum strength. Bitcoin trades between long-term parabolic support and resistance structures, with current positioning suggesting neither imminent collapse nor parabolic acceleration. Monthly charts also reveal that the 4-year halving cycle pattern may be evolving as the Federal Reserve’s monetary easing shifts the market structure from a supply-driven to a liquidity-driven dynamic. Analyst Ted Pillows suggests “the $BTC 4-year cycle is most likely over,” noting “it was never about a 4-year cycle but about liquidity.” The $BTC 4-year cycle is most likely over. The Fed has now started to do monetary easing, which means Bitcoin could peak in 2026.

Currently, Bitcoin faces probable consolidation between $105,000-$120,000. The $104,000 level represents a critical test where Bitcoin either finds support and stabilizes or breaks toward deeper correction zones around $96,500 MVRV fair value. An extended timeframe for new all-time highs appears likely, with 2026 potentially representing a more realistic peak than December 2025 if liquidity conditions evolve as anticipated.

53224317,https://cryptonews.com/?p=439152,1760616737,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53224317.jpeg,Sony Shocks Wall Street: Tech Giant Seeks U.S. Bank License to Issue Its Own Stablecoin,https://cryptonews.com/news/sony-seeks-u-s-bank-license-to-issue-its-own-stablecoin/,"Sony has taken Wall Street by surprise after its banking division, Sony Bank, filed an application with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish a national crypto bank under its subsidiary “Connectia Trust.” The move positions the Japanese tech giant to become one of the first major global corporations to issue a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin through a federally regulated institution. The application outlines plans to issue a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, maintain the reserve assets backing it, and provide digital asset custody and management services. The filing places Sony alongside an elite list of firms , including Coinbase , Circle , Paxos , Stripe, and Ripple , currently awaiting OCC approval to operate as national digital banks. Source: OCC If approved, Sony would become the first major global technology company to receive a U.S. bank charter specifically tied to stablecoin issuance. The move shows how far stablecoins have evolved from a crypto niche to a mainstream financial instrument, particularly after the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act , a bill that established a unified federal framework for stablecoin issuers, requiring full backing by cash or Treasuries and ensuring token holder redemption rights. Is the OCC Quietly Opening the Door to a New Era of Crypto Banking? According to Sony’s filing, Connectia Trust plans to issue a USD-pegged stablecoin, hold corresponding reserves in cash or Treasuries, and provide digital asset custody and management services. The company said these activities fall within the OCC’s previously approved scope of permissible national bank operations. “During its initial phase, Trust Bank intends to engage in digital asset activities that the OCC has found permissible under existing national bank legal authorities,” Sony Bank wrote in its application. “These include the issuance of dollar-pegged stablecoins and maintenance of corresponding reserve assets, non-fiduciary digital asset custody services, and fiduciary asset management for affiliates.” So far, Anchorage Digital Bank remains the only crypto-native institution to secure a full de novo OCC charter, though it faced compliance challenges that led to a temporary cease-and-desist order in 2022 , later lifted this August. The OCC, an independent bureau of the U.S. Treasury, plays a crucial role here. It is the only regulator that can issue a national bank charter, allowing a firm to legally operate banking activities across all U.S. states under one license. An OCC charter has become a prized gateway to legitimacy, granting crypto firms access to the Federal Reserve’s payment systems and establishing credibility with institutional partners. The US Senate has confirmed former crypto exec Jonathan Gould as OCC chief in a 50–45 vote, naming him the first permanent head since 2020. #OCC #JonathanGould https://t.co/ipM7YhaG8B — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 11, 2025 The OCC has received over 15 applications from fintech and crypto entities seeking trust charters, a sign of renewed regulatory openness under OCC chief Jonathan Gould, a former blockchain executive confirmed earlier this year . Gould, who previously served as chief legal officer at Bitfury, has publicly emphasized that the OCC “does not impose blanket barriers” to banks engaged in digital asset activities. His confirmation marked a policy shift: in May, the OCC issued new guidance explicitly allowing national banks to buy, sell, and custody cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, provided they meet safety and risk management standards. That change has transformed the OCC into a more crypto-friendly regulator under the Trump administration , following several years of hesitation. The OCC clears the way for banks to handle customer-held crypto, buy and sell assets, and outsource custody services to third parties. #Banking #DigitalAssets https://t.co/SUIKNLycQD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Notably, the agency recently approved Erebor Bank for conditional national status, showing a willingness to back digital-first institutions once again. Could Sony’s Connectia Trust Redefine How Big Tech Enters Crypto Banking? The regulation clarity has sparked a surge of new OCC applications from financial and tech firms hoping to capitalize on what has become one of crypto’s most lucrative markets. The total stablecoin market capitalization now exceeds $300 billion, dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), according to DefiLlama. Source: DefiLlama Forecasts suggest the market could drain $1 trillion from global banks by 2028 , making Sony’s entry well-timed for a fast-growing segment of the digital economy. If approved, Connectia Trust would join a new generation of federally chartered digital asset banks. The implications go beyond finance. Sony Bank, already known for steady profits from mortgage lending and foreign currency operations, has been expanding aggressively into digital banking. Earlier this year, it launched a next-generation banking system and the Sony Bank CONNECT app, designed to link its services with other Sony Group platforms and Web3 infrastructure. Analysts believe the stablecoin initiative could lay the foundation for Sony’s broader ecosystem strategy. Like JPM Coin , Connectia Trust’s tokens may initially operate as closed-loop settlement assets, used internally for treasury transfers, cross-border payments between subsidiaries, or digital transactions within Sony’s entertainment network. That could mean stablecoin-powered payments across PlayStation, Sony Music, and Sony Pictures, or instant settlement between Sony’s international branches. Such integration would give Sony an edge in programmable money applications, aligning its financial arm with its global entertainment and gaming businesses, a potential first for a consumer tech conglomerate. Notably, Sony has been active for a while in the blockchain sector. In January, Sony Group launched Soneiun , an Ethereum layer-2 network built in partnership with Startale Group, extending its reach into decentralized infrastructure. The company had first teased the project in 2023, and the chain now holds over $75.87M in total locked value.

Key Takeaways: OKX expanded its custody partnership with Standard Chartered to Europe, offering bank-grade protection. The model lets clients trade on OKX while their assets remain in Standard Chartered’s custody. The partnership strengthens regulatory trust in crypto. The move extends the program first launched in the UAE earlier this year and aims to strengthen investor protection by separating asset custody from trading, a practice standard in traditional finance but still emerging in the crypto space. Partnership Lets Institutions Trade While Assets Stay in Bank Custody The partnership allows institutional clients to store their assets with Standard Chartered, one of the world’s few Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), while simultaneously mirroring those balances on OKX for trading. This means clients can access OKX’s liquidity without transferring actual custody of their funds to the exchange, significantly reducing counterparty and custodial risks. These concerns have loomed large since the 2022 collapse of FTX, which left billions in frozen user assets. Erald Ghoos, CEO of OKX Europe, said the expansion marks a key milestone in aligning digital assets with traditional financial safeguards. “The expansion highlights not only Standard Chartered’s confidence as the first and only G-SIB to work directly with a crypto exchange, but also the growing trust of regulators in this model,” he said. Ghoos added that OKX’s MiCA license provides the regulatory clarity needed for institutions to deploy capital in Europe with greater confidence. Standard Chartered’s Global Head of Financing and Securities Services, Margaret Harwood-Jones, said the collaboration combines the bank’s established custody infrastructure with OKX’s regulatory framework, delivering “secure and compliant solutions” for Europe’s institutional investors. The model, she noted, aims to bring the same level of transparency and safety that institutional clients expect in traditional markets to the crypto industry.

It joins other major exchanges such as Deribit, Binance, and Bitget, which have pursued comparable partnerships to build trust after years of high-profile failures and regulatory scrutiny. “For us, it all comes down to trust, regulation, and innovation,” said Ghoos. “With Standard Chartered as a partner, we’re bringing those principles to life in one of the world’s most important markets.” OKX Integrates PayPal for Zero-Fee Crypto Purchases in Europe In July, OKX partnered with PayPal to allow users in the European Economic Area to buy and deposit cryptocurrencies directly through the payments platform. The move aims to simplify the buying process by offering familiar, localized payment methods such as PayPal balance, linked bank accounts, and cards, with no extra setup needed once accounts are connected. The initiative follows the exchange’s recent Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) registration , ensuring full compliance with EU digital asset regulations. Circle Internet Group and OKX have also announced a partnership aimed at expanding access to and liquidity for the USDC stablecoin. The collaboration will introduce 1:1 conversions between USD and USDC on the OKX platform, improving trading efficiency and accessibility for the platform’s more than 60 million global users.

He noted that Solana recently broke out of its uptrend line, indicating significant weakness. Analysts stated that after the trend line was broken, the Solana price fell to the 0.5 Fibonacci level, approximately $173, and that the price recovered slightly, but the overall structure remained weak. The breakout that analysts predicted occurred during the major crash last Friday. Analysts, who didn't paint an optimistic picture for Solana, shared their short-term and long-term forecasts. Accordingly, they noted that the area between $192 and $188 for the SOL price acts as short-term support. Analysts predicted that Solana could rise again if this zone is maintained, pointing to $204 and $223 as resistance levels. On the other hand, failure to defend this zone may cause the Solana price to decline to the lower support level around $159. “The first hurdles for Solana are located at $204 and $223, with both areas currently acting as critical resistance.” It was stated that if the bulls gain the $223 level and stay above this level, the Solana price may experience a recovery towards $246 – $264. Analysts recently noted that Solana, like other altcoins, is experiencing a rapid correction and has already reached important support levels. Analysts predict that if Solana holds the $192-$188 range, the larger bullish scenario remains intact. However, a sustained correction could see Solana test the lower support area around $159. #Solana Chart Update SOL hat nach dem Bruch der roten Aufwärtstrendlinie deutliche Schwäche gezeigt und ist im Tief bis zum 0,5er Fibonacci-Level bei ~$173 gefallen.

Back then, blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain identified the wallet as belonging to a “ Bitcoin OG ” who held 86,000 BTC from 2011. Multiple reports claim the trader opened shorts ranging from $120 million to $600 million across BTC, ETH, and SOL ahead of Trump’s 3 PM ET announcement. The precise timing, just as during the tariff crash, fueled accusations of insider trading and market manipulation.

Satoshi-era whale shorted $1.1B in BTC and ETH 30 minutes before Trump's 100% tariff announcement, banking $190M-$200M as liquidations hit $20B across 1.66M traders. #Bitcoin #Whale https://t.co/seLnV54bX9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 11, 2025 On-chain analyst @mlmabc reported the whale closed approximately 90% of Bitcoin shorts and completely exited Ethereum positions at the bottom, pocketing between $190 million and $200 million in realized profits within a single day. The market collapse triggered over 1.66 million liquidations in 24 hours, wiping out $19.33 billion in positions, according to data from CoinGlass. However, Mlmabc argued that “the real number is likely much higher, somewhere in the $30B-$40B+ range.” The whale’s identity traces back to the 2011 accumulation of 86,000 BTC. Records show that he sold 35,991 BTC, worth $4.43 billion, starting on August 20 to purchase 886,371 ETH, valued at $4.07 billion. Fresh Bearish Bets Multiply as Other Whales Join Short Campaign On October 14, the same trader opened a 3,440 BTC short position worth $392.67 million at $115,783 . Currently, the position is sitting on a $5.7 million unrealized profit, with a liquidation threshold of $128,030. About $80 million in USDC was bridged into Hyperliquid to fund the position. Other heavy hitters joined the bearish campaign. Whale 0x9eec9 holds $98 million in shorts across DOGE , ETH, PEPE , XRP , and ASTER . Whale 0x9263 wagers $84 million against SOL and BTC. A trader who pocketed $160M shorting Bitcoin before the last crash is back with a $392M short, betting that the rebound won’t last and another drop is coming. ⁰ #BTCShorts #CryptoOG https://t.co/rGk88v1Ruu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 Meanwhile, earlier today, a dormant Bitcoin wallet transferred 2,000 BTC , worth approximately $222 million, into 51 new addresses. The coins split across multiple wallets haven’t reached exchange addresses, suggesting custodial reshuffling rather than selling intent. The whales move, and their precision has drawn criticism on the Trump rings. The Trump family’s crypto empire has now generated approximately $1 billion in pre-tax gains over the past year from memecoins, stablecoins, and DeFi platforms, according to a Financial Times investigation. The TRUMP and MELANIA coins generated around $427 million, while WLFI token sales fetched approximately $550 million. Private investors poured billions into Trump-backed ventures, with Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun investing $75 million in WLFI. Abu Dhabi’s MGX reportedly provided $2 billion to Binance using a USD 1 stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasuries, which has raised $2.71 billion. All of these have increased the family’s wealth and net worth.

The settlement comes through a deferred prosecution agreement, which closes the door on mail fraud and tax evasion charges stemming from Ver’s decision to renounce U.S. citizenship in 2014. Why the IRS went after ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Ver, often called “ Bitcoin Jesus ” for distributing BTC freely in the early 2010s to spread adoption, failed to properly disclose the full size of his Bitcoin fortune when he expatriated. By law, individuals who give up U.S. citizenship must pay an “exit tax” on all global assets. Prosecutors said Ver intentionally concealed holdings, causing a $16.8 million federal tax loss. Adding in fraud penalties and accrued interest, his liability swelled to nearly $50 million. U.S. citizenship change sparked tax clash The California-born investor became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014 and filed his expatriation-related returns in 2016. The DOJ said those filings deliberately understated his Bitcoin wealth, violating federal tax rules . Despite his status as a leading crypto evangelist, Ver’s omission placed him in direct conflict with the IRS at a time when regulators were sharpening their focus on digital assets. Authorities warn crypto investors U.S. officials stressed that digital asset holders face the same obligations as traditional taxpayers . “Whether you deal in dollars or digital assets, you must file accurate tax returns and pay what you owe,” said Associate Deputy Attorney General Ketan D. Bhirud. The settlement spares Ver from prison time but forces him to surrender a large portion of his crypto fortune, with the deal closing a decade-long dispute, but it also cements the IRS’s stance that cryptocurrency profits, no matter how early, remain taxable and enforceable.

The event, which occurred on October 15, reignited attention toward SHIB’s ongoing deflationary efforts. Despite the massive burn, the token’s market performance remained largely unaffected, reflecting broader market weakness. Shiba Inu’s price continued to dip as Bitcoin and Ethereum also registered declines. Coinbase-Linked Wallet Executes 140 Million SHIB Burn According to data shared by the community-driven tracker Shibburn, an anonymous user transferred 140,033,123 Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens to a dead wallet in a single transaction. The burn took place at approximately 20:14 UTC on October 15. Blockchain records show that the wallet responsible for the transfer, identified as 0x27d…fe606, was newly created and has only executed one transaction — the 140 million SHIB burn. Coinbase user burns 140 million Shiba Inu Further analysis from Etherscan revealed that the address received its funds from a wallet associated with Coinbase , suggesting that a user of the San Francisco-based exchange initiated the move. The wallet currently holds no SHIB tokens and retains only 0.002 ETH, worth around $9. Shibburn’s data indicated that this single burn significantly boosted SHIB’s overall daily burn activity. In total, 140.39 million SHIB were destroyed across nine transactions within 24 hours, driving the daily burn rate up by 222.84%. This latest transaction represents the largest single incineration in nearly three months. Shiba Inu Supply Remains Largely Unchanged While the burn event marked a milestone for the Shiba Inu community, it had little effect on the token’s overall circulating supply. Current data shows that 410.75 trillion SHIB have been permanently removed from circulation, largely due to previous contributions, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s major burn in 2021. The most recent comparable burn occurred on July 28, when an anonymous user destroyed 600.7 million SHIB . Since then, individual burns have typically stayed below 100 million until the Coinbase-linked address executed this latest transaction. Despite these deflationary efforts, Shiba Inu still maintains an enormous supply of around 589.25 trillion tokens. The total supply has shown little reduction in recent years, indicating that burns alone have not significantly altered SHIB’s tokenomics. Meanwhile, the latest burn failed to spark price momentum. SHIB’s value dropped by 0.15% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.00001049 at the time of writing. The token’s decline aligns with the broader cryptocurrency market downturn, as Bitcoin and Ethereum also recorded losses of 0.06% and 0.73%, respectively.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-16 13:31:48

The company, still losing money, is using these deals to refill its cash reserves and fund its transformation into a major chip manufacturer for others. The logic behind this rally goes against traditional market sense, because selling new shares typically means dilution, shrinking the value of existing stockholders’ stakes. Bloomberg estimates that Intel’s shareholders have been diluted by about 14%, and predicts that it would likely only increase when the U.S. government’s warrants are exercised under certain terms. But the market doesn’t seem to care. Investors appear to value liquidity and survival more than share size right now. Michael Bailey, research director at Fulton Breakefield Broenniman, said: “Investors are front-loading all this good news and really diminishing the real cost — with all of these stake sales there’s massive dilution. It’s a plus and minus situation. Investors are betting that the plus is better than the minus.” Intel secures breathing room while chasing manufacturing revival This surge of optimism comes as Intel faces massive spending requirements. The company is in the middle of a costly buildout of factories aimed at reviving its position as a foundry rival to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). The $18 billion raised so far only covers a little over half of the $30 billion needed to build its next-generation plant. That shortfall pushed the company to approach Apple late last month about potential investment, a move that sent Intel shares up another 21% in three sessions. The balance-sheet boost is giving Intel some temporary relief, even as investors overlook the downside of share dilution. Analysts say this could be short-lived unless the foundry business attracts clients. Frank Lee from HSBC cut Intel’s rating to sell, warning that “any rallies driven by stake sales are not sustainable” until customer demand materializes. Still, for now, traders are betting that the infusion of capital buys Intel enough time to execute its turnaround. The approach mirrors AMD’s recent actions. On October 6, AMD signed a major deal with OpenAI that could bring in tens of billions of dollars over time. In exchange, OpenAI received equity warrants that vest if specific goals are met. The market’s reaction was wild, with AMD shares surging by literally 43% in three trading sessions despite the obvious future dilution. Like Intel, AMD’s investors are ignoring the math in favor of optimism around the AI mania. Analysts warn of risk as AI-era financing blurs lines Jay Goldberg from Seaport Global described Intel’s situation, asking: “Would you rather have 80% or 70% of something, or 100% of nothing?” Jay upgraded his rating on the stock from sell to neutral, saying investors prefer a smaller piece of a viable company over watching it crumble. AMD, meanwhile, is in a stronger financial spot, as its net income tripled to $872 million last quarter, and revenue rose 32% to $7.7 billion, as Cryptopolitan reported . Yet, despite those numbers, AMD still commands only a small portion of the AI GPU market dominated by Nvidia, so its deal with OpenAI was designed to change that. Under the terms, OpenAI can buy up to 160 million AMD shares, about 10% of the company, at one cent per share, if the stock and performance milestones are achieved. The final vesting condition triggers at $600 a share, a level that would make AMD a $1 trillion company. The wider AI ecosystem is also spinning in a loop of cross-investments. Nvidia recently pledged up to $100 billion for OpenAI’s expanding network of data centers filled with its own chips, while OpenAI itself remains unprofitable. Bailey called this “an unusual circular financing thing happening,” where companies “find creative ways to grow.” He added, “Investors are doing the math and for the moment they’re comfortable with it. But if you look at the history of Wall Street, this is unusual.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|AMD|Intel|Nvidia|OpenAI|TSMC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|ASIA|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-16 13:36:17

Among them is prominent crypto commentator Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz), who recently detailed why he continues to hold the asset. His reasoning ties back to Ripple’s decade-long involvement with governments, major banks, and international organizations shaping the digital payments landscape. Reasons for Holding XRP Lord XRP stated, “I hold XRP because Ripple’s the chosen one to lead the new global digital payment system, and they use XRP.” He noted that Ripple’s involvement with central institutions dates back to 2013, when the U.S. Federal Reserve first explored faster payment options. Two years later, the Federal Payments Task Force was formed, and Ripple was the only crypto-focused company included in the initiative. He also pointed to a 2014 report by the World Bank and the Better Than Cash Alliance, which mentioned Ripple’s technology as part of future payment opportunities. WHY DO I HOLD #XRP ?? I CANT TELL YOU EVERYTHING IN A DAY BUT HERE SOME ARGUE #Ripple pic.twitter.com/RoeSsI4ta3 — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) October 14, 2025 Connections Across Global Institutions Lord XRP emphasized Ripple’s expanding influence through global partnerships and affiliations . He referenced the Better Than Cash Alliance, which includes the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, and over thirty governments, all in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. He also noted that the UN’s official exchange, Xange, utilizes XRP for its carbon credit solution, demonstrating Ripple’s integration into real-world financial systems. He also pointed to the upcoming transition to ISO 20022 , the new international messaging standard set for adoption by 2025. Ripple’s network, he explained, now includes over 300 financial institutions and payment providers such as Bank of America, American Express , Santander, as well as central banks in nations like Japan, Canada, India, Singapore, and Australia. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Leadership and Expertise at Ripple Lord XRP highlighted Ripple’s leadership team, composed of former officials from the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, SWIFT, and BlackRock, along with executives from PayPal, Uber, and Amazon. He noted that Ripple also employs former advisors from the Clinton and Obama administrations. He added that Ripple maintains an active role in international digital asset forums and initiatives, including the Digital Pound Foundation, Digital Dollar Project, Digital Euro Association, Hyperledger, and the IMF’s High-Level Advisory Board on Fintech. Ripple is also a listed partner of the World Economic Forum (WEF). A Strategic Position for the Future Lord XRP questioned whether a company with such extensive connections and partnerships could ever be dismissed as irrelevant. He is strongly convinced that Ripple and XRP are positioned to play a vital role in the global shift toward digital payments and cross-border settlement.

53227634,607672,1760622075,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53227634.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Buy as ETH/BTC Pair Finds Critical Support,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-eth-btc-pair-finds-critical-support/,"Quick Facts: 1️⃣ Bitcoin and Ethereum look poised to push the market into altcoin season, with CMC Altcoin Season Index at 29 out of 100. 2️⃣ Either Ethereum or Bitcoin will lead the rebound into altcoin season. 3️⃣ Infrastructure plays ($HYPER) and a trading bot ($SNORT) headline the best altcoins to buy. So is it altcoin season, or not? The concept of ‘altcoin season’ – when altcoins broadly outperform Bitcoin – has long been the prize for crypto investors beyond Bitcoin. But timing its arrival remains elusive, and there’s broad debate over what even altcoin season means. One thing is sure, though – we might just be getting close to a true altcoin season, and that means going on the hunt for the best altcoins to buy . And right now, those include Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , and Ethereum ($ETH) . All eyes now fall on the $ETH/$BTC pair, as it approaches a historically stout support band that could dictate the market’s next major move. Ethereum relative to Bitcoin is trading near 0.032–0.034, a zone that has often served as a bounce area in past cycles. Should the pair find support here and begin to rebound, it could mark the start of rotation back into altcoins. But if it fails, further downside might be in store. But there’s a bigger question among the analysts: who leads altcoin season – Ethereum or Bitcoin? Some argue that Bitcoin must push to new highs and drive dominance higher. Only then will capital rotate into altcoins – a pattern that aligns with many past cycles. The logic basically holds like this: you need Bitcoin to reach ATHs, pushing more investors to Ethereum and other altcoins, which then cuts into Bitcoin’s dominance and establishes a true altcoin season. But there’s another perspective out there. Others counter that Ethereum (and select altcoins) can forge ahead even if Bitcoin stalls. They point to episodes (late 2017, early 2021) where $ETH led strong rallies shortly after $BTC’s peaks. The debate continues to rage on X , with both sides arguing that either Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or both, need to push higher before an altcoin season can truly get underway. The altcoin market (excluding stablecoins) still sits around 20% below its prior highs, meaning room exists for upside if conditions become favorable. And some of the altcoins out there – in particular $ETH , $HYPER , and $SNORT – are poised to go parabolic once altcoin season gets underway. Let’s take a closer look at the best altcoins to buy today. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Infrastructure Play for Bitcoin’s Fastest, Cheapest Layer-2 Upgrade Want to find a winning altcoin these days? Look for the projects that build infrastructure for crypto’s continued growth. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which targets known Bitcoin weaknesses such as low transaction speeds and high congestion fees. By leveraging a Canonical Bridge to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper will allow investors to deploy wrapped $BTC across the full expense of the crypto economy. What is Bitcoin Hyper? It’s set to be the best way to make fast, cheap Bitcoin transactions possible. Learn how to buy Hyper , and act fast – whales are pouring hundreds of thousands into the project on a weekly basis, boosting it to nearly $24M raised. Our price prediction shows $HYPER could potentially reach $0.32 from its current $0.013125, a 2,338% increase. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to buy your $HYPER today. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – 4 Days Left for a Top Solana Trading Bot Meme coin trading is typically madness. Tens of thousands of coins are launched around the clock, with most never seeing the virtual light of day. But if you can find the right projects amongst the madness, there’s room for major gains. That’s where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. A meme coin trading bot based on Solana and native to Telegram, the Snorter Bot will give traders all the tools they need to sniff out and snipe the best meme coins before they go mainstream. That also means rugpull and MEV protection, automated sniping, and even copy trading, all available with ultra-low fees (0.85% compared to 1.5%+) thanks to the $SNORT token. Our Snorter Token price prediction highlights $SNORTs potential to rise from its current $0.1081 to $0.94 by the end of the year. With only four days left, the presale has already brought in over $4.8M. Learn how to buy $SNORT and stake it for 107% before the presale closes. The clock is ticking. Buy your $SNORT before it’s too late. Ethereum ($ETH) – The Biggest Altcoin Dictates How Altcoin Season Will Go Don’t get lost in the altcoin season debate: whether $BTC leads or $ETH does, nearly every analyst expects a strong performance from the biggest altcoin of them all – Ethereum ($ETH) . Whether its $5K or $7K to $8K, the rising tide of Bitcoin and general altcoin enthusiasm should send Ethereum upwards. Add in the continued interest in Ethereum by companies like BitMine, which currently holds over 3M $ETH, and Ethereum’s future looks bright indeed. Meanwhile, macro conditions play a supporting role to any altcoin season narrative: signs that the US Federal Reserve may ease rates further could inject liquidity into risk assets, helping altcoin plays. Buy $ETH, currently priced at around $4K, through Binance and other reputable platforms. Will $BTC and $ETH continue to move up in unison? Or does Ethereum need to push ahead and establish a much higher floor? Either way, with altcoin season around the corner, the best altcoins to buy right now are Bitcoin Hyper , Snorter Token , and Ethereum . Don’t forget, this is not financial advice. Always do your own research before making any investment.

Together with existing SOC 2 Type II, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, and GDPR compliance, these achievements make Everstake the first crypto staking company to hold all five certifications that define institutional-grade infrastructure. The independent audits were conducted by Prescient Security , a global leader in cybersecurity assurance. According to EY , 86% of institutional investors already have or plan to gain exposure to digital assets in 2025, with 35% exploring staking for yield, while 55% cite compliance as a key barrier to entering the crypto space. Everstake's five-pillar certification framework bridges this gap, aligning staking with the same security and privacy standards trusted by global financial institutions. Everstake has completed an independent NIST CSF assessment, with a Cybersecurity Maturity Score of 4.16. Global benchmarks indicate that only 4% of organizations worldwide achieve the “Optimized” level on NIST-aligned maturity scales, positioning Everstake among a select group recognized for its advanced, adaptive cybersecurity practices. This accomplishment reaffirms Everstake's ongoing investment in security, governance, and technology. A Level 4 score confirms that the company not only meets global standards but also proactively anticipates and adapts to emerging threats—enhancing resilience and institutional confidence. The California Consumer Privacy Act compliance further strengthens Everstake's data protection framework, bringing transparency, user rights, and privacy standards to the U.S.-based customers — complementing its GDPR protections for European users. ""Being the first staking company to reach SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA, and NIST CSF compliance further cements Everstake's role in setting the industry benchmark for institutional-grade security,"" said David Kinitsky, CEO at Everstake. ""By aligning with global best practices across security, privacy, and risk management, Everstake ensures that institutional partners can rely on staking services that meet standards comparable to those used in the traditional financial sector."" ""Achieving a NIST Cybersecurity Maturity Score of 4.16 reflects the depth, consistency, and forward-thinking nature of Everstake’s security program,” said Denys Avierin, CIO at Everstake. “This result confirms that our controls are not only fully aligned with the NIST CSF 2.0 framework but are operationally optimized and continuously improved to meet the highest institutional expectations. We don’t simply follow compliance requirements — we advance them, setting a new standard for trust, resilience, and innovation in institutional-grade staking."" The complete certification reports are available upon request. About Everstake Everstake is the largest global non-custodial staking provider for institutional and retail clients, trusted by over 1,000,000 users across 80+ Proof-of-Stake networks.

The round was led by Paper Ventures and included participation from YZi, CMT Digital, Sfermion, Halo Capital, Protagonist, 5N Canton, Eterna Capital, AMA, GSR, Selini, Presto and G20. Temple leverages Canton’s privacy-preserving architecture to deliver 24/7 markets with built-in compliance and connectivity to the broader digital-asset economy. The platform combines features of traditional electronic trading systems—such as automated order routing, all-to-all liquidity, and post-trade reporting—with blockchain innovations such as instant settlement, tokenization, and non-custodial wallets . With the new funding, Temple plans to expand its product lines to support additional assets, financial instruments, and integrations across blockchain networks. The Canton Network, whose development group, Digital Asset, recently raised 135M,has built a new technical stack to update the international financial system in collaboration with the world’s largest institutions. Canton Network is already conducting trillions in monthly volume from products launched by major partners such as Goldman Sachs, Broadridge, BNP Paribas, and more. Designed to meet institutional standards for privacy and compliance, Canton provides additional privacy and compliance features for capital markets —offering capabilities that networks like Ethereum and Solana cannot natively support. The company’s leadership team— Evan Varsamis (CEO) and Dan Simerman (CSO) —bring deep experience in digital assets, trading systems, and decentralized networks. The duo see Canton as ‘An Open Institutional Network’ where anyone can access and build technology for the new financial system. “We see an incredible opportunity to develop new financial primitives with and for large institutions ready to participate in digital asset markets” said Evan Varasmis, CEO and co-founder of Temple. “We want Temple to be a core trading engine for use cases that have traditionally been inaccessible on decentralized networks.” About Temple Digital Group Temple Digital Group is an infrastructure development company building a privacy focused technical stack to trade capital markets on the Canton Network.

The new automated VIP tier system, set to launch on November 1, 2025, will adjust account fees based on monthly trading volumes. This change coincides with rising institutional activity on CME Group, which recently introduced options trading for XRP and Solana futures. New Fee Model Based on Trading Activity Deribit’s upcoming fee model aims to improve fairness and transparency by automatically adjusting discounts according to trading volumes. The exchange will classify traders into six VIP levels, ranging from standard to VIP 6. Each level provides progressively larger discounts, with rates determined by volumes recorded between September 15 and October 14, 2025. Under the new system, VIP 1 traders will receive discounts of up to 16.66% on options and 30% on futures or perpetual trades. At the highest tier, VIP 6 users will enjoy fee reductions of 66.66% on options and 55% on futures and perpetual contracts. To qualify for VIP 6 status, traders must record over $5 billion in total trading volume. Besides, the exchange requires VIP 1 traders to maintain at least 100,000 USDC in their accounts. These balances can also earn monthly U.S. Treasury yields, a move designed to encourage more stable liquidity within the platform. The changes reflect Deribit’s effort to reward high-volume traders and attract professional participants as competition in the derivatives market intensifies. CME Expands Options Market with XRP and Solana Meanwhile, CME Group has expanded its crypto derivatives portfolio by adding Solana and XRP options earlier this week. The move signals growing institutional interest in alternative assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. CME’s crypto derivatives trading hit $901 billion in Q3 2025, while open interest averaged $31.3 billion and peaked at $39 billion. Solana Eyes Recovery Toward $260 Resistance Solana (SOL) has drawn attention from analysts as its price consolidates around $196 after recent declines. Despite a weekly loss of over 11%, the token holds firm above the $190 support zone. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Solana could retest the $260 resistance level if bullish momentum continues. Source: X Hence, maintaining price action above $200 may confirm renewed accumulation and support a breakout toward higher resistance. However, if momentum fades, a correction toward $166 remains possible. Overall, Solana’s structure appears constructive, suggesting another rally attempt may unfold in the coming sessions.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-16 13:48:07

While XRP continues to maintain its reputation as a long-standing crypto asset, attention is steadily drifting toward projects combining innovation and utility. One name consistently drawing expert recognition is Remittix (RTX) , a cross-border DeFi project built for global payments. Analysts now identify it as the best crypto presale 2025, thanks to its strong fundamentals and verified team credentials. XRP Price Update And Market Position XRP currently trades at $2.48, with a 1.64% rise over the last 24 hours. The market capitalization stands at $148.37 billion on the back of a $5.82 billion trading volume, though the volume is down 29.07%. XRP remains a significant player in cross-border payments but is also facing more competition from newer DeFi projects that are developing beyond remittance. This is where Remittix comes in. The token offers real-time crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, bridging digital assets and real-world use. Its mission mirrors what XRP pioneered but extends it through low gas fee crypto architecture and a scalable design that supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies within its ecosystem. Remittix Beta Wallet Goes Live And CEX Announcements Continue Remittix has officially launched its beta wallet, now live for community testing, enabling users to experience instant global transactions. RTX’s journey so far has been remarkable. The Remittix presale has raised over $27.5 million, with 679 million+ tokens sold at $0.1166 per token. Following these milestones, the team revealed its first two future CEX listings on BitMart after reaching $20 million and LBank at $22 million. These upcoming listings will boost accessibility and liquidity, signaling that RTX could soon join the ranks of top crypto under $1 with real market strength. How Remittix Is Shaping the Next Wave of PayFi Over $27.5 million raised in presale 679 million+ tokens sold Beta wallet live for community testing CEX listings revealed: BitMart & LBank Ranked #1 pre-launch token on CertiK CertiK Verification And #1 Pre-Launch Ranking Boost Credibility The Remittix project has now been fully verified by CertiK, the best blockchain security auditor. The verification not only confirms the authenticity, but it also builds trust in the community. Also, Remittix is now officially ranked #1 on CertiK for Pre-Launch Tokens. This recognition adds weight to RTX’s reputation as a crypto with real-world utility and shows that its progress is backed by security and accountability.

The testing was done in collaboration with the Dubai Land Department (DLD) through its Dubai Pay platform managed by Digital Dubai Authority and Emirates NBD Bank. The aim was to validate the operational and technical efficiency of the systems to ensure the highest levels of security once officially adopted in the future. Crypto.com , registered in the UAE as Foris Dax Middle East, which recently received an In-Principle Approval ( IPA ) from the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) for a Stored Value Facilities (SVF) license, which will allow it to provide digital payment services for government fees in UAE dirham or dirham-pegged stablecoins. The testing is in preparation for the final license, when Foris Dax, trading as Crypto.com will be able to provide digital payment services for Dubai government fees in UAE dirhams or AED stablecoins. DLD tested a successful payment for the issuance of a property map. DLD had noted previously that by the end of the year, it would be offering crypto payment services. Accordingly, Amina Lootah, Director of Digital Payment Systems Regulation at Dubai’s Department of Finance, confirmed that the first-of-its-kind government transaction, settling digital assets in dirhams, was successfully executed within a secure, closed environment. The transaction’s value was settled in UAE dirhams through fully integrated systems, ensuring complete regulatory compliance. The Dubai government pilot is part of the City-as-a-Service concept His Excellency Abdulrahman Al Saleh, Director General of Dubai’s Department of Finance, affirmed that the successful pilot is a proactive step toward the future of digital transactions in Dubai , adding that the Emirate will offer an advanced financial technology with the highest standards of security and compliance. He added, “At Dubai Finance, we are working to explore innovative financial solutions that enhance the government payment ecosystem and accelerate the transition toward a fully digital economy, in alignment with the vision of our wise leadership.” H.E. Hamad Al Mansoori, Director General of Digital Dubai Authority, noted that this was a major step forward in realizing the concept of City as a Service, where modern financial technologies integrate seamlessly with government service systems in one secure and frictionless experience. According to Al Mansoori, the ability to pay government fees using digital assets reflects the city’s ability to anticipate the future and embrace technologies that redefine the relationship between government and customer. Omar Bushahab, Director General of the Dubai Land Department, emphasized that the test payment of a government transaction using an innovative method involving digital asset settlement in dirhams reflects the government’s commitment to employing advanced digital technologies prior to full-scale implementation. Mohammed Al Hakim, President and General Manager, UAE at Foris Dax Middle East, explained, “This milestone comes within the framework of the preliminary approval granted by the UAE Central Bank, marking a preparatory phase toward building a secure and sustainable digital payment ecosystem that serves both the government and society.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The market’s optimism has cooled, and BTC is consolidating near $111,000 as traders remain cautious. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC is hovering just above key support around $110,000, which is the critical 200-day moving average, while the 200-day moving average is acting as a resistance above the price around $116,000. The $110,000 area remains critical, and a decisive breakdown could send the market toward $101,000 and the lower boundary of the large descending channel. Meanwhile, the RSI around 42 signals neutral momentum, reflecting hesitation among both bulls and bears. Unless Bitcoin reclaims $116,000 with strong volume, the broader uptrend remains at risk of losing its mid-term structure. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights a tight consolidation between $110,000 and $116,000 after the strong downward impulse. The $110,000 range continues to hold as a demand zone, but repeated tests have weakened its reliability. Resistance sits at $116,000, as already mentioned, which capped every recovery attempt over the past few days. The RSI also remains flat near 40, indicating equilibrium on the 4-hour timeframe, but the lack of momentum suggests the market could break down if sellers regain control. Sentiment Analysis Futures Open Interest Open interest across exchanges has sharply declined following the recent selloff, reflecting a clear reduction in speculative activity. Traders are avoiding aggressive positions after getting liquidated during the last move down. This decline in leverage shows that the market is resetting, but it also signals a lack of conviction for any strong bullish continuation in the short term. Investor sentiment remains fragile, as fear is outweighing greed, and most participants are waiting for a stronger confirmation before re-entering long positions.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-the-next-10-days-will-be-life-changing-heres-what-is-coming/,"Anticipation is building rapidly within the XRP community. Traders, investors, and institutional watchers sense that something significant is about to unfold. Social media has once again become the arena of speculation, analysis, and conviction — and this time, it’s Bale, a respected market commentator, who has sparked the buzz. In a bold statement shared on X, Bale told followers that “the next 10 days for XRP will be life-changing,” urging them to bookmark his prediction and call him out if proven wrong. His words have fueled intense discussion among market participants, many of whom believe that the ecosystem is on the verge of a critical transformation. Ripple’s Expanding Institutional Footprint The resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple case has strengthened institutional confidence in Ripple’s operations and opened the door for renewed partnerships with financial entities previously cautious about engaging with the company. The legal victory has therefore become a cornerstone of XRP’s potential resurgence, laying the groundwork for a more compliant and scalable ecosystem. My sources are telling me the next 10 days for XRP will be life changing. It’s only the beginning. Bookmark this. Call me out if I am wrong. — BALE (@AltcoinBale) October 15, 2025 Parallel to the legal clarity, Ripple is executing one of its most ambitious expansions to date. The company’s application to establish Ripple National Trust Bank is currently under review by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, Ripple would gain the authority to offer regulated banking and custodial services — a development that could integrate its payment technology directly into the U.S. financial infrastructure. Such a move would not only boost Ripple’s credibility within traditional finance but also enhance the utility of XRP as a bridge asset for institutional settlement. Many observers view this as one of the most significant catalysts in the near term — and one that could validate Bale’s “life-changing” prediction. RLUSD and the Next Phase of On-Chain Utility Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December 2024, continues to see increasing traction. Designed to power enterprise-grade payments and DeFi liquidity on the XRPL and Ethereum, RLUSD has demonstrated strong adoption metrics. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent blockchain data shows rising volumes across payment corridors using the token, with several fintech platforms integrating RLUSD into their settlement operations. This growing utility reinforces XRP’s role within Ripple’s broader ecosystem. By bridging stable liquidity with the XRPL, Ripple is effectively merging traditional banking standards with blockchain efficiency — a combination that could redefine how value moves globally. What Could the Next 10 Days Bring? Given these developments, Bale’s statement appears to be more than mere speculation. The coming days may coincide with key updates from U.S. regulators regarding Ripple’s OCC banking application, new liquidity partnerships for RLUSD, spot XRP ETF approval , or additional institutional integrations. Any of these milestones could drive major sentiment shifts and potentially mark a new era for XRP’s real-world utility. In conclusion, Bale’s forecast of “life-changing” days ahead for XRP holders aligns with a confluence of genuine, verifiable events — legal closure, regulatory advancement, and ecosystem expansion. While the exact catalyst remains undisclosed, the landscape surrounding Ripple has never looked more prepared for transformation. For the XRP community, the next ten days may not simply be another speculative countdown — they may represent the beginning of a new financial chapter powered by real utility and institutional validation.

Just a week earlier, Arca CIO Jeff Dorman had accused Coinbase of inconsistent listing standards, arguing that it supported “some of the absolute worst assets” while ignoring top-performing tokens from rival ecosystems. Dorman’s criticism intensified following a separate dispute between Binance and Limitless Labs, a firm backed by Coinbase Ventures. offer from @binance : > 1% airdrop on day 1, alpha listing > 3% further airdrops in 6 months > 1% for ""marketing"" at Binance full discretion > provide 100% of TVL for token pool on Pancake Swap ($1M+) > $250k security deposit > 3% reserved for BNB HODLer programme > $200k… — CJ (@cjhtech) October 14, 2025 Then, in a move that caught the crypto world by surprise, Coinbase added BNB to its listing roadmap , showing potential support for its biggest rival’s token for the first time. The announcement immediately drew a response from CZ, who acknowledged the listing with a mix of gratitude and subtle challenge. Woke up to this. Thanks for the support from industry peers. Listing a 3rd largest market cap crypto should be a no-brainer. Excellent liquidity, volume and ecosystem. Not listing it is a loss for the exchange themselves. #BNB , keep building! pic.twitter.com/h7SptEBdLS — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 16, 2025 But the story didn’t end there. CZ later challenged Coinbase directly, urging the exchange to go beyond BNB and start listing other BNB Chain–based tokens if it truly upholds a neutral and unbiased listing policy. His message was clear: if Coinbase can finally embrace BNB, then the era of selective chain exclusion should end. The exchange rivalry that once defined early crypto competition now appears to be evolving into a battle over ecosystem recognition, with CZ positioning Binance’s BNB Chain as the “stronger, more active network” and daring Coinbase to acknowledge it. CZ Publicly Challenges Coinbase: ‘List More BNB Chain Projects!’ In a post on X, Zhao called on Coinbase to list more BNB Chain projects, arguing that Binance had already supported several tokens built on Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base. “Binance has listed several Base projects. I don’t think Coinbase has listed a single BNB Chain project yet,” CZ wrote. “And it’s a more active chain.” Moreover, I would urge Coinbase to list more @BNBChain projects. @Binance has listed several Base projects. Don't think Coinbase has listed a single @BNBChain project yet. And it's a more active chain. Not a trade. Just recommending, given we are on the topic of being open,… https://t.co/16WkVUM6Om — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 16, 2025 CZ emphasized that his suggestion wasn’t a demand for reciprocity but a call for cross-chain inclusivity, insisting that Coinbase’s engagement with the BNB ecosystem would benefit both platforms and their users. Indeed, Binance has already listed multiple Base-native projects, including meme coin Brett (BRETT), analytics platform Kaito (KAITO), and Aixbt (AIXBT), alongside the Base-wrapped version of Horizen (ZEN). These listings, which CZ has referred to, show Binance’s willingness to support projects across ecosystems, even those associated with a competitor. Notably, data supports CZ’s claim about BNB Chain’s stronger network activity. According to DeFiLlama , BNB Chain currently holds over $8.76 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its decentralized finance ecosystem, outpacing Coinbase’s Base network, which stands at roughly $4.99 billion in TVL. Source: DeFiLlama That gap, industry analysts say, indicates a broader skepticism about Coinbase’s listing philosophy, whether the exchange prioritizes ecosystem alignment over user demand. For years, Coinbase has been cautious about supporting assets tied to direct competitors, and the delayed consideration of BNB shows that tension. Still, the timing of the token addition to its roadmap shows a potential shift in stance. With BNB ranked among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Coinbase’s move could mark a pragmatic step toward bridging exchange silos in an increasingly interconnected crypto landscape. As CZ put it, “This isn’t about rivalry — it’s about fairness.” But for many in the industry, it’s also a reminder that even in 2025, crypto’s biggest exchanges are still battling for ideological and market dominance, one token listing at a time Binance Founder Clears Air on Exchange Listing Fees as BNB Activity Hits Record Highs In a separate post addressing growing debates about exchange listing fees, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao offered a rare clarification, encouraging crypto projects to focus on value creation rather than payment negotiations. In the post, CZ outlined his views, advising projects not to pay them if they believed in their strength. Unpopular opinion post: On Listing ""Fees"" (saw this a few times recently) 1. If you are a project complaining about listing airdrops or ""fees"" (to users), Don't pay it. If your project is strong, exchanges will race to list your coin. If you have to beg an exchange to list,… https://t.co/DtEMb4RdS0 — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 15, 2025 He argued that exchanges have different models; some list everything, some charge fees, and others require deposits or airdrops for users, but none should be vilified. “If your project is strong, exchanges will race to list your coin,” he said. “If you have to beg an exchange to list, you need to ask yourself who is providing value to whom.” Industry analysts say that for exchanges, excluding top-performing tokens like BNB carries more long-term cost than short-term gain by eroding liquidity access, user engagement, and market credibility. Meanwhile, the BNB Chain ecosystem continues to post record activity, indicating CZ’s argument that demand for strong projects drives listings, not the other way around. According to data from Nansen, daily active addresses on BNB Chain hit an all-time high of 3.46 million on Monday, passing the previous record of 3.44 million in December 2023. Source: Nansen Nansen data also showed that in the last 30 days, the number of successful transactions on BNB Chain passed 500 million, surging 151% from the previous 30-day period. The network is second only to Solana, which recorded nearly 1.8 billion transactions in that time frame.

Source: YouTube When asked how regulatory bodies support innovation, Atkins responded that the past approach to the digital asset industry had been somewhat disingenuous, but confirmed the situation has changed. The SEC is now working full-time on crypto regulation and will introduce an “innovation exemption” to permit experimentation with new ideas. “We at SEC with respect to our statutes have pretty broad authority for exemptions to be made, and so I think we can be, you know, very forward-leaning in that in order to accommodate new ideas,” he said. “And if the ideas are not good, the free market reaction would tell.” He noted that the crypto industry benefits from having pro-crypto executives at the SEC, like “crypto mama,” whose understanding of the space helps the agency embrace innovation. He emphasized that crypto is the agency’s top priority to close the 10-year gap created by previous regulatory approaches. When questioned about tokenization and real-world assets, Atkins replied that tokenization is essential because blockchain technology is the most exciting aspect of crypto. “Tokenization is not necessarily the numerous crypto coins as many would come and go, but I think putting things on-chain presents huge potential benefits for the financial industry and elsewhere.” He added that blockchain’s transparency makes it incredibly powerful for solving compliance issues. The 1946 Howey Test Struggles With Modern Crypto Atkins’ comments have renewed attention on how existing securities laws, particularly the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, apply to digital assets. Under the 1933 Act, any asset classified as a “security” must be registered with the SEC unless an exemption applies. The 1934 Act extends oversight to secondary markets, regulating broker-dealers, exchanges, and market manipulation. The classification question often depends on the Howey Test , a 1946 Supreme Court standard determining whether a transaction constitutes an “investment contract.” Source: Kyrian Alex The SEC has used this test to pursue enforcement actions against token issuers like Ripple and Coinbase , arguing that many crypto offerings meet these criteria. However, the test’s application to decentralized networks remains disputed. Critics argue that blockchain tokens, which can power networks, enable governance, or represent stable value, don’t fit neatly into the traditional definition of a security. SEC’s Innovation Exemption Coming by Year-End Atkins acknowledged that the regulatory lag is hurting U.S. competitiveness, as jurisdictions like the UAE and Singapore advance clearer digital asset frameworks. He hinted at moving away from the agency’s enforcement-first strategy toward a more collaborative framework balancing investor protection with innovation. This may include expanding no-action letters and closer coordination with the CFTC and the Treasury Department. In September, Atkins said the SEC is working closely with Congress to provide technical support on securities law. “We want to see this get over the finish line, ” he said, pointing to the GENIUS Act’s passage, which gave statutory recognition to stablecoins, as evidence of growing momentum. @SECGov Chair Paul Atkins proposed an ""Innovation Exemption"" to fast-track crypto products, aligning with blockchain policy moves in Congress. #Crypto #SEC https://t.co/pkWAeCaffd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 Speaking on Fox Business, Atkins confirmed that by year-end, the agency intends to roll out an “ innovation exemption ” designed to let crypto firms bring new products to market without immediately facing burdensome requirements.

The German central bank explained on Thursday that both deep-seated problems and pressure from US tariffs continue to plague the country. It added that the building sector remains sluggish, though there was at best a slight uptick in private consumption. Still, in remarks delivered, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel had expressed tentative confidence in Germany’s economic prospects. He stated, “The situation in Germany is improving.“Now we see maybe economic growth by the end of this year.” The IMF predicts Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2% Germany is still struggling to emerge from an economic slump that has persisted for at least two years. So far, economists expect only slight growth next year, with a more notable rebound once more fiscal support measures are rolled out. The International Monetary Fund also forecast that the nation’s economy will grow by 0.2% this year, aligning with official government projections. The Bundesbank’s June forecast, however, predicted stagnation. The bank noted in its monthly assessment that an Ifo Institute survey showed more upbeat production plans and export expectations, signaling a somewhat stronger industrial picture by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is still deliberating whether to reduce or increase interest rates for the eurozone. However, Governing Council member François Villeroy de Galhau suggested a cut is more likely. He remarked, “If there is a next move, a rate cut is more plausible, more likely than a rate hike. I see a few risks on the upside, but there are more risks on the downside.” Speaking to Bloomberg Television on Tuesday, the head of France’s central bank, however, argued that inflation now carries greater downside risks, adding that the current monetary policy is well-balanced but could be adjusted if needed. Still, a recent survey showed that confidence in the German economy among financial analysts rose this month, reflecting cautious resilience despite enduring uncertainty for firms. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:59b721bb-bf18-46cb-93ef-86b64e9539db-1"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-4"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> The ZEW Economic Sentiment Indicator, surveying 177 analysts and investors from banks, insurers, and other firms, rose 2 points to 39.3 in October, falling short of the 42.6 forecast by economists polled. ZEW President Achim Wambach stated that respondents remain optimistic about a medium-term upturn, despite persistent global uncertainties. Bundesbank suggested changes to EU bank regulations The Bundesbank has recently proposed two major ideas to reduce regulatory requirements for Europe’s banks, as part of its role in an ECB task force preparing recommendations for EU authorities by the end of the year. The German proposal has met resistance from EU banks, which argue that it could undermine profitability — although German regulators insist it’s the right move. The biggest flashpoint is a plan to draw a clearer line between funds used in normal business and those set aside for resolution or bankruptcy. According to Michael Theurer, the Bundesbank’s head of banking supervision, certain banks utilize AT1 capital in “going-concern” frameworks and would need to adjust; however, he believes the approach can be applied safely across the sector with prudent measures. On Wednesday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that while existing rules have reinforced financial stability, they have also inflicted significant damage on Germany’s economy . He said, “The banks are too heavily regulated,” adding that he’s worried US competitors are overtaking European banks.

Nonetheless, regardless of its popularity, DOGE is experiencing indications of a deceleration as it is unable to overcome the major levels of resistance. At the same time, one of the most promising meme-coin investors is becoming Little Pepe (LILPEPE). With a robust Layer-2 blockchain and a massive presale delivery, Little Pepe is shaping up as the next massive crypto success story, with its returns projected to be over 19,777%. Dogecoin Struggles Near $0.19 Amid RSI Weakness According to the existing market charts, Dogecoin is trading around $0.19, and it is being rejected again at the $0.25 resistance level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at approximately 33, which indicates that DOGE is on its way to becoming oversold. This shows that there might be a momentary recovery, but this would only happen if DOGE manages to make it above its current value of $0.22 to resume the bullish trend. Analysts are estimating that DOGE may reach up to $0.50 in the case of an increase in buying pressure and the clearance of the mid-term resistance. The one-dollar goal can only be possible when a wider crypto sentiment, and that of Bitcoin in particular, becomes highly bullish. The most optimistic projection of $1.50 will rely on rekindled retail confidence and macroeconomic aid. In the short run, DOGE is likely to stay within the range of $0.15-$0.25, with a reserved hope that traders would observe RSI indications to pick up. The LILPEPE Price Set Climbs to $0.0023 The LILPEPE presale is nearing its conclusion, and its performance has been impressive. The ongoing Stage 13 is almost sold out, with the token currently priced at $0.0022 and set to rise to $0.0023 in the next stage. So far, the project has raised over $26.97 million out of its $28.77 million target, meaning 95.26% of the current stage is complete. More than 16.43 billion LILPEPE tokens have already been sold, reflecting strong demand and growing community confidence. Only $1,798,641 in funds and 817,565,176 tokens remain before Stage 13 completely sells out. This achievement shows that Little Pepe has gained credibility and a reputation in the market. Analysts feel that the token would witness a strong launch after being listed on large exchanges due to innovation, demand, and interest of early investors. $777K Giveaway and ETH Prizes Energize LILPEPE Presale To keep the momentum going, Little Pepe has rolled out an exciting $777,000 giveaway exclusively for its presale participants. A total of 10 lucky winners will each take home $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. To qualify, investors need to contribute a minimum of $100 and complete a few simple community engagement steps. Alongside this, the team has also launched another thrilling 15+ ETH giveaway running across Stages 12 to 17. This campaign rewards both major contributors and random buyers with generous ETH prizes. The top three investors will earn 5 ETH, 3 ETH, and 2 ETH, respectively, while 15 random participants will each receive 0.5 ETH. These incentives have strengthened community participation and heightened investor enthusiasm throughout the presale. Layer-2 Innovation Drives Long-Term Value The Layer-2 blockchain network of Little Pepe has a new idea of the meme-coin market. It is compatible with EVM, sniper-bot-resistant, and can do zero-tax and near-zero-fee transactions. This architecture offers a safe space for developers to issue tokens effectively. As opposed to the historical meme coins that are founded on hype, Little Pepe aims at developing a sustainable ecosystem that fosters actual blockchain utilization and cross-chain availability. Conclusion Little Pepe is also fast establishing itself as a formidable competitor in the meme-coin market. Although Dogecoin cannot break the important resistance points, Little Pepe has an opportunity to be outstanding due to its technological innovation, large presale, and rewards provided by the community. The project has strong foundations and a Layer-2 strategy, which may make it one of the crypto success stories of 2025, providing investors with an innovative mix of engagement and high potential growth.

Ripple’s XRP has been on an evident downfall ever since it broke its all-time high in July this year, and has lost two positions in terms of market capitalization to USDT and BNB. The question now arises whether it will plunge further to $2, which was posted by popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez. $XRP looks like it wants to revisit $2! pic.twitter.com/B2QFVKsMWw — Ali (@ali_charts) October 15, 2025 If we exclude the black swan market-wide crash from last Friday, in which XRP dumped below $1.5 on most exchanges and even under $1 on a few, the asset has stood above $2 for almost four straight months. The last time it dipped below that line was in June and in April before that. Now, though, the overall market sentiment and conditions appear rather unfavorable for multiple altcoins, including XRP. Martinez also brought up XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which outlined the next key support for the asset if another leg down takes place. He noted that this critical level is situated at $2.10, which is just inches above the potential target of $2. In case of a rather surprising reversal, he highlighted the first major support, which is situated at $2.80. If taken down, XRP could resume its rally and aim at $3 next. $XRP – Resistance: $2.80 – Support: $2.10 pic.twitter.com/jIOGiiZEwZ — Ali (@ali_charts) October 16, 2025 The post Is XRP Destined to Fall to $2?

The data shows a sharp tilt toward downside protection, signaling that large players may be preparing for more volatility as BTC extends its slide through mid-October. Bracing for Impact In a post on X, Greeks.live noted that the options market was showing clear signs of fear. The activity is concentrated in shallow out-of-the-money (OTM) puts with strikes between $104,000 and $108,000, which expire this week and month. At the same time, the options skew, a measure of the relative cost of puts versus calls, has turned more negative, particularly for short-dated contracts. This movement indicates that liquidity providers and market makers are the ones driving the activity, with the firm concluding that, given this landscape, purchasing put options appears to be the most judicious approach for traders looking to protect themselves. “Options participants — particularly large liquidity providers/market makers — are pricing in substantial downside risk, with sentiment nearing that seen after the broader market drop on the 11th,” wrote Greeks.live. This derivatives gloom is mirrored in spot markets. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at around $110,076, reflecting a 2.3% drop in the last 24 hours and a more significant 9.4% dip over seven days. Further, the downward momentum seems to have extended to Binance, where funding rates for perpetual futures contracts recently hit a three-day negative run , an unusual bearish streak for 2025. Some more analysis from CryptoQuant pointed to an increasing volume of deposits to the exchange and a high percentage of market sell orders, implying that selling pressure could persist. A Speculative Market at a Crossroads The current caution comes in the wake of crypto’s largest-ever liquidation event on October 10, which erased $19 billion and reset over-leveraged positions. Despite a partial recovery, the market appears to be in a delicate state, with on-chain data showing Bitcoin had entered a mature “speculative phase.” The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio is at +0.52, a level associated with late-cycle euphoria in previous bull markets. Additionally, short-term holders now control a record 44% of the realized cap, meaning newer investors are dominating the market while long-term holders take profits. While this October is currently in the red, analyst Joe Consorti noted that in the last six instances of negative mid-October performance, the month has always closed positively. However, crypto litigator Joe Carlasare has proposed that the recent downturn is necessary to work through excessive optimism tied to seasonal Uptober expectations, potentially setting the stage for a longer cycle extending into 2026.

In return, the fund will receive native JTO tokens. Andreessen Horowitz invested $50M into Solana’s staking protocol Jito, valuing the project at $800M according to sources familiar with the deal. Based on currently circulating JTO tokens , the platform has a market cap of $442M. The a16z crypto fund will receive JTO tokens in return, in one of the significant late-stage financing deals for the Solana ecosystem.

The $50M investment comes just days after Andreessen Horowitz announced a $300M investment in Kalshi . Jito points to long-term alignment with Andreessen Horowitz The deal signals long-term alignment between Andreessen Horowitz and Jito, announced Brian Smith, executive director at the Jito Foundation for Fortune magazine. The amount of JTO and the price at which the tokens changed hands. “ If you’re accepting long-term alignment where you can’t sell for a while, then there’s traditionally some modest discount associated with that,” said Smith. Andreessen Horowitz has already established a connection with the Solana ecosystem, as the leading VC in the private placement of $314M SOL in 2021. The late-stage deal to acquire JTO is a rarity in the crypto space, where funds usually join ahead of the token launch. Previously, the fund acquired tokens from LayerZero and EigenLayer. As Cryptopolitan reported , the fund directly injected $70M into the fund. The fund has mostly picked up some of the high-profile crypto projects, achieving over 72,871% in total returns. a16z has over $433M in direct crypto holdings in its public-facing wallets. Jito awaits a recovery of SOL staking Jito is still among the top liquid staking protocols on Solana. Over 14M SOL was staked with the protocol, though other platforms are competing hard. On Jito, the amount of staked SOL diminished by 4M tokens since May. Liquid staking may be the next step for Solana treasury companies. Jito is seen as one of the more reliable platforms, with $2.87B in notional value locked. The project still achieves over $407M in annualized fees based on its multiple decentralized activities, including MEV block-building. Despite the growth of Solana, JTO tokens are trading near their lowest level for the past year. JTO is down over 48% for the past year, trading at $1.14. JTO tokens have around 36% of the supply locked, expecting the tokens to be released in the next few months. On November 7, another 1.13% of the supply will be unlocked, valued at $13.03M. The vesting schedule will continue until December 2026, retaining the pressure on the price of JTO. The new a16z investment has not set the details on any changes to the vesting schedule. Jito has also not explained the source of coins and the actual size of the discount sale.

BTC had already retraced from the weekly peak of $116,000 to $113,000 yesterday, before it corrected to $110,000 today. That support held initially, and BTC rebounded to $112,000 later during the day. However, it lost more than three grand in less than an hour and dipped to $108,600 (on Bitstamp). Most altcoins are in an even worse shape, led by a massive 11% decline by ZEC. ASTER follows suit, while PUMP, IP, TAO, and ENA are next in line. ETH dropped to $3,930, while XRP is well below $2.40.

In 2027, it will range between $157.24 and $186.72, with an average price of $171.98. In 2031, it will range between $353.78 and $383.26, with an average price of $368.52. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Hyperliquid Token HYPE Price $37.87 (+1.26%) Market Cap $12.78B Trading Volume $532.47M Circulating Supply 336.68M HYPE All-time High $59.30 (Sep 18, 2025) All-time Low $3.2 (Nov 29, 2024) 24-hour High $39.44 24-hour Low $37.05 Hyperliquid Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $28.45 (-25.43%) Price Volatility (30-day variation) 11.23% 50-Day SMA $47.85 200-Day SMA $35.85 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) Hyperliquid Price Analysis: HYPE receives mixed market sentiment at $37.87 TL;DR Breakdown: Hyperliquid price analysis confirms a mixed trend at $37.87.

The increase creates relatively favorable circumstances for investors, as the altcoin is no longer losing value.

The cryptocurrency’s value slightly increased to $37.87 during the day, as bulls strive to lift the price further.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is near the lower half of the neutral region. The indicator’s value has been maintained at 38.45 today.

HYPE/USD value has decreased to $37.88 in the past few hours, as selling pressure is returning.

From a broader perspective, the HYPE price increased to $37.87, gaining 1.26% in its total value today. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does justify predicting a $50 target. In the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, but if the token maintains its price levels, a rally can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by any time in 2025 once again, as it did in September. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $137.58. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $383.26, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $383.26 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached a high price of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and on August 27, it discovered the $50.99 level with changing market dynamics. On September 18, HYPE achieved its ATH at $59.30, and in October, it is trending near $50.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN|USDC|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ZEC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-16 15:58:40

As reported by Cointelegraph and CoinCentral , the total debt has ballooned to about $38 trillion, increasing at a staggering pace of $69,890 per second. This isn’t just an abstract number. It’s a clear warning that global markets are on edge and investors are starting to look for safer, decentralized hedges. This is where crypto comes in. When inflation, interest rates, and fiscal policies all move in unpredictable directions, digital assets can offer an alternative. And among today’s options, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly becoming a favorite, with early investors already seeing 120% gains, and stage 13 investors still looking at a 36.36% potential gain before launch. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — The Smart Meme with Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is currently trading for $0.0022, and stage 13 of the presale is 95.1% full out of 19 stages. Before the coin launches for $0.0030, early adopters from stage 1 have already doubled their investments, and those joining now could still enjoy a significant upside. Unlike typical meme coins, Little Pepe isn’t just about hype. The project is fully audited by Certik, listed on CoinMarketCap, and currently running a $777K giveaway, alongside a Mega Giveaway offering more than 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers. The presale has already raised over $26.9 million. Beyond numbers, Little Pepe has captured attention by peaking at the top of ChatGPT 5’s memecoin trend analysis, surpassing PEPE, Dogecoin, and SHIB between June and August 2025. That signals serious community interest and strong potential for growth once it lists. Stellar (XLM) — The Bridge for Cross-Border Money At the time of writing, XLM is priced around $0.2672, up a modest 1.19% in the last 24 hours. Nothing dramatic, but steady, and that’s kind of Stellar’s thing. In a world where currencies swing like mood changes, Stellar’s blockchain feels like a calm, practical anchor. It’s not the loudest project out there, but its quiet consistency in making global payments smoother keeps it relevant and trusted. Cronos (CRO) — The Ecosystem Token with Momentum Cronos (CRO) is sitting around $0.2071 right now, though it’s had a rough day with a 7.13% dip. Yeah, not great, but crypto’s full of ups and downs, and CRO has proven it can bounce back. As the backbone of the Crypto.com ecosystem, it’s plugged into real products, payment apps, DeFi tools, and staking. That’s actual usability, not just hype. And despite the short-term red, there’s still a sense that CRO’s long-term story is far from over, especially with Crypto.com striking deals left and right in sports and finance. Hedera (HBAR) — Enterprise Powerhouse in a Volatile Market Hedera (HBAR) trades around $0.252, slightly down about 4% this week. It’s not immune to the market’s mood swings, but Hedera’s reputation is built on something solid: enterprise adoption. It’s built for businesses that want real-world utility: identity systems, asset tokenization, supply chain solutions. While others chase hype, Hedera’s building the quiet, reliable infrastructure that traditional companies are slowly waking up to. In times when trust in old institutions is fading, HBAR feels like the grown-up in the crypto room. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) — The Newcomer with Bold Vision Now here’s where things get interesting. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is trading around $0.17, with a ranking near #30 and a circulating supply of roughly 24.6 billion tokens. It’s down about 4.56% in the past day, not ideal, but honestly, the buzz around it is louder than ever. WLFI’s blend of decentralized finance and political involvement makes it stand out in a sea of copy-paste projects. The Case for Crypto as Debt Grows With the U.S. adding $6 billion to its debt every day, the dollar’s long-term strength is in question. Investors are understandably turning to blockchain assets with transparent supply and real community support. Among all these options, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out, not just for its fun branding, but for the ecosystem it’s building, its Certik audit, and its ongoing presale momentum. Those entering now could still capture a 36.36% gain before launch, while joining one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto communities. The takeaway? In a world drowning in debt, Little Pepe is the most refreshing lifeboat to climb aboard.

Currently trading at $2.57, XRP/USDT is consolidating and showing signs of a recovery, which could indicate that it has completed its most recent big correction ahead of a strong leg higher. What is driving the optimism is the rise in institutional interest, led most significantly by expectation around XRP ETF approvals on October 18–25. CME futures data show XRP achieving $1 billion of open interest faster than all other altcoins, with estimates by analysts of between $10 billion and $20 billion of ETF inflow in the first year. If approvals go through, XRP could realistically test the $4–$6 level by year-end, with some aggressive estimates extending to $8 under sustained momentum.

53232428,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=838892,1760630405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53232428.jpeg,Analyst Reveals The Chances Of The XRP Price Rallying 300% To $9 This Bull Run,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-rallying-300-to-9/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has revealed the chances of the XRP price rallying to $9 in this market cycle. He alluded to performances in previous cycles to explain why he believes this $9 target is the minimum for this cycle, with the possibility that XRP could reach higher prices. Chances Of The XRP Price Rallying to $9 In an X post, Egrag Crypto revealed a 57% chance that the XRP price will rally to $9. This came as he highlighted a descending broadening wedge, which he claimed has a 57% chance of breaking to the upside and a 43% chance of breaking to the downside. He advised those betting on an upside to consider selling XRP when the price hits the $9 range, as that is also a measured move. Related Reading: Analyst Urges All XRP Investors To Pay Attention To This Connection No One Has Made Before Egrag Crypto is also betting on the XRP price rallying to new highs based on the altcoin’s historic performance in past cycles. He noted that during the 2021 cycle, XRP increased by about 1,700% from its cycle low to its cycle high. Meanwhile, the altcoin has seen about a 1,160% increase so far in this cycle. The analyst further remarked that he can’t accept the idea that the XRP price in this cycle will underperform the 2021 cycle by 540%, especially considering the existing narratives in this cycle. This likely includes narratives such as the XRP ETFs, which have drawn institutional inflows into the XRP ecosystem. In line with this, Egrag Crypto predicts that the XRP price will mimic the 2021 cycle percentage gains, which would mean that the altcoin could rally to a top of $5.20. He revealed that he might sell a small portion at $5 to assess the market, but that he is aiming for bigger gains, especially given his projection that XRP could hit $9. No Plans To Sell Right Now Egrag Crypto stated that he has no plans to sell now, despite the recent XRP price crash, which has sparked speculation about a market top. The analyst said that he will hold even if it means riding out his portfolio through a bear market. He reiterated his belief that XRP will head towards a minimum of $9, with an average target of $20 and a high-end target of $27. Related Reading: Buying XRP Now Could Be A Good Idea As Negative Sentiment Jumps To 6-Month High Egrag Crypto also mentioned that if this is the market top, it would mean that they are being “rugged” for the second cycle. He alluded to how the Solana price rose from $8 to around $300, representing an increase of around 3,600%, while Bitcoin rose from $15,000 to $126,000, an increase of around 840%. As such, he believes the XRP price should be recording greater gains than it has so far. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.40, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This rapid increase in debt, amounting to about $38 trillion, underscores a critical shift in investor sentiment towards alternative investments like cryptocurrencies. Reports from Cointelegraph and CoinCentral suggest that as traditional fiscal policies become unpredictable, digital assets offer a viable alternative, with cryptocurrencies like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) showing potential for significant gains.

53232908,607319,1760630459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53232908.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Anxiety Grows: Short-Term Holders Panic As BTC’s Price Remains Range-Bound,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-anxiety-grows/,"Bitcoin is still battling with the recent market crash that occurred last weekend, which has caused the leading cryptocurrency asset to enter a bearish phase. Given the sharp pullback from its all-time high of $126,000, a wave of uncertainty and fear has been observed among BTC investors, especially short-term holders. Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Struggling With Uncertainty Presently, Bitcoin is facing strong bearish action, with its price falling towards the $110,000 mark. As a result of this negative price movement, short-term BTC holders are exhibiting pessimistic behavior toward the flagship digital asset. Darkfost, a market expert, disclosed that Bitcoin is still inside a small trading range, but the calm hides a feeling of unease among short-term holders. “Although BTC continues to hover around $112,500, the STH realized price shows that short-term holders are still panicking,” the expert stated. This feeling of unease among smaller traders highlights the ongoing psychological tension in the market, where speculative investors struggle to find direction because of muted volatility. Darkfost highlighted that the latest liquidation event caught these smaller investors off guard. The impact was significant as even a slight price decline on Tuesday set off a fresh round of panic. As observed on Tuesday, more than 56,000 BTC held by short-term holders were sitting in losses following the drop in Bitcoin’s price. At the same time, the huge number of coins was transferred to crypto exchanges , which was more than during the actual liquidation episode last weekend. In the interim, these short-term holders are still under heavy pressure from the ongoing bearish price action. The market expert highlighted that the recent panic-driven movement marks the third time in just a few days. According to Darkfost, many of these investors are probably the most recent buyers who are attempting to exit at break-even points. Such investor action clearly makes breaking past the $112,500 price level a bit difficult. Are Large BTC Investors Still Panicking? With the current observation of Bitcoin movements by large holders , these key investors might also be entering into a state of pessimism and panic. Maartunn’s latest research has uncovered a massive movement of BTC to crypto exchanges. Whale inflows to crypto exchanges are picking up pace once again at a rapid rate. After his examination, the market expert noted that 17,184 BTC had been moved to exchanges, marking the highest transfer in two weeks. This wave of exchange inflows is being carried out by wallet addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC. When whale investors are moving their BTC to crypto exchanges, it signals a potential profit-taking to reposition ahead of anticipated market volatility. While it typically precedes significant price swings, this trend could ignite the start of a new distribution phase or temporary liquidity adjustment.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|Bitcoin Whale Inflows|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 16:00:59

Kaifu Zhang, a vice president at the company, told journalists that early testing shows the technology is producing measurable improvements. The announcement comes as businesses worldwide face questions about pouring money into AI systems without clear proof of profitability. Alibaba revealed last month it plans to boost spending on AI and cloud computing infrastructure. The company had already committed in February to invest 380 billion yuan, equivalent to $53 billion, on these technologies over three years. Zhang handles AI applications for Alibaba’s online shopping platforms. According to CNBC, he explained Thursday how the company deployed various AI tools, including systems that customize search results for individual users and technology that makes virtual clothing fitting tools work better. Singles Day shopping event approaches His remarks came one day after Alibaba kicked off early sales for Singles Day, the massive Chinese shopping event similar to Black Friday that happens every year. The main date falls on November 11. According to Zhang, initial testing produced steady results, with advertising spending efficiency jumping 12%. “It’s very rare to see double-digit changes” in such tests, he told reporters in Mandarin, as translated by CNBC. Zhang forecast that AI integration would create a “very significant” positive effect on Alibaba’s total merchandise sales during this year’s Singles Day period. The company’s Chinese online shopping division generates the most revenue among all Alibaba business units. In the quarter ending June 30, this segment grew 10% compared to the same period last year, reaching roughly $19.53 billion. Chinese shoppers have spent cautiously in recent years, but Singles Day sales still climbed last year. Research company Syntun calculated that combined sales across Alibaba’s Tmall, JD.com and PDD rose 20.1% from the previous year to hit 1.11 trillion yuan. Despite growth, Chinese e-commerce firms face pressure from price wars that have squeezed profit margins across the industry. During an earnings call in late August, company leaders described AI and consumer spending as “two major historic opportunities” requiring Alibaba to make investments of “historic scale.” Chief Financial Officer Toby Xu stated at that time: “Our first priority at this point is making these investments. So for now, we may place relatively less emphasis on profit margins. But that does not mean that we don’t care about margins.” Stock rally attracts fund managers Investment fund managers believe Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. could continue a $250 billion stock surge this year that made it China’s most popular artificial intelligence investment. The company’s American-traded shares more than doubled as investors responded positively to Beijing’s push for technological independence. Despite this rally, Alibaba stock remains more than 65% below its highest point ever, while major American technology stocks recently hit peak values. Chinese tech stocks have rallied as investors grow more confident in AI investments paying off. Concerns about China’s economy and fierce market competition led to increased short-selling bets against Alibaba last month. However, the stock price remains relatively affordable, and global funds hold limited positions, suggesting the rally could continue. The stock trades far below its 2020 peak following years of decline driven by government regulations, internal company changes, and weak Chinese consumer spending. Competition in food delivery that briefly interrupted recent gains also worries investors. Investors continue questioning how much higher Alibaba’s valuation should go. AI stock valuations globally have sparked fresh concerns that services haven’t yet reached widespread use or generated substantial revenues. The company recently raised $3.2 billion through convertible bonds to fund continued expansion of cloud computing and AI infrastructure. Get seen where it counts.

Ripple’s expansion in South Africa could bolster institutional adoption of $XRP. With 4 days left in the presale, $SNORT could follow $ XRP’s upward trend. Ripple’s $XRP hasn’t had a great month, dropping 20%. The downturn comes as the rest of the crypto market fares little better; Bitcoin currently trades near $110,000, down 10% for the week. But there’s every chance $XRP could drop further still, with one analyst seeing a plunge down to $2 even as major whales sell $XRP . So why be optimistic about $XRP’s chances? That’s because, despite the poor recent performance, technical indicators point to a favorable long position for savvy investors. The path upward won’t be easy. However, recent presale success stories – such as Snorter Token ($SNORT) – indicate underlying strength in the broader cryptocurrency economy. That strength could send $XRP sharply upwards in the near future. Recent Market Conditions and Price Action After a sharp correction, $XRP has managed to tread water, down only slightly in the past 24 hours. The token is testing resistance zones, though it has a ways to go before breaking through the $3 threshold. This behavior occurs against the backdrop of a broader weakness in the cryptocurrency market, where volatility and macroeconomic headwinds have dampened investor appetite. But that appetite hasn’t completely vanished: leading analysts remain strongly bullish on $XRP’s prospects long-term. Recent moves by Ripple itself bolster that outlook. Ripple’s Custody Expansion in Africa Ripple’s newly announced partnership with Absa , one of South Africa’s leading financial institutions, underscores the growing global adoption of cryptocurrencies. Under this collaboration, Ripple will broaden its institutional-grade custody services in Africa. The move could help bridge the gap between large capital holders and the $XRP ecosystem, another major win for the token’s long-term viability. In the meantime, the technical outlook for $XRP includes key price points : Resistance: $2.75 Upper support: $3.15 and $3.75 Downturn: Below $1.00 Upside: $5.20 Only time will tell with Ripple – but there’s another token that’s nearly ready to launch, which could increase in value by 100x overnight. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Presale Ends in 4 Days for Meme Coin Trading Mastery With tens of thousands of meme coins launched every day on Solana alone, sorting the winners from the losers can feel like a game of random chance. Snorter Token ($SNORT) takes the guesswork out of it, giving investors a chance to sniff out tomorrow’s winners today – long before they launch and reach mainstream exchanges. That’s because Snorter Bot operates on Solana and Telegram, where low-cap meme coins launch underground and opportunities for major gains are easily overlooked. Snorter provides: Fast swaps Automated sniping Honeypot and rugpull protection Limit orders Copy trading In short, Snorter provides everything an investor needs to sort through the junk and find the low-cap gems with the best chance to go 10x, 100x, or even 1000x. There’s not much time left on the Snorter presale. $SNORT will only be around at its final presale price of $0.1081 for the next 4 days. That price could rise to $1.02 by the end of the year and even reach $1.50 by the end of the decade, providing gains of 843% and 1287% to investors who get in before it’s all over. Don’t delay – learn how to buy $SNORT and see what the $4.8M presale is all about. Visit the presale website for Snorter today. The idea of XRP reaching $5 is compelling – and not without merit, given Ripple’s custody expansion and the optimistic technical analysis. Both $XRP and $SNORT could defy the doubters and surge to new heights in the back half of the year. As always, do your own research – this isn’t financial advice.

53232683,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86536,1760630754,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Time Traveler: You Need 2000 XRP or More In 2025 to be a Millionaire,https://timestabloid.com/time-traveler-you-need-2000-xrp-or-more-in-2025-to-be-a-millionaire/,"The dream of transforming a modest crypto holding into a million-dollar fortune has fueled countless debates and predictions across the digital asset world. Optimism around XRP’s long-term potential remains strong, driven by regulatory clarity, Ripple’s expanding financial partnerships, and the increasing integration of ISO 20022 standards. Yet, amid this optimism, a bold claim by the X user known as Time Traveler has reignited discussion across the XRP community — the idea that owning 2,000 or more XRP tokens in 2025 could make you a future millionaire. The Growing Fascination with XRP’s Future XRP has long been a centerpiece of discussions about the future of cross-border payments. Its use within Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network and growing alignment with compliant financial infrastructures such as ISO 20022 have positioned it as more than a speculative token — it’s increasingly viewed as an asset tied to real-world financial rails. The token’s resilience following years of regulatory challenges has only strengthened community conviction that XRP could play a central role in a restructured global payment ecosystem. You need 2000 or more XRP tokens in 2025 to be a millionaire+. And 2000 XRP tokens 5 years ago is not the same as 2000 XRP tokens today. We are in the present, and the present feels stagnant, but the future is coming, it can't be stopped. Where will you be in 5 years? — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) October 15, 2025 Time Traveler’s message taps into this conviction. It reflects a belief that as the global economy undergoes digital transformation, XRP’s utility and scarcity could combine to deliver exponential price appreciation. But as with every ambitious prediction, the math and market fundamentals deserve scrutiny. The Math Behind the Million-Dollar Claim As of report time, XRP trades around $2.41. Holding 2,000 XRP at that price would be worth approximately $4,820 — a far cry from one million dollars. For that portfolio to reach millionaire status, XRP would need to hit $500 per coin. That calculation is simple but staggering: $1,000,000 ÷ 2,000 XRP = $500 per XRP Given XRP’s circulating supply of about 59.9 billion tokens, a $500 price point would imply a total market capitalization near $30 trillion. For comparison, that figure would surpass the combined valuation of the global stock market’s largest companies and even challenge the GDP of major world economies. This isn’t to say such growth is impossible — but it would require an unprecedented restructuring of global finance and an astronomical influx of liquidity into the XRP ecosystem. Realistic Catalysts That Could Drive Growth Despite the exaggerated market-cap math, several real-world catalysts could still propel XRP’s value substantially higher: Institutional Integration: Ripple’s technology continues to gain traction with banks and payment providers, and its recently revealed U.S. banking charter application (“Ripple National Trust Bank”) could significantly boost institutional confidence if approved. ISO 20022 Adoption: The ongoing transition to ISO 20022 enables interoperability across financial networks and supports technologies like XRP Ledger, which can handle compliant, instant settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expansion of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): As RippleNet expands into more corridors and partners with traditional financial institutions, transactional demand for XRP could increase, gradually supporting price appreciation. While these developments strengthen XRP’s utility case, none alone are likely to drive the price anywhere near $500 in the foreseeable future. They could, however, push XRP to new all-time highs if adoption continues accelerating. The Mindset Behind Time Traveler’s Prediction Time Traveler’s post serves less as a literal forecast and more as a motivational message for long-term holders. It captures a psychological truth: investors often undervalue what disciplined accumulation in the present can yield when markets mature. The claim that “2000 XRP five years ago is not the same as 2000 XRP today” underscores this idea — that in a market driven by adoption and macro transformation, the same number of tokens can hold vastly different potential value over time. Conviction Meets Caution Time Traveler’s statement — that holding 2,000 or more XRP in 2025 could make one a millionaire — is undeniably attention-grabbing. But while it highlights the powerful optimism surrounding XRP’s future , achieving such a valuation would require a scale of global financial realignment far beyond current projections. Still, history shows that the cryptocurrency market often rewards conviction — especially when combined with patience and sound research. Whether XRP reaches triple or even quadruple-digit valuations remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the digital finance revolution is unfolding rapidly, and XRP remains one of its most consequential players. The future, as Time Traveler reminds us, “can’t be stopped.” The question is — where will you be in five years?

The company will raise the funds through senior secured notes, which are due within five years. TeraWulf is attempting one of the largest single debt financings by an incorporated Bitcoin mining company. TeraWulf targets institutional investors The Bitcoin mining and AI corporation said that secured notes, or a loan agreement, will be offered to qualified institutional investors. The fundraising procedure follows Rule 144A of the Securities Act in the United States. TeraWulf will provide a safety net to the investors through WULF Compute’s subsidiaries. If the debt is not paid by 2030, investors have the right to claim TeraWulf’s assets, like equity interests and even a dedicated lockbox account in Fluidstack USA Inc. An extra security cushion is provided by Google LLC. The tech giant will pledge warrants giving it the right to purchase TeraWulf shares as an extra security. In mid-August, Cryptopolitan reported that Google has increased its stock share in TeraWulf from 8% to 14%. TeraWulf has also signed two contracts with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider, for a duration of 10 years. TeraWulf’s deal with Fluidstack provides it access to over 200 megawatts of capacity at the Lake Marine data center facility. At the time of writing, WULF is trading at 14.93, down by 3.49% from the last trading session. The stock has a year-to-date (YTD) return of 163.25%, a one-year return of 186.54%, and a three-year return of 1,266.97%, based on data collected from Yahoo Finance. TeraWulf has surpassed other competitors like Iris Energy (IREN) and Marathon Digital (MARA) in terms of the proposed secured notes of $3.2 billion. Bitcoin and crypto mining companies are diversifying revenue streams by moving to AI and cloud computing. TeraWulf’s $3.2 billion offering is a huge step in this direction, showing that AI and cloud computing provide a more predictable and stable revenue stream for companies.

Olli Rehn, who sits on the ECB’s Governing Council, told Bloomberg TV that the bank needs to keep all options open when it comes to interest rates. He pointed to several forces that could affect prices in the months ahead. On the one hand, faster economic growth could push consumer prices higher. On the other hand, cheaper energy, a stronger euro, and smaller wage increases could hold prices down. “We have risks that are two sided,” Rehn said during the IMF’s annual meetings in Washington. As quoted by Bloomberg, he added “It’s important in the current context where we have pervasive uncertainty still due to trade wars and due to geopolitical tensions that we maintain full freedom of action.” Rate cuts on hold after eight reductions The central bank has already lowered borrowing costs eight times, each time by a quarter point. But since June, officials have left rates alone. Most observers expect them to do the same when they meet again this month. Inflation across the 20 countries that use the euro is sitting close to the bank’s 2% target . Forecasts show it staying around that level going forward, with the economy picking up steam in coming years. Still, some officials worry that growth might not be as strong as expected, which would drag down prices. Most policymakers think rate cuts are probably finished, though a few say more moves shouldn’t be ruled out. Rehn, who has worked in both central banking and politics for many years, is seen as a top candidate to become ECB vice president when Luis de Guindos finishes his term in May 2026. That would start a two-year period of change at the bank, replacing two-thirds of its top leadership, including President Christine Lagarde. When asked about his future plans, Rehn said he hasn’t made any decisions yet and hasn’t “reserved any removal vans.” China’s export restrictions add new concerns Meanwhile, another ECB official raised concerns about China’s recent moves on rare earth exports . Madis Muller, who heads Estonia’s central bank, said these restrictions could create new price pressures if they affect the global economy. “Shortages of some critical inputs could certainly lead to higher prices for certain products, even if it hurts the economy,” Muller said in Washington. He noted that China’s export controls show how trade barriers “can have an inflationary impact also in Europe,” contrary to the usual thinking that American tariffs would lower European prices. Under Beijing’s new rules, foreign companies must get Chinese government approval before exporting products that contain even small amounts of certain rare earths from China. President Donald Trump responded by threatening an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods. With rates at the right level now, Muller said officials should be “patient” and watch for developments that could move prices in either direction.

Despite years of volatility and regulatory headwinds, XRP’s chart has consolidated into a textbook reaccumulation phase, bounded by two critical historical levels: the 2017 peak at $3.3, which now acts as a major resistance, and the 2021 peak at $1.96, serving as major support. EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL identifies this range as a pivotal reversal zone, where long-term investors are positioning for a potential parabolic breakout. In market cycle theory, a reaccumulation zone marks a period when strong hands quietly build positions after an initial rally, setting the stage for the next major breakout. XRP’s ongoing consolidation reflects this classic pattern, hinting at a potential surge in momentum once price breaks free from its tightening range. A decisive breakout above the $3.3 resistance could mark the start of XRP’s next parabolic wave with the present price being $2.42, one that may rival or surpass the explosive 2017 rally. Such a move would likely ignite renewed institutional and retail demand, fueled by Ripple’s expanding real-world utility and growing influence in global payments. BlackRock CEO Confirms It: The Era of Full Asset Tokenization Has Begun According to renowned market analyst X Finance Bull, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has confirmed what the crypto and financial worlds have long anticipated: the global economy is entering the era of full asset tokenization. This seismic shift is revolutionizing how assets, from bonds to real estate, are issued, traded, and managed through blockchain technology. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has already made significant strides toward this future. Its tokenized BUIDL fund, launched in partnership with Securitize, marked a pivotal moment in bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi). The fund, which tokenizes U.S. Treasury assets, demonstrates how institutional-grade investments can be seamlessly represented and traded on blockchain platforms with greater transparency, efficiency, and accessibility. The significance deepens with Ripple’s involvement in this evolving ecosystem. Ripple recently announced a partnership with Securitize, aligning itself directly with one of the most important players in the tokenization space. This collaboration strengthens Ripple’s vision of building real-world utility for blockchain through compliant, regulated, and scalable financial solutions. Notably, the BUIDL fund now converts directly into Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, delivering 24/7 liquidity and instant settlements. Therefore, this breakthrough eliminates traditional banking constraints, no intermediaries, no delays, no borders, marking a major step toward continuous global finance. Backed by the U.S. dollar, RLUSD serves as a seamless bridge between tokenized assets and real-world capital, empowering institutions to transfer value with unmatched speed and efficiency. Conclusion XRP’s chart signals a market on the edge of transformation with the ongoing reaccumulation phase reflecting rising conviction among long-term holders and a resurgence of hidden bullish momentum. A decisive breakout above the $3.3 resistance could unleash a parabolic rally reminiscent of XRP’s legendary 2017 surge, reinforcing its position as one of the most technically compelling assets in the crypto market today. Meanwhile, the fusion of BlackRock’s institutional power, Securitize’s tokenization expertise, and Ripple’s blockchain innovation signals the dawn of a new financial paradigm, one defined by transparency, interoperability, and on-demand liquidity As BlackRock’s CEO confirms the inevitability of this transition, it’s clear that the world’s financial foundation is being rebuilt, block by block",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-16 17:08:25

What began as an internal disagreement within the Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance has now spiralled into public accusations, on-chain revelations, and an intervention from crypto exchange Binance. Allegations over token transfers The dispute centres on about 286 million Fetch.ai (FET) tokens — worth roughly $84 million — that were allegedly linked to Ocean Protocol’s actions before and after the ASI token merger. The merger, formed in 2024, aimed to unite Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET under a shared token framework to strengthen their collective position in the AI and blockchain sectors. However, Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh now claims that Ocean Protocol mishandled large amounts of tokens tied to that merger. In a detailed post on X , Sheikh alleged that the Ocean Protocol Foundation minted and transferred 719 million OCEAN tokens in May 2023. Sheikh further claimed that by July 2025, more than 661 million of those tokens were swapped for 286 million FET, and that significant portions were later sent to exchanges and market-making firms without proper disclosure. Sheikh provided specific on-chain data, citing wallet addresses and transaction dates. He claimed that over 76 million FET were transferred to one wallet, with about 21 million eventually sent to Binance and 55 million linked to an address associated with market maker GSR. Another 13.5 million FET allegedly went to a wallet funded by ExaGroup. He said that the remaining tokens were later distributed across multiple Gnosis Safe wallets in August 2025 and have “mostly moved to Binance.” Binance restricts deposits of Ocean Protocol’s ERC-20 tokens Amid the turmoil, Binance announced that it will restrict deposits of Ocean Protocol’s ERC-20 tokens starting October 20. The exchange warned that deposits made after that date “will not be credited and may lead to asset loss.” Although Binance did not directly cite the Fetch.ai–Ocean dispute as the reason, Sheikh interpreted the move as a sign that the exchange was taking his public calls for investigation seriously. Industry watchers noted that the timing and the nature of the restriction — targeting ERC-20 deposits — suggest internal risk assessments, possibly linked to Ocean’s disputed on-chain activities. Class action and legal escalation Sheikh maintains that the actions taken by Ocean Protocol have damaged not only FET holders but also the credibility of the broader ASI Alliance. He has vowed to personally fund class-action lawsuits in at least three jurisdictions. He called on FET holders who suffered losses during what he called “the Ocean action” to prepare evidence and submit claims once a formal channel is opened. Humayun @HMsheikh4 · Follow If you are or were a holder of $fet and have lost money during this Ocean action be ready with your evidence. I am personally funding a class action in 3 or possibly more jurisdictions. I will be setting up a channel for all to submit your claims. Hold tight and be ready! 2:02 PM · Oct 16, 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Sheikh also urged Binance, GSR, and ExaGroup to investigate the transfers, describing the situation as “something that would be classed as a rug pull” if done by a stand-alone project. Ocean denies allegations Ocean Protocol has firmly denied the accusations. In a statement issued on X , the foundation said it remains “working and active” and described Sheikh’s posts as “unfounded claims and harmful rumours.” The statement suggested Ocean is preparing a detailed legal and public response while adhering to legal boundaries. Ocean Protocol asserted that its treasury remains safe and will continue to be used for the benefit of the Ocean community. Ocean also revealed that an adjudicator had already reviewed aspects of the dispute under the ASI Alliance’s merger framework. The foundation said it had offered to waive confidentiality so that the findings could be made public, but claimed Sheikh refused.

The deal, conducted through a private token sale, underscores the firm’s growing confidence in Solana’s ecosystem and its long-term vision for decentralised finance (DeFi) infrastructure. According to the Jito Foundation, the investment is not just about capital — it represents what both sides describe as a strategic and long-term alignment. Jito Foundation said it will use the funding to advance Jito Network technology, enhance validator performance, and improve transaction efficiency on Solana . Brian Smith, executive director at the Jito Foundation, described the transaction as the largest single commitment ever received from one investor into Jito. He emphasised that the deal was structured to encourage long-term collaboration between a16z and Jito, with potential lock-up terms on the tokens. Deals involving token purchases are not unusual in crypto venture financing. Instead of traditional equity, investors often acquire native tokens of a protocol, effectively buying a stake in the network’s economic future. For a16z, such arrangements have become a familiar strategy. Earlier this year, the firm made similar investments—$55 million in LayerZero and $70 million in EigenLayer—demonstrating its preference for long-term, token-based partnerships. A major bet on Solana’s growth Jito has emerged as one of Solana’s most prominent infrastructure projects, designed to optimise how validators process transactions and stake assets. By improving the efficiency of Solana’s validators, Jito helps ensure smoother and faster transaction execution across the network. The protocol gained further traction in September when it launched its Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) on the Solana mainnet, a platform designed to enhance how blocks are assembled and traded among network participants. For a16z, the Jito investment continues a recent trend of deepening involvement in the Solana ecosystem. A16z has already backed several Solana-based startups, including MagicBlock and Reflect, as part of a broader strategy to expand its reach into blockchain infrastructure and decentralised applications. Jito’s key role in Solana’s ecosystem Though Jito may not yet be a household name in crypto, it has become a critical piece of Solana’s infrastructure. The protocol supports what’s known as “liquid staking,” an innovation that allows validators to trade or utilise staked assets without unbinding them from escrow. This approach helps maintain network security while freeing up liquidity across the Solana ecosystem, which has been essential to the network’s continued growth and efficiency. Notably, Jito is “intricately tied to Solana’s growth,” reflecting the protocol’s deep integration with the network’s validator and transaction layers. Jito’s tools enable developers and users to prioritise how their transactions are processed — an increasingly valuable feature in a blockchain environment that prizes speed and cost-efficiency. Impact on Jito and a16z coins The investment caused a short-lived spike in the price of Jito cryptocurrency , which rallied to an intraday high of $1.18 from $1.08 before pulling back to $1.14 at press time. On the other hand, the news had no impact on the a16z token , which dropped to a low of $0.05913 earlier today before bouncing back to around $0.06105 at press time.

Traders are still engaging names that pair liquidity with clear near-term signs, whether that is a measured price gain, a defended support level, or an uptick in execution across venues. DeXe fits the first profile. Tron sits in the second, steady after a retest of support. Jupiter belongs to the third, where a flat print still comes with a higher turnover. Together, they sketch a day driven more by participation patterns than headline rallies. Altcoin Season Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) DeXe: Measured Gain With Supportive Structure DeXe is currently trading near $7.12 , up by 5% over 24 hours. The move is not a spike. Intraday ranges tightened through the session while bids held reclaimed levels from earlier in the week. That combination often indicates accumulation rather than a brief squeeze. The interest links to steady usage around governance and social-trading features and to consistent visibility on market trackers. Liquidity has been sufficient across major pairs, allowing larger clips without heavy slippage. If volume holds near today’s pace and spreads stay orderly, DeXe can keep its slot on rotation screens even while the index stays weak. AI develops faster than governance frameworks can catch up. This piece explores how Human-AI collaboration can be coded: translating trust, oversight, and accountability into executable rules, making on-chain governance the next logical step. More detail in the original post https://t.co/mb2vxHGgD1 — DeXe Protocol (@DexeNetwork) October 14, 2025 “From agent reputation to policy-as-code and human-in-the-loop feedback—we’re sketching a future where AI creates value fast, and Web3 makes it trustworthy,” DeXe posted on social media. A sequence of higher lows on short time frames helped trend followers stay involved. A close above today’s intraday shelf would confirm that playbook and leave room for a continuation attempt. Tron: Support Near $0.32 Invites Patience Tron is priced around $0.321, up 1.3% in 24 hours. The price sits on a well-watched band near $0.32 that many desks treat as short-term support. Stabilization there matters because it reduces downside pressure while the broader market cools. Tron Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Reports cite steady on-chain activity and consistent venue depth as reasons the level has held. The trade here is position management rather than chasing. If $0.32 continues to act as a base, the next checkpoint sits closer to $0.35, where earlier attempts stalled. A clear loss of the base would shift the focus back to risk control. Jupiter: Flat Price With A Clear Volume Bump Jupiter is trading near $0.362, roughly unchanged on the day, while 24-hour volume rose about 17% to $43M. The rise in tickets without a directional print often appears when liquidity providers and programmatic strategies get busier, but buyers and sellers remain balanced. A flat close with rising turnover does not ensure a break. It does indicate deeper participation, which often precedes cleaner moves once order flow skews. Traders will watch whether the extra activity persists through the next session and whether liquidity migrates toward one side of the book. Altcoin Season Read An index at 28 says breadth is thin, yet today’s tape is instructive. DeXe posts a controlled advance with supportive structure and liquid pairs. Tron offers a read on patient positioning at $0.32, useful in a market that is not chasing. Jupiter’s higher volume without a price change suggests engaged participants and healthier books than the headline would imply. The checklist is straightforward. For DeXe, track volume against spreads and whether higher lows continue to form. For Tron, monitor the $0.32 base and the reaction on approaches to $0.35. For Jupiter, watch if the $43M turnover becomes a trend and whether flow skews enough to push price out of balance. If these markers hold , selective rotation can continue even while the altcoin season index stays soft.

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), established in the wake of the global financial crisis, said there were “significant gaps” in the regulations countries have put in place to address the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies. The FSB warned that these gaps could harm financial stability. In its assessment published today, the FSB acknowledged that some progress has been made in cryptocurrency regulation. However, it noted that international practice and existing rules are too fragmented, inconsistent, and inadequate to address the global nature of cryptocurrency markets. The FSB noted that the current risks in crypto markets are limited for now, but these risks increase as the market grows. FSB Secretary General John Schindler expressed his concerns: “Financial stability risks are currently limited, but they are increasing as the rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has doubled the value of the global cryptocurrency market to $4 trillion in the last year. This is a significant result. These crypto assets can move across borders much more easily, if not more easily, than other financial assets.” Schindler finally said that as cryptocurrencies become increasingly linked to the traditional financial system and stablecoins become more widely used, close monitoring is needed. At this point, the FSB noted that one of the main concerns is that no country yet has comprehensive regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. While still a small market compared to Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets, the stablecoin market has grown by almost 75 percent in the past year, reaching $290 billion. “We can all make rules, but if there are parties that don't cooperate and don't help each other, it's going to be very difficult indeed because these assets don't recognize borders,” the FSB said, urging countries to cooperate on crypto regulations. *This is not investment advice.

The leading meme coin trades over 20% year-on-year, with the downtrend set to continue as SHIB lacks any major catalyst. Analysts fear the token might not recover its earlier strength even in the upcoming bull cycle. Investors are now positioning into three players with better upside potential. These SHIB competitors combine community energy with fresh ideas. They all trade under $0.05, making them ideal for early investors seeking strong upside potential. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin; it’s the first Layer-2 blockchain explicitly designed for meme projects. This gives it a massive edge over most SHIB competitors, combining viral appeal with true scalability. The project’s presale has already raised over $26.9 million, selling 16.4 billion tokens at $0.0022 in Stage 13, more than double its initial Stage 1 price. Its EVM-compatible Layer-2 design enables fast and cheap transactions, addressing the same network issues that slowed older meme coins like SHIB. Core strengths include: Layer-2 architecture optimized for memes and microtransactions. Zero buy/sell tax and near-zero trading fees. CertiK audit completed for investor confidence. Strict vesting schedule to ensure long-term stability. Pepe Pump Pad is a native launchpad for new meme projects. Little Pepe’s ecosystem also introduces the idea of a MemeFi economy, treating memes not just as jokes but as cultural assets. Analysts believe LILPEPE could reach $1 during the next bull phase, a 450x gain from today’s levels. Among SHIB competitors, it’s arguably the most ambitious and technically advanced. Toshi (TOSHI) Toshi is a Base network cat-themed meme coin. This penny coin has become a surprising favorite among retail traders. Built solely on Base, it blends fun alongside decentralization through the Meow DAO. Toshi jumped nearly thirty percent last week. The token’s value increased from $0.00089 to $0.00105 before leveling off. This breakout has caught investor attention, suggesting growing traction for Base-based meme projects. If this momentum continues, TOSHI could double from current levels, making it one of the more balanced plays in the meme sector this quarter, a smart mid-risk, high-reward option compared to Ethereum’s slower movement. Cheems (CHEEMS) Cheems token has long been part of meme culture, and now, it is back in a big way. The project has surged over 45% in a week, trading around $0.0000015, proving there’s still plenty of excitement around dog-themed coins. As one of the oldest SHIB competitors, Cheems keeps things simple. It runs on the BNB Chain, boasts an active community, and embraces its meme-first identity. The project focuses on community wealth creation rather than complex DeFi mechanics. Cheems’ charm is its nostalgia. It reminds investors why meme coins exploded in the first place: accessibility, humor, and viral potential. Its low entry price makes it a favorite for traders seeking high-risk, high-reward SHIB competitor plays under $0.05. Why these SHIB competitors stand out All three tokens share something Shiba Inu once had: underdog energy. They’re early, cheap, and fueled by strong community movements. But unlike early SHIB, each brings something unique: technology (Little Pepe), decentralization (Toshi), and nostalgia (Cheems). For investors with $1,000 to deploy, these SHIB competitors offer different risk profiles but share one trait: room to grow. Little Pepe: The next-gen meme Layer-2. Toshi: The cat token is climbing notable heights. Cheems: The comeback dog that refuses to fade.

The streaming service will work with Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, independent licensing agency Merlin, and digital music firm Believe on the project. The company did not reveal what specific AI tools it plans to launch but said it is putting major resources into AI research and building new products. This includes setting up a fresh AI research lab and a dedicated product team. Gustav Söderström, who serves as co-president at Spotify, said AI represents the biggest technology change since smartphones arrived. According to CNBC, he explained the company wants to shape this future alongside the music business while keeping creators at the center of their plans. Söderström compared this moment to when the industry faced piracy challenges years ago. Spotify is already testing AI features The streaming platform already offers some AI features to users. These include an AI DJ and an AI Playlist tool that came out in beta testing last September. The playlist feature lets people create custom music collections by typing in what they want to hear. Music industry leaders have grown increasingly worried about AI technology being misused and violating artists’ rights. Universal Music Group chief Sir Lucian Grainge told his employees on Monday that the company will refuse to license any AI system that copies an artist’s voice or makes songs using their music without permission. Grainge said working with partners like Spotify helps create an environment where artists, songwriters, fans, music companies, and tech firms can all succeed together. This partnership announcement came less than four weeks after Spotify took action against low-quality AI content flooding its platform. The company deleted more than 75 million spam tracks over the past years and put new rules in place to stop AI systems from copying or faking artists. The Velvet Sundown, a band created entirely by AI, gained attention this summer after reaching 1 million monthly listeners. The group now describes itself as a “synthetic music project” on its profile and currently has more than 264,000 people listening each month. Spotify has verified the band as an official artist on the platform. Four core principles guide partnership The collaboration will focus on four main areas. Working with record labels, distributors and music publishers which includes giving artists choices about participating, ensuring fair payment and creating new income streams, and strengthening connections between artists and fans. Spotify emphasized in its announcement that protecting musicians’ rights matters greatly and that copyright law is critical. The company warned that if the music industry does not take charge now, AI development will move forward somewhere else without proper rights, consent, or payment for artists. Meanwhile, the streaming platform has faced criticism over CEO Daniel Ek’s involvement in defense technology. Ek, who plans to leave his CEO position next year, led a 600-million-euro investment round for defense tech startup Helsing last June. Several bands, including King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Xiu Xiu, Deerhoof, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Massive Attack have pulled their music from Spotify in protest. Deerhoof posted on Instagram that they do not want their music connected to AI weapons technology.

Renewed optimism around ecosystem upgrades and staking activity has injected fresh energy into ADA’s price action. Still analysts believe its upside may be limited compared to emerging players in the DeFi market. Among these coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-growing new crypto coin, is rapidly gaining investor attention during its presale phase. Now in Phase 6, with over 65% sold out and $17.4 million raised, MUTM’s fast growth is positioning it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for those seeking exponential potential. As Cardano bulls aim for $1, Mutuum Finance could be the project that quietly outpaces ADA with 20x growth potential once it hits major exchanges. Cardano Price Bounces Back: Bulls Target Key Resistance in Attention-Rich Market After plummeting sharply to $0.27, Cardano (ADA) has rebounded respectably back to reclaimed territory and retested the breakdown region of its dropping channel. The next test then lies between the support line and the 20-day EMA at $0.78, where major resistance is made by sellers. A breakdown below this region could slide ADA back to $0.60 or even $0.50, but a strong bullish breakout could spur an immediate near-term reversal. Whilst traders look on the price movement of Cardano and weigh its recovery potential, attention also turns to new, higher-potential projects within the realm of DeFi like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that are capturing the attention of investors before the 2025 market boom. Mutuum Finance Expands Faster Than Projected Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming one of the brightest new crypto coin initiatives in the DeFi space with momentum well in excess of anticipated early hopes.

Despite trade tensions, the financial organization highlighted strong trade activities, upcoming investments, and regional technological growth as key drivers of growth. The IMF projected a 4.5% increase in 2025 growth, representing a 0.6 percentage point increase from the previous April forecast. The Fund also estimated that growth will slow to around 4.1% in 2026, with Asia contributing approximately 60% towards global growth. IMF raises Asia’s growth forecast to 4.5% for 2025 The IMF revealed that economic activities across the Asia-Pacific region remained higher than expected while continuing to suffer from the impact of the U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump in April. The Fund noted that companies in China, Japan, and South Korea shipped large quantities of exports ahead of the tariff hikes. At the same time, increased intraregional trade helped maintain the region’s economic growth. Growth in Asia is holding firm at 4.5% in 2025, supported by strong exports and policy easing. But we project growth to slow to 4.1% in 2026 as export strength fades and domestic challenges persist. pic.twitter.com/PdVrGpLtTm — IMF (@IMFNews) October 16, 2025 According to a report by the World Economic Forum, AI-driven technology advancements played a key role in the growth of exports and manufacturing investments, especially in advanced East Asian economies. The resilient nature of the Asian region’s economy shows how a diversified economic structure and proactive policy responses could help shape a nation’s financial conditions. During a press briefing in Washington today, Srinivasan cautioned that risks remain tilted to the downside. The financial institution warned that tariff impacts have not been fully resolved, especially with new U.S. measures threatening to escalate trade tensions. Trump recently signaled that a possible 100% tariff on Chinese imports could be imposed, fueling market uncertainty. If trade tensions escalate, the IMF has confirmed that interest rates may rise again, narrowing financial conditions and adding to the debt burden, which is on track to surpass 100% of global GDP. According to a recent Crypropolitan report , the Fund released its October Fiscal Monitor, which projects that the public debt could exceed 100% of the global GDP by 2029. The financial organization urged policymakers to take swift action in tightening the fiscal measures and prepare for a potential market shakeup driven by higher borrowing costs. Asia to drive 60% of global growth in 2025 Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, revealed in an interview with AFP that trade tensions can arise at any time. He acknowledged that regional adaptability and domestic demand have helped cushion much of the shock. The IMF has maintained its earlier estimate that China’s economy will grow by 4.8% in 2025, down from 5.0% in 2024. It cited weaker exports being offset by policy-driven domestic demand. India stood out across the region with an increased estimate from 6.4% in July to 6.6% outlook for 2025. The IMF attributed the growth forecast to strong investments and consumer spending across India. The IMF expects Japan’s growth to reach 1.1% in 2025, citing tech exports and fiscal support as the key drivers. The Fund also highlighted economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam as upcoming and continuing to attract foreign investments while sustaining their manufacturing outputs. Globally, the Fund projects that Asia could contribute up to 60% to global growth, offsetting weaker growth in other regions, including Europe, with a projection of only 1.2%, and the United States, with a projection of 2.0% in 2025, representing a slowdown from last year’s 2.8%. The Asian outlook results follow a recent upgrade by the IMF this week, which raised the global growth forecast for 2025 from 3% in July to 3.2%. Inflation was projected to remain at 4.2% this year before slowing down to 3.7% in 2026. Srinivasan urged Asian policymakers to pursue structural reforms that will empower trade and investment in the medium term, thereby maintaining confidence in global markets.

Waiting days for money to settle is just bad business. Our new payment suite lets companies send and receive instantly – globally and without chargebacks. Devs, contractors, vendors, and you. All paid in seconds. Less waiting, more doing. https://t.co/oAyyId9lze — Coinbase (@coinbase) October 16, 2025 The new offerings—global payouts and payment links—allow businesses to move funds using USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar with low fees, instant settlement, and no chargebacks. Traditional business payments have long suffered from high costs, slow settlements, and complicated cross-border processes. Coinbase said its new tools seek to remove that friction by providing businesses with faster, cheaper, and more transparent financial infrastructure. Both features are available within Coinbase Business, designed to help startups and established companies scale seamlessly. Faster, Cheaper Global Payments with USDC The global payouts feature allows businesses to send USDC to any on-chain address or even an email, creating instant international transfers without the burden of high wire fees or delays. Recipients can receive funds gas-free on networks like Base, Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain, or via email if they don’t yet have a crypto wallet. The platform also includes contact management tools to save vendor details and prevent manual errors, while a Payouts API supports automated, batch, or scheduled payments. This flexibility helps companies better manage global contractor or vendor networks and improve cash flow predictability. “Your business moves fast—your money should too,” Coinbase stated, showing how these tools can streamline workflows and free up liquidity tied to slow settlement systems. Simplified Customer Payments with Instant Settlement Coinbase’s new payment links feature offers businesses a simple way to collect payments from customers worldwide. Each shareable link allows a business to request a specific amount in USDC, payable in seconds via wallets such as Base, MetaMask, or Phantom—with no network fees, no chargebacks, and no 3% card processing fees. For developers, the upcoming Payment Links API will allow dynamic payment creation directly inside apps or e-commerce flows. Coinbase Business customers can also earn 4.1% APY on USDC balances and integrate their transactions with QuickBooks, Xero, or CoinTracker, ensuring full accounting transparency and compliance. The Future of Coinbase Merchant Solutions The rollout of these features marks the next evolution in Coinbase’s merchant strategy. Coinbase Commerce will soon merge with Coinbase Business, offering an integrated ecosystem with full custody and fiat cash-out capabilities—previously unavailable to Commerce users. Currently in alpha for early U.S. customers, Coinbase Business is designed as an all-in-one financial platform for modern companies, combining regulated infrastructure with instant onboarding and enterprise-grade crypto services.

Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Waller told the audience: “Based on all of the data we have on the labor market, I believe the FOMC should reduce the policy rate another 25 basis points at our meeting that concludes Oct. 29. But beyond that point, I will be looking for how the solid GDP data reconcile with the softening labor market.” Waller’s statement came amid growing debate inside the Fed about how aggressively to ease policy. Stephen Miran , another Fed Governor, said he will again press for a half‑point reduction when the committee meets, arguing that a weak job market and rising geopolitical risks make a stronger move necessary. Miran’s call proves rumored tension within the central bank between those urging faster cuts and those, like Waller, preferring to move gradually while inflation remains stubborn under President Donald Trump’s tariff‑driven price pressures. Waller lays out scenarios as labor market weakens In his speech, Fed’s Waller detailed two scenarios guiding his outlook. If GDP growth continues and employment rebounds, he said, the Fed must act carefully to avoid reigniting inflation. But if the economy deteriorates further, the central bank may have to reduce rates by as much as 1.25 percentage points. “What I would want to avoid,” Waller said, “is rekindling inflationary pressure by moving too quickly and squandering the significant progress we have made taming inflation. The labor market has been sending some clear warnings lately, and we should be ready to act if those warnings are validated by what we learn in the coming weeks and months.” Waller emphasized that he sees Trump’s tariffs as temporary price shocks, not long‑term inflation drivers. His position aligns with most of the FOMC, which has leaned toward smaller, incremental cuts this year rather than Miran’s larger proposals. Despite disagreements, both governors agree more reductions are likely, though the scale remains uncertain. The FOMC has faced what officials describe as a data dilemma, caught between soft hiring data and missing economic indicators due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has stalled key releases. That data blackout has made decisions harder as the Fed weighs whether economic weakness reflects a genuine slowdown or temporary noise. Miran pushes for deeper cuts as shutdown clouds outlook Speaking separately on Fox Business, Miran repeated that he believes the central bank should go further. “My view is that it should be 50 basis points,” he said. “However, I expect it to be an additional 25 and I think that we’re probably set up for three 25‑basis‑point cuts this year, for a total of 75 basis points this year.” Miran’s push echoes his September stance, when he voted alone for a half‑point reduction and lost 11‑1 to the rest of the committee. Miran said the lack of new data makes it difficult to judge how the economy is evolving. “It would be really helpful to have the economic data in order to be able to make the decisions we need to make,” hesaid. “Without those data, we still have to make a decision anyway, and so we’ll have to rely upon our forecasts for doing so.” Miran added that growth “looks OK for most of this year,” but he’s worried about rising tensions between the United States and China, which he believes strengthen the case for sharper easing. Earlier in the week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the slowdown in hiring leaves the door open for more rate cuts. Participants from the September meeting projected two more reductions this year, while Miran continues to argue for a cumulative 1.25‑percentage‑point cut by the end of 2025.

Little Pepe is building a Layer 2 meme blockchain, setting it apart from many coins that rely solely on hype. Designed for scalability, ultra-low fees, and fairness, this project could easily redefine what meme coins represent. The question now circulating in crypto circles is simple: Could a $500 investment in LILPEPE set you up for life? A Layer 2 for meme culture Unlike traditional meme tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu that thrive on community alone, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is a full-fledged blockchain ecosystem designed to power the next generation of meme projects. Its Layer 2 network, often dubbed the “meme breeding ground”, will enable creators to launch, trade, and grow meme tokens seamlessly in a bot-resistant environment. The Meme Launchpad, a platform innovation, enables fair launches and decentralized production of meme assets. This makes meme fans participants in a blockchain-powered creative economy, not just speculators. Presale and listing price advantage At the heart of LILPEPE’s explosive potential is its strategic presale structure. The token is currently priced at $0.0022 in Stage 13, with $27,020,879 raised and 16,452,671,249 tokens sold. The final listing price is set at $0.003, offering early buyers an immediate upside upon exchange launch. This means that even before public trading begins, presale investors already enjoy built-in profit potential. At current prices, $500 buys 227,000 LILPEPE tokens. If the token hits $0.50, a figure supported by multiple 2026 analyst estimates, the investment would be worth $113,500, a 226x return. Even a minor increase to $0.05 would turn $500 into $11,350, illustrating the significant influence early-stage entries have on growing ecosystems. The roadmap: from birth to billion-dollar ambition Little Pepe’s roadmap is divided into symbolic yet purposeful phases: Pregnancy Phase – Development of the core L2 infrastructure, optimized for meme scalability, security, and low fees. Birth Phase – Token launch and early exchange listings, including DEX and CEX integrations. Growth Phase – Marketing expansion, influencer campaigns, and ecosystem integration, including the Meme Launchpad and staking platform. To become the “King of Meme Chains” is the project’s audacious but realistic goal. Little Pepe aims to host hundreds of meme coins and thousands of community-led projects, creating a long-term cultural and financial ecosystem with Ethereum-level security and lightning-fast transaction rates. Tokenomics that reward holders Out of its 100 billion total supply, Little Pepe maintains a healthy allocation designed for growth and sustainability: 26.5% for presale participants 30% for chain reserves 13.5% for staking and rewards 10% each for liquidity, marketing, and CEX/DEX reserves Importantly, there are zero buy/sell taxes, ensuring frictionless trading and liquidity. Its CertiK audit score of 95.49% also boosts investor confidence by informing buyers that the project’s smart contracts are safe and have been checked by professionals. Why LILPEPE could change lives LILPEPE is in its infancy—its market cap at launch is expected to be under $100 million, giving it tremendous upside potential. If LILPEPE were to reach even a modest $1 billion market cap, each token could trade at a price near $0.01, representing a 5x gain from the listing price. If the price increases to $10 billion, it will decrease to $0.10–$0.12, which will significantly impact the lives of early holders. These goals aren’t unreasonable when you consider the excellent fundamentals, the viral marketing strategy, and the growing meme economy. Final thoughts: the smart $500 bet Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just a meme; it’s a movement. By combining blockchain innovation with meme culture, it presents one of the most exciting asymmetric opportunities in 2025. For early investors, a $500 bet could evolve into a generational wealth play, provided the project continues to execute on its roadmap and listings unfold as planned. With its Layer 2 foundation, CertiK audit, rewarding giveaways, and massive presale momentum, LILPEPE could be the defining meme coin of the decade. To participate, visit LittlePepe.com , connect your wallet, and secure your tokens before the next price increase. The future of memes, and perhaps your financial freedom, may just begin with Little Pepe.

These companies, which aggregate crypto assets ranging from Bitcoin to Dogecoin, indirectly offer their digital currencies to investors through publicly traded stocks. However, the rapid growth of the sector has some experts worried. Critics warn that DATs could be the next “bubble crash” in the crypto world. Speaking on Fortune's Crypto Playbook, BitMine President and longtime crypto analyst Tom Lee said that this bubble “may have already burst.” Lee first encountered Bitcoin in 2012 while serving as chief strategist at JPMorgan. He later became a prominent advocate for Bitcoin through his founding firm Fundstrat, even as Wall Street remained wary of cryptocurrencies. In June, he joined a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company called BitMine and began leading the firm's rebranding as “Ethereum's largest institutional investor.” Related News: BREAKING: Ripple (XRP) Announces New $1 Billion Acquisition Deal Inspired by a strategy launched by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor in 2020, Lee aims to make BitMine the “MicroStrategy of Ethereum.” MicroStrategy offered investors access to cryptocurrency by accumulating Bitcoin even before direct ETFs were approved. BitMine currently has a market capitalization of over $15 billion and the company holds over three million Ethereum, equivalent to approximately 2.5% of the total supply. Lee's goal is to increase this figure to 5%. According to the experienced analyst, Ethereum remains the “blockchain of Wall Street,” as financial institutions still largely choose Ethereum for their stablecoin and tokenized asset projects. However, Lee noted that the overall picture for digital asset holdings is bleak. He argued that many DATs are currently trading below their net asset value (NAV), adding, “If this isn't a bubble burst, what is?” *This is not investment advice.

Appfigures, a firm that tracks app downloads, shared information with Business Insider showing a clear pattern. When Google rolled out its Gemini 2.5 Flash model, nicknamed Nano Banana, in August, people rushed to download it. At the same time, Adobe’s Firefly app, which does similar work with images and video, saw its downloads fall. Nobody can say for sure that the two things are connected, but the timing lines up closely. Firefly had been doing well since it came out in June. By August, downloads had jumped 150% from the month before, according to Randy Nelson, who leads insights at Appfigures. Gemini only grew 20% during those same weeks. The numbers cover downloads from both Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Adobe Firefly sees sharp drop after Nano Banana launch Things changed fast after Google added Nano Banana to Gemini on August 26. Within a week, Firefly downloads fell by more than half. Gemini downloads shot up instead. By October 6, the gap had grown even wider. Gemini downloads increased 331% since the last week of July. On the other hand, Firefly lost 68% of downloads, the lowest it had been since Nano Banana arrived, the Appfigures data shows. Looking at actual download numbers makes the shift even clearer. Gemini pulled in 6.1 million more downloads last week than it did the week the new image tool launched. Firefly, on the other hand, saw 2 million fewer downloads. The pattern holds up when looking at specific places too. In the United States, Gemini downloads jumped 88% from late September to late October, Appfigures found. Firefly dropped 82% during the same weeks in the US. Adobe tries to fight back Adobe tried to respond by adding Google’s Nano Banana to its own Firefly app in September. When Nano Banana first came out, Adobe told Business Insider that putting several different models in one app was better for users because they would not need to switch between apps. But people still seem to prefer going straight to Gemini . Adobe’s stock price tells part of the story. It has fallen nearly 35% over the past year. The company faces pressure from Google, OpenAI, and other firms building AI tools. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Detailed in an official press release on Ripple’s website, this transaction emphasizes the San Francisco fintech giant’s aggressive push to embed digital assets into the core operations of global corporations. Ripple eyes corporate treasury players with GTreasury move Ripple’s foray into corporate treasury management through the GTreasury acquisition marks a pivotal evolution for the company. It’s a move that adds to recent deals and partnerships . This is because Ripple is a major champion of efficient global payments via its solutions. Other than XRP, the company is behind the Ripple USD stablecoin and the XRP Ledger network. Treasury plays across the ecosystem, including those focused on the native token XRP, are on the rise. Ripple acquires key platform GTreasury, founded over four decades ago, brings to the table a suite of tools renowned for their compliance rigor and connectivity to major banks and enterprise resource planning systems. Its platform excels in risk assessment, foreign exchange hedging, and liquidity optimization. Meanwhile, Ripple’s blockchain solution addresses the inefficiencies that have plagued treasurers for years, such as delayed settlements and exorbitant fees. By merging GTreasury’s forecasting and audit capabilities with Ripple’s real-time transaction network, the combined entity aims to empower finance leaders to deploy idle capital more dynamically. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, said: For too long, money has been stuck in slow, outdated payment systems and infrastructure, causing unnecessary delays, high costs, and roadblocks to entering new markets — problems that blockchain technologies are ideally suited to solve. Growth opportunity The GTreasury footprint is global, with the Chicago-based firm having offices in Dublin, London, Sydney, Singapore, and Manila. In the grand scheme of things, this is another major move that adds to Ripple’s acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road and stablecoin platform Rail. The integration could be a huge boost to RLUSD and XRP as treasury firms take advantage of crypto and blockchain for growth opportunities. “I’m excited for Ripple and GTreasury to help corporates move money around the world faster, cheaper, 24/7/365, and actively manage and grow their money through safe, more efficient solutions. It’s the Ripple platform put to work at the global corporate scale. The opportunity to unlock trillions in trapped capital for corporates is huge and ambitious and… did I say exciting!?” Ripple president Monica Long said . The deal, which Ripple expects to close later in the year, will allow for the teaming up of two platforms that could offer a major boost to Fortune 500 CFOs and treasurers. GTreasury’s suite of tools will help equip these players with tools to easily manage and scale the adoption of stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and other assets.

We’re proud to announce @Ripple is acquiring treasury management leader GTreasury: https://t.co/9EF3tWLKaF The fusion of Ripple’s enterprise crypto solutions with GTreasury’s 40+ years of expertise immediately opens the multi-trillion-dollar corporate treasury market. Learn how… — Ripple (@Ripple) October 16, 2025 The deal marks Ripple’s largest expansion to date, positioning the company to tap into the multi-trillion-dollar corporate treasury market and connect with some of the world’s largest and most established businesses. GTreasury brings over four decades of experience supporting treasury operations for leading global brands, providing solutions across liquidity, risk, and cash management. Bridging Blockchain and Treasury Infrastructure “For too long, money has been stuck in slow, outdated payment systems and infrastructure, causing unnecessary delays, high costs, and roadblocks to entering new markets—problems that blockchain technologies are ideally suited to solve,” said Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO. He added that the combination of Ripple’s blockchain capabilities with GTreasury’s deep expertise in treasury operations creates a powerful foundation for global enterprises: “Together, we bring the best of both worlds, so treasury and finance teams can finally put their trapped capital to work, process payments instantly, and open up new growth opportunities.” The acquisition shows Ripple’s intent to bridge traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems, allowing corporates to manage liquidity and payments in real time. Real-Time Liquidity and Capital Efficiency As the financial world accelerates toward tokenized assets and stablecoin adoption, Fortune 500 CFOs and treasurers are seeking infrastructure that can handle both fiat and digital assets at scale. Through this acquisition, Ripple and GTreasury seek to empower clients to unlock idle capital by accessing the multitrillion-dollar global repo market via prime broker Hidden Road and move money instantly using Ripple’s cross-border blockchain network for real-time, 24/7/365 transactions at competitive rates. “By joining Ripple, we are accelerating our vision from managing capital to activating it,” said Renaat Ver Eecke, CEO of GTreasury. “The combination of our cash forecasting, risk management, and compliance foundation with Ripple’s speed, global network, and digital asset solutions creates an opportunity for treasurers to manage liquidity, payments, and risk in the new digital economy.” A String of Strategic Acquisitions GTreasury’s platform is recognized for its industry-leading risk management, FX, and compliance capabilities, meeting the highest regulatory standards. The acquisition marks Ripple’s third major deal in 2025, following purchases of prime broker Hidden Road and stablecoin platform Rail. The spree shows Ripple’s financial strength and growing dominance in enterprise blockchain and digital asset infrastructure. The GTreasury deal is expected to close in the coming months, pending regulatory approval.

The company now ranks fifth among public crypto mining companies in terms of mining power. Bitdeer has officially moved ahead of Riot Platforms thanks to its new Sealminer equipment. The new batch of Sealminer rigs adds an extra five exa-hashes per second (EH/s) to the overall mining capacity of the company. Bitdeer earned 20.5% more BTC In September, Bitdeer earned 452 BTC. That’s a jump of 20.5% from 375 BTC coins, which were earned in August. The company’s total hash rate increased by 15.5% in September. The mining power jumped from 30.3 EH/s to 35 EH/s in one month. The addition of five exa-hashes helped the company earn more Bitcoin. Moreover, Bitdeer’s realized hashrate increased from 24.64 EH/s to 32.74 EH/s, increasing performance and effectiveness. Bitdeer is the biggest fifth mining company based on hashrate power. It trails MARA, CleanSpark, Cango, and IREN based on data from BitcoinMiningStock . Hash rate of public Bitcoin miners. Source: BitcoinMiningStock. The company stated that the boost in mining power is due to its in-house Sealminer rigs, in addition to energizing new mining sites located in Tydal, Norway, and Jigmeling, Bhutan. The company wants to reach a mining power of 40 EH/s by the end of October. After that, Bitdeer stated that it will retire older and less efficient third-party equipment to enhance profitability. Bitdeer designs new BTC mining rigs So far, Bitdeer has built 34.2 EH/s worth of Sealminer A2 rigs. Around 22.6 EH/s are already running, and another 5.5 EH/s are on the way. The company launched its new Sealminer A3 series last month and started mass production in October . Bitdeer will utilize the new equipment in its own facilities. In terms of technology, the crypto mining company has finished designing the SEAL04 chip and sent it for fabrication. During the early testing phase, the chip proved that it can consume less than 10 J/TH in energy use. This is still far from the company’s goal of a 5 J/TH target. Matt Kong, Chief Business Officer (CBO) at Bitdeer, said, “Over the coming quarters, we will continue expanding our SEALMINER fleet into our near-term global power capacity, putting us on track to become one of the largest vertically integrated miners in the world.” Last month, Bitdeer AI, the AI cloud arm of the crypto mining company, reached $8 million in annualized revenue. The company has 584 GPUs deployed with a utilization rate of 86%. It also aims to double its capacity and add 1,160 GPUs by the end of 2025. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Reports say he threatened steep tariffs — including a 100% tariff on Chinese imports — after Beijing tightened controls on rare earths and related technology exports. Traders moved fast. Prices fell. Volatility spiked. Crypto Markets React To Tariff Threats According to Reuters and market reports, Bitcoin and Ether both dropped as investors rushed to reduce risk. Based on reports, close to $20 billion in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated within a 24-hour window. Many smaller tokens plunged even more, driven by thin order books and forced selling. Stock markets fell too, and some firms accelerated shipments to beat possible tariff dates. The mood turned cautious almost overnight. JUST IN: President Trump declares the United States is in a TRADE WAR with China “We’re in one now!” “We have 100% tariffs.” “If we didn’t have tariffs, we would have no defense. They’ve used tariffs on us.” pic.twitter.com/o360DtdsaQ — Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) October 15, 2025 Crypto Seen As Risk Asset Reports have disclosed that the idea of crypto as a safe haven has taken a hit. Under the stress of rising geopolitical tension, digital assets have behaved more like stocks than gold. Gold itself rallied and reached fresh highs as traders sought traditional safe havens while crypto investors chased liquidity. Analysts say that when global risk rises quickly, holders of risky assets tend to sell first — and that has folded crypto into the wider “risk off” reaction. Supply Chains And Mining Costs Under Pressure China’s export controls on rare earth minerals matter to crypto beyond headlines. Rare earths and chipmaking are crucial for electronics and for mining rigs. Based on trade reporting, any prolonged curbs or tariffs could raise the cost of semiconductors and other parts used in mining hardware and data centers. Higher input prices would push some smaller miners to the sidelines, and could slow planned hardware upgrades that support networks. Policy Moves Could Shape Crypto’s Future According to policy briefings and financial commentary, the political fight may bring new rules. If trade measures harden, regulators in several countries could tighten oversight of cross-border flows and exchanges out of concern for national security and financial stability. At the same time, fragmentation of payments and finance between blocs could create both risks and openings for alternative payment rails built on blockchain. Capital flows may shift quickly as institutions reprice geopolitical risk and reallocate holdings.

The market remains tense, and sentiment is split between hopes of recovery and fears of another leg down. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Closes $197M Short, But The Game Might Not Be Over After one of the most volatile weeks of the year, BTC is showing signs of consolidation, but uncertainty dominates as traders assess whether this is the start of a stabilization phase or a temporary pause before another sell-off. Analysts note that price structure remains fragile, and momentum indicators suggest the market needs stronger demand inflows to sustain current levels. Meanwhile, onchain data points to notable whale activity. Several newly created wallets have been observed withdrawing large amounts of Bitcoin from major exchanges, signaling that some large investors may be moving assets to cold storage — a move often interpreted as a sign of accumulation or strategic repositioning. These flows highlight the ongoing tug-of-war between market fear and institutional interest. As the market seeks direction, traders are closely watching whale behavior for clues about whether this consolidation will turn into a rebound — or another wave of volatility. Whale Activity Signals Strategic Accumulation Data from Lookonchain shows renewed whale activity as Bitcoin consolidates near the $110K mark. A newly created wallet, bc1q0q, withdrew 1,000 BTC ($110.65 million) from Binance, while another wallet, bc1qxm, pulled 465 BTC ($51.47 million) from FalconX over the past five hours. These two withdrawals — totaling more than $160 million in Bitcoin — have caught the attention of analysts tracking institutional and large-scale investor flows. Historically, such movements of newly created wallets withdrawing significant sums from exchanges tend to indicate accumulation behavior rather than short-term speculation. When large players move funds off exchanges, it typically signals reduced selling intent and a preference for holding BTC in self-custody — a bullish long-term sign, even amid short-term market weakness. However, this doesn’t mean volatility is over. The market remains fragile after last week’s sharp drop, and many traders expect a period of sideways consolidation before any clear directional move. Bitcoin may continue to hover within the $108K–$115K range as it absorbs recent liquidations and rebuilds structure. Related Reading: Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Cross 1M BTC: Over 176K BTC Added In Q3 Bitcoin Bulls Defend $110K Support Amid Consolidation Bitcoin continues to hover around $111,300, showing resilience after last week’s sharp crash that briefly sent prices near $103,000. The chart reveals that BTC is currently consolidating just above the $110K support zone, a key area that has repeatedly acted as a short-term floor during past corrections. Price action shows limited momentum, with the 50-day moving average (blue line) sloping downward and acting as resistance near $115K, while the 200-day moving average (red line) sits around $107K, providing a broader structural base. This setup suggests that Bitcoin remains in a neutral-to-bearish short-term phase, as buyers and sellers continue to battle for control within a tightening range.

For now, the $117,500 level remains the key resistance to reclaim if BTC wants to confirm a recovery trend. A decisive breakout above this zone could trigger renewed momentum toward $120K–$122K. Conversely, a drop below $109K would likely extend the correction toward $106K. Market sentiment remains cautious but stable. Consolidation at these levels could allow BTC to rebuild support and reset indicators before attempting another move, making the current phase critical for determining the next major direction in price action.

While to the untrained eye these movements may seem like random volatility, professional traders recognize them as precision events — calculated liquidity grabs designed to test key support and resistance zones. In his latest analysis, market expert Egrag Crypto spotlighted a critical 30-minute XRP liquidity grab, offering insight into how traders can interpret and react to these short-term fluctuations. Liquidity Grabs in the XRP Market Liquidity grabs, also referred to as stop-hunts or liquidity sweeps, occur when market makers or large players deliberately push prices beyond visible support or resistance zones. The purpose is to flush out stop losses, trigger pending orders, and collect liquidity before driving the market in the intended direction. For XRP, which has been oscillating around narrow mid-$2 ranges, such short-term liquidity hunts have become more pronounced. These quick spikes often create long wicks on the candlestick chart — visible evidence of liquidity being absorbed and volatility recalibrating. Understanding this mechanism gives traders an edge in identifying fakeouts and high-probability entry zones. #XRP – Liquidity Grab (30 Mins Time): Use it if your are Trading these small ranges. pic.twitter.com/HhrZgdTPFn — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 16, 2025 Egrag Crypto’s 30-Minute XRP Chart Analysis In his recent post on X, Egrag Crypto presented a detailed 30-minute TradingView chart illustrating a well-defined liquidity grab. The chart highlighted a sudden dip below a local support band, immediately followed by a rapid recovery — a textbook example of liquidity absorption. According to Egrag, these movements can offer excellent opportunities for short-term traders who know how to navigate tight ranges. His analysis pointed out critical support zones between $2.12 and $2.18, where buy-side liquidity was collected, and a resistance ceiling near $2.45, which traders should monitor closely for potential rejection or breakout confirmation. The use of key moving averages (particularly the yellow and red lines visible on Egrag’s chart) further validates the intraday structure, signaling that XRP remains in a short-term consolidation phase while broader liquidity continues to build below current market levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trading Implications and Short-Term Strategy For traders operating on 30-minute timeframes, liquidity grabs can be both a trap and an opportunity. A smart approach involves waiting for the liquidity sweep to complete, confirming a reversal or continuation before entering trades. Egrag’s setup encourages traders to observe how XRP behaves after the wick forms — a sustained rebound signals accumulation, use tight stop losses slightly beyond the wick to minimize exposure, and target the opposite end of the range for short-term profits. Risk management remains crucial, especially since short timeframes amplify volatility. Egrag emphasizes that disciplined range trading with precise entries can yield consistent returns without overexposing capital. The Bigger Picture for XRP Holders Beyond the 30-minute charts, these liquidity grabs play a pivotal role in shaping XRP’s broader market structure. Each sweep redistributes positions, clears inefficiencies, and prepares the token for its next significant move. For investors and traders alike, monitoring such events offers valuable insight into market sentiment and institutional activity. As Egrag Crypto’s latest analysis makes clear, short-term volatility isn’t chaos — it’s data. Those who understand liquidity dynamics can navigate XRP’s current phase with greater precision and confidence.

Via an announcement on X, the company revealed that it is acquiring GTreasury, a global leader in treasury management solutions, for $1 billion. The announcement has drawn attention from the financial and crypto sectors as it positions Ripple to enter the multi-trillion-dollar corporate treasury market. The announcement described the acquisition as a combination of Ripple’s XRP-powered financial infrastructure with GTreasury’s four decades of experience in corporate cash and liquidity management. Together, the two companies aim to modernize how large enterprises manage their funds, creating faster and more efficient systems for moving capital across global networks. We’re proud to announce @Ripple is acquiring treasury management leader GTreasury: https://t.co/9EF3tWLKaF The fusion of Ripple’s enterprise crypto solutions with GTreasury’s 40+ years of expertise immediately opens the multi-trillion-dollar corporate treasury market. Learn how… — Ripple (@Ripple) October 16, 2025 Strategic Expansion into Institutional Finance GTreasury provides software and infrastructure for corporate treasurers to manage liquidity, risk, and cash positions. By bringing this company under its umbrella, Ripple is expanding beyond cross-border payments to target the heart of enterprise finance. Integrating Ripple’s blockchain-based infrastructure with GTreasury’s established systems could enable corporations to move and manage funds in real time , something conventional networks have struggled to achieve efficiently. Ripple’s blog post elaborated that the acquisition aims to make corporate treasury operations faster and more efficient. The company emphasized that the combination of both platforms would help Fortune 500 CFOs and treasurers unlock idle capital and transfer funds instantly. For large organizations managing billions in assets, that promise represents a substantial upgrade in how liquidity can be deployed. Positive Outlook for XRP and Global Reach The $1 billion acquisition also has potential significance for XRP, the digital asset used in Ripple’s payment and liquidity products. As Ripple integrates with GTreasury’s network of corporate clients, XRP could see greater utility in facilitating instant settlements and optimizing treasury flows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Widespread corporate adoption of Ripple’s infrastructure would naturally extend the token’s real-world use cases , reinforcing its position as a functional asset rather than a speculative one. This move also signals Ripple’s intent to position itself as a major player in global finance, not just within the crypto ecosystem. By aligning with a well-established treasury management platform, Ripple gains credibility among institutional clients that may have previously hesitated to engage with XRP and Ripple’s XRP-powered solutions . If successfully integrated, this acquisition could redefine how multinational corporations manage liquidity and capital allocation. The merger could accelerate corporate acceptance of XRP as a tool for liquidity and capital efficiency, expanding its role in global finance.

The recovery follows weeks of consolidation and comes as sentiment across the entire market improves. Traders point out that Solana’s technical structure is still constructive, while fresh institutional interest, which recently saw VanEck file for a Solana Staking ETF, is pumping up expectations for a sustained rally. Analysts stated that if the momentum continues, Solana could reach the upper resistance band near the $250 mark again in the upcoming sessions. The larger rebound has spurred investors to re-enter the market in anticipation of what analysts expect to be a strong fourth quarter. Alongside Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting early attention, with projections that it could have 300x returns before Solana’s $250 target in Q4. Solana’s Technical Structure Points Toward $250 Technical indicators show Solana is approaching a breakout phase after weeks of consolidation. The daily chart shows a symmetrical triangle, which includes a descending resistance from the September $260 peak and an ascending support from the March trendline. Source: TradingView The recovery from $180 played an important role in lining up with the 200-day EMA near $187 and causing buying strength to be confirmed. Price has since crossed the 100-day EMA ($200) but is still just below resistance levels of $210 – $212, which coincides with the 20 and 50-day EMAs. Analysts say a daily close above $212 could pave the way for $230, and eventually, to retest the $250 – $260 zone. Institutional Flows and ETF Momentum Support the Upside Institutional activity is still feeding Solana’s bullish narrative. According to Coinglass, Solana saw $5.49 million in net inflows on October 15th, coinciding with its technical rebound. These flows frequently signify accumulation phases rather than the distribution, indicating bigger players are in position for future gains. VanEck’s proposal for a Solana Staking ETF, with a 0.30% management fee, has added confidence. If approved, it would be the first ETF to provide institutional-grade access to Solana’s staking yields, which could open up new capital from traditional finance. The anticipation of this approval has put Solana on the list of most closely watched altcoins this month. Corporate Accumulation Adds Strength to the Trend Nasdaq-listed Solana Company (formerly Helius Medical Technologies) confirmed the accumulation of more than 2.2 million SOL tokens, with the combined holdings and cash reserves amounting to almost $530 million. Executives stated that the move was part of a long-term digital asset treasury approach aimed at maximizing shareholder value. Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera Capital, applauded the firm’s strategies, stating that they match other corporate treasury models that have been observed during cycles of adoption for Bitcoin. Executive Chairman Joseph Chee stated that institutional interest from Asia has been better than expected after the recent regional cryptocurrency conferences, strengthening Solana’s appeal as an investment asset in the balance sheet. Outlook: Buyers Position for the Next Leg of the Rally Solana is now trading within a key range of $180 support to $212 resistance. A confirmed breakout above $212 could extend gains towards $230 in the short-term, with the $250 target now very much back into play. Analysts maintain that as long as the token is above the 200-day EMA, the overall structure remains bullish. Market optimism appears to be spreading beyond large-cap assets. Analysts are tracking a surge of early investment activity in smaller, high-growth projects, led by MAGACOIN FINANCE. They predict the token could generate up to 300x returns before Solana hits its quarter-end target. Investors are reportedly rushing in early to position ahead of a broader rebound expected later this month. Experts cite utility-focused design and strong ROI potential as the key reasons driving its rapid adoption among retail and private investors. The rising enthusiasm for MAGACOIN FINANCE illustrates a broader trend in which early, utility-driven tokens are attracting liquidity during the market’s recovery phase. Analysts say this shift indicates growing confidence that Q4 could mark a decisive turnaround for altcoins. Solana and Broader Market Regain Momentum Solana’s steady rebound above $200 and mounting institutional engagement suggest its $250 target is within reach. Strong ETF momentum, corporate accumulation, and rising on-chain inflows are reinforcing confidence across the ecosystem. At the same time, investor attention is turning toward promising, high-ROI opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts believe could outperform before Solana’s rally peaks. Together, these developments reflect an improving risk environment and a crypto market preparing for renewed strength in the final quarter of 2025.

Lee stated that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in the coming period (flippening), likening this process to Wall Street's dominance of the dollar over gold in 1971: “Ethereum could overtake Bitcoin in the same way Wall Street overtook gold after 1971. When the dollar came off the gold standard, Wall Street created the financial products that would dominate this new era. By 2025, everything will be tokenized, and Ethereum will be the foundation of this new era.” Lee stated that he predicts the total value of the cryptocurrency ecosystem will reach $25 trillion by 2030, with most of that value held by Bitcoin. However, he also stated that Ethereum could become the new center of Wall Street innovation with the development of tokenization and smart contract-based financial products. Related News: Ethereum Bull Tom Lee Announces: “The Bubble Has Burst” Recalling that US President Richard Nixon’s removal of the country from the gold standard in 1971 ushered in a period in which the dollar became a “synthetic” currency, Lee stated that Wall Street turned this change into an advantage in those years: During that time, Wall Street launched 14 new financial products, from money market funds to mortgages. This doubled the dollar's share of global reserves in just a few years. Lee argued that a similar transformation will occur by 2025, with the tokenization of the dollar and other assets on the blockchain creating a major opportunity for Ethereum. “Bitcoin is digital gold,” he said. “But in the world of tokenized assets, Ethereum will take over the role of the dollar and financial products. Therefore, Ethereum could overtake Bitcoin just as Wall Street overtook gold.” Despite all these considerations, Lee stated that he is optimistic about Bitcoin and argued that the fair value of BTC in the long run could be between $1.5 million and $2.1 million. *This is not investment advice.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3195 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. In 2025, Pi Network is entering a crucial stage, despite market sentiment remaining cautious; on-chain activity and ecosystem growth continue to develop. Notably, Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.1585 on Oct 11, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. The Passkey Update introduced stronger wallet security through Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN authentication ahead of the long-awaited Mainnet launch. Meanwhile, the Pi Hackathon 2025 has reached its halfway point, with developers showcasing projects that could expand the Pi ecosystem. At the same time, Pi has drawn attention from a partnership with Sign Protocol, backed by Binance’s venture arm, fueling speculation of a potential Binance listing. In this article on Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2103 Price Change 24h -1.49% Market Cap $2.24B Circulating Supply 8.24B PI Trading Volume 24h $42.55M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2103 Price Prediction $ 0.20109 (-4.94%) Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 11.19% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.346655 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 26.14 Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi trades at $0.2103, reflecting a loss of 1.49% the last 24 hours after a recent low of $0.1585. The crypto market faced a broad market crash, and Pi remains near record lows. Resistance is seen between $0.23 and $0.25, while support is between $0.19 and $0.20. On October 16, 2025, Pi Network continues to experience volatile price movements, recovering slightly after a recent crash in October. Pi network is trading at $0.2104, reflecting a loss of 1.49% in the past 24 hours. This follows a 33% recovery from a recent all-time low of $0.1585 recorded just five days ago. Despite this slight rebounce, the broader crypto market remains bearish, with Pi trading well below its highs earlier this year, reflecting persistent investor caution. The PI network resistance is between $0.23 and $0.25, while support is at $0.19 and $0.20. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 24-hour chart shows Pi Network is trading at $0.2103, which is a slight gain from a recent low of $0.1585. This price movement reflects buyer activity attempting to stabilize the market following the broader crypto market crash. The overall momentum remains fragile as Pi still hovers near its lowest levels in recent months. Pi remains below the key $0.23–$0.25 resistance zone, signaling cautious sentiment among traders and subdued market confidence. The RSI is currently at 29.53, with the average line at 26.89, placing Pi in the oversold zone. This indicates persistent selling pressure, though a short-term rebound may occur if buying volume increases around current support. However, unless the RSI climbs above 40, any recovery is expected to be weak and short-lived. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD line stands at –0.0274, below the signal line at –0.0277, with the histogram showing a faint positive reading of 0.0001. This setup confirms that the bearish trend is still in control, although the narrowing gap between the MACD and signal lines suggests that the downward momentum may be weakening. Immediate resistance remains between $0.23 and $0.25, while support is found near $0.19–$0.20. A breakout above $0.23 could signal a mild recovery, but if Pi fails to sustain above $0.20, a retest of the $0.16–$0.18 range remains a strong possibility given the prevailing market weakness. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.2104, showing a minor decline from $0.2123 over the last four hours. The price is fluctuating in a narrow range. The RSI stands at 45.42, indicating neutral conditions and suggesting that neither buying nor selling pressure is significantly dominating the market at this moment. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD line is at 0.0001, which is slightly above the signal line at -0.0024, suggesting a subtle shift towards a weakening bearish momentum. The histogram shows a minor positive shift, though the trend remains weak. Immediate resistance is seen between $0.22 and $0.23, with support remaining near the $0.20 level. If Pi struggles to break through the resistance zone, it may continue to consolidate or potentially test lower levels.

Pi price is expected to remain in a consolidation phase between $0.20 and $0.24 over the short term. The token is still oversold, suggesting limited buying momentum but potential for a rebound if demand increases. However, bearish pressure persists. Unless Pi breaks above $0.25 resistance, sideways trading with a weak bias is likely, while a drop below $0.20 could trigger further bearish momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi Network (PI) is down due to a combination of bearish technical signals, ongoing delays in ecosystem upgrades, and low liquidity. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, but MACD confirms continuing bearish momentum, with the token struggling to hold the $0.20 support level. Market-wide caution, driven by the broader crypto market downturn and skepticism about Pi’s mainnet launch, has led to further selling pressure on Pi. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and continuous token unlocks, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: CoinMarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-16 19:02:56

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-hodler-net-position-change-plunges-34-in-two-weeks-heres-the-significance/,"The XRP market has entered a phase of heightened uncertainty as new on-chain data reveal a significant shift in long-term holder behavior. While XRP’s price has been fluctuating within a tight range, underlying wallet activity suggests a potentially deeper change in investor sentiment — one that could influence price stability and market direction in the coming weeks. Long-Term Holders Reduce Exposure According to recent on-chain data shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, XRP’s Hodler Net Position Change — a key metric that measures the flow of tokens into or out of long-term wallets — has plunged by 34% within just two weeks. This means that wallets historically known for holding XRP for extended periods have reduced their overall positions, signaling a notable wave of distribution rather than accumulation. This decline, recorded between October 2 and October 15, reflects a drop from approximately 163.68 million XRP to 107.84 million XRP held by long-term investors. The rapid contraction highlights a rare instance where some of XRP’s most patient holders appear to be trimming exposure, either to lock in profits or to reposition ahead of potential market volatility. BREAKING: #XRP HODLER NET POSITION CHANGE PLUNGES 34% IN TWO WEEKS. LONG-TERM HOLDERS ARE REDUCING EXPOSURE — NOT ACCUMULATING. pic.twitter.com/9Xadd5zUia — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 16, 2025 Why the Hodler Net Position Change Matters The Hodler Net Position Change is widely regarded as a critical indicator of long-term conviction. When the metric trends positive, it suggests that seasoned investors — often referred to as “diamond hands” — are adding to their positions, reinforcing market stability. Conversely, a negative reading indicates distribution or reduced confidence among long-term holders, which can heighten selling pressure if persistent. In XRP’s case, this steep two-week decline could either represent a healthy market rotation — where long-term holders distribute to new entrants — or signal cautious sentiment among investors amid broader market indecision. Historically, sustained drops in this metric have preceded short-term corrections before new accumulation phases begin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Could Mean for XRP’s Price Outlook While a 34% reduction in long-term holdings may raise alarms, the broader interpretation depends on who is selling and why. If large institutional or early-adopter wallets are behind the move, it may reflect strategic repositioning rather than panic selling . However, if data show widespread exits among smaller holders, it could point to weakening confidence in the short term. Analysts will be watching closely to see whether this trend stabilizes or accelerates. Sustained negative readings in the coming weeks could exert downward pressure on XRP’s price, while a rebound in long-term accumulation could quickly restore bullish momentum. Final Thoughts STEPH IS CRYPTO’s analysis provides a timely reminder that on-chain behavior often precedes price action. With XRP’s Hodler Net Position Change plunging sharply, investors are now monitoring whether this is a brief redistribution event or an early sign of a broader shift in sentiment. Either way, the data underscore the importance of tracking long-term holder trends as XRP navigates its next market phase.

The leading cryptocurrency is holding the same higher low structure from which the October 2024 reversal emerged, sparking renewed optimism among traders. Back then, Bitcoin filled its CME gap at $68,785 before launching a two-month run to $108,000. Now, analysts at RektCapital note that a bullish divergence is forming on the daily timeframe, hinting that a similar breakout could propel Bitcoin toward $130,000 before Q4 ends. #BTC Bitcoin continues to hold the very same Higher Low (purple) from which the previous reversal originated from $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/7Tu6UMbDIV — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) October 16, 2025 Bitcoin Market Sentiment Hits 2017 Lows Crypto traders who have been around since late 2017 say morale is at one of its lowest points in years. Sentiment in major chat rooms is showing exhaustion and doubt, with many convinced the cycle has ended. Even seasoned traders admit to underperforming this year compared to 2020–2021. Coupled with last Friday’s brutal wipeout, the market feels like a ghost town. These factors have fueled speculation that Bitcoin topped out after hitting $126,000 ten days ago. However, both technical patterns and macroeconomic indicators suggest otherwise. Bitcoin’s funding rate on Binance flipped negative this week, a rare occurrence that has historically marked local bottoms and preceded major rallies. Source: CryptoQuant On-chain data also shows large spot exchange outflows, indicating quiet accumulation amid widespread fear. Gold Indicator Shows Bitcoin Is About to Steal the Spotlight Meanwhile, gold has outperformed Bitcoin since March, rising 28.12% compared to Bitcoin’s 4.42% decline. Historically, Bitcoin tends to take the baton from gold once the metal’s rally becomes overextended. With gold’s RSI hitting an unprecedented 92 and retail investors queuing for physical purchases, the yellow metal may be approaching exhaustion. The last three instances when gold led, August 2020, September 2024, and early April 2025, were followed by massive Bitcoin rallies. Source: TradingView In 2020, Bitcoin surged from $9,500 to over $45,000 within two months after gold peaked. If this pattern holds, the current environment could be setting up for another post-gold rotation, potentially propelling Bitcoin toward the $130,000 zone by year-end. Bitcoin’s monthly Bollinger Bands continue to expand to the most extreme levels ever recorded. Source: TradingView Every historical expansion of this magnitude has led to higher prices, pointing more to a growing volatility that often precedes upside moves. Additionally, this marks only the third time in six years that Bitcoin has traded negatively halfway through October. On all six previous occasions, BTC closed the month green by October 31. On the Macro front, CME data indicates a 96.7% probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut later this month, marking the Fed’s first easing move in over a year. Lower borrowing costs typically lead to greater liquidity and stronger risk-on appetite, a scenario that historically benefits Bitcoin. $132K or Sub-$110K? Expert Maps Bitcoin’s Two Possible Paths Farzam Ehsani, co-founder and CEO of VALR, told Cryptonews that while the Fed’s dovish stance and rising liquidity are constructive for digital assets, renewed U.S.–China trade frictions and prolonged U.S. government shutdown risks could complicate near-term sentiment. JUST IN: China says it plans to work with the United States to find a solution on trade. pic.twitter.com/0sWWayQCO5 — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 16, 2025 He pointed to the growing alignment between gold and Bitcoin, noting that “investors increasingly view both Bitcoin and Gold as hard assets hedging against fiscal risks, sovereign debt concerns, and policy uncertainty.” Ehsani concludes that Bitcoin stands at a key crossroads. “If liquidity tailwinds materialize and institutional accumulation continues, BTC could strengthen toward $132,000 by year-end.” However, should macro risks resurface or trade tensions escalate, a move below $110,000 remains possible as markets recalibrate.

This bold move coincides with the recent stabilization of XRP's price, sparking curiosity among crypto enthusiasts. The article delves into the potential impact of Ripple's expansion and explores which coins might be on the brink of growth. Discover more in the detailed tech analysis. XRP Showing Resilience with Room to Rise Source: tradingview XRP is in a price range between $1.19 and $3.46, catching attention despite recent dips. Over the last month, it has slipped about 21%, but its six-month performance is nearly 15% up, hinting at resilience. The coin is currently just below its 10-day simple moving average, showing potential for upward movement. To see significant gains, XRP must clear a resistance level of $4.39, a bit above 25% more than the highest in its current range. If it can push further, reaching $6.67 is on the cards, a promising leap over 90% higher. With room to grow and strong fundamentals, XRP could bounce back if it gains momentum. Conclusion XRP has maintained its price as Ripple announces a significant expansion. This move into corporate finance marks a notable step for the company. Ripple's decision to invest $1 billion suggests confidence in the future of XRP. The market seems to respond positively so far. XRP's stability contrasts with fluctuations in other cryptocurrencies. This stability might attract more institutional investors. Ripple's ambitious plans could play a key role in XRP's market position. The upcoming developments will be crucial to monitor.

Notable coins like FET, OP, and INJ stand out, capturing attention with their resilience and potential for growth. This article uncovers the stable nature of these assets amidst a stagnant Bitcoin market and explores their readiness for a possible upward trend. Delve in to discover promising contenders in the crypto space. FET Cryptocurrency Struggles with Price Dip But Holds Potential Source: tradingview The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) coin is having a tough time. It's now priced between $0.13 and $0.61 after a steep fall of nearly 50% last week. Over six months, it has dropped by around 44%. Despite this slump, there's hope. The nearest hurdle to clear is at $0.85. If FET breaks through, it could climb to $1.34, which would be an impressive jump of over double its current high range. The low RSI value of 35.07 suggests it's not overbought, hinting at further potential. FET is down, but not out. Investors eyeing recovery could see a significant rebound. Optimism Seeks Stability Amid Price Woes Source: tradingview Optimism's price has been moving between $0.1665 and $0.7891 recently. The coin is struggling after a rough week, with the price dropping almost 39% and over 40% in a month. There's some hope, though. If it pushes through the nearest resistance level of just over $1.08, Optimism could climb towards the next target at about $1.71. That could mean a potential gain of over 100% from its lowest point. However, with an RSI of around 36, the crypto is still in the oversold zone, showing it might need some time before making significant leaps. Injective (INJ) Shows Promise Amidst Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Injective (INJ) is currently navigating a price range of about $7 to $13. Despite recent drops, with the price down roughly 35% over the past month, there's potential for growth. The nearest key level it could challenge is around $16. If it manages to break through this resistance, optimistic traders believe it might aim for the $21 mark, representing a significant increase from its current levels. Supporting its current situation, short-term signals show some stabilization. The ten-day moving average is just under $10, while the 100-day is slightly higher, hinting at a base forming. Additionally, the six-month performance still shows a modest gain of over 11%. Conclusion FET, OP, and INJ have shown notable stability and growth. These mid-cap cryptocurrencies outperformed in a flat market. Their resilience is a promising signal of their potential. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This price point has proven to be a significant resistance level in the short term. Amid these fluctuations, Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to declare, “Gold is eating Bitcoin’s lunch.” Schiff Calls For HODLers To Sell ‘Fool’s Gold In his post, Schiff highlighted that Bitcoin has experienced a 32% decline when priced in gold since its peak in August, predicting a “brutal” bear market ahead. Schiff urged HODLers to reconsider their investments, suggesting they sell their “fool’s gold” and invest in the tangible asset of gold instead, or risk financial ruin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Coming To An End: Cycle Peak Countdown Signals 99.3% Completion In response to Schiff’s assertions, Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, offered a sarcastic retort. He noted, “ We should have listened to him, two months ago, out of the 16 years in bitcoin’s existence. About 1% of the time.” Zhao reminded followers that Bitcoin has surged from a mere $0.004 to approximately $110,000 USD over the years, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential despite current challenges. Expert Predicts Positive October For Bitcoin Schiff has continued to voice his skepticism about Bitcoin’s viability as a substitute for the US dollar or as “digital gold.” He argues that many HODLers are in denial about the realities of the market, a mindset he believes will lead to significant losses. Related Reading: Is Sony The Next Crypto Bank? Tech Giant Applies For A National Charter In The US Contrasting Schiff’s bearish outlook, experts like Timothy Peterson have offered a more optimistic perspective. Peterson’s updated AI forecast for Bitcoin, suggests there is still a 75% probability that October could be a positive month for Bitcoin, with the potential for prices to close above $114,000. As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at approximately $108,280, having dipped toward $107,500 earlier on Thursday. It currently stands 13% below all-time high levels.

Despite short-term losses, several technical patterns are pointing to a potential move higher. Market participants are also watching liquidity zones and ETF filings, which may influence upcoming price action. Analysts Watch for $260 Revisit According to Ali Martinez, Solana may be positioning for a return to the $260 area. The chart shows that the price remains within a broader upward channel. Although SOL has declined by 5% in the last 24 hours and over 14% in the past week, it is still respecting the current trend. At press time, it traded at around $193. Solana $SOL could be looking to retest $260! pic.twitter.com/UriEqCNiX4 — Ali (@ali_charts) October 16, 2025 Notably, the chart outlines $250 to $260 as a key resistance zone. If the price rises into this range but fails to hold, a retracement could take it back toward the $165 to $170 area. This level has acted as both support and resistance in previous moves and is being tracked by traders as a possible downside target. Moreover, data shared by Bitcoinsensus shows a repeated pattern on Solana’s daily chart. In past moves, 33% corrections were followed by strong rallies. The first recovery gained 93% and the second reached 100% . Each time, the price reversed near the lower boundary of a rising channel. Source: Bitcoinsensus/X Solana has recently seen another 33% drop and has bounced from the same trendline. If the pattern continues, the current move could reach into the $280 to $300 range. The channel structure remains intact, with higher lows supporting the idea that buyers are still active. Liquidity Zones Between $190 and $210 A heatmap posted by CW shows that high-leverage long positions were recently liquidated near the $200 level. The area around $190 is now showing strong buying interest, which is acting as short-term support. Above current levels, the chart reveals low resistance up to $210. With fewer resting sell orders in this range, the price could rise quickly if there is renewed demand. According to the analyst, “ there is no resistance for short positions up to $210 ,” making it a key zone to watch in the near term. Source: CW/X Furthermore, 21Shares has submitted Form 8-A(12B) to the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing is required to complete the process for listing a Solana-based exchange-traded fund. The document was filed after markets closed. Meanwhile, this registration allows for the launch of a spot Solana ETF, which would provide regulated access to SOL for a broader group of investors. The development is seen as part of ongoing efforts to bring digital assets into traditional financial products.

The study has registered significant growth in Europe’s “remarkably resilient” crypto assets market over the past two years, marked by comprehensive regulations taking hold across the region. Russia ranks first among European crypto markets Cryptocurrency adoption in Europe “highlights a patchwork of convergence and transformation,” according to Chainalysis, which published its latest report on the matter on Thursday. During the period covered by the research, the region showed “remarkable growth and resilience,” the U.S.-based blockchain analytics firm points out. Transaction volumes back the claim, peaking at $234 million in December 2024, after declining earlier that year. The “robust recovery” spilled into 2025, underlining the maturity of the market. The leading 10 markets span all corners of the continent, the authors noted, “demonstrating broad-based adoption across the region.” Against this backdrop, Great Britain ceded the top spot to the Russian Federation, Chainalysis reveals and details further: “Between July 2024 and June 2025, Russia emerged as the dominant crypto market with $376.3 billion received, substantially ahead of the United Kingdom ($273.2 billion). This gap between Russia and the U.K. — traditionally the region’s leading markets — is notably larger than in previous years.” At the same time, the difference between the U.K. and other major markets shrank. The previously smaller Germany, Ukraine, and France are seeing similar levels of crypto activity, with volumes reaching $219.4 billion, $206.3 billion, and $180.1 billion, respectively. Top countries within the wider European region by total value received. Source: Chainalysis. Chainalysis registers ‘strong network effects’ The reasons for this growth, exceeding 50%, are unique in each case. Germany, for example, is becoming a preferred destination for crypto platforms due to the smooth implementation of EU’s new rules for the industry. Ukraine and Poland , on the other hand, are tapping into remittance flows and grassroots adoption. There is a common denominator, however. Chainalysis elaborates: “Notably, the region exhibits an unexpected positive correlation between transaction volume and growth rates, challenging the conventional wisdom that larger markets grow more slowly.” “This pattern suggests powerful network effects in crypto adoption: as markets expand, they become increasingly attractive to new participants, creating a self-reinforcing growth cycle,” its analysts believe. Crypto adoption in Europe: growth vs. market size. Source: Chainalysis. U.K. and Russia leaning towards DeFi This year, the American crypto forensics company has implemented a different classification of European crypto markets, saying it reflects better current activity and geopolitical realities. It divides European nations into three groups – the European Economic Area, the Rest of Europe, Russia, and the U.K. The latter two have been analyzed separately to emphasize their significantly larger volumes of crypto activity. With 32% growth, the United Kingdom remains a strong market, despite losing the lead to Russia , but a shift in trading activity from major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) towards stablecoins and altcoins suggests the British market is maturing. Britain’s crypto ecosystem draws its strength mainly from significant institutional engagement, Chainalysis remarks. But it also notes that while institutional players prefer centralized venues, retail traders increasingly favor DeFi (decentralized finance) platforms, indicating that the U.K. market is evolving, rather than contracting. The report underscores Russia’s expansion into Defi as well, pointing out that the country’s remarkable crypto volumes result from two key trends – surging institutional transfers, which grew 86%, and accelerating DeFi adoption, which saw an eight-fold increase in early 2025. Chainalysis explains: “This rapid DeFi expansion, coupled with the increase in large-value transfers, indicates growing adoption of crypto for financial services.” It also emphasizes that the trend is exemplified by the sanctioned Russian ruble stablecoin A7A5 , used in cross-border payments by both institutions and businesses. The document further highlights growing DeFi activity in the rest of Europe, the influence of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation that’s currently being implemented by EU member-states, as well as the rise of euro stablecoins at the expense of U.S. dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. “The European crypto landscape of 2024-25 reflects a market in sophisticated transition, shaped by regulatory frameworks like MiCA, evolving institutional engagement, and growing DeFi … European crypto adoption remains dynamic and resilient,” Chainalysis concludes.

Former poster child for meme-coin greatness Shiba Inu (SHIB) still retains nostalgic value among traders who witnessed its storied surge, but in 2025 the attention is focused on projects with practical utility and sustainable ecosystems, and that’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is beginning to take center stage. Now in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 and already sold out by more than 65%, MUTM has already attracted $17.4 million in investment and is showing increased signs of investor confidence. Its dual-lending model and canonical DeFi infrastructure have many commentators hailing it the crypto to buy now before the next big market rally hits, with some going so far as to call it the 100x winner of the next bull cycle. Shiba Inu Whales Hint At Potential Breakout Shiba Inu (SHIB) is once again rocking the crypto space with the surge in whales. In the last 24 hours alone, more than 408 billion SHIB coins have left exchanges, an enormous bullish signal that indicates large investors are relocating assets to cold storage. The move is an indication of increased confidence among long-term investors because lowered exchange availability historically precedes sharp upward momentum. As sell pressure slows and momentum rises, SHIB may be laying the groundwork for its next significant breakout reminiscent of earlier rallies that made overnight millionaires. But as the hype comes back to the Shiba Inu space, investors now also look at expanding their options with emergent DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in view of developing the next bull cycle’s diversified approach. Mutuum Finance Outshines in Q4 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining significant traction throughout the entire DeFi market, setting itself among the best cryptos to invest in this year and the top crypto to buy now. The presale of the project in 2025 has been incredibly impressive with over 17,200 investors putting in more than $17.4 million thus far. In Phase 6, the presale is already 65% sold out and this is unequivocally indicative of burgeoning investors’ confidence and speeding market traction. Central to Mutuum Finance’s performance is its in-real-time risk management platform with dynamic Liquidation Terms and an intelligent Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism. These continually respond to market developments such that the platform hedges volatility and remains solid even under stormy conditions. This intelligent automation makes Mutuum Finance one of the best cryptos to invest in for investors that value both performance and security in decentralized finance. In Q4 of 2025, Mutuum Finance will launch its highly anticipated lending and borrowing protocol on the Sepolia Testnet. The platform’s Version 1 (V1) of the protocol is going to contain the basic DeFi elements like mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot all designed to provide maximum scalability, user-friendliness, and efficacy. From the first day onwards, ETH and USDT would be borrowable, lendable, and collateralizable with the capability to facilitate fast, secure, and multi-asset DeFi transactions. Mutuum Finance Leaderboard Spawns Competitive Mindset Mutuum Finance is taking investor engagement to the next level with its interactive leaderboard system, fueling enthusiasm across the growing DeFi community. In the last 24 hours, the top five investors have purchased $8,860, $8,339, $1,187, $949, and $408 worth of MUTM tokens, highlighting the surging demand and competitive spirit driving the presale. It all centers on the free-spurring reward: the #1 buyer at the end of the day receives the $500 MUTM bonus. Participation requires investors to do just one transaction during the 24-hour period of the day, providing everyone with an equal chance at the top position. Mutuum Finance has already garnered $17.4 million in funds contributed by more than 17,200 investors during Phase 6, which is currently 65% sold out. Daily leaderboard action with leading buys of $8,860 and $8,339 indicates accelerating momentum and community participation. With its lending/borrowing protocol set to launch soon, MUTM juxtaposes innovation with scalability along with practical real-world utility and finds itself among the better cryptos to invest in today. Secure your tokens now and position yourself for the next bull cycle.

The Dutch Vehicle Authority (RDW) said Thursday it’s revising its approval rules for all Tesla vehicles sold across the EU. The reason is that too many people have been getting trapped inside their cars after crashes, especially when the battery dies. First responders have also struggled to get in. According to Bloomberg, these issues triggered the review after it uncovered that Tesla’s flush door handles fail during power loss, locking people inside, including in situations where cars caught fire. “Doors must always be operable, from the inside by occupants and from the outside by emergency responders, even in the event of a power failure,” said an RDW spokesperson in an emailed statement. The agency added that where current rules are too old to handle these newer designs, updates are now underway, with Committees inside the European regulatory structure reviewing every angle. NHTSA opens probe into Model Y handles as China proposes mechanical overrides Meanwhile, just days later, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation into the door handles on Tesla’s best-selling vehicle, the Model Y. This probe is targeting whether the design fails in emergencies and violates federal safety laws. Franz von Holzhausen, who has led Tesla’s design for years, told Bloomberg that the company is “working on making its door handles more intuitive to use.” He didn’t explain how or when, but that comment came right after the NHTSA probe went public. Meanwhile, China’s safety regulators have gone further. They’re pushing for a national rule that every passenger car must include mechanical door releases that work both inside and outside the car. The rule directly targets the flush handle design made famous by Tesla and copied by local automakers like Xiaomi. The Dutch RDW spokesperson said that resolving power failure access is now “a key priority for both Euro NCAP and UNECE,” naming the continent’s crash test body and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Those two organizations are leading the push to make sure every new vehicle sold in the region meets a higher standard of emergency access — regardless of how futuristic the design looks. Tesla fights $56B Musk pay case in Delaware’s top court While regulators dig into doors, Tesla is back in court again, this time appealing to Delaware’s top judges to reinstate Elon Musk’s $56 billion compensation plan that was thrown out earlier this year. The case has dragged on for nearly two years. Earlier today, Tesla’s lawyer Jeffrey Wall argued the company’s shareholders had “all the facts” when they approved the plan back in 2018 and called it “the most informed stockholder vote in Delaware history.” But Jeffrey did later admit that his argument goes against a January 2024 ruling from Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who voided the entire payout, saying that Tesla’s board was way too close to Elon and that investors were misled. Elon didn’t show up in court, but he still has options. Even if the $56 billion plan doesn’t come back, Tesla already put a $25 billion backup package in place earlier this year. And it doesn’t stop there. The board is now backing an even larger $1 trillion incentive package. The deal would reward Elon only if Tesla hits extreme long-term market goals. Critics are calling it reckless. Supporters argue it’s needed to keep Elon focused on Tesla’s push into AI, energy, and robotics. But all this is happening while people can’t even open the doors.

The blunder was swiftly corrected as Paxos burned the excess tokens and reissued the correct amount of 300 million PYUSD, but not before the crypto community noticed the jaw-dropping figure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Closes $197M Short, But The Game Might Not Be Over To put the scale of the mistake into perspective, 300 trillion PYUSD would have exceeded the entire US money supply (M2) — currently around $21 trillion — by nearly 14 times. In global terms, it would represent almost three times the total estimated global M2, roughly $100 trillion. In other words, for a brief moment, Paxos had “created” enough digital dollars to buy nearly every publicly traded company in the world. The situation sparked a wave of disbelief and humor across social media, with traders and analysts mocking what could have been the largest minting error in crypto history. While Paxos acted quickly to reverse the error and confirmed that no funds were affected, the event has reignited discussions about smart contract precision, stablecoin risk management, and the potential consequences of such errors in large-scale financial systems. Paxos Responds to Minting Error, Sparks Debate on Stablecoin Oversight On Wednesday afternoon, Paxos addressed the situation directly on X, confirming that the minting of 300 trillion PYUSD was the result of an internal mistake during a routine transfer. The company stated: “At 3:12 PM EST, Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer. Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD. This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause.” The acknowledgment calmed immediate fears of a security breach or loss of funds, but the incident quickly became the subject of widespread jokes and criticism across the crypto community. Traders and developers mocked the idea that a few misplaced zeros could momentarily inflate global liquidity by trillions of dollars — a stark reminder of how even the most regulated issuers can make human or technical errors. While the issue was resolved within minutes, it reignited debate over stablecoin minting procedures and the need for real-time transparency and safeguards. Some industry observers argued that such incidents underscore why stablecoin issuance should face stricter regulatory standards, especially when tied to large institutions like PayPal. Others countered that blockchain’s transparency worked as intended — the mistake was instantly visible, verifiable, and corrected without harm. Ultimately, the event highlights a deeper tension within the stablecoin sector: how to balance innovation and automation with the level of oversight and accountability expected from entities that effectively issue digital representations of real-world money. Related Reading: Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Cross 1M BTC: Over 176K BTC Added In Q3 Stablecoin Dominance Shows Growing Market Caution The chart shows that stablecoin market dominance has climbed back to 8.49%, signaling a notable shift toward risk aversion following the sharp market correction last Friday. Historically, rising stablecoin dominance reflects traders rotating capital into safety — holding stablecoins like USDT, USDC, or DAI rather than volatile assets like Bitcoin or altcoins. After dipping below 7.5% in late September, dominance rebounded sharply during last week’s crash, even briefly spiking near 9.5%, the highest level since early June. This surge aligns with the massive minting activity reported by Tether and Circle, which together issued over $4.5 billion in new stablecoins after the sell-off. The move suggests that large players and institutions are preparing liquidity reserves for potential market re-entry or risk management amid ongoing uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Handles $14B OI Drop As Spot Volume Surged To $44B: Controlled Reset? If dominance continues to consolidate around 8–9%, it may indicate that investors are still hesitant to redeploy capital into crypto assets, waiting for confirmation of a market bottom. Conversely, a sustained decline below 8% could mark renewed confidence and inflows into Bitcoin and altcoins.

As the sector evolves, several major financial institutions are changing their perspective towards cryptocurrencies and are currently adopting these assets for cross-border payments and settlements. Banks Shift To New Standard, With Cardano At The Forefront With its robust network activity and scalability , Cardano (ADA) is gaining significant attention and traction in the financial landscape. A recent development that has triggered a frenzy in the Cardano reveals that the blockchain is rapidly emerging as a frontrunner in the evolution of global payments. This bold outlook is becoming a reality thanks to its full compliance with the ISO 20022 messaging protocol, a notable standard set to reshape the future of international banking. The optimistic development was shared by Mintern, the Chief Meme Officer (CMO) at Minswap, on the X platform. In the X post, Mintern has declared that Cardano is ready for the global financial reset. Currently, financial institutions worldwide are transitioning toward more data-rich and interoperable platforms, and the blockchain is well-positioned to connect decentralized networks and traditional finance . According to the report from Mintern, every international bank transfer is expected to primarily follow the ISO 20022 standard. Meanwhile, Cardano already meets this requirement, signaling its growing function as a fundamental layer in the upcoming generation of financial communication and cross-border payments. This new framework, aimed at enhancing banking operations and transactions, is set to go live on November 22, 2025. Mintern highlighted that the move provides Cardano a massive head start in connecting with banks, institutions, and global financial systems. Such a development is fueling speculation on whether the Cardano blockchain might become the bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Investors’ Activity On The Blockchain Is Growing As Cardano’s role in global finance expands, activity on the leading blockchain is rapidly increasing . Mintern has reported bullish action among major investors, as they persistently accumulate ADA in large quantities. Large investors, also known as whales, have gone on a buying spree, acquiring over 140 million ADA in just 3 days. This massive accumulation is observed among wallet addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA. Following the buying spree, the cumulative coins held by these key investors have moved from about 13.03 billion ADA to 13.20 billion ADA. Such purchasing pressure from whales underscores the rising conviction in the network and ADA’s long-term potential. At the time of writing, the price of ADA was trading at $0.67, showcasing bearish action. However, Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst and trader, has predicted an impending rally to the $1 price mark after identifying a massive triangle pattern. Should the altcoin break above the $0.90 level, Martinez is confident that it could rise to the next target of $1.88.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Ali Martinez|Cardano news|Cardano Price|ISO 20022 Messaging Protocol|Minswap|Mintern,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 20:00:59

The ongoing market decline is being primarily driven by Binance-led selling pressure, said CryptoQuant. The company’s analysts, however, believe this represents a short-term correction rather than the end of the broader bull cycle. Bears Dominate in Short-Term Three crucial indicators – the Coinbase Premium, Funding Rate, and Taker Buy/Sell Ratio – collectively highlight this market behavior. The US buying activity appears to be strong, as evidenced by the Coinbase Premium, which remains positive. Despite this, Bitcoin’s price continues to falter, which means that selling on Binance is overpowering US-based demand. Meanwhile, Binance’s Funding Rate has stayed negative for four straight days, even as most other exchanges record positive rates, revealing that futures traders on the platform are betting on short-term downside moves. In addition to this, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has dropped to its lowest level in over a year, as aggression among sellers increased, implying that market order flows are heavily skewed toward liquidation. While these factors depict Binance’s outsized influence on near-term price action, CryptoQuant argued that the correction appears cyclical rather than structural. Bitcoin’s on-chain fundamentals, such as network activity and long-term holder accumulation, remain strong, and the overall market structure continues to support a bullish outlook. As such, investors may see a surge in volatility in the short-term as the market digests these developments, but the broader uptrend remains unbroken. Is ‘Uptober’ Still Alive? Bitcoin may, in fact, soon regain momentum as October progresses. CryptoQuant data points to a recurring seasonal trend in which BTC often delivers its strongest performance during the latter half of the month. Since 2020, a $100 position in Bitcoin at the start of October has typically grown to around $120-$125 by month’s end. This pattern has been fairly consistent. The explanation lies in the fact that during the second half of October, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have historically declined by 0.5-1% as investors withdraw BTC into self-custody or long-term storage. This contraction in sellable supply tightens market liquidity, which makes prices more sensitive to renewed buying pressure. Early in the month, price action is usually shaped by short-term traders, but as the month unfolds, long-term holders resume accumulation, which boosts positive sentiment and sparks the so-called “Uptober” effect. At the same time, stablecoin issuance tends to rise, which means that new capital is flowing into the crypto ecosystem and increasing market demand. These factors together create favorable conditions for late-month rallies.

After weeks of uncertainty and panic triggered by the recent Binance shake-up, one market analyst believes a powerful shift is quietly forming. Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders has sounded the alarm , declaring that “the stats don’t lie” and that an XRP breakout nobody is ready for may be imminent. The Calm Before the Storm While the broader market remains cautious, XRP is beginning to show technical and psychological signals of strength. In a video shared on X, Levi Rietveld expressed his confidence in XRP’s potential breakout. His confidence is rooted in data. Following the Binance situation — which triggered a wave of liquidations and short-term sell-offs — the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has fallen to 37, signaling a market dominated by fear. Historically, such low readings often mark the beginning of accumulation zones — where smart money quietly positions itself before the next uptrend. Levi believes this setup could mirror previous market reversals, noting that “markets are fearful” but that this fear is itself a bullish indicator. In his view, XRP’s current structure presents a rare entry opportunity before broader sentiment flips. When Fear Becomes Opportunity For Levi, market psychology plays a critical role in timing. He shared his personal trading insight: “In my crypto journey, I’ve learnt to be bullish when a lot of people are bearish. You start looking for entry when everyone else is selling.” Across social media, the tone among retail traders has been one of panic and exhaustion. Yet, Levi argues that fear may be peaking — and that investor sentiment is beginning to shift: “People are realizing maybe it’s not all over, maybe we’re overreacting to the situation, maybe it’s an opportunity.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historically, moments like these have marked the turning points that spark new waves of accumulation. As traders reassess the charts, XRP could experience a rapid resurgence in volume and momentum if confidence continues to return. Retail Re-Entry and Institutional Catalysts Levi calls the current setup “ultra bullish for retail re-entry,” stressing that low participation among everyday traders combined with improving macro sentiment could trigger a massive upside move. He added, “This may be your last chance to get in.” The potential approval of spot XRP ETFs could also serve as a major catalyst. With institutional demand rising and global adoption accelerating, the groundwork is being laid for a fresh bullish phase. Crypto adoption remains in its early stages, and XRP’s utility-driven model positions it strongly in this evolving landscape. “Don’t Listen to the Fearful; Be Greedy” Levi concluded with a timeless reminder: “Crypto adoption is still very early… Don’t listen to the fearful; be greedy.” That contrarian wisdom — to act decisively when others hesitate — has defined every major breakout in crypto history. Whether or not this is the XRP breakout nobody is ready for, the market conditions, sentiment trends, and technical setup all point toward a pivotal moment. If fear subsides and momentum returns, XRP could soon shift from doubt to dominance — and those waiting for confirmation might once again be too late.

Also referred to as “tokenized gold,” these assets combine the stability of gold with the flexibility of blockchain technology. As the price of gold continues to hit new all-time highs, the demand for gold-backed tokens has increased. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain recently posted on X that two crypto whales bought more than $30 million worth of Tether Gold (XAUt) over the past week. Whales are buying $XAUT (Tether Gold)! casualpig.eth bought 4,463 $XAUT ($18.7M) over the past week. Whale 0xdfcA bought 2,879 $XAUT ($12.1M) today. https://t.co/4ATUYIokm2 https://t.co/Z1RlArgtxL pic.twitter.com/jejcyVUrOk — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 15, 2025 Alex Tapscott, CEO of CMCC Global Capital Markets, told Cryptonews that as gold continues to break $4,000, tokenized gold volumes will likely skyrocket. “The total volume of tokenized gold is about $3 billion—up from less than $500 million at the beginning of this year—and daily volumes are over $600 million,” Tapscott said. He added that gold-backed toke ns have become the fastest-growing category of tokenized assets to date. This is impressive, as Galaxy Digital predicts tokenized assets will hit $1.9 trillion over the next five years. What Are Gold-Backed Crypto Tokens? Alex Melikhov, co-founder of digital asset management firm BrettonWoods, told Cryptonews that gold-backed cryptocurrencies are digital tokens whose value is directly tied to physical gold held in reserve. “Each token represents ownership of a fixed amount of gold, typically one troy ounce or a fraction of it,” Melikhov said. He elaborated that the physical gold is typically stored by a certified custodian, while the issuer of the gold-backed currency holds legal ownership. The issuer, in turn, commits to redeeming an equivalent amount of gold upon presentation of the currency. Given the volatile nature of cryptocurrency, Melikhov believes that gold-backed tokens may appeal more to conservative investors who desire stability and real-world value support rather than price volatility. “Gold has a 5,000-year track record as a store of value, while Bitcoin and Ethereum are more speculative,” he noted. Melikhov added that tokenized gold offers digital convenience for traditional investors. Benefits include 24/7 transfer and trading, along with instant settlement, all while retaining the familiarity of an underlying tangible asset. “Tokenized gold bridges the psychological gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” Melikhov remarked. Examples of Gold-Backed Tokens While the market cap of gold-backed cryptocurrency is close to $3 billion, Tether Gold (XAUt) and PAX Gold (PAXG) are currently among the top-performing gold-backed tokens on the market. Source: CoinMarketCap Tether Gold, or XAUt, is a stablecoin that represents ownership of one fine troy ounce of digital gold. Sources note that the physical gold behind XAUt is held in secure , audited vaults. This is verified by Tether, as the company is required to provide regular proof-of-ownership and transparency reports. Source: Tether PAX Gold, or PAXG, is backed by one fine troy ounce of gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars. The bars are stored in Brink’s vaults located in London. This means that 1 PAXG equates to 1 ounce of physical gold. Paxos Trust Company is the issuer of PAXG and is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Other top-performing gold-backed cryptocurrencies include Kinesis Gold (KAU), Matrixdock Gold (XAUM), and Comtech Gold (CGO). Gold-Backed Crypto Token Use Cases One of the best use cases for gold-backed crypto tokens is to serve as a hedge against inflation. For instance, Melikhov believes that inflation persistence and geopolitical tension are pushing investors toward hard assets like gold. “Now that tokenized gold has credible infrastructure, regulated issuers, audited reserves, and access through major exchanges, investors are comfortable holding tokenized commodities as an alternative to fiat-backed stables,” he said. In addition, Tapscott mentioned that tokenized gold can be pledged as collateral in DeFi protocols, allowing investors to get leverage. “Similar to a margin loan in a brokerage account but on-chain—big picture tokenized gold makes the gold more useful, fungible, and marginable,” he said. Additionally, as more investors seek exposure to gold in today’s digital economy, gold-backed crypto tokens seem to be the answer. “Holding physical gold poses security risks, and it’s not easy to move, store, or manage. Tokens are—tokenized gold democratizes gold ownership,” Tapscott mentioned. Risks and Challenges to Consider While gold-backed crypto tokens gain traction, it’s also important to point out the risks associated with these digital assets. For instance, Melikhov believes that the main challenges are custodial and regulatory. “Investors must trust that the gold truly exists, remains unencumbered, and is redeemable on demand,” he said. Echoing this, Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, thinks trust and transparency remain an issue, noting that investors need proof that the gold truly exists and is fully backed. “If investors feel confident about the reserves, this could provide an additional boost for the asset,” Otychenko said. For example, on July 24, Tether published its Q2 attestation report confirming that XAUt was backed by more than 7.66 tons of physical gold. Otychenko noted that shortly afterward, XAUt began confidently surpassing both PAXG and KAU in daily trading volume. “A few weeks after that, XAUt executed the largest single-day supply expansion in tokenized gold history,” Otychenko added. While transparency remains key, liquidity is yet another challenge. Melikhov pointed out that only a few venues currently offer deep trading markets for gold-backed crypto tokens. What’s Next For Gold-Backed Crypto Tokens Challenges aside, gold-backed crypto tokens will likely continue to perform well. This also depends on key fundamental drivers, such as expectations of future U.S. interest rate cuts, threats to U.S. Fed independence, geopolitical risks around the world, U.S. trade policy and tariffs, and government fiscal policy and rising debt. “I think within a few years there will be trillions in tokenized real-world assets and gold will be one of the biggest beneficiaries,” Tapscott said. “Tokenizing gold is just one of many ways in which blockchains are bringing finance into the 21st century.” The post Why Tokenized Gold Is Booming as Spot Gold Breaks Records appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Gold|Tether|Tokenization,EN,0,0,FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XAUT|BUSINESS|USDT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-16 20:09:38
