The meme coin has slumped to multi-month lows as market participants sold the news on US-China trade war escalations. Now, both mid-sized and large investors are stepping in. Santiment data shows wallets holding 100,000 to 10 million PEPE have increased their balances to 610.21 billion tokens. PEPE supply distribution. Source: Santiment. Similarly, large holders with 10 million to 1 billion PEPE have stopped offloading, stabilizing their positions at 15.42 trillion tokens. This end to de-risking by whales, coupled with continued retail participation, sets a solid foundation for a potential market reversal. Pepe Price Prediction: Is This the Last Bottom Before $1? These move to increase exposure to Pepe comes as it affirms the lower boundary of a year-long symmetrical triangle, now nearing its apex. PEPE / USDT 1-day chart, 1-year symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. The support zone stretches back well beyond the pattern itself, acting as a proven launchpad since mid-2024. Now, with momentum indicators turning up, another bounce could be on the horizon. The RSI has rebounded from oversold territory above 30, while the MACD histogram is edging closer to the signal line, both hinting at the early stages of a potential bullish push. The key threshold for a breakout sits around the historic demand zone at $0.000009, which must hold as support for confirmation. Fully realized, the pattern targets past highs into new Pepe price discovery in a potential 600% move to $0.00005. However, with continued U.S. interest rate cuts stimulating risk appetite and growing speculation around spot PEPE ETFs under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, fresh inflows could fuel a 1,200% rally to $0.0001. While this marks the first step towards the $1 milestone, it remains distant. Such a jump would likely require long-term institutional participation and deep TradFi integration to meet the necessary demand. PepeNode: You Don’t Need the Perfect Entry to Net Gains Meme coins often reward those who time their entries perfectly, but that same volatility makes them unpredictable. What if you could mine them instead of betting everything on catching the right dip? With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No expensive setups, no tech barriers. Just log in, acquire nodes, stack rigs, and start earning rewards across top-performing meme coins. The stats look solid too. The presale has already exceeded $1.8 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 700% APY. And with 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs burned, scarcity is built directly into the system, helping support long-term value growth. The timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins, making PepeNode’s rewards and model even stronger as momentum builds across the sector.

Historically, “Uptober” has often marked the beginning of prolonged bull markets. Last Monday, Bitcoin hit a new ATH, sparking widespread optimism across the crypto space. That momentum quickly derailed when Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports on Friday. The news triggered some of the sharpest intraday declines ever recorded in the market. Despite the volatility, many veteran traders view the correction as a necessary reset. Historically, crypto markets tend to crash hard before major bull cycles. This event, they argue, served as a healthy purge that removed excessive leverage and mercurial holders. XRP ($XRP): Perplexity Anticipates a Run Toward $20 Perplexity’s AI-driven analysis suggests that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb to between $10 and $15 before the end of the year, an increase of four-to sixfold from its current price of $2.50. Source: Perplexity AI Ripple, the company behind XRP, secured a landmark legal victory this year after a five-year battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The win pushed XRP to $3.65 on July 18, marking its first all-time high since 2017. Furthermore, over the past 12 months, XRP’s price appreciated 360%, making it the best-performing large-cap cryptocurrency not pegged to a fiat currency. During the same period, Bitcoin rose 72%, while Ethereum appreciated 57%, meaning XRP outperformed them fivefold and sevenfold, respectively. Technical charts reveal three distinct bullish flag patterns throughout 2025, including two during the summer months, signals that often precede strong upward movements. Analysts expect that October’s historically bullish seasonality, combined with potential ETF approvals, promised U.S. regulation, and new Ripple partnerships, could propel XRP toward the $15 level. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Perplexity AI: Dogecoin Could Surpass the Doge Army’s $1 Goal Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted satire, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a major cryptocurrency, boasting a $30.6 billion market capitalization within the $66 billion meme coin sector. Currently trading around $0.20 with a relative strength index (RSI) near 40 and trending upward, Dogecoin has risen 1.2% in 24 hours despite the rest of the meme coin market collectively dipping 5.5% True to its meme coin nature, Dogecoin often amplifies daily crypto market trends. But as we’re seeing today, it has a second nature as a multibillion-dollar blue chip, which means it’s enjoying the market’s 2% rise today. Throughout summer 2025, several bullish formations appeared in its chart, setting the stage for a possible breakout. Perplexity predicts that DOGE could finish the year between $0.75 and $1.36, with the upper limit representing an ambitious stretch target. A more cautious estimate places it at $0.33. Given its previous all-time high of $0.7316 during the 2021 bull run, surpassing the Doge Army’s long-standing $1 objective would be a major psychological victory. Additionally, adoption continues: Tesla accepts Dogecoin for merchandise, and payment platforms such as PayPal and Revolut now support DOGE transactions. Pepe ($PEPE): Perplexity Predicts the Meme Coin Could Reclaim Its All-Time High Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) now commands a $3.1 billion market cap, making it the largest non-dog-themed meme token. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic, Pepe’s internet culture roots have made it a viral phenomenon in and beyond the crypto world. Despite strong competition, Pepe maintains deep liquidity and an active community, occasionally boosted by subtle, bullish references from Elon Musk on his X profile. Currently trading near $0.0000075, Pepe sits about 73% below its December 2024 peak of $0.00002803. Perplexity’s optimistic outlook suggests Pepe could retest its previous ATH, potentially quadrupling in value if it breaks key resistance around $0.000018. In a wildly speculative scenario, Perplexity targets $0.0024, a 32,000% increase. This is simply not possible given Pepe’s huge market cap, but a run to $0.0001 is a good stretch target in a bull run. Missed DOGE? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Challenger Fueled by Degen Energy and Community Hype A new Dogecoin rival, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , just hit the presale market, already raising $3.6 million in early funding as investors FOMO in. After watching Dogecoin’s success from the sidelines, his distant cousin Maxi Doge is now claiming his own spotlight, and reflecting it on the pump-loving maximalism of crypto’s degen community. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI is faster, cheaper, and more environmentally sound than Dogecoin. It focuses on community engagement through Telegram and Discord groups, trading competitions, and upcoming brand partnerships. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” a reserve dedicated to marketing initiatives and strategic collaborations. Staking is already live, offering yields of up to 84% APY, though returns fluctuate as participation increases. The presale currently prices tokens at $0.000263, with incremental increases tied to funding milestones. Investors can purchase using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Although DOGE’s trajectory has flipped bearish, short-term holders are currently capitalizing on the pullback, as they go on a massive buying spree. A Massive Dogecoin Buying Spree Ongoing In light of waning action in the price of Dogecoin, short-term investors are showcasing their presence once again in the market. Despite DOGE’s price experiencing a pullback, on-chain data reveals that these investors appear unfazed by the drop; instead, they view it as an ideal opportunity to increase their holdings. As reported by Joao Wedson, a market expert and founder of Alphractal, Dogecoin is still in its early stages of development, and short-term holders are accumulating. This steady accumulation reflects growing confidence in the meme coin’s long-term resilience. Such persistent conviction could pave the way for a bullish recovery after the broader market sentiment stabilizes. According to the Hodl Waves chart, short-term holders are amassing more DOGE every day, which shows a supply increase of up to 6 months. Historically, this crucial pattern has driven prices higher for Dogecoin, Bitcoin , and other coins. The major reason for prices moving higher is due to the fact that new speculative capital entering the market raises the Realized Cap. In the meantime, the MVRV Z-Score has not yet displayed the same level of intense ecstasy as previous cycles or 2021. Therefore, it shows that the leading meme coin still has room for more price growth before the cycle comes to an end or reaches its top. DOGE’s Top For This Cycle Not In? Wedson has also shared insights on whether DOGE has reached its top for this current cycle. In December 2024, Wedson highlighted that DOGE reached its all-time high for the current cycle exactly at the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) Alpha, a key metric for determining cycle bottoms and tops. However, data from the Reserve Risk Indicator implies that DOGE’s top in 2024 was fragile and lacked robust on-chain interest. Wedson considers the reading from this key metric as it has accurately predicted every Dogecoin’s top in the past 9 years. While DOGE keeps facing bearish pressure, Wedson claims that monitoring holders’ actions daily is important to navigate the market direction. His statement is fueled by the fact that steady accumulation may suggest a potential rise in price in the near future . Related Reading: House Of Doge Reveals Why Institutions Are Now Closely Watching Dogecoin Bitcoinsensus has forecasted that DOGE could soon rise beyond the $1 price mark as the macro picture remains bullish. Despite the recent market volatility, DOGE is holding strong on high time frames. Presently, the price is positioned above the support line of a rising channel. Should the meme coin surge to the upper line of the channel alongside a steady bullish overall trend, it is likely to surpass the $1 level and head towards $1.40.",Dogecoin|Alphractal|Bitcoinsensus|Cumulative Value Days Destroyed|CVDD Alpha|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Joao Wedson|MVRV Z-Score|Realized Cap|Reserve Risk Indicator|Rising Channel,EN,0,0,DOGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 22:30:03

The announcement came during a High Court hearing in London on Wednesday, where the Director of Public Prosecutions informed victims’ lawyers about the possibility of establishing such a scheme, though specific details remain undisclosed. At the center of the dispute are 61,000 Bitcoin, worth $6.7 billion, seized by police in 2018 from devices found at a mansion in Hampstead, north London, now representing one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in UK history. The case has pitted British authorities against approximately 130,000 Chinese investors who lost money in the fraud and contend the UK state should not benefit from their losses. Zhimin Qian, left, and Seng Hok Ling, right | Source: FT The Fraud and Seizure Zhimin Qian, 47, also known as Yadi Zhang, masterminded an investment fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded victims of 43 billion yuan ($6 billion). She fled China after converting much of the investors’ cash into Bitcoin and settled in the UK under a false identity. Qian and her Malaysian associate Seng Hok Ling, 47, pleaded guilty to money laundering charges last month at Southwark Crown Court in London. Both are scheduled for sentencing in November. Bitcoin’s value has surged dramatically since the 2018 seizure, climbing from approximately $1.8 billion at the time to its current valuation of roughly $7.2 billion. UK authorities recently obtained access to additional cryptocurrency assets worth about £67 million after Qian disclosed access codes and passwords for a ledger and two cryptocurrency wallets . “The ledger had been found in a purpose-made concealed pocket within a pair of jogging bottoms which [Zhang] was wearing at the time of her arrest,” according to written submissions by Martin Evans KC, counsel for the Crown Prosecution Service. Compensation Proposal and Victim Response Evans told the court that the proposed compensation scheme would provide “adequate protection” for victims. The CPS stated it had maintained throughout legal proceedings that it intended to seek a civil recovery order to compensate victims for their lost investment, insofar as they have not otherwise been compensated. The agency said it would consider how all victims could be compensated, not just those participating in the UK legal proceedings. William Glover, director at law firm Fieldfisher representing a group of victims, said in a statement following the hearing that “the DPP has effectively accepted responsibility to create a form of compensation scheme for those who may be unable to seek redress through the existing statutory provisions.” However, lawyers for the victims face serious challenges in proving direct links between their clients’ investments and the confiscated coins. Jack Ding, assistant managing partner at Duan & Duan, which represents around 10,000 victims, noted that “some materials lack sufficient information to establish a clear connection.” Legal experts warn that victims are unlikely to recover Bitcoin’s appreciated value, as courts typically focus on returning principal amounts and reasonable interest rather than speculative gains. Treasury Implications and Market Concerns The Bitcoin spoils have drawn attention from UK Treasury officials, with some privately questioning whether the assets could help Chancellor Rachel Reeves address the country’s fiscal gap estimated at up to £30 billion by 2029. However, other government officials have cautioned that the haul is likely subject to protracted legal battles extending potentially into 2027. The Treasury has been advised it cannot include the seized assets in its fiscal calculations, as the Office for Budget Responsibility does not account for asset seizures in its forecasts. Meanwhile, authorities face the practical challenge of liquidating such a large Bitcoin position without triggering major market disruption . The UK government is attempting to retain over 61,000 Bitcoin that was seized from a Chinese national convicted in a massive investment fraud case. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/L7LPgA3fCW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 The case has sparked debate about cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement in cross-border fraud cases, with implications for how governments handle seized digital assets. A civil recovery case filed in September 2024 will determine the final distribution of assets, with proceedings scheduled to continue through January 2026. The outcome is expected to establish precedents for international cooperation in cryptocurrency-related financial crime cases and may influence how other jurisdictions approach similar seizures. The coordination difficulties are compounded by the fact that many victims have limited experience with digital finance, making documentation and claim verification particularly challenging.

The San Francisco-based AI startup is currently enjoying a rapid adoption of its products by enterprise customers, fuelling the ambitious revenue projections, as per sources cited by Reuters. Apart from strong AI demand, the projections are also reflective of the growing investor confidence and growth in the generative AI sector, even as spending especially in infrastructure buildout comes under scrutiny. Anthropic eyes rapid expansion supported by enterprise customers Anthropic is currently on course to meet its internal goal of $9 billion annual revenue run rate by end of this year, according to the two sources who requested to remain anonymous to discuss private financial matters. The sources further revealed that for this year, the company has set a base target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion, with a best case reaching as much as $26 billion. While Anthropic declined to comment of the projections, the company confirmed to Reuters that its current annual revenue run rate is approaching $7 billion this month, a significant increase from the $5 billion it reported in August. Anthropic, which is also a top rival for OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, was recently valued at $183 billion after raising $13 billion in a series F funding round led by ICONIQ. The AI startup on Wednesday launched a new version of its cheapest AI model, Haiku as part of a broader effort to appeal to companies that are looking for capable AI systems that are cheaper than its more advanced models. The latest model – Haiku 4.5 reportedly sells for about one third the price of Sonnet 4, one of its medium-sized models. Anthropic’s expansion is being spurred by a widespread uptake of its enterprise products. Recently professional services giant Deloitte inked an agreement to deploy Anthropic’s AI assistant Claude, to its more than 470,000 employees across the globe. The deal marked the largest enterprise deployment of the AI assistant to date, deepening a relationship the two firms first established in 2024. Anthropic currently serves more than 300,000 businesses and enterprise customers , contributing about 80% of its total revenue. Its models like Claude family of large language models, are sold via application programming interfaces (APIs). A notably successful tool is Claude Code, a code generation assistant, achieved an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $1 billion since its launch earlier this year, according to one of the sources. Its ambitious growth forecasts positions it as a strong competitor to OpenAI, which announced in August that it had surpassed $13 billion in annualized revenue and is aiming to exceeding $20 billion by end of this year driven by ChatGPT growth. The chatbot has over 800 million active users. Anthropic has been expanding its sales to governments and growing outside the US. The company revealed in August that it would offer its Claude to the US government for $1. Anthropic is also targeting to open its first office in Bengaluru in India next year, its second largest market after the US and aims to triple its international workforce. It is also aiming to expand its applied AI team fivefold this year to meet rising demand for AI products and services. Get seen where it counts.

Extended Consolidation (35% Probability) Breakdown below $38.11 could result in $35 – $40 consolidation, allowing infrastructure development while testing structural support before catalyst-driven recovery.

From there, HIP-3 scaling and fee generation could push recovery toward $47 , with Polymarket expansion driving toward $52 + mid-October resistance reclaim.

Investors believe in its ability to pay up to 80x ROI when it lists on major exchanges later this year. Having verified audits and an Ethereum-based ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in high demand among retail and institutional investors preparing to make the next big presale success story of the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Investor Confidence Unlike normal presales that are based on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining the confidence of investors through transparency and independent verification. The project passed audits by Hashex and CertiK , which are most reputable blockchain security firms. Both audits attested that the smart contract does not have vulnerabilities or backdoors , ensuring all transactions and token minting are completely transparent on-chain. This kind of verification is not common among early-stage crypto projects. According to analysts, such degree of due diligence makes MAGACOIN FINANCE superior to its rivals in terms of dependability and long-term growth potential. The design of the presale also involves an anti-whale system, which denies a small number of investors the ability to control the supply of tokens and ensure a fair launching process. Moreover, the organized roadmap of the project and regular updates by the development team has helped in boosting investor confidence. All milestones have been implemented in a timely manner. Roadmap and Utility Ahead of Exchange Launch The exchange listing of the project expected in Q4 2025, is one of the most anticipated events by investors. Furthermore, market analysts believe that the listing will lead to a sharp price increase, as it has been with other high-performing presales in their early years. The projected 80x ROI is due to existing demand factors and presale velocity which are still above average. MAGACOIN FINANCE is also characterized as a utility-based approach. The token will enable a decentralized ecosystem with staking and liquidity incentives to reward holders. Moreover, the platform will incorporate live analytics to track the performance of tokens, which will serve as transparency to traders and long term investors. What Sets MAGACOIN FINANCE Apart Although numerous new tokens are introduced every day, only a few of them integrate audit-backed security, real-time transparency and systematic growth like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Its Ethereum foundation enables it to take advantage of security and scalability of the network, being compatible with major DeFi protocols. The other important distinguishing factor is the community-based approach which might lead to 80x ROI . MAGACOIN FINANCE has an excellent communication channel through social platforms where investors are updated on progress of the presale, exchange partnerships and roadmap implementation. Furthermore, its crypto presale model with distinct funding phases, has enabled investors to participate with ease, knowing their targets and allocation limits at each stage. This commitment to legitimacy by the project has also attracted the attention of influencers and analysts who rank it among the few 2025 presales that have both transparency and realistic growth expectations. Its performance potential and credibility is what helps MAGACOIN FINANCE attract early adopters prior to the start of listings. Conclusion Having already raised more than $16 million and boasting of audit-backed security, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already demonstrated legitimacy before its major exchange launch . Its well-organized roadmap and clear token utility, makes it one of the best-performing presales in 2025. With investor anticipation ahead of the listing stage MAGACOIN FINANCE is a safe project that will offer 80x ROI once listed on major exchanges.

However, according to prominent market analyst Egrag Crypto, there’s a critical signal to watch for that could determine whether the cryptocurrency’s bullish narrative remains intact or not. The expert’s analysis, shared on X social media, highlights that the behaviour of XRP’s 3-day candles could soon decide the direction of its next major move. XRP Price Integrity Hinges On 3-Day Candle Closes Below $2 In his post on X, Egrag Crypto explains the “measured move breakdown” for XRP, identifying a key technical formation in the form of a descending triangle that, based on its structure, points to a potential move toward $2.14. The accompanying chart shows XRP hovering between $2.40 and $2.60, with multiple retests of the same price levels over the past few months. Despite the brief wick to the downside, Egrag Crypto suggests that the structure continues to indicate consolidation within the range. Related Reading: Here’s How High The XRP Price Would Be With The Market Cap Of Bitcoin The analyst reiterates that $2.65 remains a critical price target for XRP. If the cryptocurrency breaks and sustains above it, he predicts that it could regain upward momentum, potentially paving the way for renewed bullish sentiment. However, failure to hold current levels around $2.5 might expose XRP to deeper retracements, particularly if 3-day candles start closing below the $2.00 to $1.91 range. Egrag Crypto warns that this specific candle behaviour is concerning, as it could signal a structural breakdown of XRP’s market cycle. It could also invalidate his bullish thesis, suggesting that the recent peak near $3.65 may have been the cycle top. Additionally, the analyst’s chart shows XRP’s price action hovering above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), serving as a long-term support level. Should XRP maintain its position above this moving average, Egrag Crypto asserts that the cryptocurrency’s bullish setup remains valid. He noted that the next 60 to 90 days are expected to be crucial, as XRP’s reaction around the levels mentioned above could define the trajectory of the rest of the year. XRP Faces 57% Chance Of Breaking To A New ATH In a separate analysis, Egrag Crypto introduced a 57% to 43% probability model, sharing his broader perspective on XRP’s potential price direction in the short term. He stated that there is a 57% probability that XRP could break into a new all-time high in the coming months. He also sees a 43% chance that the cryptocurrency could decline significantly, offering traders another opportunity to accumulate it at a price below $1. Related Reading: Market Strategist: What You Should Expect For The XRP Next Leg While the probabilities of XRP’s near-term price favor a more bullish outcome, the bearish case remains plausible given the lingering macroeconomic uncertainty and overall crypto market volatility. Egrag Crypto notes that he is personally positioning himself toward the bullish scenario, aligning his expectations with the 57% chance of a major price breakout.

The OG crypto that investors once treated as “digital gold” slumped as over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out within 24 hours, the largest single-day liquidation in history of the market. The crash was so huge it dragged Bitcoin from about $125,000 all the way to $102,000 in matter of hours, exposing how closely Satoshi’s dream still moves with risky assets instead of acting as a shield against them. For most of this year, Bitcoin was thriving on a new narrative. Exchange‑traded funds were attracting billions, and Wall Street giants were pouring in. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had grown to $91 billion in assets, trailing the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fund’s $136 billion, a symbolic race that investors said would prove whether crypto actually could rival gold as a store of value. That race is now over for the moment. Gold has reclaimed its dominance while Bitcoin’s safe‑haven credentials look weaker than ever. Gold rallies after Trump’s China tariff warning President Donald Trump’s new tariff threat against China sent investors scrambling for cover. Gold surged past $4,200 an ounce today, its highest level ever recorded, while Bitcoin fell in tandem with equities and oil. The selloff showed again that the token’s price still depends heavily on risk appetite and leverage rather than fear or capital preservation. “I have never considered Bitcoin a safe haven. I have always believed it to be a speculative risk asset,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. Gold’s centuries‑long reputation as a store of value remains intact. I mean, GLD stands above $130 billion in assets, IBIT hovers near $91 billion, and investors are again turning to bullion when volatility spikes. Even when volatility is factored in, gold is beating Bitcoin. The Sharpe ratio, which tracks risk‑adjusted returns, shows gold at 3 as of October 14, its highest in a year. Bitcoin has dropped to 1.91, down from 3.68 in January. Gold’s gains are steadier, while Bitcoin’s are fueled by momentum that vanishes once markets panic. Analysts call gold the new Bitcoin amid liquidity crunch Market veteran Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research, told clients on Wednesday that “Gold is the new Bitcoin.” He wrote that investors now view gold as “physical Bitcoin,” a more reliable hedge against rising geopolitical tension. Yardeni pointed out that while both assets posted strong returns this year, gold leads by a wide margin, jumping 60 percent in 2025 compared with Bitcoin’s 20 percent rise. Gold’s strength over the last month is striking, up 13 percent, while Bitcoin fell 3 percent. Over the past week alone, gold gained 4 percent as Bitcoin plunged 9 percent and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1 percent, a reminder that the token continues to trade like a tech stock rather than a hedge. Yardeni expects gold to hit $5,000 in 2026 and possibly $10,000 by the end of the decade. Yardeni blamed Bitcoin’s slide on liquidity pressure. He said exchanges triggered auto‑deleveraging to limit damage as markets collapsed, forcing even profitable or hedged traders to close positions to protect balance sheets. Market makers stepped back, spreads widened, and there were no buyers strong enough to absorb the avalanche of sell orders. Meanwhile, gold’s rally was helped by Trump’s tariff threats, as traders sought protection from policy shocks and global instability. Yardeni said, “Investors seeking protection from mounting geopolitical risks have been heading for the hills to mine for gold as well as for silver.” Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that institutional participation through ETFs proves the asset’s maturity and that the crash is temporary. Critics counter that as long as Bitcoin behaves like a high‑beta stock, its dream of becoming a hedge remains fantasy. The numbers leave little doubt. Gold funds continue to draw steady inflows as part of what traders call the “debasement trade,” while Bitcoin’s momentum has cooled. The token may still be the poster child of speculative finance, but for investors looking for safety in Trump’s world of tariffs, inflation worries, and geopolitical friction, gold is back in charge.

Here’s What $429M in ETF Outflows Really Means,https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-panic-pullback-or-bullish-setup-heres-what-429m-in-etf-outflows-really-means/,"Investors pulled nearly $430 million from Ethereum ETFs on Monday after Friday’s sharp sell-off, but analysts still favor a bullish Ethereum price prediction . According to Farside Investors , ETH ETFs saw eight straight days of net inflows before the crash, drawing in nearly $2 billion in fresh capital. This puts the recent outflow into perspective, suggesting that most investors aren’t shaken by the dip to $3,500 . Analyst Dean Chen from Bitnunix said that only if outflows continue for several sessions would it signal broader market fear. For now, the data suggests confidence in Ethereum remains strong despite short-term volatility. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Could Rise by 125% If It Breaks Out of Consolidation Ethereum is showing signs of strength as it enters a clear consolidation phase between $3,900 and $4,700 , holding this range for nearly three months. This type of setup has often preceded major breakouts — and ETH has done it before. The last time Ethereum traded sideways like this, it exploded 125% , climbing from $2,150 to $4,750 in just a matter of weeks. A similar breakout now could push the price beyond $8,000 , setting the stage for one of the biggest rallies of the year. However, momentum indicators haven’t confirmed the move just yet. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) still needs to break above the 14-day moving average to flash a clear buy signal, and $4,800 remains a key level to beat. For now, the signal isn’t confirmed. The RSI still needs to push above its 14-day moving average, and price must break through $4,800 to open the floodgates. Still, bullish sentiment remains strong after last week’s crash, and momentum is building fast. Presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are already seeing a surge in demand and with confidence returning to the market, early buyers could be positioned for massive upside. Bitcoin Hyper Nears $23M Raised to Launch The First-Ever Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is breaking new ground as the first true Layer-2 for Bitcoin , finally unlocking the full potential of the most popular blockchain. It cuts fees, adds smart contract functionality, and boosts transaction speed all by integrating the power and performance of Solana .

Buyers stepped in aggressively around the $2 level , showing confidence despite the market shakeout. In the last 24 hours, XRP has climbed 1.6% to $2.50, with trading volumes holding strong at 4% of its total circulating market cap — a sign that momentum may be shifting back in the bulls’ favor. Meanwhile, ETF assets held steady despite the downturn. The recently-launched REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) is still managing over $90 million worth of the token, which is pretty much what the fund had last week. It appears that diamond-handed XRP holders took advantage of last week’s decline to scoop up the token at a much lower price, meaning that this isolated Binance transfer is not necessarily indicative of an overall shift in market sentiment. XRP Price Prediction: Trend Line Support Bounce and Big Volumes Favor Bullish Outlook The daily chart shows that XRP bounced off a key trend line as it touched the $2 level. Above-average volumes reflect the technical relevance of this level and favor a bullish XRP price prediction for the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also jumped off oversold levels as the price climbed to $2.5. However, the token is still trading below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Moving forward, a bullish breakout above $2.70 would confirm that the token is once again en route to hitting the $3 level. Meanwhile, if positive momentum accelerates and a breakout above $3.5 occurs, that should set XRP on course to hit $5+ before the year ends. Ripple has been focusing its efforts lately on growing its ecosystem as regulations have turned in its favor. As institutional interest keeps growing, catching early crypto presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) while they are still flying below the market’s radar could deliver above-average returns during this cycle. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Crypto Mining Fun, Simple, and Hardware-Free Pepenode ($PEPENODE) makes it easy for anyone to start mining meme coins — no expensive gear, no complicated setup.

The researcher explained that Naver “has always been relatively undervalued” on the South Korean market, despite its rival Kakao “receiving a high valuation through business expansion.” He explained: “The acquisition of Dunamu will allow Naver to fully enter the crypto industry. Stablecoins , in particular, could generate significant synergy with Naver’s existing advertising, commerce, and fintech businesses.” The Kospi surged past 3,600 mark for the first time ever in early trading Friday as Korean markets reopened after the long Chuseok holiday, fueled by a rally in semiconductor and biotech shares following strong momentum from U.S. chipmaker Nvidia. https://t.co/HMv6UQaJXd — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) October 10, 2025 Naver is the country’s biggest internet company. Its subsidiary Naver Financial already operates several banking and e-pay platforms. The firm hopes to merge Naver Financial with Dunamu, the owner of South Korea’s biggest crypto trading platform. The move would create Asia’s biggest fintech company. Jung explained: “The industry expects the new firm to create a stablecoin ecosystem centered on Dunamu’s exchange business and its GIWA protocol [Upbit’s Layer-2 Ethereum-based chain].

(@joosik_school/YouTube/Screenshot) Jung opined that the merger would “open up various possibilities for Naver,” which has seen its valuation decline due to “a lack of new growth engines.” And while some continue to claim that regulatory approval for the merger is still up in the air, the researcher said there was a “relatively positive atmosphere” around the deal. While regulations still prevent banks from engaging in crypto-related business, some say that these rules do not apply to e-pay providers like Naver. Jung said that there is uncertainty over the question of whether fintech companies such as Naver Financial should be considered traditional financial companies. He said: “The levels of uncertainty surrounding the merger are not very high.” The researcher concluded that the proposed merger meant Naver would be “the most notable internet large-cap stock to watch next year.” Naver Financial last month announced a plan to effectively take over Dunamu in a proposed comprehensive stock swap deal. Upbit has cornered over 70% of the South Korean market share, per recent estimations . The merger talk has stoked speculation that Naver Financial-Dunamu could look to go public on the NASDAQ exchange.

In a recent analysis published on Tuesday, Matthew Dixon, a veteran trader and financial market strategist, identified one critical price point that could determine XRP’s next major rally. According to Dixon, once XRP clears this resistance, it could accelerate rapidly into new price territory. Key Resistance at $2.65 Dixon pinpointed the $2.65 level as the crucial barrier preventing XRP from initiating a sustained rally. This area previously acted as solid support but turned into resistance after XRP’s steep decline to $1.37 during the October 10 market crash. #XRP so far has failed to break back above the $XRP 2.65 resistance level but it should just be a matter of time. If we can break and retest that level then rapidly higher towards new ATH should follow the large WXY correction down that now appear complete pic.twitter.com/oCrTPcqMfQ — Matthew Dixon – Veteran Financial Trader (@mdtrade) October 14, 2025 Following that drop, XRP has made several attempts to reclaim the $2.65 region. On Monday, the token climbed to $2.647 before being rejected. Another attempt on Tuesday also failed, with the price retreating to $2.40 shortly after touching the resistance zone. Dixon emphasized that while XRP has struggled to move above this range, he expects the breakthrough to occur eventually. Once the $2.65 resistance is decisively cleared, he believes the price could advance quickly, potentially surpassing XRP’s current all-time high of $3.66. WXY Correction May Support Next Uptrend Dixon’s optimistic forecast is supported by his technical interpretation of XRP’s recent market structure. He argues that the token has completed a WXY corrective pattern, which often precedes a new bullish phase. His analysis outlines three main points, W, X, and Y, on XRP’s daily chart. The “W” point represents the low of $1.615 recorded in April. This was followed by an ABC pattern that led to a rally and peak around $3.66 in July, labeled as point “X.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Afterward, XRP entered a consolidation period, forming another ABC corrective wave, pushing prices downward to the “Y” point at $1.37 on October 10. Dixon considers this drop the final stage of the correction. He contends that a recovery from this zone could mark the beginning of a new bullish cycle, provided XRP reclaims the $2.65 resistance. Analysts Expect New All-Time High When asked about potential price targets, Dixon refrained from offering a specific number, noting instead that surpassing the previous all-time high would be the most immediate milestone following the resistance break. At present, XRP trades around $2.42 , roughly 31% below its record high. To establish a new peak, the token would need to climb at least 45% from current levels. Dixon’s outlook aligns with several other bullish forecasts for XRP. For example, market analyst CasiTrades recently projected that XRP could reach $4.50 as part of the final leg of a three-wave Elliott Wave pattern. Although short-term volatility remains, multiple analysts agree that XRP’s long-term trajectory depends on a clear break above the $2.65 resistance level. If that happens, they believe a rapid move toward new all-time highs could follow soon after. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

XRP and SUI have both posted decent gains in the past 24 hours, while hotly anticipated L1 cryptocurrency Monad shared details of its upcoming airdrop. These three coins are all likely to do well in the coming weeks, but so is another new token that’s also preparing to launch before the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Ripple Growth Will Drive Altcoin to Record-Breaking Highs XRP has bounced by 2% in 24 hours, although its current price of $2.52 still equals a 12% loss in a week and a 17% decline in the past month. Yet longer term momentum is undoubtedly on XRP’s side, given that it has posted a 360% increase in the past year. Bigger gains are still to come, especially when a whole raft of XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the near future , driving institutional investment in the token. This probability combines bullishly with the setup of XRP’s current chart, which shows the alt in an oversold position. Source: TradingView Its MACD (orange, blue) has recently plunged to a new low, while its relative strength index (yellow) has also bounced from a bottom. As such, XRP is ready for a big recovery, and the launch of ETFs may be the catalyst that triggers a big end-of-year rally. And when you add Ripple’s ongoing growth as a company – adding new partnerships and acquisitions in recent months – the future looks very bright for XRP. It could reach $3 in November, before ending the year above $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Monad ($MON) – Incoming Airdrop May Help New L1 Become the Next Big Thing in Crypto Monad is a new Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer-one blockchain, with its technical documentation stating that it’s capable of 10,000 transactions per second. It promises to improve on performance in five major areas, including block transmission, state access and consensus.

The Monad Airdrop Claim Portal is live Claim your MON here: https://t.co/WAKIvKK8xm https://t.co/WAKIvKK8xm — Monad (mainnet arc) (@monad) October 14, 2025 And this excitement has transferred to the imminent airdrop for its native MON token, which is yet to list. The airdrop is open to active members of the Ethereum and Solana communities, and will remain open until November 3. While there may be a dip in price once it does list (due to airdrop participants selling their holdings), its fundamentals put it in a strong position for medium- and long-term growth. It will have a total supply of 100 billion MON, and judging by other major tokens with a similar supply, this means its price could settle at around the Crypto Price Prediction: Sui ($SUI) – Network Growth and Canary ETF Increases Chances of Big Xmas Rally SUI has risen to $2.82 today, and while this makes for a 2% increase in 24 hours, the altcoin remains down by 19% in a week and by 22% in a month. It has also posted a 47% decline since reaching its ATH of $5.35 in early January, yet there’s an argument to be made that this indicates how much it could rally in the next few weeks. SUI does remain a very strong coin fundamentally, with its MOVE-based L1 now boosting a TVL of $2.2 billion , making it the ninth-biggest platform in crypto. It has also signed big partnerships in the past year (e.g. with World Liberty Financial ), and it’s looking forward to the launch of an ETF from Canary. Source: TradingView Its chart today also shows it in an oversold position, but because of its underlying fundamentals, we can expect it to recover strongly once the market is more favorable. It’s likely to retake $3 in the next few weeks, before ending November above $4 and then breaking the $6 barrier in December. $1.8 Million and Counting: PEPENODE Presale Sets Stage for Big Listing Rally The coins above are all showing massive potential, but so too are several newer tokens, some of which could rally big once they list for the first time. This includes presale coins such as PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has now raised over $1.8 million in its ongoing sale. Build. Mine.

Gramegna’s comments came during the International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings, where he said that if stablecoins ever became mainstream without being tied to central bank money, “there’s a risk to the whole financial system, not just in Europe, but the whole world,” according to Bloomberg. The IMF, in a report earlier this week, had said that the $305 billion stablecoin market could shake traditional lending, weaken monetary policy, and potentially trigger runs on the safest global assets. The Financial Stability Board backed that concern, warning that the explosive growth of stablecoins and their growing ties to the banking sector make them a rising threat to stability. IMF warns of run risks and central bank intervention The IMF’s semiannual financial stability report said a sudden loss of trust in stablecoins could create a “run risk,” because if investors rush to redeem their tokens, issuers might be forced into fire sales of reserve assets like government bonds or bank deposits. The report said such selloffs could spill into repo markets, push up volatility, and force central banks to step in to stabilize prices. Stablecoins are typically backed by US Treasuries, making them the most conservative slice of the crypto market. Yet the IMF said their size and the increasing overlap with traditional finance now pose global contagion risks. It warned that banks’ exposure to these assets could spread shocks across multiple markets if investors panic. Gramegna insisted that the European Union is not against stablecoins, but stressed that they must operate under a strict framework that protects both consumers and financial institutions. “It must be in a framework that is safe for consumers and financial actors,” he said. Gramegna also called on Europe not to fall behind the United States or Asia in crypto development, arguing that if the continent doesn’t produce stablecoins pegged to the euro, it will “lose an opportunity.” All these also came after Austrian central bank chief Martin Kocher said at the Bloomberg Global Regulatory Forum that he didn’t believe stablecoins would gain strong traction in the eurozone. “As 99% of stablecoins are denominated in dollars, if Europe doesn’t produce stablecoins denominated in euros we will eventually lose an opportunity here,” Gramegna said. “I do think there is a possibility of coexistence of cash, digital currency and stablecoins.” Banks expand stablecoin projects amid rising oversight The IMF’s admonitions come as banks and other financial institutions expand their stablecoin activities, following the passage of the US Genius Act, which establishes a new regulatory framework for the tokens. The total market value of stablecoins has soared this year do surpass $300 billion, data from DefiLlama show. Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Banco Santander announced plans to issue a 1:1 reserve-backed token on public blockchains. Citigroup joined nine European banks to develop a regulated euro-based stablecoin. Still though, the IMF is warning that as these dollar-linked tokens grow, they could limit central banks’ ability to manage interest rates and control inflation, especially in smaller economies where stablecoins may act as parallel currencies. They may also alter the structure of bond markets by prompting a preference for certain kinds of debt, which has implications for traditional lending, the IMF said. The report also cautioned that any large-scale loss of parity between a stablecoin and its reference currency would cause “direct losses and heightened uncertainty” for users. Over the weekend, Cryptopolitan reported that Ethena, the third-largest stablecoin, briefly lost its dollar peg as crypto markets saw their largest single-day liquidation in history. The Financial Stability Board joined the IMF in warning that stablecoins remain an “emerging threat” and promised to increase global oversight. Other major regulators, including the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, have also cautioned that without strong management, the stablecoin sector could create a crisis that no central bank is ready to contain.

The U.S. had slapped a 50% tariff on Indian goods earlier this year, split into two separate 25% rounds, after talks collapsed over trade and energy deals. India had protested that others like China and Turkey, who also buy Russian crude, weren’t hit with the same penalties. Trump pushes India and China to join the oil boycott Trump added that Modi could not end the purchases instantly because “it’s a little bit of a process,” but said the transition would be completed soon. The two leaders are expected to meet this month at the Southeast Asia Summit in Malaysia, their first face-to-face since tensions flared over the tariffs. “Modi is a great man, he loves Trump,” the president said, sounding confident about the partnership. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that China could face steeper tariffs if Europe joined the effort. He accused Beijing of “fueling the Russian war machine,” and Trump later urged China to follow India’s example. The White House decision came only days after Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, held a closed-door meeting with Modi in New Delhi. The pair reportedly discussed defense, technology, and trade, with Trump emphasizing that Gor’s appointment was part of his plan to stabilize relations after months of pressure over energy imports. Behind the scenes, Trump’s administration has been coordinating a broader international effort to limit Moscow’s oil profits through tariffs and financial restrictions. Officials described the goal as forcing nations still trading with Russia to shift away, using Washington’s trade tools rather than military ones. Britain expands sanctions as G7 debates frozen Russian funds Across the Atlantic, Britain announcement new sanctions aimed at Russia’s oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft, and 44 oil tankers accused of moving crude under Moscow’s so-called “shadow fleet.” Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the crackdown, part of a 90-item sanctions package, was designed to choke off funds used for the war in Ukraine. “We are sending a clear signal: Russian oil is off the market,” Reeves said during remarks in Washington D.C., ahead of meetings with international finance chiefs. Reeves also confirmed that the UK had sanctioned India’s Nayara Energy Limited, which she said imported 100 million barrels of Russian crude worth over $5 billion last year. The company’s inclusion marks the first time London has directly targeted an Indian firm in connection with Russian oil shipments. Reeves added that the UK government was also tightening the screws on four Chinese oil terminals linked to Russian exports. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper backed the action, saying, “Today’s action is another step toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and a more secure United Kingdom.” The two Russian energy firms under sanctions together ship about 3.1 million barrels of oil daily, with Rosneft producing nearly half of Russia’s crude, around 6% of total global output. The new measures were announced alongside meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose 190 member countries are tracking the global economic fallout from the war. Meanwhile, the G7 is preparing to debate next week a proposal to seize hundreds of billions in frozen Russian investments, much of it held in cash at the European Central Bank after maturing bond holdings. Earlier this year, both the U.S. and UK sanctioned Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, a move former Foreign Secretary David Lammy said would “drain Russia’s war chest.” Now, Trump’s latest push to align India with the oil boycott adds another layer of pressure on Moscow. The U.S. is also considering tariffs up to 500% on Chinese imports linked to Russian energy, though Scott Bessent did say that: “We will respond if our European partners will join us.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|India|Russia|USA,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|MACROECONOMICS|ASIA|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-15 23:37:53

Recent chart patterns and market behavior show striking similarities to its 2017 accumulation phase, a period that preceded a massive parabolic rally. As Q4 unfolds, technical indicators and Bitcoin dominance data hint that the long-awaited bullish setup could still be in play. Q4 Move Still Possible: XRP’s Bullish Potential Isn’t Gone Yet Crypto analyst CoinsKid recently shared an update confirming that the highly anticipated Q4 move for XRP is still a potential option. This optimistic outlook is heavily underpinned by the current data observed on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which the analyst views as a crucial barometer for altcoin performance. If BTC.D shows weakness, capital typically flows into assets like XRP, supporting the potential for a significant surge in the coming months. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Crashes 50% Over The Weekend, What Does This Mean For Price? However, CoinsKid pointed out that the recent loss of the $1.90 low last Friday introduced what he described as a structural anomaly into the equation. This development adds a layer of uncertainty to XRP’s short-term outlook, even as the broader setup continues to show potential. He further explained that for this bullish scenario to remain valid, Bitcoin dominance must stay below its 5-day resistance level on the CoinskidRibbon. At the same time, XRP needs to hold above its own 5-day CoinskidRibbon as support. Wyckoff Blueprint In Motion: XRP Mirrors Its 2017 Setup EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL, in a recent update, highlighted that XRP is currently positioned within a major accumulation area, signaling that a crucial phase may be unfolding for the asset. According to the analyst, the current market structure strongly mirrors the early stages of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, a technical formation that often precedes large-scale bullish movements. Related Reading: XRP Bull Run Reloaded: Analyst Says Momentum Mirrors 2017’s Explosive Rally The Wyckoff method identifies this accumulation phase as a period where smart money quietly builds positions while the price remains range-bound. This typically occurs after extended declines, setting the stage for a powerful reversal once the market confirms strength. From a technical perspective, this accumulation structure indicates growing pressure beneath key support zones, which often leads to a strong bullish cycle once a breakout occurs. The repeated testing of support levels, combined with diminishing selling volume, strengthens the case for a potential upside breakout in the near term. EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL also drew parallels to XRP’s behavior in the 2017 cycle, when a similar accumulation phase preceded one of the asset’s most explosive rallies, with XRP climbing all the way to the distribution zone, where profits were eventually taken. If history repeats, the altcoin could once again be on the verge of a powerful upward run.

Critics argue that the devastating episode highlights the difference between digital assets and traditional safe-haven investments, such as gold, exposing and challenging the long-held myth about BTC’s digital gold status . Bitcoin Flash Crash Highlights Fragility Of “Digital Gold” Narrative Veteran economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has been vocal in analyzing the flash crash that shook the crypto market last Friday. He stated in an X social media post that the sharp decline, which saw BTC drop from above $122,000 to $102,000 in a single day, was not a buying opportunity but a critical warning to investors. Notably, the Bitcoin flash crash came after US President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese tech imports , which added geopolitical pressure to markets. Reports from numerous analysts also indicated that internal pricing issues at Binance allegedly contributed to the massive liquidations the same day, exacerbating the broader market decline. Schiff highlighted in his post that the surge in gold price during the Bitcoin flash crash exposes the myth that BTC is digital gold, underscoring a stark contrast between volatility-driven digital currencies and traditionally tangible assets. He further argued that the notion of Bitcoin as a stable and reliable store of value is flawed, pointing out that the cryptocurrency’s price could collapse at any time in the future without warning. Addressing the crypto community, Schiff cautioned that many investors stand to lose significantly by choosing BTC over gold. He remarked that BTC enthusiasts seem to fear gold for “exposing Bitcoin for the fraud that it is,” highlighting the enduring resilience and stability that traditional assets continue to demonstrate over cryptocurrencies. Unsurprisingly, his remarks about Bitcoin provoked intense backlash from many Bitcoin maximalists and crypto investors, many of whom pointed to BTC’s record highs above $126,000 in contrast to Schiff’s past failed predictions or “warnings” that the cryptocurrency would never reach $100,000. Schiff Predicts Further Decline Ahead For BTC In a follow-up post on X, Schiff turned his attention to Bitcoin’s near-term outlook, forecasting another sharp decline from its present levels. He analyzed broader market trends, particularly the performance of Nasdaq futures , suggesting that if the index falls by an additional 7.5%, it would enter correction territory, potentially triggering a 15% drop in BTC prices. A 15% drop in the BTC price could send it tumbling below $95,000. However, Schiff went further, predicting that the cryptocurrency could continue sliding toward its next support level near $75,000, representing a steep 34% decline from current levels around $112,000. Moving on, the financial strategist highlighted the contrasting performance of traditional precious metals, noting that gold and silver continue to rise even as Bitcoin and Ethereum retreat . Schiff also warned that cryptocurrency buyers are likely in for a “rude awakening,” describing the experience as a costly but valuable lesson.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|ETH|Ethereum|gold|Peter Schiff,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 00:00:18

Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that the recent dip has created a rare opportunity for accumulation, particularly for investors seeking to move into the upper tiers of the XRP rich list. The XRP Rich List and Market Decline According to data compiled by the XRP community, wallets holding between 8,162 and 10,501 XRP currently fall within the top 5% of all XRP addresses. With XRP trading around $2.48 , this translates to an entry value of approximately $21,129 to $27,197. These figures represent a slight decline compared to earlier this month. On October 1, the threshold for inclusion in the top 5% ranged from 8,229 to 10,550 XRP, which was valued at $23,370 to $29,962 based on the token’s price at that time. The reduction in both token and dollar value means that investors can now join the top 5% segment with roughly $2,000 less than they would have needed two weeks ago. The decline in XRP’s value followed the broader market crash that affected most major cryptocurrencies on October 10, when XRP fell more than 43%, briefly touching $1.58 before recovering above the $2.40 region. Although sentiment remains cautious, several observers believe this period of weakness offers a favorable entry poin t for long-term investors. Analysts’ Perspective on Accumulation Market commentators such as Coach JV have recently emphasized that opportunities to buy XRP at lower valuations may not last long. He warned that once market momentum returns, XRP’s upward movement could be swift, leaving little time for new entrants to accumulate at current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other analysts, including DustyBC, have maintained bullish long-term expectations, with many placing the next significant target around $10 per XRP. While opinions differ on when such a rally might occur, the $10 projection remains one of the most cited price goals within the XRP community. Projected Returns for Top 5% Holders at $10 If XRP were to reach $10 , investors currently in the top 5% tier would see a substantial increase in their holdings’ value. Based on the present range of 8,162 to 10,501 XRP, their portfolios, now worth $21,129 to $27,197, would appreciate to $81,620 to $105,010. This potential increase represents profits between $60,491 and $75,048, assuming the holders maintain their current balances. Such returns highlight the financial leverage available to those already within the upper bracket of XRP ownership, particularly if the token’s price realizes the projected surge. While short-term uncertainty persists, the adjustment in the XRP rich list underscores how market downturns can shift entry requirements for top holders. With the current drop lowering the threshold for elite-level participation, new investors have an opportunity to join the upper percentile at a relatively reduced cost. If XRP succeeds in reclaiming bullish momentum and eventually approaches the $10 mark, these early entries could prove highly profitable. For now, analysts remain divided on the timing of such a move, but most agree that XRP’s present pricing offers a more accessible point for those looking to strengthen their positions before any potential market recovery.

UK prosecutors are preparing to confiscate Bitcoin worth about $6.8B connected to one of the largest cryptocurrency fraud cases ever uncovered. Prosecutors revealed during a court hearing in London on Wednesday that the funds are tied to a fraudulent investment scheme that swindled about 128,000 investors across China. Authorities plan to create a victim compensation program to return funds to those affected. Chinese victims are set to be repaid by the UK The $6.8 haul is from an investigation by the London Metropolitan Police, which uncovered 61,000 Bitcoins in 2018 during a money laundering probe involving two Chinese women. The women were involved in a 2017 fraud case that was first detected by Chinese authorities when investors began reporting losses linked to Tianjin Lantian’s promises of high-yield returns. The scheme eventually fell apart and exposed a vast network of false investment products and fake profits used to attract new participants. The structure was similar to a Ponzi-style scam . UK prosecutors stated that the company lured investors with promises of high returns and when it collapsed, it resulted in losses of more than 40 billion yuan. Fourteen Chinese nationals have already been convicted in China in connection with the scheme. One of the largest UK crypto seizures Yadi Zhang, also known as Zhimin Qian, played a key role in laundering the stolen cryptocurrency. Zhang pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges last month after years of investigation. Her accomplice, another Chinese woman, was convicted of fraud by a UK jury last year. Prosecutors revealed at the last hearing that Zhang had hidden additional cryptocurrency from investigators. The court filings show that Zhang told police in April 2024 that she had stored the passwords for two crypto wallets inside a pocket sewn into the pair of jogging bottoms she was wearing at the time of her arrest. Due to her confession, the police were able to recover another £67.3M worth of Bitcoin. “Some investors have suffered huge personal loss in the form of lives, marriages, fracturing families and businesses,” William Glover, a representative of a group of affected investors, stated. Glover added that the fraud had destroyed livelihoods and caused years of hardship for ordinary people who had invested their savings in what they believed were legitimate opportunities. Discussions are already being held to determine how the funds will be distributed. The court will have to decide on the process for verifying claims and determining which victims qualify for compensation . A lawyer representing another group of investors, Jackson Ng, stressed that the most important thing considering the amount involved in the case is to compensate the victims.

Muller noted that with interest rates currently at an appropriate level, policymakers should remain patient while closely monitoring developments that could sway inflation in either direction. Heightened trade conflicts in the market spark tension among investors During the 2025 IMF’s annual meeting, scheduled to take place from October 13 to 18 at the IMF and World Bank Group headquarters in Washington, D.C., Muller pointed out that China’s export controls are an example of how trade barriers set by other nations can have inflationary effects in Europe as well. The Governor of the Bank of Estonia also mentioned that insufficient essential material could raise prices for certain goods, even if it hurts the economy. Hence, according to Muller, this situation contradicts the belief that Trump’s additional tariffs would lead to European deflation. Regarding Chinese export limitations , Beijing’s new export regulations stipulate that foreign firms must obtain approval from the Chinese government before exporting products that contain even small quantities of specific rare earths sourced from the country. In response to this limitation, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an extra 100% tariff on Chinese goods. This heightened conflict between the US and China has sparked concerns among investors in the market regarding the possibility of a fierce trade war between the two. As a result, they have called on the ECB to consider the geographic risks that could affect their predictions. This has led the central bank to anticipate that price growth will decline drastically below its 2% target in 2026, before picking up pace again in 2027. “The risks linked to this forecast are currently more or less balanced,” said Muller. The ECB executive further explained that weakening the recovery process could lower inflation. However, he still pointed out the likelihood of higher inflation amid ignited trade conflicts. Therefore, with these considerations in mind, Muller speculates that the economy might recover swiftly, as it could turn out either way. Muller calls on officials to be patient as debates on interest rate cuts intensify After lowering the deposit rate to 2% eight times, several ECB officials think they should hold off on making further adjustments to borrowing costs until something truly surprising happens in the economy. This decision was weighed during Müller’s remarks, when he stated that with inflation at 2% and interest rates in a range that encourages economic recovery without resulting in slowdowns, officials need to be patient and make their decision based on what is likely to happen in the economy in the coming months. Even with this statement, some of his colleagues still hold the belief that further rate cuts are needed. In response to these contradictions, Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau mentioned in an interview this week that they expect to see a reduction rather than an increase next. Muller disagreed, saying the ECB could take action in either way. “It really depends on how things unfold, and it is very uncertain what we might need to do next in terms of changing rates,” he explained. Based on his argument, he has no reason to start leaning toward making things easier. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The forecast , delivered by Chief Financial and Operating Officer Robin Washington at the company’s investor event on Wednesday, does not include any revenue from a pending Informatica Inc. acquisition that Salesforce anticipates will close in the middle of 2026. Washington said the company was confident about returning to double-digit growth, noting that it would take about 12 to 18 months for the turnaround to materialize. She added that Salesforce had reported $37.9 billion in revenue for the fiscal year ended in January, its slowest growth since going public. AI agents drive Salesforce’s revival Having grown more slowly in recent years, Salesforce is making aggressive use of artificial intelligence to fuel its comeback. At the center of this is Agentforce 360 , an AI-powered automation platform that lets businesses deploy “digital agents” to perform tasks such as customer support, data entry, and early-stage sales conversations. The company stated that over 12,000 customers are already using Agentforce, which has also been adopted internally to reduce costs. The tool is saving Salesforce approximately $100 million per year, the company stated in figures shared during its Dreamforce 2025 conference earlier this week. To bolster its AI capabilities, Salesforce has strengthened its collaborations with OpenAI and Anthropic to integrate their latest models into the suite known as Agentforce 360. The integration enables customers to combine generative AI with Salesforce’s own Einstein Copilot system, which provides more intelligent, context-aware suggestions. The company also announced plans to invest $15 billion in San Francisco over the next five years, as it expands its data centers, supports local AI startups, and advances research on how AI can be used responsibly. The commitment aligns with CEO Marc Benioff’s efforts to establish the global AI economy in San Francisco. Benioff stated at Dreamforce that the company’s AI ecosystem was growing rapidly and described Agentforce as more than just a tool, calling it the future of how companies would interact with their customers. Salesforce boosts investor confidence with buybacks and acquisitions Washington also announced a $7 billion share buyback program over the next six months — part of an effort to help restore investor confidence after a turbulent year. The news lifted Salesforce’s shares about 4% in after-hours trading, although the stock is still off almost 29% year to date. The company’s struggles have additionally reflected investor fears that its corporate clients may be shifting their spending from traditional applications to AI startups and emerging tools. However, Washington has brushed aside those worries, calling talk of software applications dying a “myth.” Salesforce relies on its purchase of the data-integration and analytics firm Informatica as part of its growth strategy. Analysts have said the deal will enable Salesforce to integrate data more seamlessly across its products, which could help AI models operate with better information. Data is the basis for artificial intelligence, and acquiring Informatica would allow Salesforce to fully close that loop by combining customer data with automation and analytics in one place, according to technology analyst Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. The focus on AI and automation from Salesforce comes as the company battles to solidify its dominance in a cloud world that looks different than before. The competition is intensifying — Microsoft, Oracle, and ServiceNow are also incorporating generative AI into their enterprise software stacks. But Salesforce believes it is poised for its next growth chapter. Emphasizing AI, data, and efficiency more will help the firm recover from recent growth declines and restore investor confidence. Benioff noted the AI wave was real and Salesforce didn’t want to wait to take advantage of it. He said people were seeking smart software to do things for them, rather than the other way around.

XRP remains steady around the $2.70 support area, demonstrating strength and hinting that a potential push towards $5 might be in the future. Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, continues to impress with the steady development releases and expanding ecosystem, remaining the darling of long-term bullish believers. Against these established heavy-hitters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , as a presale project, is standing out as one to watch, now in Phase 6 with over 65% sold out, gaining interest with the innovative framework of the DeFi platform as well as the aggressive roadmap. As the go-to high-potential crypto assets under $5, these three tokens are taking the limelight this week among traders and investors. XRP Price Analysis Analysts are growing bullish on XRP, citing that the weekly chart could be taking shape within the form of a megaphone pattern, a formation that typically signals building volatility as well as market indecision. This pattern, defined by growing tops as well as bottoms, usually anticipates a watershed breakout once one side of the market succumbs. Should bulls take the helm, XRP might experience a strong continuation to the high side, consistent with general hopes based on its long-term fundamentals. As traders anticipate this possibility, most investors are putting their sights on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), too, as it continues to gather interest among investors anticipating a move into the next gen high-growth crypto assets. Cardano Price Analysis: The Rally Continues Towards $1 Cardano (ADA) remains to build on bullish strength as buyers continue the extension of the 3-day recovery, taking the price from about $0.63 to $0.70, a remarkable 11% increase since the previous update. This persistent move demonstrates the strength of the $0.60–$0.63 demand area, as this area continues to be the source of strong institutional buying interest. So long as ADA remains above this pivotal point, the bullish technical outlook remains good, with the near-term targets being $0.75, $0.85, as well as $0.95. The momentum bars continue to favor bulls, and with Bitcoin holding steady above the psychological $110K, ADA may soon threaten the psychological $1 barrier, giving way to potential gains towards $1.17–$1.33. As bullish momentum builds, investors are likewise expanding the scope of interest to a presale project gaining strong ground in the growing DeFi arena, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Surges in 2025 Mutuum Finance is the talk of the town nowadays within the DeFi market, as the presale has hit 17,000+ investors with a wonderful $17.35+ million worth of funds to-date. Already in Phase 6 with 65% snapped up during the current phase, the price of the token is currently at $0.035, indicating a consistent market demand with growing investors’ confidence. The platform will launch its lending and borrowing protocol . V1 will be launched onto the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature core product building blocks of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as a liquidator bot. ETH as well as USDT will be featured to be borrowed, collateralized, as well as lent, and will be provided at the time of launch to provide multi-asset, plug-and-play access to DeFi. Institutional as well as retail consumers will be provided with secure, efficient, as well as easy-to-use decentralised finance products. Inexpensive powerhouses to accelerate this week XRP, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance are emerging as three of the most intriguing crypto assets under $5 to watch this week. The bullish megaphone setup in XRP suggests a breakout could be possible, whereas the sustained Cardano rebound above crucial support demonstrates the regained belief among investors in the strength of its fundamentals. The spotlight, meanwhile, belongs to the early-stage DeFi project Mutuum Finance as one that offers innovation, security, as well as practical real-world utility. With over $17.35 million, 17,000+ investors participating, as well as 65% of Phase 6 presale sold, MUTM’s momentum builds upon the possibility of generating outsized returns this 2025. For value hunters and bulls looking to ride the upside in a fluctuating market, coming into the Mutuum Finance presale now might be the best early step towards benefiting from one of 2025’s largest crypto growth stories.

At the same time, altcoins like Ethereum, Avalanche (AVAX), and MAGACOIN FINANCE drew new attention from traders looking for the best altcoins to buy the dip. MAGACOIN FINANCE, in particular, continues to draw eyes for its consistent price movement and growing trust appeal. Bitcoin Price Path Below $112K Tests Trader Confidence Bitcoin price drop under $112,000 came after a sharp flash crash that erased about $15 billion in futures open interest. Despite reclaiming the $114,000 level briefly, caution still dominates the market. Analysts suggest the next push toward $125,000 could be delayed as investors weigh global macro issues. Weaker U.S. job numbers and fresh tension between the U.S. and China added pressure. Bond yields fell, signaling traders’ move toward safer assets. Some still view Bitcoin as a key hedge, but the current price zone shows how cautious participants have become. Even so, Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation asset, and its pullbacks often open opportunities in promising altcoins. As traders wait for volatility to settle, many now scan the broader market for the best altcoins to buy the dip before the next cycle recovery. Ethereum Price Eyes $4.5K as Market Regains Balance Ethereum’s recovery above $4,100 suggests confidence is returning. The heavy liquidations that hit futures markets on Friday have eased, with funding rates normalizing. Analysts now see Ethereum regaining its footing toward the $4,500 zone if sentiment continues to improve. ETH’s strength lies in its ability to stay resilient during sharp downturns. While many other assets dropped by 60% or more, Ethereum’s correction was softer, proving its deeper market presence. Options data also shows balanced activity, hinting that traders are not betting on heavy downside moves. The broader sentiment now sees Ethereum as one of the best altcoins to buy the dip , given its stability, long-term developer base, and steady institutional demand through ETFs and derivatives markets. As confidence rebuilds, ETH may lead the next leg of recovery. Avalanche (AVAX) Recovery Hints at a Broader Altcoin Turnaround Avalanche has started to show signs of life after one of its sharpest shakeouts in months. AVAX now trades near $22 , with analysts tracking a possible rebound toward $47 . Market watchers highlight its strong on-chain activity and network usage, which remain steady despite the price crash. The Bokcast and other analysts point to a clean structure forming, suggesting AVAX may have already cleared weak hands. Historically, such capitulations often mark macro bottoms. September saw Avalanche’s busiest month in nearly two years, a sign of real activity beyond speculation. As developers continue to build through the market noise, Avalanche’s growing base makes it one of the best altcoins to buy the dip for those looking to position early before the next uptrend. The network’s health, combined with price consolidation, supports the idea of an early accumulation phase underway. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Altcoin Traders Are Watching Closely Amid the market chaos, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown stability rarely seen during broad selloffs. Its price continues to rise steadily every hour with no major pullbacks, making it stand out as a safe haven altcoin in this volatile week. With a smaller market cap under $15 million , it offers room for growth and serves as a useful hedge for traders seeking diversification. The project has confirmed plans for a CEX listing soon , drawing further attention as one of the best altcoins to buy the dip during uncertain times. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s steady pace and community-driven structure make it a good find, agile enough to grow, yet stable enough to trust amid wider price crashes. How Traders Can Position in This Market Short-term fear often creates long-term opportunity. The recent dip has given traders a new chance to reposition in quality altcoins before sentiment flips again. Watching Bitcoin’s next moves remains key, but those who diversify early into names like Ethereum, AVAX, and MAGACOIN FINANCE may be better placed for the next recovery wave.

Cobb’s remarks come at a time when broader market sentiment remains uncertain. Despite recent corrections, XRP has managed to hold above crucial technical support zones, maintaining investor confidence amid volatility. His comments came after an independent analysis by market observer Charting Guy, who examined XRP’s long-term price structure using Fibonacci retracement levels. According to Charting Guy, XRP is currently hovering around the 0.888 Fibonacci retracement level near $2.44. The analyst identified a strong support range between $1.61 and $1.70, a zone that played a key role during XRP’s early 2021 price surge. He described XRP’s market structure as fundamentally sound, dismissing claims that the asset was turning bearish. Instead, he suggested that XRP is consolidating before another upward breakout. The next leg up on XRP will have Bitcoiners genuinely worried about their #1 spot https://t.co/U4damVkK3J — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 14, 2025 If the token manages to move past the $3.31 resistance zone, the next Fibonacci extension targets could position XRP for significant gains. Based on current chart projections, these levels include $8.29, $13.38, and $26.63, indicating potential returns ranging from threefold to elevenfold from current prices. At $2.50, XRP’s price would need a considerable rally to reach those upper targets, but doing so would give the asset an estimated market capitalization of around $1.6 trillion. XRP’s Growth Could Stir the Bitcoin Market Cobb remarked that such a development would likely raise concerns among Bitcoin investors, as a substantial XRP rally could draw capital and attention away from BTC. His comment implied that XRP’s next major move could reignite discussions about which asset leads the crypto market. Currently, Bitcoin retains a commanding lead with a market capitalization exceeding $2.24 trillion. XRP, valued at roughly $149 billion, ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. While XRP briefly reclaimed the third position earlier this year, its market value has since declined, leaving a significant gap between it and Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Long Path Toward Market Leadership Before XRP could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance, it must first overtake several major cryptocurrencies. Binance Coin (BNB) currently leads XRP by roughly $15 billion in market capitalization, while Tether (USDT) sits about $30 billion ahead. Surpassing these assets is feasible based on past performance. XRP previously reached a $210 billion market cap, but the larger obstacle lies in overtaking Ethereum. Ethereum’s current valuation stands near $500 billion, meaning XRP would need to triple in price to around $8 to match it. If Ethereum continues to rise, this gap would expand further. While Cobb remains confident in XRP’s long-term potential, other analysts such as Charting Guy have voiced caution, acknowledging Ethereum’s own strong technical structure and positive outlook. In theory, for XRP to surpass Bitcoin’s market value, it would need to appreciate by approximately 1,397%, reaching a price near $38, assuming Bitcoin’s value remains unchanged. This represents a substantial challenge in both the short and medium term. Although the idea of XRP surpassing Bitcoin remains speculative, many in the XRP community continue to view it as a long-term possibility. Some projections suggest that if market conditions align, XRP could achieve this by 2030. However, others predict that Bitcoin may rise to $1 million by then, further extending its lead. For now, XRP’s focus remains on sustaining its bullish structure and reclaiming higher resistance levels. Whether it can eventually compete with Bitcoin’s dominance will depend on how the market evolves in the coming years.

Dogecoin Set For Takeoff As Wave 3 Kicks In Sharing a weekly chart, the analyst wrote: “Initially I thought DOGE wave 2 retraced to 0.5 of wave 1, which is valid, but it decided to get to 0.382 which is also possible for a wave 2 retracement. Now it’s reclaiming 0.618 and wave 3 could be starting… and wave 3 is the most bullish and most powerful of them all.” The chart posted by Cantonese Cat applies a Fibonacci grid to Dogecoin’s 2022–December 2024 advance (“Wave 1” on the graphic), with the 0.618 retracement anchored around ~$0.20088 on the weekly timeframe and the mid-range levels marked at 0.5 (~$0.15350) and 0.382 (~$0.11729). On the left axis, historical weekly candles show DOGE’s earlier cycle blow-off followed by a lengthy basing period near the ~$0.05–$0.10 zone (the 0.0 line sits at ~$0.04909), from which the advance began in mid-2022. Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation’s House Of Doge Announces NASDAQ Listing Elliott Wave analysis proposes that markets trend in a five-wave impulse where the third wave is typically the strongest by both breadth and momentum. Within that framework, a “Wave 2” pullback frequently terminates in the 0.382–0.618 retracement band of Wave 1, while a decisive reclaim of the 0.618 level on higher timeframes is often treated by technicians as a structural pivot back in favor of the prevailing uptrend. The chart Cantonese Cat shared labels the recent decline as “Wave 2,” with wicks probing toward the 0.382 band and subsequent weekly closes gravitating back toward the 0.618 level. The current weekly candle plotted on the image sits almost exactly on that 0.618 line, indicating the market is testing whether buyers can convert it into support. Related Reading: Elon Musk Mentions Dogecoin Again — Is The Meme Coin About To Rally? The analyst’s emphasis on the 0.618 reclaim is consistent with how many systematic traders translate Fibonacci confluence into risk frameworks: closes and acceptance above the golden-ratio band raise the probability that the prior impulse has resumed, whereas sustained rejection there often keeps a market locked in a range. DOGE Price Targets The chart also visualizes potential topside waypoints should momentum expand. The Fibonacci projections drawn beyond the “Wave 1” peak display the 1.0 band at roughly $0.48 and classical extensions at 1.272 (~$0.89), 1.414 (~$1.23), and 1.618 (~$1.96). Elliott practitioners frequently monitor these zones for acceleration targets or distribution risk if a third wave unfolds. For now, the operative claim is straightforward and testable on chart: “Now it’s reclaiming 0.618 and wave 3 could be starting,” with the reminder that “wave 3 is the most bullish and most powerful of them all.” Whether price can hold above the ~$0.20088 pivot into weekly close and then demonstrate impulsive breadth—rising range, expanding volume, and leadership versus peers—will determine if this setup matures into the kind of third-wave advance Elliott theorists anticipate or fades back into consolidation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.20.

Erik Thedéen, the chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and governor of Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, said that regulators are currently focused on stablecoins. Other central bankers also stated that they were closely monitoring developments related to these so-called stablecoins, which are digital tokens linked to traditional currencies such as the dollar or euro, providing one-to-one value. Thedéen said at a conference in Washington on Wednesday, during the IMF meetings, that the Basel Committee could revise its current crypto capital framework, given the significant changes in the digital asset landscape since 2022. Basel considers rule review amid stablecoin boom When, in 2022, the Basel Committee wrote its crypto capital rules, stablecoins were new. But policymakers at the time were more concerned about volatile assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, since then, stablecoins have experienced a surge in use and value — tokens like Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC), for example, now facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of transactions every day worldwide. Under the current regime, most stablecoins are considered highly risky crypto assets, and banks must maintain equal amounts of capital against them as they would against much more volatile cryptocurrencies. Thedéen admitted that this blanket approach may no longer be suitable for today’s evolving market, as newer stablecoins are increasingly backed by liquid assets such as short-term US Treasuries. The new capital rules, which were set to take effect in 2026, would have made it far more expensive for banks to dabble in crypto assets. The finance industry has stated that such treatment is excessively punitive and stifles innovation, especially at a time when several global banks have been experimenting with issuing their own stablecoins, which are pegged to major currencies, including the US dollar, the euro, and the yen. Thedéen emphasized that any revision of the rules would undergo a very thorough process involving all Basel member states. He noted that some members had already adopted parts of the package, suggesting that any amendments would require broad consensus. The Basel Committee’s latest signal comes as regulators worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing the stablecoin industry. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) had just cautioned that the widespread use of stablecoins could increase risks to the financial system , particularly if the tokens were to be used in payments and credit. The Systemic Risk Board, for its part, suggested that banks or shadow lenders could hold stablecoins issued in multiple countries to a range of users from across the world. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also urged closer supervision to close any regulatory gaps. In the United States, Congress passed the Stablecoin Act, establishing national standards for stablecoin issuers. The Act ensures that issuers maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets and provide clear redemption rights to holders. The Bank of England has just indicated that it will only lift its proposed cap on stablecoin payments when it is certain that there can be no impact whatsoever on financial stability as a result of this technology. Banks push back against punitive capital charges Key banks and trade associations, such as the GFMA, have warned the Basel Committee against delaying or reconsidering its forthcoming crypto framework. They state the market has advanced beyond 2022, with better governance, transparency, and collateralisation for the majority of top stablecoins. The GFMA stated in an August letter to the committee that the proposed rules could make it increasingly uneconomical for regulated UK financial institutions to offer cryptoasset custody and payment services. The group further urged the committee to adopt data-driven adjustments that would better reflect the reduced risk profile of stablecoin issuers with strong performance records.

53203202,606615,1760578252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53203202.jpeg,Tether And Circle Mint $4.5B In Stablecoins Since The Market Crash – Recovery Fuel?,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-circle-mint-stablecoins-since-market-crash/,"Tether (USDT) is back in the spotlight after minting another $1 billion in new tokens — just days after issuing $2 billion earlier this week. The timing has drawn attention from analysts and traders alike, as the market continues to recover from one of the sharpest sell-offs of the year. With Bitcoin struggling to hold above the $110K region and altcoins showing weak follow-through, Tether’s sudden burst of activity is being closely watched as a potential signal of renewed liquidity or strategic repositioning. This latest mint pushes Tether’s total new issuance to $3 billion in under a week, reinforcing its dominant position in the stablecoin market. During the sell-off, Tether dominance spiked to 5.5%, its highest level since April, reflecting a surge in demand for stable liquidity as traders fled risk assets. Since then, dominance has cooled slightly to 4.7%, but the stablecoin giant’s activity continues to draw intense scrutiny. While Tether mints don’t always translate into immediate inflows to crypto assets, they often hint at growing sidelined capital preparing to re-enter the market . Whether this surge in issuance reflects institutional demand, exchange liquidity provisioning, or broader market preparation for a rebound remains to be seen — but the timing is far from random. Stablecoin Issuance Surges After Market Crash According to data shared by Lookonchain, Tether and Circle have minted a combined $4.5 billion in stablecoins following last Friday’s market crash. The report reveals that Tether issued $3 billion USDT, while Circle minted $1.5 billion USDC, highlighting that liquidity is quietly rebuilding even as prices remain unstable. Lookonchain notes that Circle has minted 250 million USDC six times since the crash, each within short intervals, underscoring strong and consistent demand for dollar-backed assets. These minting events — often used to meet institutional or exchange-level liquidity needs — suggest that large players are positioning capital in anticipation of potential volatility or future accumulation opportunities. The timing is significant. The crypto market remains in a delicate and fearful phase, with Bitcoin consolidating around the $112K level after its sharp decline to $103K. Altcoins continue to trade at heavy discounts, and sentiment across social and on-chain indicators remains cautious. Yet, historically, such spikes in stablecoin issuance tend to precede aggressive market moves, as sidelined liquidity eventually flows back into risk assets once confidence begins to return. In this context, the surge in Tether and Circle’s minting could signal that institutional money is quietly preparing for a turnaround. While fear continues to dominate short-term price action, stablecoin activity suggests that deep-pocketed players are positioning for what could become the next major phase of recovery. USDT Dominance Spikes, But A Key Level Could Signal Recovery The chart shows USDT dominance rebounding to 4.78%, reflecting a cautious market still leaning toward stablecoins after last week’s sharp sell-off. During Friday’s crash, Tether dominance briefly spiked to 5.5%, its highest since April, as investors sought safety amid panic. While the ratio has since cooled, it remains elevated — a sign that traders are still hesitant to rotate back into Bitcoin and altcoins. Technically, dominance is now sitting above key moving averages, showing short-term strength for stable liquidity. However, analysts are watching a critical level at 3.96%. Historically, when USDT dominance falls below 3.96%, it signals that capital is flowing back into risk assets — often marking the early stages of altcoin recoveries. If dominance fails to sustain above 4.5% and trends downward, it could indicate that investors are beginning to redeploy capital into the broader crypto market. Combined with the recent $4.5 billion in new stablecoin issuance from Tether and Circle, the setup suggests that while fear still dominates sentiment, liquidity is quietly building on the sidelines — ready to re-enter once confidence returns. A sustained drop below 3.96% would therefore be a bullish signal for altcoins and a potential turning point for the market.

The platform has reaffirmed the sole official appeal channels for lifting withdrawal limits and, importantly, launched a new anti-fraud reporting mailbox . The initiative targets scams in which fraudsters impersonate HTX staff and demand illegitimate fees under the pretext of “unfreezing withdrawal limits”. This move marks a critical step in HTX’s evolving strategy toward user security education and systemic fraud prevention. Targeted Fraud Prevention: Official Channels as a Firewall In the crypto asset space, scams that exploit user anxiety—especially those involving fake “asset unfreezing” services—are alarmingly frequent. HTX’s announcement draws a clear boundary: the only valid methods to appeal withdrawal restrictions are via the platform’s in-app Help Center system and the official customer service email ( htxsupport@htx-inc.com ). The service is completely free of charge . Any attempt to bypass these channels, collect fees, or impersonate HTX staff is considered fraud. To combat such activities, HTX has also introduced a new reporting email: ia@htx-inc.com . Users who encounter impersonators or suspicious actors claiming to represent HTX are encouraged to report them. Once a case is verified, the platform will take strict enforcement actions and assist in recovering any associated funds. By designating these trusted channels —bound email and in-app support—HTX is cutting off fraudsters at the source. This simplifies the appeal process for users while neutralizing external attempts to exploit confusion or misinformation. From Process Control to Systemic Security: Building a Trust-Based Safety Framework As a globally recognized digital asset platform, HTX adheres to a “user-first, security-driven” philosophy. This latest update is more than a procedural clarification; it represents a shift from isolated defense tactics to a comprehensive anti-fraud system . On one hand, HTX has proactively integrated the sensitive issue of “withdrawal limits” into its broader risk control framework, presenting it as a protective mechanism rather than a punitive one. With a guaranteed 24-hour response time and real-time case tracking , users now benefit from a service experience defined by transparency and trust. On the other, by reiterating that all appeal-related services are completely free and by introducing an official reporting mechanism , HTX is encouraging its users to become active participants in fraud detection. This creates a shared ecosystem of platform-user co-governance , forming a more resilient and collaborative defense line against scams. Industry Implications: Fraud Prevention as a Shared Responsibility As crypto adoption expands, scam tactics are evolving—especially those exploiting “frozen funds” narratives. HTX’s proactive stance—clarifying its official processes and launching a fraud reporting channel—signals a paradigm shift: from reactive to preventative, from siloed to systemic. This model provides a valuable blueprint for the broader industry. Effective anti-fraud strategies are not just technological, but ethical and collaborative. Platforms must set clear policies, empower users, and act decisively against bad actors. Only through such unified efforts can the space maintain its integrity and ensure user confidence. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to strengthen its identity verification systems and behavioral risk controls, while collaborating with global regulators, industry partners, and cybersecurity firms to build a safer, more transparent crypto ecosystem.

Trump made the statement after days of rising tension following his threat to impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports. A reporter asked Trump if the U.S. was preparing for a trade war with China, to which he answered, “Well, we’re in one now.” He emphasized that the tariffs are America’s main tool of defense against unfair trade practices. His remarks mark the first official acknowledgment from the administration that trade hostilities with China have fully reignited. Trump defends tariffs and says they protect America President Donald Trump said, “If we didn’t have tariffs, we would have no defense.” He argued that the tariffs stop foreign nations like China from flooding the U.S. market with cheap goods and controlling critical industries that America depends on. Just last week, the President posted on social media, stating that he would impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports. His announcement triggered fear across global markets, as Bitcoin prices dropped quickly from around $121,560 to below $103,000 within a few hours. Traders and analysts said the sudden drop shows just how sensitive the market is to signs of rising tension between the world’s two largest economies. The reaction also reminds people just how much power Trump’s words still carry. People who support these trade policies argue that the tariffs will prompt companies to reconsider relocating production outside the United States and make trade more equitable. They also argue that the tariffs will push businesses to make goods locally, even if that means paying more in the short term, which will help the country become more self-reliant. On the other hand, critics argue that the tariffs will increase prices for everyday goods, including electronics, clothing, and machinery. They also warn that American farmers and exporters could lose access to key markets if China responds with its own tariffs. The markets did not crash as many people had expected following Trump’s announcements, and prices even began to stabilize after an initial shock. U.S. stock futures remained mostly steady, and Bitcoin prices increased by about 0.1% over the next few hours. Experts say this indicates that investors no longer panic as quickly as they did before, because they have grown accustomed to Trump’s strong language regarding China. A few analysts think Trump’s approach is a deliberate strategy to put more pressure on China and gain the upper hand before trade talks between the two governments. Bessent criticizes China’s “disappointing actions” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke on Wednesday and criticized what he called China’s “disappointing actions” in trade and resource control. He said the Chinese government is making choices that could slow down the entire global economy and cause serious harm to China’s own industries and workers at the same time. “If some in the Chinese government want to slow down the global economy through disappointing actions and economic coercion, the Chinese economy will be hurt the most,” Bessent said in his statement. Bessent said that China’s restrictions on exports, such as rare earth minerals, will disrupt global supply chains and make it difficult for companies everywhere to plan their production. The Treasury Secretary stated that these restrictions create fear and uncertainty, which will ultimately prompt companies to relocate their supply chains away from China. In the long run, this will reduce China’s influence and slow down its economic growth. Bessent said that China’s approach to trade is damaging its relationships with other countries. He explained that the U.S. and its allies have been working with Beijing for many years to encourage open trade and shared progress that would benefit everyone. However, countries are beginning to see China as a threat to stability because its actions make it difficult to maintain trust. “This is China versus the world,” Bessent said firmly, adding that “we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled by a group of bureaucrats in Beijing.” Bessent said that Washington is helping its allies establish new production centers and identify new sources of raw materials, thereby reducing their dependence on any single country.

This statement was made after Kent, who oversees the RBA’s engagement with financial markets, noted that narrower loan spreads and households making extra mortgage repayments amid lower interest rates signal improving conditions. Meanwhile, apart from the above considerations, analysts have also highlighted an increase in credit growth driven by escalating demand for housing. Moreover, stiff competition among lenders and reduced funding costs have inspired businesses to borrow more. Australia’s central bank anticipates a balanced economy amid lessened financial conditions While addressing the CFA Society Australia in Sydney, Kent mentioned that the RBA’s predictions suggest that the toughness of financial conditions has reduced, thus establishing a balanced economy in the future. This includes full employment and inflation approaching the center of their target range, said the assistant governor. Notably, the RBA wants to maintain an inflation range between 2% and 3%. Kent’s remarks came a day after his colleague, Sarah Hunter, forecasted that the country’s underlying inflation for the three months ending in September will probably be stronger than what the RBA had earlier predicted. This indicated a slightly tougher stance. In the meantime, Hunter and Kent’s statements collectively demonstrate the central bank’s belief that recent policy changes, particularly the three interest rate cuts this year and the improvement in credit conditions, are helping the economy stabilize after a tough period of tightening. Concerning the situation, several officials have weighed in on the topic of discussion. Based on their argument, this aligns with inflation gradually returning to its target. However, they warned of the uncertainties ahead as they await the review of the final price report for the third quarter. On November 3-4, the monetary policy board is scheduled to hold a meeting. Regarding this meeting, economists have predicted that a cut would be imposed on the benchmark rate. Traders, on the other hand, speculate that the decision will go either way. September’s employment data, which will be published in a few hours, is crucial in this decision. Kent illustrates the estimates of financial status in the current market conditions Kent cautioned that the outlook in the future will depend on how new figures impact views of economic growth, inflation, and potential risks. Meanwhile, the assistant governor mentioned that the RBA prefers the use of various methods to assess financial conditions because of the uncertainties involved. An example of these methods is to compare the cash rate with estimates of the nominal neutral rate. According to Kent, model-based estimates suggest that financial conditions have been strict, which helps reduce overall demand. While he does not specify a number, the assistant governor highlighted that the cash rate is expected to decline within a wider range, given the current market conditions. “The estimates of the neutral rate match with several indicators of financial conditions,” he said. “In fact, various indicators – including mortgage payments and housing credit growth – have already started to display early signs of responding to this year’s easing in financial conditions.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|RBA,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-16 01:57:51

That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 14, 2025 Tesla’s Past Moves And Holdings Based on reports, Tesla bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in early 2021 and said it would take the coin as payment for cars. But the deal was short-lived. The company soon stopped accepting Bitcoin because of concerns about mining’s heavy energy use and said it might resume payments only after a major move toward renewable mining practices. By mid-2022, Tesla sold about 75% of its holdings, a move that happened near a market low and drew wide notice. According to Arkham Intelligence, Tesla still holds roughly 11,509 BTC, which is worth about $1.25 billion at current prices. What The Market Might Be Watching Traders read signals. A single public endorsement from a high-profile executive used to move prices more. That was the case in 2021 when Tesla’s investment and payment plan helped lift sentiment.

BTC is now consolidating and might start another decline below $110,000. Bitcoin started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $114,000 resistance level. The price is trading below $113,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $112,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it trades below the $110,200 zone. Bitcoin Price Faces Hurdles Bitcoin price started a recovery wave above the $112,500 resistance level. BTC recovered above the $112,800 and $113,000 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $115,975 swing high to the $110,000 low. The bulls even pushed the price above the $113,500 resistance level. However, there are many hurdles on the upside. Bitcoin is now trading below $113,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $112,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $112,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $113,000 level. The next resistance could be $113,700 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $115,975 swing high to the $110,000 low. A close above the $113,700 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $114,500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $115,250 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $115,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $113,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support is near the $110,200 level. The first major support is near the $110,000 level. The next support is now near the $109,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $108,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $107,200, below which BTC might struggle to recover in the short term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $110,200, followed by $110,000.

The U.S. Department of Justice described the case as ‘first of its kind’ due to the complex nature of the scam. The two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, are facing conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering charges for allegedly exploiting the Ethereum blockchain’s transaction validation process in 2023. According to the prosecutors, the brothers used their advanced technical skills in the blockchain network to manipulate pending trades on the network. The brothers took away $25 million in Ethereum tokens in just 12 seconds. Ethereum ‘Exploit’ case puts blockchain integrity under legal scrutiny According to a release by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Peraire-Bueno brothers, who studied computer science and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, allegedly used their special skills in blockchain technology to compromise the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain. The two brothers have pleaded not guilty and are currently free on a $250,000 bail each. The trial sought an educated Jury panel, half of which holds a master’s degree in several areas of study, including finance and medicine. U.S. District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke led the first trial. The education levels of the selected Jury reflect the complex technical nature of the case that they will have to evaluate. Prosecutors in the case will have to provide evidence showing that the two brothers studied the trading patterns of their victims before carrying out the code-based attack, which involved intercepting and rerouting pending Ethereum transactions. “Unfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for DOJ prosecutors and IRS agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme,” – Lisa Monaco , Deputy Attorney General The court filings revealed that the operation dubbed ‘the Exploit’ was meticulously planned over several months and carried out in seconds. They added that the two brothers analyzed blockchain data for several months, created shell companies, and created multiple wallets with foreign exchange accounts to conceal the proceeds. Prosecutors of the Exploit revealed that before and after the April 2023 incident, the two brothers conducted online searches for ‘how to wash crypto’, ‘fraudulent Ethereum addresses database’, and ‘money laundering statute of limitations’. They added that once the funds had been stolen, the two accused washed them through a network of transactions to hide the original wallet. Prosecutors say ‘Exploit’ case is key to safeguarding blockchain integrity Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described the alleged scheme as novel and has never been charged before. He acknowledged that, regardless of the sophisticated nature of the case, the Justice system will relentlessly pursue those who attack the financial system’s integrity. The defense attorneys argued that the prosecution mischaracterized the nature of the alleged attack. They stated that the brothers simply exploited flaws in the blockchain network. They added that the accused only exploited the predatory nature of automated trading bots in the decentralized ecosystem. The defense also argued that there were no direct interactions between the defendants and the alleged victims. Following the defense attorneys’ remarks, Judge Clarke barred them from making their claim based on the notion that the victims deserved the losses or from introducing expert testimony on the lack of crypto regulation. The move to bar the defense has created a setback for the defense’s legal strategy amid the trial, which is expected to continue into early November. If convicted, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno face up to 20 years in prison on each count. Prosecutors insist that safeguarding the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain is essential to maintaining investor confidence in decentralized ecosystems. Cryptopolitan reported last month on another sophisticated crime in which hackers hid malware inside Ethereum smart contracts. ReversingLabs’ research uncovered a malware campaign that used Ethereum smart contracts to conceal malicious software URLs. The findings revealed that the hackers used the npm packages colortoolv2 and mimelib2, which acted as downloaders.

The firm also revealed that it is working to add support for additional networks and ecosystems, aiming to provide its users with the best inventory of assets. It’s the first time Coinbase has signaled support for the native token of Binance’s ecosystem flagship asset, BNB. The firm added the digital asset and assured users that trading will commence once market-making support and sufficient technical infrastructure are established. Coinbase launches BNB perpetual futures on its platform Assets added to the roadmap today: BNB (BNB) https://t.co/lyEugQo7Cv — Coinbase Markets 🛡️ (@CoinbaseMarkets) October 15, 2025 Coinbase’s interest in BNB started on April 3, when Coinbase Advanced began supporting BNB perpetual futures. The firm argued that introducing BNB perpetual futures trading on its international platforms presents new opportunities for traders. The initiative enabled Coinbase users to access perpetual futures contracts, a type of derivative that doesn’t have an expiration date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. The listing of BNB perpetual futures on the platform enables traders to take larger positions with borrowed funds, thereby amplifying their gains and losses. Binance co-founder, Changpeng Zhao, said the introduction of BNB perpetual futures on Coinbase enhances the network’s accessibility and credibility. The initiative allowed Coinbase to expand its derivatives market and position itself as a competitor to leading exchanges like Binance, which already offer BNB futures. The initiative was launched on Coinbase International Exchange for non-U.S. users and on Coinbase Advanced for experienced traders. CZ responded to the news, stating that BNB’s growth occurs naturally, although increased trading activity on major exchanges may lead to higher liquidity. The crypto exchange is also planning to list other digital assets, including Bitcoin Hyper, Maxi Doge, PEPENODE, and Snorter Bot. Barron’s research revealed that new listings on Coinbase average 91% gains in the first five days. At the time of publication, BNB is exchanging hands at around $1,168, down nearly 4.3% in the last 24 hours. The digital asset has also dropped by more than 11% in the last 7 days, but is up 27.1% in the last four weeks. CEXs charge nearly 16% for new crypto listings The new BNB listing on Coinbase comes as Binance refuted claims on Tuesday that it profits from its token listing process. The exchange’s remark was in response to CJ Hetherington, CEO of Limitless Labs, who made the claim. Hetherington alleged on Tuesday that Binance receives a 1% airdrop on the day of listings and a further 3% airdrop six months after listings. He also revealed that the exchange requires a 1% marketing fee at its discretion and a $250,000 security deposit before any listing. Hetherington also said Binance requested 3%, which is reserved for the BNB HODLer programme. According to the announcement, the exchange also requires a $2 million BNB security deposit for spot listings. He made the remarks despite Limitless receiving backing from Coinbase Ventures as well as the Base Ecosystem Fund. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , Binance responded to the founder’s claims, stating that they’re false and discriminatory and that the exchange reserves the right to pursue legal action. The exchange also stated that it was surprised by CJ’s unauthorized disclosure of confidential communications with Binance. The firm acknowledged that CJ’s publications damaged the integrity of what the industry and community understand, arguing that he clearly understood and knew to be sensitive and confidential information. Binance assured its users that it doesn’t charge any listing fees. The firm also revealed that any cash and token security deposits are typically refundable within a 1-2 year period. However, the co-founder of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, previously stated that Binance charges a listing fee of up to 8% of the total token supply. He also revealed that the centralized exchange requires projects to purchase and stake BNB, which is equivalent to around $5 million. Hayes added that Binance requires projects to distribute 8% of their token supply to Binance users through airdrops and other activities. He also said listings on Binance cost around 16% of a token’s supply and $5 million in BNB purchases. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The approval, announced Wednesday, marks the first de novo bank to receive national authorization under Comptroller Jonathan Gould, according to the Financial Times. Erebor Bank, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, filed its application on June 11, and its approval follows a four-month regulatory review. The OCC granted preliminary conditional approval to Erebor Bank after thorough review of its application. In granting this charter, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all charter applications. https://t.co/9G7WkRRohN pic.twitter.com/tQhLqNbtM9 — OCC (@USOCC) October 15, 2025 “I am committed to a dynamic and diverse federal banking system, and our decision today is a first but important step in living up to that commitment,” Gould said. Gould’s accompanying remarks indicated a notable shift from the regulator’s previous restrictive look: the OCC “does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities.” That statement shows one of the clearest indications yet that U.S. banking regulators may be reconsidering their restrictive stance toward crypto-linked financial services, which was further exacerbated by the 2023 collapses of several crypto banks. Analysts view the OCC’s decision as a watershed moment for the industry, a sign that Washington is ready to experiment with responsible crypto banking, provided institutions can demonstrate robust compliance and risk controls. If Erebor secures full authorization, it could become a test case for how regulators manage digital asset exposure within federally chartered banks and a potential model for others seeking to bridge the gap between traditional banking and digital finance. The question now shifts to what Erebor will offer. After SVB’s Fall, Erebor Bank Steps In to Serve Tech and Crypto Businesses In the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s dramatic collapse in 2023, which sent shockwaves through the startup and venture capital ecosystem, Erebor Bank is emerging as a deliberate attempt to fill the vacuum left in the financing of America’s economy. Erebor seeks to serve clients in high-growth , high-tech sectors, including artificial intelligence, defense, manufacturing, and digital assets, as well as payment processors, venture funds, and trading firms. The bank’s charter aims to operate as a full-service national bank, offering both traditional deposit and lending services, while integrating digital asset operations under a tightly regulated framework. Peter Thiel @peterthiel joins tech billionaires in backing Erebor, a new US bank set to fill the funding gap left by Silicon Valley Bank’s 2023 collapse. #Erebor #PeterThiel https://t.co/x4NarhsPGz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 2, 2025 According to its filings, Erebor expects to hold approximately $1 million in cryptocurrency for transactional purposes, indicating limited but deliberate exposure to digital assets. Unlike the risk-heavy approach that defined some of its predecessors, Erebor’s model aims for conservatism and compliance. A source close to the company told the Financial Times that Erebor aims to be “a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk.” The fall of SVB, along with Silvergate, Signature Bank, and First Republic , had left tech startups and crypto firms struggling to find stable banking partners. This disruption forced many to seek offshore or non-traditional solutions , a gap Erebor now seeks to fill with institutional discipline and Silicon Valley know-how. Still, Erebor is not fully operational yet. The OCC’s conditional approval means the institution must complete a series of compliance, cybersecurity, and capital adequacy reviews, a process that could take several months, before receiving a final charter. How Erebor’s Approval Reflects Washington’s Crypto Policy Pivot Erebor’s approval comes amid broader regulatory momentum in Washington. President Donald Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act , a landmark bill establishing oversight rules for stablecoin issuers, while Congress continues to debate broader crypto market structure legislation and limits on a central bank digital currency (CBDC). @SECGov Chair Paul Atkins has reaffirmed support for a crypto market structure bill as the White House expects the bill to pass by year-end 2025. #Bitcoin #Marketstructure #SEC https://t.co/cBbLNtKeS9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 The new policy climate has encouraged several crypto-linked firms, including Coinbase, Circle, and Ripple, to pursue national trust or banking charters with the OCC. In May, the OCC issued updated guidance confirming that banks may buy and sell cryptocurrencies held in custody at the direction of customers, an important reversal of prior restrictions. @Coinbase has filed an application with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a National Trust Company Charter. #Coinbase #Crypto https://t.co/WruBToItQd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 4, 2025 The policy also allows institutions to outsource crypto custody and execution to third parties, provided they meet strict safety and soundness standards. The clarification marked a clear shift toward integrating crypto activities within federally regulated banks. Gould’s appointment in June reinforced that direction. The former Bitfury executive and OCC veteran was confirmed by the Senate in a narrow 50–45 vote , becoming the agency’s first permanent chief since 2020. The US Senate has confirmed former crypto exec Jonathan Gould as OCC chief in a 50–45 vote, naming him the first permanent head since 2020. #OCC #JonathanGould https://t.co/ipM7YhaG8B — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 11, 2025 His background in blockchain and digital assets has shaped a more open stance toward innovation in banking. Under his leadership, the OCC has already removed references to “reputation risk” in its internal guidance, a change viewed as reducing barriers for banks engaging in crypto-related service s. Despite the shift, some lawmakers have voiced concerns about the growing ties between politics and cryptocurrency. In August, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Ron Wyden urged Gould to investigate potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump’s personal involvement in crypto ventures, particularly a stablecoin called USD1 issued by World Liberty Financial. The senators questioned whether the OCC could maintain impartial oversight as it becomes the primary regulator for stablecoins under the GENIUS Act.

A $1.3 billion LuBian-linked wallet transfer followed the DOJ’s $15 billion crypto seizure, while a proposed $9.3 trillion 401(k) bill could drive institutional inflows.

Analysts say even a small allocation toward digital assets could channel billions into the crypto market. The proposal has fueled optimism across the industry, with investors viewing it as a pivotal step toward mainstream adoption and a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s next major price surge. Crypto and NFT Markets Rebound After $1.2B Crash The crypto market rebounded sharply after Friday’s $1.2 billion selloff, with NFTs recovering from a steep drop. According to CoinGecko, total NFT market value fell from $6.2 billion to $5 billion before stabilizing near $5.5 billion as Bitcoin and altcoins regained footing. Top Ethereum-based collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks saw mild losses, while others such as Mutant Ape Yacht Club began climbing again. Bitcoin also bounced back after briefly dipping amid market panic over Trump’s tariff comments. Investors invested $3.17 billion into cryptocurrency funds in spite of the enormous liquidations, indicating a growing confidence in digital assets. Despite heavy liquidations, crypto funds saw $3.17 billion in new inflows, signaling investor confidence in digital assets. Analysts say the swift recovery highlights resilience across NFTs and crypto, reinforcing optimism for sustained growth as market sentiment stabilizes. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Triple-Bottom Pattern Eyes $130,000 Breakout Zone Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is forming a strong triple-bottom pattern near $109,600, a key level that has triggered multiple reversals since late September. The setup signals easing selling pressure and growing accumulation, with higher lows forming along the neckline. On the two-hour chart, BTC trades below the 100-period SMMA at $116,054, aligning with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $116,108, creating a decisive resistance zone before a breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI at 43 is curving upward from oversold levels, suggesting early bullish divergence and improving momentum. A confirmed close above $114,600 would validate the triple-bottom pattern and likely accelerate buying activity. While Bitcoin remains within a descending channel, TradingView’s path projection signals a breakout toward $117,600 and $119,800 if momentum strengthens. A sustained move above $120,000 could flip market sentiment bullish, opening targets at $125,000 and $130,000. Traders may look for long setups above $114,600, with stop-losses under $109,500 and initial targets at $117,600–$119,800. As institutional inflows build and volatility compresses, Bitcoin’s current consolidation could mark the base for its next upward phase, potentially defining the start of a stronger Q4 rally.

ETH has reclaimed support above $4.5K on large aggregate purchases, indicating further price appreciation with technical momentum pointing towards $7,000 and beyond by the end of 2025. In ETFs, inflows and staking-enabled products continue to flow into the market. Over $1 billion of stablecoins flowing in daily keeps the price buoyant for now. Whales’ coordinated activity indicates institutional-level confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals. Such accumulation satisfies the anticipations for Q4, namely that Ethereum will be a focal point for market rotations. This will create opportunities for altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE to attract early-stage investors. Solana Poised for ETF-Driven Upside As Solana’s price fluctuates between $218 and $230, the ecosystem is gaining renewed interest. The upgrade to Firedancer will increase the scalability of the Solana network, which can support one million transactions per second. This should be enough to instil confidence among the institutional validator. Solana ETF Tracker: theblock Approval from the SEC for multiple Solana ETF filings and $310 million in inflows has served to renew bullish sentiment. Traders in whale are taking leveraged long positions, expecting a breakout above $250. The strong DeFi and NFT activity on Solana’s chain enhances its institutional appeal, making it an ideal platform for early development investments, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE.

According to analysts, post listing the returns may range from 75x, with some scenarios pointing to an even greater upside in Q4 2025. Conclusion Cryptocurrency investors are looking at October 2025 as a crucial time. Ethereum whales and Solana setup indicate strong institutional confidence amid possible ETF approval that can provide huge upside. Experts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s successful Hashex audit and ongoing verification on Certik as major proof of reliability, reinforcing investor trust in its presale model.

Related Reading: Why This Resistance Could Trigger Another XRP Price Crash Soon Before stabilizing around $4,100, the second-largest cryptocurrency briefly dipped below $4,000 this week, but several analysts argue the pullback places ETH in a key “buy zone” ahead of a potential push toward new highs. ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Fidelity Steps In as ETFs See Redemptions Fidelity’s reported buy spotlights a growing trend as traditional finance is steadily increasing exposure to Ethereum’s smart-contract ecosystem, staking yields, and tokenization upside. The move contrasts with the latest ETF flow picture, where spot ETH products saw about $428 million in outflows in a single day, led by $310 million from BlackRock’s fund. While redemptions weighed on price near term, primary-market creations like Fidelity’s purchase can tighten available supply and stabilize spot liquidity. Outflows and Liquidations Test Nerves Macro jitters and tariff headlines helped trigger a sharp selloff, sending ETH down 6.5% on Oct. 14 and sparking $145 million in liquidations in 24 hours, per derivatives trackers. That forced unwinding pushed price through the $4,000 handle, but technicians note ETH is retesting prior resistance-turned-support and still carving a bullish flag structure on higher time frames. Popular trader Michael van de Poppe argues ETH likely just needs a higher low to reassert momentum, eyeing a recovery toward $5,000 first and then $6,250 if buyers reclaim control. Ethereum Price Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Near term, bulls want to see an Ethereum price balance back above $4,000–$4,211, followed by a decisive break of the $5,000 psychological level to unlock the $6,250 target many chartists flag via tools like Murrey Math and measured-move projections. On the downside, traders are watching $3,626 as interim support; a daily close below $3,425 would dent the bullish structure and argue for deeper consolidation. Despite headline outflows, the Fidelity inflow highlights sticky institutional interest in Ethereum’s role across DeFi, NFTs, and real-world asset tokenization, plus the structural tailwind from staking yields.

ETH is now consolidating in a range and might decline sharply if there is a move below $3,880. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $4,000 and $4,020 levels. The price is trading below $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it trades above $4,075. Ethereum Price Dips To Support Ethereum price struggled to settle above $4,200 and corrected most gains, like Bitcoin . ETH price declined below the $4,050 and $4,000 levels. It even tested the $3,940 zone. A low was formed at $3,932 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,216 swing high to the $3,932 low. Besides, there is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $3,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,075 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,150 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,216 swing high to the $3,932 low. The first major resistance is near the $4,200 level. A clear move above the $4,200 resistance might send the price toward the $4,250 resistance. An upside break above the $4,250 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,350 resistance zone or even $4,420 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,150 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,950 level and the triangle’s trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,880 zone. A clear move below the $3,880 support might push the price toward the $3,820 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,750 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,640.

Blockchain records visible on Etherscan confirmed the flurry of minting and burning transactions, exposing a rare but dramatic “fat-finger” error in the reportedly tightly controlled world of stablecoin issuance. The transactions revealed that the firm had accidentally added six extra zeros during minting. Within minutes, Paxos destroyed the incorrectly issued $300 trillion PYUSD and re-minted the correct amount of $300m instead. Paxos( @Paxos ) accidentally minted 300T $PYUSD 7 hours ago — they added six extra zeros by mistake! The error was quickly corrected as they burned the 300T $PYUSD and properly re-minted 300M $PYUSD instead. https://t.co/RJeWtSnW9R pic.twitter.com/ktQQ88RfHw — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 16, 2025 Stablecoin Issuers Have Faced Similar Minting Mishaps Before Such mistakes are not rare in crypto. Often, token transfers sent to the wrong address cannot be reversed. However, stablecoin issuers have more control. They can step in to correct errors, such as by returning or burning tokens created by mistake. Paxos’s blunder echoes past industry slipups. In 2019, Tether mistakenly issued about $5b in USDT and later burned the overage. In May 2021, BlockFi accidentally credited users with vast amounts of Bitcoin instead of a promotional stablecoin, forcing complicated reversals. And in Dec. 2022, a DeversiFi upgrade glitch triggered a $23.7m Ethereum gas payout, which developers mostly recovered with community support. Stablecoins Tighten Grip On Crypto Ecosystem These incidents show how fragile crypto’s plumbing can be, especially when automated systems handle large-scale transactions. As of mid-October 2025, the stablecoin sector’s market cap stood near $306.18b, up about 47% year to date. The growth leans heavily on major players like Tether’s USDT (holding around 59% market share) and Circle’s USDC. PayPal USD (PYUSD), though smaller, commands attention. As of Oct. 2025, its market cap is about $2.32b, matching its token supply of 2.32b, with trading prices tightly anchored near $0.9997.

Open Interest has cratered, reflecting widespread liquidation across futures markets. With leverage drained and traders shaken out, the path forward depends on whether spot demand can fill the vacuum left by the OI collapse. The recent market volatility has presented a critical opportunity to assess the underlying health of various crypto assets. In an X post, Daan Crypto Trades, a full-time crypto trader and investor, has offered a compelling analysis of Ethereum’s high-timeframe chart, specifically focusing on Open Interest (OI), which shows exactly how much speculative excess has been washed out. Particularly, ETH got hit hard in the process. Why This Flush Could Be The Foundation For Ethereum’s Next Move According to Daan, what’s encouraging is that ETH’s Open Interest is now sitting at levels comparable to when ETH traded at $3,000. Meanwhile, the price now hovers around $4,000. For Daan, a simple rule of thumb to determine whether a healthy reset has occurred is if open interest is lower than it was previously at a specific price. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Strength – Bulls Aim Higher As ETH Eyes Potential Outperformance Typically, as price increases, Open Interest tends to rise as more capital flows into derivative markets, and vice versa. This relative comparison of OI and price is crucial because an increase or decrease in price will generally make OI trend in both directions. There are also coins used as margin, which can inflate OI figures in a rising market. Thus, the relative levels to watch out for are between OI and price, which carry more weight than the absolute numbers. In the meantime, leverage is making a comeback in the Ethereum market. As the Master of Crypto, an observer of market dynamics, has highlighted, the Open Interest on ETH has surged 8.2% within 24 hours, fueling the ongoing price move. The surge in Open Interest suggests that traders are once again opening aggressive long positions after the recent flush, a familiar pattern that often carries more risk than reward. Master of Crypto advises caution, framing this leverage-driven rally within a historical context, that approximately 75% of rallies aggressively fueled by such a rapid build-up in leverage tend to reverse, while only 25% sustain their momentum upward. The Calm Phase Before The Next Expansion The Ethereum macro trend remains upward despite the short-term move. Analyst EtherNasyonaL has emphasized that after breaking free from its long-standing downtrend, ETH is currently only retesting the demand zone and trendline, a healthy bullish move retest that is typical of a strong market structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At Risk – Momentum Fades As Bears Target Fresh Lows Ahead However, the analyst pointed out that the fluctuation on the short timeframes doesn’t define the trend, but it’s the longer timeframes that hold the true directional signal.

This milestone underscores a strategic vision to meet the accelerating demand for institutional-grade digital asset solutions, with a clear focus on scaling in the world’s most dynamic markets. “The demand for institutional-grade solutions is driving the next wave of global digital asset growth. This is no longer an industry of a few pioneers, but an ecosystem built for sophisticated businesses that require trust and security at their core,” said Sailor Zhong, Founder & CEO of ChainUp . “Our focus has always been on providing the essential infrastructure that builds trust in this industry, and the market’s overwhelming response validates that vision.” Institutional Momentum Reshaping the Market The broader digital asset landscape is entering a new growth phase, driven by regulated products, tokenized assets, and participation from traditional finance. Key indicators of this structural shift include: ETF Expansion: The global Bitcoin ETFs has surpassed US$153 billion , highlighting soaring institutional interest. This momentum is creating a powerful spillover effect into corporate treasury strategies, providing treasurers and CFOs with the confidence and validation to consider holding digital assets directly on their balance sheets. As new approvals for crypto-related exchange-traded products (ETPs) accelerate, this trend is further normalizing digital assets as a core component of modern financial portfolios. Regulatory Clarity: Landmark events – such as the passage of the GENIUS Act which provided crucial clarity to stablecoins, and new frameworks streamlining spot ETF approvals – are creating a more predictable and favorable environment for digital asset adoption in major global markets. Tokenization’s Ascent: Assets Under Management (AUM) for tokenized funds has nearly quadrupled over the past year, as institutions embrace on-chain liquidity. This signals a clear transition toward a financial system built on secure, digital rails. Market Convergence: Leading crypto exchanges are advancing toward a Universal Exchange (UEX) model that unites digital assets, tokenized securities, and traditional markets in one ecosystem. A Strategic Roadmap for a Digital-First Future With institutional adoption accelerating, ChainUp is positioned to lead the industry’s next chapter by delivering the infrastructure required for secure, compliant, and scalable digital finance. The company’s strategic vision is anchored by a multi-pillar approach: The Foundation of Trust: Institutional Custody The institutional digital asset custody market is experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. This surge in capital is driven not only by ETFs but a fundamental shift in how corporations manage their reserves. With over $113 billion in Bitcoin held in corporate treasuries, the demand for secure, professional crypto asset management is now at an all-time high. ChainUp’s zero-incident security record in the past 8 years underpins its commitment to providing the ultimate safeguard for digital assets. Leveraging advanced technologies like multi-party computation (MPC) , ChainUp’s institutional-grade custody solution serves as the essential bridge between traditional finance and the crypto economy. Driving Value: Real-World Assets (RWAs) Tokenization Tokenization of real-world assets has emerged as a key trend, with the market projected to reach $10 trillion by 2030 . ChainUp’s infrastructure directly addresses this burgeoning market by providing the secure, scalable models needed to unlock trillions in value. The company’s white-label tokenization platform is built to enable the creation, management, and secure custody of these assets, including tokenized private equity, commodities like gold, real estate, fine art, intellectual property, and more. A Regulatory Backbone: Compliance-First Infrastructure Navigating a complex and evolving regulatory landscape remains a top priority for institutional clients. ChainUp’s infrastructure is designed to meet this challenge head-on, with modular solutions that can quickly adapt to new international standards. Complemented by a suite of compliance tools and advisory services, this approach enables businesses to achieve regulatory clarity, mitigate legal risk, and conduct robust due diligence and risk assessments in an increasingly regulated environment. Real-World Utility of Crypto: Infrastructure for the Digital Economy The global stablecoin market is projected to exceed US$3.7 trillion by 2030 , establishing it as a key driver of transactional volume. ChainUp is positioned to power this growth by providing a secure infrastructure for crypto real-world utility, including next-generation payment solutions designed to seamlessly integrate digital assets into daily transactions for both businesses and consumers. A New Frontier: Global Strategic Expansion With key markets like North America and Europe at the forefront of regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, they represent a central pillar of ChainUp’s expansion. The company is committed to building a strong presence in these dynamic markets, leveraging recent regulatory progress to accelerate its delivery of secure and compliant infrastructure, a key move designed to attract a broader client base and accelerate its global scaling. Pioneering the Future of Digital Assets In conjunction with its 8-year milestone, ChainUp recently hosted “ The All-Time High (ATH) Night ” in Singapore. The exclusive event, held ahead of the globally-acclaimed TOKEN2049 conference, convened over 400 industry leaders and partners to discuss the critical infrastructure needed for mainstream digital asset adoption. Commenting on the industry’s maturation and the company’s role within it, Chung Ho, Chief Operating Officer of ChainUp , remarked, “This is an industry moving from promise to purpose. Our focus remains on empowering our clients to drive the future of digital assets by delivering the trusted, secure, and scalable solutions needed to turn their vision into value in every major market, from Asia to EMEA and U.S.” About ChainUp ChainUp, a leading global provider of digital asset solutions, empowers businesses to navigate the complexities of this evolving ecosystem.

The price was able to climb above the $2.350 and $2.40 levels to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. However, the bears are still active near the $2.550 and $2.60 levels. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.50 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2.60 level, above which the price could rise and test the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low at $2.660. A clear move above the $2.660 resistance might send the price toward the $2.750 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.780 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.820. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.40 level. The next major support is near the $2.30 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.30 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.2420. The next major support sits near the $2.220 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.40 and $2.30.

53211042,606737,1760589034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53211042.jpeg,Sam Bankman-Fried Blames Politics: Says Biden Team Targeted Him For GOP Support,https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-blames-politics-says-biden-team-targeted-him-for-gop-support/,"Sam Bankman-Fried has gone on the offensive, accusing the administration of former US President Joe Biden of singling him out after he said he shifted large donations toward Republican causes. In a post on microblogging site GETTR, he framed the move as political retaliation for his funding choices and for his plans to speak before Congress on crypto policy. Sam Bankman-Fried: Claims Of Political Targeting According to recent posts and statements attributed to him, he says he donated “tens of millions” to Republican groups and that federal actions followed soon after. He argues his arrest came weeks before a crypto bill he backed was scheduled for a vote and the night before he was due to testify to lawmakers — timing he calls suspect. Reports note he published these allegations on social platforms where he has sought to explain his side. The missing trail of internal messages has added fuel to the controversy. Based on reports, messages from former US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler ’s government phone covering parts of late 2022 and 2023 were not recoverable, which critics say leaves questions unanswered about how and when regulators decided to act. Officials have offered technical explanations, while some lawmakers have demanded more documents and clarity. Conviction And Punishment Bankman-Fried faces a heavy legal record that complicates his claims. According to federal prosecutors and court filings, he was convicted on multiple fraud and conspiracy counts and later sentenced to a 25-year prison term after a trial that traced large customer losses to his companies. Reports put customer losses in the billions and cite judicial findings about false statements and misuse of funds. Financial fallout tied to the collapse of his exchange has already rippled through politics. Based on reports, FTX debtors and bankruptcy trustees have sought to recover more than $38 million in political donations made by him and associates, arguing some gifts were funded improperly. The recovery efforts show the money flowed through a mix of PACs and dark-money groups, with a large share tied to Republican-aligned organizations. Political Reactions And What Comes Next Lawmakers and commentators have split along partisan lines in how they view his latest claims. Some Republican members of Congress have seized on the missing messages and the timing of the arrest to press for documents and answers from regulators. Other observers point back to the trial record and evidence presented in court, saying the prosecution stood on detailed financial traces and witness testimony. Bankman-Fried is serving his sentence at a federal prison in Mendota, California. He’s appealing his conviction, claiming unfair treatment and political bias. Once a billionaire leading a global exchange, FTX, he now spends his days behind bars, fighting to regain his freedom.

He made the remarks during a group interview with reporters, following renewed weakness in Japan’s currency against the US dollar. The yen reached an eight-month low of 153.27 per dollar on October 10. Analysts say the decline indicates low market expectations that the BOJ will raise its rates . Bessent declined to comment directly on the yen’s level or on Governor Kazuo Ueda’s next policy decision scheduled for October 30, but he said Ueda is “very capable.” Bessent links yen’s future to the Bank of Japan’s steady policy Bessent said the Bank of Japan was moving too slowly to fight inflation in August, but has now softened his tone, stating that the yen will naturally find a stable level on its own if the Bank of Japan continues to follow a “proper” or responsible policy path. The BOJ has maintained its main interest rate at 0.5% since January, following the end of its ultra-easy monetary policy last year. The bank adhered to this policy for over a decade to help the economy recover from weak growth and low inflation. However, the situation has now changed because prices in Japan have been rising faster than before. Most Japanese households are now struggling with higher living costs as inflation has remained above 2% for more than three years, but real wages have not kept up. Governor Ueda has stated that he wants to understand how US tariffs, slower global trade, and changes in domestic spending impact Japan’s inflation and economy. He explained that the BOJ will proceed cautiously before raising interest rates again, as he believes a sudden move could harm the fragile recovery that Japan has worked so hard to build. Both Bessent and the governor say building confidence in the market requires patience, consistency, and clear communication. The US Treasury Secretary expressed his faith in Japan’s long-term economic management when he said that the yen would “find its own level” if the BOJ follows the right path. Japan’s politics and markets make a rate hike less likely The BOJ can’t change interest rates at the moment because the state of politics in the country is unstable. The leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has recently changed, and Sanae Takaichi is now preparing to become Japan’s next Prime Minister. Her victory caused some nervousness inside the government and among investors who prefer stability and clear direction. The situation became even more complicated when the LDP’s longtime coalition partner, the Komeito Party, left the alliance. Most government decisions, including those related to economic policy, are on hold because lawmakers will vote on the next prime minister next week. The Bank of Japan is likely to raise its rates due to this unstable situation. Traders estimate about a 15% chance that the BOJ will increase interest rates compared to around 70% at the end of September. The Japanese yen currently trades at around 150.60 per dollar as of Thursday morning in Tokyo. This weakened yen will make imported goods more expensive for Japanese consumers and businesses. Japan’s Finance Minister, Katsunobu Kato, said the government has noticed “rapid moves in a weak-yen direction,” and is ready to act if things get out of hand, but he did not explain what specific steps they might take. A former executive director at the BOJ, Kazuo Momma, stated that a rate hike would become increasingly likely if the yen weakened to 155 per dollar or beyond. He explained that a weaker yen would raise the prices of goods even higher and further frustrate the citizens. For now, the BOJ is waiting for the country’s political environment to stabilize before making its next significant move.

Over $200 million of ETH had been bought in under 24 hours by major wallets and institutional treasuries. This comes after a series of intense leveraged sell-offs which temporarily drove Ethereum up to the $3,500 mark before stabilizing. With ETH consolidating around $4,300, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also drawing investor interest, being rated by analysts as one of the top presales with 100x ROI in 2025 Q4. Ethereum Whales Return to Accumulation According to blockchain data, the whale wallets have gone back to accumulating heavily after the recent price correction. BitMine Immersion Technologies affirmed that it purchased 202,000 ETH on the weekend, which had a value of approximately $834 million at an average price of $4,154 per token. The acquisition increased the overall holdings of BitMine to $3.03 million ETH, which is roughly 2.5% of the total supply of Ethereum in circulation. Tom Lee, the chairman of the company, stated that it bought 202,037 ETH to bring their total to more than $3 million, calling the post-crash period an opportune accumulation period. A significant wallet bought 7,817 ETH, or approximately $32.5 million, just hours after panic selling during the fall. A different over-the-counter desk was an additional 14,165 ETH purchased using market-making mechanisms valued at approximately $55 million. These acquisitions imply that giant buyers still perceive the present range of Ethereum as a long-term entry point. Market Stabilizes After Weekend Volatility The fall on Friday-Sunday was attributed to a combination of unwinding of leverage and new macroeconomic tensions between the United States and China. The liquidations were exceeding key exchanges, but the market has since become stable with recovery. According to CoinGecko data, Ethereum trades near $4,003, down about 3.1% in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinGecko According to analysts, the major support is at $4,000, and the major resistance is at $4,263. In case Ethereum cracks higher than that point, then it may have space to make potential move towards $4,500. Others anticipate another institutional interest when volatility has been overcome. Spot Ether ETFs reported outflows of more than $428 million on October 13, although long-term investors are piling up in the pullback. Emerging Focus on MAGACOIN FINANCE With the stabilization of Ethereum, players in the market are exploring more opportunities in the presale industry. One of the projects that are getting attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, an established and regulated presale that is run on open tokenomics. According to analysts, it can be defined as one of the finest crypto presales in 2025 because of its allocated pricing phases and increasing investment of investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE enables those who buy early to purchase tokens prior to the entry prices being listed on the exchange. Each presale stage adds value to the token in bits, which is a benefit to early entrants. The community of the project has grown in a short period on social platforms, indicating the increased awareness of the project among retail and institutional investors. According to experts, its presale structure favours long-term holders and provides equitable distribution at different stages. Market researchers predict that, in the case of the continuation of the current trends, MAGACOIN FINANCE would bring significant profits when trading becomes operational in the latter part of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned for Growth According to analyst reports, MAGACOIN FINANCE may experience up to 100x returns as the larger market moves to the altcoins. The probability of appreciation of its value after listing is due to its deflationary supply structure and minimal issuance of tokens. It is considered by many early investors to be one of the best crypto to buy ahead of the next big market surge. The presale with its growing following and roadmap has proven to be a viable option to individuals who want to gain exposure to early-stage assets. With liquidity back in the market, the steadily growing development of MAGACOIN FINANCE has maintained it on the lists of the top crypto to buy in 2025 of analysts. Conclusion Ethereum whales have reentered the market, signaling renewed confidence after recent volatility. Their large-scale purchases suggest belief in the network’s long-term strength even amid short-term uncertainty. Parallel to this, early investors are looking toward MAGACOIN FINANCE , which continues to gain momentum as a structured and transparent presale project. With steady accumulation among major ETH holders and rising demand for audited presales, analysts view MAGACOIN FINANCE as the best crypto to buy for those seeking early-stage exposure during the upcoming market cycle.

Related Reading: Why This Resistance Could Trigger Another XRP Price Crash Soon Whale and mid-tier wallets snapped up roughly 200 million ADA over 48 hours, about $140 million at recent prices, after last week’s volatility knocked the market lower. The build-up comes as the project readies the Cardano Summit in Berlin (Nov. 12–13), adding a fresh narrative tailwind into Q4. ADA's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Whales Scoop ADA as Selling Pressure Cools Analytics platforms tracking address cohorts report renewed accumulation, with 10–100million ADA and over 1 billion ADA wallets expanding balances. Similarly, network “spent coin” metrics declined by 51%, suggesting fewer coins are moving to sell and that distribution is easing. Price-wise, ADA continues to defend the $0.70–$0.80 band many traders view as pivotal for basing. A sustained hold keeps the recovery structure intact and positions the token for attempts at prior resistance. Staking Access Expands, Berlin Summit In Focus Adding fuel to the thesis, eToro launched ADA staking in the U.S., potentially opening rewards access to over 40 million users and reducing liquid supply as holders lock tokens. Beyond flows, the community is eyeing the Berlin Summit, where ecosystem teams are expected to showcase progress across Midnight, Leios, and dApp growth, events that historically boost sentiment and developer visibility. Strategists argue these catalysts, paired with bargain hunting from whales, can help stabilize spot liquidity after the broader market shake-out. Cardano Price Outlook: Levels That Matter Now Technically, Cardano rebounded from the $0.61 swing low and is attempting to reclaim short-term signals. Bulls first want a clean move through $0.73 (recent pivot / 0.236 Fib area). Above that, chart watchers flag $0.86 as a major resistance repeatedly capping rallies; a breakout there exposes $1.01 and $1.12 as subsequent targets, aligning with an ascending-channel upper bound on higher time frames. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Coming? Factors That Highlight Another Decline On the downside, $0.61 remains the must-hold support; a daily close below would risk a deeper revisit toward $0.50–$0.60 and delay any trend resumption. A decisive push through $0.73, and especially $0.86, would strengthen the case for a broader recovery leg, while failure to hold $0.61 puts ADA back in consolidation.

This equates to around 4.9% of the entire supply of the asset, which is around 121 million. BitMine Immersion Technologies has the lion’s share of the total with 51% or just over 3 million ETH, which puts it halfway toward its target of 5% of the entire supply. It has been buying the dip recently as Ether fell below $4,000 during the weekend liquidation event, and it is still buying. It looks like BitMine just bought another 104,336 ETH worth $417 million, reported Lookonchain on Thursday. DATs are one of three “supply vacuums” that were not present in previous market cycles, said analyst ‘Crypto Gucci,’ who added that 40% of all Ether was locked and illiquid. It is entering the cycle with “record institutional demand and the smallest liquid float in history,” he said before predicting that prices would “go nuclear.” The second supply vacuum is exchange-traded funds, which have scooped up 6.84 million ETH worth $27 billion, equivalent to 5.6% of the total supply. Staking is the third supply vacuum, as 35.7 million ETH remains illiquid due to the length of the exit queue. These three alone account for 48.4 million ETH, or 40% of the total supply.

DOGE is now consolidating and might decline below $0.1920. DOGE price started a fresh downside correction below $0.2050. The price is trading below the $0.240 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2025 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1880. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.20, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.2050 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.2120 and $0.2150. A high was formed at $0.2182 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1788 swing low to the $0.2182 high. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.2050 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2025 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2025 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2085 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2120 level. A close above the $0.2120 resistance might send the price toward $0.2180. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.2250. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2320. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2085 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1930 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1788 swing low to the $0.2182 high. The next major support is near the $0.1880 level. The main support sits at $0.1800. If there is a downside break below the $0.1800 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1665 level or even $0.1650 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

The Nasdaq index performed similarly to Bitcoin during the same period. In the last month, gold gained 13% while Bitcoin fell 3%. Last week, gold rose 4% while BTC fell 9%. Related News: BREAKING: Things Are Calming Down in the Exchange Wars - Coinbase Makes a Listing Push on Binance Yardeni predicts that gold could reach $5,000 in 2026 and $10,000 before the end of the current decade. Yardeni argued that a liquidity squeeze is behind Bitcoin's recent decline, with approximately $19 billion in liquidations recently occurring in futures and leveraged positions. “Some platforms have triggered automatic deleveraging for risk management. This has led to the closure of even profitable or protected positions,” he said. As prices fell rapidly in the markets, market makers reduced their activities, causing spreads to widen and selling pressure to increase. Last Friday, after President Donald Trump announced that he could impose tariffs of up to 100% on China, gold surged again, while Bitcoin fell. Yardeni concluded his assessment by saying, “Investors seeking protection from geopolitical risks are turning to gold and silver again.” *This is not investment advice.

Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden explained that the restrictions are there to prevent sudden liquidity shifts from banks to stablecoins and confirmed that a public consultation will be held later this year. Meanwhile, in Europe, Franco-German banking group ODDO BHF launched EUROD, a euro-pegged stablecoin under the EU’s MiCA regulation. With EUROD joining other recent euro-backed launches, it is clear that Europe is pushing to strengthen its role in the global stablecoin market. Stablecoin Caps Will Be Temporary Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden reassured the crypto industry that the central bank’s proposed restrictions on stablecoin holdings and transaction sizes will be temporary measures to ensure a smooth and stable transition for the financial system. At DC Fintech Week on Wednesday, Breeden explained that the limits, which were initially introduced in a 2023 discussion paper, are not meant to be permanent barriers but short-term safeguards to prevent disruption as stablecoins become integrated into the broader economy. She said that the limits were previously floated to range between £10,000 and £20,000 (about $13,400 to $26,800), and were designed to give the financial system time to adapt to the rise of stablecoins. According to Breeden, the Bank’s primary concern is that a sudden shift of funds from bank deposits into stablecoins could reduce credit availability for businesses and households, leading to instability. Sarah Breeden “Our starting point is that applying limits to a user’s holdings of a given systemic stablecoin is the best way to avoid such a precipitous reduction in the availability of credit to UK borrowers,” she said. Breeden added that once the financial system adjusts, these restrictions will be lifted, as the Bank ultimately wants to “support a role for stablecoins as part of a multi-money system. People in the Industry strongly criticized the proposed limits, and warned that such restrictions could send the wrong message about the UK’s openness to innovation and drive crypto-related businesses elsewhere. In response, Breeden said the Bank will launch a public consultation before the end of the year to gather some more feedback on the proposed limit levels and possible exemptions. Among the ideas being discussed are higher thresholds for businesses and carveouts for companies operating in the UK’s digital sandbox, a government initiative launched in 2024 to test blockchain and digital ledger technologies. Breeden also clarified that while stablecoins and tokenized deposits will likely play a bigger role in future markets, the Bank of England intends to keep its role as the sole provider of settlement for wholesale and asset market transactions to avoid unnecessary interconnections that could threaten financial stability. She called on both traditional financial institutions and crypto innovators to collaborate with the central bank in shaping a resilient and inclusive financial system for the digital age. ODDO BHF Launches Euro Stablecoin In other parts of Europe, Franco-German banking group ODDO BHF entered the digital asset market with the launch of its own euro-backed stablecoin, EUROD. This makes it one of the first traditional European banks to issue a stablecoin under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The initiative was announced on Wednesday , and positions ODDO BHF as the issuer of the token, with Flowdesk providing liquidity services and Fireblocks supplying the tokenization infrastructure. The stablecoin will be listed first on Spanish crypto exchange Bit2Me. ODDO BHF announcement Guy de Leusse, deputy chief operating officer at ODDO BHF, said the goal of the move is to provide a distinctly European alternative to the dominance of dollar-based stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. “We felt it was essential to offer a European solution denominated in euros to provide an alternative to stablecoins denominated in US dollars,” he said. USD stablecoins dominating the market (Source: CoinMarketCap ) ODDO BHF formed in 2016 through the merger of France’s ODDO bank and Germany’s BHF-BANK, and it operates across France, Germany, Switzerland, and Tunisia. It also has a long-standing presence in European finance dating back to the 19th century. The launch of EUROD is another step in the movement toward euro-pegged digital assets across the continent. Europe’s stablecoin landscape gained momentum this year after Société Générale’s introduction of the EUR CoinVertible in April, and AllUnity’s release of the regulated EURAU stablecoin in July, backed by Flow Traders, Deutsche Bank’s DWS, and Galaxy. Nine European banks also announced plans to release a joint euro-backed stablecoin by 2026. Experts suggest that while USD-backed stablecoins still account for more than 83% of the global $316 billion stablecoin market, euro-denominated alternatives are gaining attention as Europe accelerates its digital currency agenda. Bhau Kotecha, co-founder of Paxos Labs, said that European issuers will need strong partnerships and liquidity strategies to compete with their US counterparts.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-16 05:30:00

Australia was a significant outlier, with shares hitting record highs, fueled by weaker-than-expected jobs data, which increased market expectations for the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) to implement further policy easing (interest rate cuts). The overall advance in the region was limited by renewed U.S.-China trade tensions, leading investors to remain cautious. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a possible extension of Chinese import duty pauses if Beijing halts new rare-earth export controls. The U.S. is nearing completion of a trade deal with South Korea, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday, adding he expects an announcement within the next 10 days. Gold prices rose above $4,230 per ounce on Thursday, continuing its rally to a new record, driven by safe-haven demand and growing expectations of a dovish US monetary policy. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.31% to around 48,000 while the broader Topix Index added 0.8% to 3,210 on Thursday, extending gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened past 151 per dollar on Thursday, rising for the third straight session, as the path for Liberal Democratic Party leader Sanae Takaichi to become the next prime minister remains highly uncertain following the coalition breakup with the Komeito party last week. Japan’s core machinery orders—which exclude volatile sectors such as ships and electric power—fell 0.9% month-over-month to ¥8890 billion in August 2025, improving from a sharp 4.6% drop in July but missing market expectations for a 0.4% gain. Bank of Japan board member Naoki Tamura warned against premature monetary tightening, saying Japan must avoid returning to a period of stagnant prices and wages. In a speech in Osaka today, he cautioned against allowing inflation to persist beyond moderate levels. The Bank of Japan should maintain its loose monetary policy and raise interest rates only gradually amid persistent global trade uncertainties, said Deputy Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department Nada Choueiri. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.09% to 3,920, while the Shenzhen Component added 0.1% to 13,130 on Thursday, marking a second straight session of gains amid bets that Beijing would introduce new stimulus to combat deflationary pressures and the impact of higher US tariffs, and the offshore yuan Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the U.S. might extend a pause on import duties on Chinese goods beyond three months if Beijing cancels plans for strict new export controls on rare-earth elements. Investors are eyeing key Chinese data next week, including September industrial output, retail sales, Q3 GDP, and the monthly loan prime rate fixing. Meantime, China’s September CPI and PPI continued to highlight persistent deflation risks. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.60%, little changed in Thursday morning trade, hovering around 25,895 after Wednesday’s rally. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.53% to 82,978 in morning trade on Thursday, gaining for the second straight session, supported by optimism over quarterly earnings and continued foreign inflows. However, the rally was partially offset by slight losses in the tech sector, ahead of earnings reports from Infosys and Wipro, two of the country's largest IT firms. The central bank’s meeting minutes showed policymakers increasingly open to easing, with Governor Malhotra noting that the downward revision in inflation projections provides policy space to support growth. The central bank has revised its inflation forecast for 2025–26 to 2.6%, down from 3.1% in August and 3.7% in June, while raising the GDP growth forecast to 6.8% from 6.5%. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.84% to a fresh all-time high above the key 9,000 level on Thursday, lifted by gains in gold stocks amid record-high bullion prices, while investors assessed the latest jobs data. The Australian dollar weakened below $0.650 on Thursday, reversing the previous session’s gains, after a softer job report revived expectations of an RBA rate cut. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the unemployment rate rose more than expected to 4.5% , the highest in nearly four years, while employment increased by just 14,900, below forecasts for a 20,000 gain. In the U.S. on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended volatile session mostly higher despite ongoing US-China trade tensions and a lingering government shutdown. U.S. stock futures were subdued on Thursday, as traders weighed strong earnings against rising U.S.-China trade tensions: Dow +0.08% ; S&P 500 +0.02% ; Nasdaq +0.02% .

53212107,606739,1760592624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53212107.jpeg,Shiba Inu Reopens Shibarium Bridge After 1-Month Freeze,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-reopens-shibarium-bridge/,"Shiba Inu has restored BONE transfers on Shibarium’s Plasma bridge, re-enabling deposits and withdrawals between Ethereum and the layer-2 network following a security incident that forced a month-long pause. In an October 14 post, core contributor Kaal Dhairya wrote that the “Plasma Bridge is back online for BONE, following a comprehensive review and a series of security enhancements,” adding that users can now bridge BONE “with a safer, stronger, and more resilient experience.” Shiba Inu Relaunches The Shibarium Bridge The relaunch comes after Shibarium’s bridge was restricted in mid-September following a validator-key compromise that enabled a malicious exit on the PoS bridge. In a September 21 incident report, Dhairya stated that “on September 12, 2025 at 18:44 UTC, unauthorized validator signing power was used to push a malicious state/exit through the PoS bridge, withdrawing multiple assets,” prompting immediate containment measures and a broader hardening program. The team said at the time it would publish full technical details once it was safe to do so and that “bridging remains restricted during containment/hardening.” Shibarium’s team is positioning the re-opened BONE bridge as the first step in a phased restoration of services, backed by new policy-level and operational controls. The most visible change for users is a mandatory delay before withdrawals finalize: “All BONE Plasma withdrawals now include a 7-day finalization delay. This buffer gives operators and security teams time to monitor and respond to unusual activity before funds finalize—significantly improving defense without removing user access.” The post frames the delay as reinforcing Plasma’s fraud-resistance guarantees. Another control introduced at the bridge layer is proactive address blacklisting. According to the team, the new mechanism “lets us flag and block suspicious addresses at the bridge layer,” with the intent of preventing repeat abuse across the ecosystem. The Shiba Inu team also emphasized that critical code changes underwent an external review: “All critical changes were reviewed by Hexens, adding an independent layer of expert scrutiny.” The relaunch followed a validation sequence that included unit tests, end-to-end simulations, deployment on the public testnet (“ Puppynet ”), and “multi-timeframe” monitoring before production activation. The October 14 update also addresses a separate strand of the September incident involving KNINE and minor OSCAR token flows. The Shiba Inu team disclosed that the attacker “drained and sold roughly $600 worth of OSCAR tokens from the bridge but ignored the 5 ETH recovery offer for KNINE tokens,” which now remain blacklisted and unusable to the attacker. The previously announced KNINE bounty “has expired,” the team said, but it plans “one final, conditional bounty (amount TBD) for complete return of all KNINE held by attacker-controlled addresses,” stressing that partial returns will not qualify and that terms will appear only on verified channels. While only BONE is live on the Plasma bridge today, Shibarium signaled a broader roadmap. The team plans “gradual re-enablement for other tokens” and is “finalizing a fair and transparent repayment framework for affected users,” with specifics to be published once doing so would not increase risk. The post underscores a measured posture after the September compromise: “Safety first: We won’t publish specifics that could be gamed while security work is ongoing. Expect measured, verifiable updates.” Context around the month-long outage highlights the extent of remediation behind the scenes. In late September, Shibarium detailed rotations of validator signers, migrations of contract control to multi-party hardware custody, targeted contract-level protections, live monitoring and exchange coordination, and the engagement of independent security and incident-response specialists. The September 21 update also acknowledged decentralization shortcomings in validator operations and outlined a hardening plan “in progress collaboration with Hexens,” with restoration gated on third-party sign-offs and successful drills on test environments. For now, the reopening restores a critical path for validators, liquidity providers and users who rely on BONE mobility between Ethereum and Shibarium. As the post concludes, the new safeguards—including blacklisting and the 7-day challenge window—are intended to align the bridge’s user experience with the practical realities of operating a Plasma-style system under adversarial conditions: “Every new safeguard, every extra check, and yes—even the 7-day delay—reflects one core principle: protecting the community.” At press time, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token traded at $0.00001060.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|Shibarium Exploit,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 05:30:24

Its upcoming lending system, stablecoin design, and possible exchange listings have set expectations for a 500 % rally before mid-2026—putting it on shortlists for what crypto to invest in and top cryptocurrencies this cycle. Presale momentum and token Economics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4 billion tokens. It is now in Phase 6 of its presale. In Phase 6, each token is priced at $0.035. The next Phase 7 will set the price at $0.040, a 15 % increase over the current rate. So far, Mutuum has raised about $17.4 million. Of the 170 million tokens allocated in Phase 6, 68 % are sold. Combining all phases, over 17,200 holders have already joined—leading some analysts to include MUTM among the best cheap crypto to buy now. An investor who bought at $0.01 could see 6× value gain at a listing price of $0.06. Analysts expect the token to climb further, projecting a 30x (about 500 %) rally from listing to mid-2026. This trajectory has already drawn comparisons to early calls on major crypto successes. Some analysts are treating Mutuum as the next big cryptocurrency pick. In Q4 2025, Mutuum plans to launch protocol’s Version 1 on the Sepolia testnet. In that version, users will be able to lend, borrow or collateralize both ETH and USDT. It will include important components such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure the system runs smoothly and safely. That release is pivotal as it will demonstrate real use cases and help attract more users and liquidity into the platform. Dual lending design and growth engines t0 500% Mutuum’s dual lending strategy sets it apart. In the P2C pools, users deal with stable or major assets like ETH or USDT. In P2P pools, more volatile assets—such as DOGE or SHIB—can be lent or borrowed. This mix lets liquidity flow flexibly and invites more people to participate. The lending and borrowing utilities create strong real-world use cases that are likely to draw more users to the platform. In the near future, users will be able to lend, borrow, and stake their assets in dedicated pools to earn passive income and rewards. Each of these activities naturally increases the demand for MUTM, which is anticipated to significantly contribute to the token’s value appreciation—key considerations for lists of best crypto to buy now and top crypto to buy. A second growth driver is the planned decentralized stablecoin. When someone borrows it, they lock up collateral like ETH, and the stablecoin is minted. When they repay or get liquidated, the stablecoin is burned. Interest rates will adjust dynamically to keep the stablecoin close to its $1 peg. For example, a trader might lock $5,000 in ETH and borrow stablecoins while still holding their crypto exposure. This setup will anchor activity in Mutuum’s P2C and P2P markets, making borrowing and lending flow continuously. Over time, this built-in demand for the stablecoin and for MUTM itself is expected to lift token value steadily. Questions like is crypto a good investment are now taking a new focus with projects like MUTM in mind. Third, Mutuum’s price discovery system is built with strong oracles. The primary source will be Chainlink feeds for USD and native asset pricing. Backup oracles and aggregated feeds will support redundancy. DEX time-weighted average price (TWAP) will also feed into the system. With this robust framework, wrongful liquidations or price manipulations are avoided. That kind of safety will draw institutional lenders and large borrowers. As trust grows, positions will grow, fees will rise, and more people will need MUTM to interact with the protocol. The rising demand will push the token upward. Security measures Mutuum has also secured strong security measures. It is undergoing a CertiK audit, combining manual review and static analysis. The TokenScan score is 90.00 and the Skynet score is 79.00. The audit request began February 25, 2025 and was revised on May 20, 2025. In addition, Mutuum hosts a bug bounty program with a $50,000 reward pool. Critically, bugs are rewarded up to $2,000, major issues $1,000, medium $500, and low $200. This security posture will enhance confidence among large investors. Beyond fundamentals, the chance of exchange listing gives a potent selling angle. With strong presale metrics and upcoming testnet builds, MUTM is a candidate for Tier-1 or Tier-2 exchange listings in the near future. That listing would bring huge visibility and capital inflows. For those exploring what crypto to buy now and crypto to buy now, Mutuum represents a fresh option with strong structural backing. Final verdict The 24-hour leaderboard has been enhanced with a new update. Each day, the user who ranks first will earn a $500 MUTM reward, given that they complete at least one transaction within the 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC. The 500 % projection is rooted in solid architecture: dual lending paths, a native stablecoin, rigorous oracles, strong security, and listing potential. Phase 6 is already 68 % sold and the next price point is $0.040 (a 15 % jump). This is possibly one of the last chances to claim a meaningful share of MUTM at $0.035 before a major price discovery phase kicks in. For investors who want exposure to an up-and-coming token with structure, innovation, and momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to rise and appears on several best crypto to invest in shortlists among defi crypto projects.

53211317,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86494,1760593069,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Now at Phase 8 of its Rise to Dominance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-now-at-phase-8-of-its-rise-to-dominance/,"The outlook surrounding XRP continues to evolve as community figures assess the sequence of events they believe are shaping its trajectory. A recent post from crypto trader and tech enthusiast, TheXRPguy, outlined what he identifies as a structured progression toward broader market validation. His remarks focus on key developments already achieved within the XRP ecosystem and the significant milestone still pending: potential approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). The tone of his message reflects conviction that XRP is approaching a decisive stage, yet reactions within the community show that confidence is not universal. BREAKING We are now at phase 8 of #XRP rise to dominance. 1. RLUSD is released. 2. Trumps inauguration. 3. Gary offically leaves SEC. 4. XRP Strategic Reserve 5. Ripple case ends 6. Alt season 7. Ripple name big bank partnership. 8. XRP ETF approval.… — TheXRPguy (@TheXRP_guy) October 14, 2025 Completed Milestones: Foundation for Broader Recognition According to TheXRPguy, several critical conditions have already been fulfilled in XRP’s ongoing development. He points first to the release of RLUSD , Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, which entered the market with the intention of strengthening transactional utility and institutional trust. He follows this with references to external political and regulatory developments, noting the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the confirmed departure of Gary Gensler from the SEC. Some see these events in the XRP community as contributing indirectly to a more favorable regulatory climate for digital assets. Further, he highlights the establishment of what is described as an XRP strategic reserve, suggesting structured holdings designed to support liquidity and manage long-term distribution. He also cites the conclusion of Ripple’s legal case against the SEC , which delivered clarity on the status of XRP and ended a prolonged period of uncertainty. In his view, these developments set the stage for wider market confidence. The trader additionally refers to the onset of altcoin market momentum, indicating that broader market conditions are aligning with internal progress. Major Partnership and the Final Phase Among the achievements listed, the confirmation of a major financial partnership involving Ripple is emphasized as a key point. For many community observers, partnerships with established banking or financial institutions represent significant validation of XRP’s intended utility in cross-border transactions. This acknowledgment plays into the belief that institutional integration is essential before any formal financial product, such as an ETF, could be introduced. The final point identified in his sequence is the anticipated approval of an XRP ETF. This is framed as the last remaining component in what he describes as “phase eight” of XRP’s rise. The implication is that, should such an ETF be granted, it would mark a new stage of accessibility and recognition by traditional financial markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Response from the Community Despite the structured progression outlined, responses within the community reveal evident fatigue among some participants. One user replied critically, referencing repeated assurances made during previous milestones that failed to coincide with substantial market movement. Their remarks reflect a broader sentiment shared by certain long-term holders who have grown skeptical of optimistic forecasts tied to key events. With the legal and infrastructural foundations now in place, attention has shifted to whether traditional financial markets will formally acknowledge XRP through a regulated ETF product. The coming period may prove decisive in testing whether the milestones cited thus far will translate into measurable adoption and market impact. While supporters of TheXRPguy’s framework view the pending ETF decision as a coming achievement, others remain cautious in their expectations until clear results materialize.

The minister pointed out that Australia’s financial crimes watchdog, AUSTRAC, found 85% of funds from top crypto ATM users were involved in scams. Minister Burke said that though not all ATMs are at risk, there are significant problems in areas that are hard to trace. “I want AUSTRAC to have the power to restrict, or if it decides, to prohibit high-risk products. Be in no doubt, crypto ATMs are a high-risk product,” he said. Drastic Rise in Crypto ATMs Australia has experienced a drastic surge in Bitcoin ATM installations over the past few years. From just 73 machines in 2022, the number has grown 16-fold, reaching over 1,200 by August 2024. Source: CoinTimeATM “This is a product that is multiplying quickly – six years ago, there were 23 machines in operation. Three years ago, there were 200,” said Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC CEO. “When we established the Crypto Taskforce at the end of last year, there were 1,200. That number has now risen to 2,000.” A separate statement from the regulator noted that the powers would give Thomas additional options to reduce money laundering risks associated with high-risk products. “We’re still seeing an unacceptable risk of money laundering across some channels,” Thomas added. AUSTRAC Taskforce Uncovers ‘Hidden World of Scams’ The financial crimes regulator has been taking down several crypto ATMs across Australia, following the establishment of an internal crypto taskforce last year. In a statement early this month , AUSTRAC said it uncovered “a hidden world of scams and dodgy dealings,” from several kiosks. “Our intelligence shows they pose serious risks for scams and money laundering, with dozens of scam victims identified,” it said. The agency has already identified money mule activity and scams targeting older Australians and implemented minimum standards for crypto ATM providers. “The taskforce has produced incredible results in a brief time. We know there’s more we can do to protect Australians from unscrupulous operators, so we’re expanding this important work,” CEO Thomas said at the time.

Speaking at DC Fintech Week, Atkins emphasized that the commission’s top priority is crypto and tokenization. He commented, “We want to make sure that we build a strong framework to actually attract people back into the United States who may have fled, but then also be able to build a framework that makes sense for the future, so that innovation can thrive.” He quipped that the agency might even be called the “Securities and Innovation Commission.” Atkins still wants to pursue an “innovation exemption” Since stepping into the role in April, Atkins has diverged sharply from Gary Gensler’s crypto policy, which centered on enforcement actions and the belief that most tokens fell under securities law. He’s become more open to showing support for digital assets. On Wednesday, he said that distributed ledger technology is what excites him most about cryptocurrency. Atkins had revealed in June that he had asked SEC staff to draft an “innovation exemption” to expedite the rollout of on-chain offerings, stating that he intends to finalize it before the end of the year. Speaking on Wednesday, he mentioned he wanted to roll out new solutions like the “innovation exemption” and eventually create a “super app” linking all crypto-related agencies. He argued that firms shouldn’t have to register separately with each regulator. Now in its second week, the government shutdown has largely sidelined the SEC. The agency is following an emergency operations plan after Congress failed to pass funding, leaving it with a very limited staff to handle urgent issues. Under its emergency plan, the SEC currently has just a handful of employees on duty to deal with critical situations, the agency said. The commission’s enforcement actions resulted in billions of dollars in fines for crypto agencies Under Gary Gensler, the SEC took 125 enforcement actions linked to crypto from 2021 to 2024, resulting in $6.05 billion in penalties. Industry supporters and a few members of Congress complained that the agency’s policy at the time stifled technological development and, based on legal precedents dating back to 1946, was inappropriate for use against crypto. The Trump administration issued a landmark policy reversal with its January 2025 executive order on digital financial technology. After the change, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Chair Paul Atkins dismissed multiple enforcement actions against companies, including Coinbase and Ripple. The SEC also nullified Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which had, in effect, scared banks away from providing crypto custody. Yet the shift has not been controversy-free. Investigators recently found that the SEC’s information technology department had accidentally deleted nearly a year of text messages from Gensler’s phone, adding to questions about record-keeping and transparency under the Biden administration. The deleted messages were reportedly related to discussions regarding crypto enforcement matters, including the Terraform case and a high-profile financial services settlement, which has put the SEC in a bind when fulfilling its FOI obligations. Atkins has emphasized a more measured approach , promising to give businesses notice of technical violations rather than immediately resorting to aggressive enforcement. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""b8ee08b1-dfd9-4f0d-982f-5576bd8f75c3"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-2"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> The head of the top Wall Street watchdog, who was appointed this year as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission by US President Donald Trump, recently stated in Paris that the agency aims to remove crooks from the financial markets and protect investors. “If you lie, cheat or steal your investors and steal their money like [disgraced former financier] Bernie Madoff, we’ll leave you naked, homeless, and without wheels,” Atkins said, quoting a sign posted in the office of his first SEC boss, Richard Breeden.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Breaks 13-Year Silence, Moves $33 Million To Exchange A decade-long chart was shared that traces moves from 2013 through 2025, and one commentator went as far as to call the next leg a potential “Ethereum killer.” That claim has reignited debate across crypto circles. Technical Patterns Signal Repeats Crypto analyst Peter Brandt pointed to a repeating set of shapes on XRP’s chart — symmetrical triangles and long consolidations that ended in sharp rallies. The timeline covers a decade and breaks down into three phases. The first run, from 2013 to 2017, ended with an outsized surge that exceeded 70,000%. The second phase, roughly 2018 to 2024, produced a descending formation and then a dramatic breakout near the end of 2024, when price gains were about 600%. Now, price is being held inside a narrow range after a recent rejection at $3.66, with traders watching a band roughly between $2.60 and $2.80 for signs of a move. Community Voice Meets Hard Math Another crypto expert, Alex Cobb, comments that the next leg could topple Ethereum captured social media attention. “The next leg up on XRP will be the Ethereum killer,” he said. The next leg up on XRP will be the Ethereum killer https://t.co/m56o7FuOpo — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 13, 2025 But market data shows a big gap. XRP’s market cap sits near $147 billion while Ethereum’s is about $480 billion. At a current XRP price of $2.49, a rise of over 230% would be needed for XRP to cross $8 and overtake Ethereum, assuming ETH stays flat. That path is made steeper if Ether rallies again; in August it hit an all-time high of $4,950 after climbing 239% from April lows of $1,385. Market Cap Gap Remains Large History gives headlines, yet it is not proof that patterns will repeat. XRP did briefly become the second-largest cryptocurrency in 2018, which feeds today’s hopes. Still, some technical analysts have publicly softened earlier bullish calls, urging caution and recommending investors hold both tokens rather than expect a flip. Market behavior is shaped by many moving parts — money flows, macro events, and network updates — none of which are guaranteed to follow past scripts.

Sentiment And Structure Social momentum can push price quickly, and chart breaks can trigger big moves when liquidity is thin. At the same time, market caps are driven by supply and demand across many exchanges and large holders. A pattern that looks clean on a long-term chart may be paused by regulatory headlines, changing investor appetite, or simply by a stronger rally in the rival asset.

The analyst noted that a detailed chart will follow to illustrate this projection and stated that they are personally aligning with the bullish side of the probabilities, favoring the scenario that leads to a major price breakout. This analysis frames the current market situation as one defined by probabilities rather than certainties. This signals that while bullish momentum may dominate, traders should be cautious of possible downside movements. The statement suggests a balanced perspective, positioning optimism within a structured risk framework. #XRP – The ODDs 57% Vs 43%: The ODDs Are 57% To Major New ATH or 43% We are Going Much lower and you can Again buy #XRP below $1: I am Preparing A Chart and I am playing My Odds with the 57% To Major New ATH. Be Prepared for my post: pic.twitter.com/DhyJXOyC7l — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 14, 2025 Reactions from the XRP Community Following Egrag’s post, several community members weighed in with their views on the factors that could shape XRP’s direction. One user pointed to upcoming developments such as potential ETF approvals , the anticipated passage of a Clarity Act, and the possible removal of the cap on F Assets—changes that could enable staking and further token lock-up. They argued that if these events materialize, it would be difficult for XRP’s price to fall and remain suppressed, given the number of bullish developments expected to unfold. Another user expressed similar optimism, echoing the view that regulatory clarity and broader utility could position XRP for sustained upward momentum. In contrast, some questioned the likelihood of the asset ever dropping below $1 again, emphasizing the impact of recent legal victories, partnerships, and discussions around institutional adoption. One participant expressed frustration at the notion that investors might need to wait years for new highs despite multiple indicators of progress within the ecosystem.

Rather than declaring a definitive result, it weighs potential market scenarios based on technical and broader market dynamics. The 57% probability of a new all-time high underscores a cautiously optimistic stance, suggesting that the market could be approaching a turning point, while still acknowledging the 43% risk of retracement as a realistic scenario. The mention of upcoming policy actions and possible ETF approvals by community members reflects the growing consensus that regulatory clarity could serve as a significant market catalyst. Traders appear to be closely monitoring these external developments alongside technical indicators as they evaluate positioning and timing. Egrag Crypto’s assessment highlights the current uncertainty within the digital asset market, while maintaining a clear leaning toward a bullish outcome for XRP.
