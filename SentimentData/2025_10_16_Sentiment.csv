The meme coin has slumped to multi-month lows as market participants sold the news on US-China trade war escalations. Now, both mid-sized and large investors are stepping in. Santiment data shows wallets holding 100,000 to 10 million PEPE have increased their balances to 610.21 billion tokens. PEPE supply distribution. Source: Santiment. Similarly, large holders with 10 million to 1 billion PEPE have stopped offloading, stabilizing their positions at 15.42 trillion tokens. This end to de-risking by whales, coupled with continued retail participation, sets a solid foundation for a potential market reversal. Pepe Price Prediction: Is This the Last Bottom Before $1? These move to increase exposure to Pepe comes as it affirms the lower boundary of a year-long symmetrical triangle, now nearing its apex. PEPE / USDT 1-day chart, 1-year symmetrical triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. The support zone stretches back well beyond the pattern itself, acting as a proven launchpad since mid-2024. Now, with momentum indicators turning up, another bounce could be on the horizon. The RSI has rebounded from oversold territory above 30, while the MACD histogram is edging closer to the signal line, both hinting at the early stages of a potential bullish push. The key threshold for a breakout sits around the historic demand zone at $0.000009, which must hold as support for confirmation. Fully realized, the pattern targets past highs into new Pepe price discovery in a potential 600% move to $0.00005. However, with continued U.S. interest rate cuts stimulating risk appetite and growing speculation around spot PEPE ETFs under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, fresh inflows could fuel a 1,200% rally to $0.0001. While this marks the first step towards the $1 milestone, it remains distant. Such a jump would likely require long-term institutional participation and deep TradFi integration to meet the necessary demand. PepeNode: You Don’t Need the Perfect Entry to Net Gains Meme coins often reward those who time their entries perfectly, but that same volatility makes them unpredictable. What if you could mine them instead of betting everything on catching the right dip? With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No expensive setups, no tech barriers. Just log in, acquire nodes, stack rigs, and start earning rewards across top-performing meme coins. The stats look solid too. The presale has already exceeded $1.8 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 700% APY. And with 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs burned, scarcity is built directly into the system, helping support long-term value growth. The timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins, making PepeNode’s rewards and model even stronger as momentum builds across the sector.

Historically, “Uptober” has often marked the beginning of prolonged bull markets. Last Monday, Bitcoin hit a new ATH, sparking widespread optimism across the crypto space. That momentum quickly derailed when Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports on Friday. The news triggered some of the sharpest intraday declines ever recorded in the market. Despite the volatility, many veteran traders view the correction as a necessary reset. Historically, crypto markets tend to crash hard before major bull cycles. This event, they argue, served as a healthy purge that removed excessive leverage and mercurial holders. XRP ($XRP): Perplexity Anticipates a Run Toward $20 Perplexity’s AI-driven analysis suggests that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb to between $10 and $15 before the end of the year, an increase of four-to sixfold from its current price of $2.50. Source: Perplexity AI Ripple, the company behind XRP, secured a landmark legal victory this year after a five-year battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The win pushed XRP to $3.65 on July 18, marking its first all-time high since 2017. Furthermore, over the past 12 months, XRP’s price appreciated 360%, making it the best-performing large-cap cryptocurrency not pegged to a fiat currency. During the same period, Bitcoin rose 72%, while Ethereum appreciated 57%, meaning XRP outperformed them fivefold and sevenfold, respectively. Technical charts reveal three distinct bullish flag patterns throughout 2025, including two during the summer months, signals that often precede strong upward movements. Analysts expect that October’s historically bullish seasonality, combined with potential ETF approvals, promised U.S. regulation, and new Ripple partnerships, could propel XRP toward the $15 level. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Perplexity AI: Dogecoin Could Surpass the Doge Army’s $1 Goal Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted satire, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a major cryptocurrency, boasting a $30.6 billion market capitalization within the $66 billion meme coin sector. Currently trading around $0.20 with a relative strength index (RSI) near 40 and trending upward, Dogecoin has risen 1.2% in 24 hours despite the rest of the meme coin market collectively dipping 5.5% True to its meme coin nature, Dogecoin often amplifies daily crypto market trends. But as we’re seeing today, it has a second nature as a multibillion-dollar blue chip, which means it’s enjoying the market’s 2% rise today. Throughout summer 2025, several bullish formations appeared in its chart, setting the stage for a possible breakout. Perplexity predicts that DOGE could finish the year between $0.75 and $1.36, with the upper limit representing an ambitious stretch target. A more cautious estimate places it at $0.33. Given its previous all-time high of $0.7316 during the 2021 bull run, surpassing the Doge Army’s long-standing $1 objective would be a major psychological victory. Additionally, adoption continues: Tesla accepts Dogecoin for merchandise, and payment platforms such as PayPal and Revolut now support DOGE transactions. Pepe ($PEPE): Perplexity Predicts the Meme Coin Could Reclaim Its All-Time High Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) now commands a $3.1 billion market cap, making it the largest non-dog-themed meme token. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic, Pepe’s internet culture roots have made it a viral phenomenon in and beyond the crypto world. Despite strong competition, Pepe maintains deep liquidity and an active community, occasionally boosted by subtle, bullish references from Elon Musk on his X profile. Currently trading near $0.0000075, Pepe sits about 73% below its December 2024 peak of $0.00002803. Perplexity’s optimistic outlook suggests Pepe could retest its previous ATH, potentially quadrupling in value if it breaks key resistance around $0.000018. In a wildly speculative scenario, Perplexity targets $0.0024, a 32,000% increase. This is simply not possible given Pepe’s huge market cap, but a run to $0.0001 is a good stretch target in a bull run. Missed DOGE? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Challenger Fueled by Degen Energy and Community Hype A new Dogecoin rival, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , just hit the presale market, already raising $3.6 million in early funding as investors FOMO in. After watching Dogecoin’s success from the sidelines, his distant cousin Maxi Doge is now claiming his own spotlight, and reflecting it on the pump-loving maximalism of crypto’s degen community. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI is faster, cheaper, and more environmentally sound than Dogecoin. It focuses on community engagement through Telegram and Discord groups, trading competitions, and upcoming brand partnerships. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” a reserve dedicated to marketing initiatives and strategic collaborations. Staking is already live, offering yields of up to 84% APY, though returns fluctuate as participation increases. The presale currently prices tokens at $0.000263, with incremental increases tied to funding milestones. Investors can purchase using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Although DOGE’s trajectory has flipped bearish, short-term holders are currently capitalizing on the pullback, as they go on a massive buying spree. A Massive Dogecoin Buying Spree Ongoing In light of waning action in the price of Dogecoin, short-term investors are showcasing their presence once again in the market. Despite DOGE’s price experiencing a pullback, on-chain data reveals that these investors appear unfazed by the drop; instead, they view it as an ideal opportunity to increase their holdings. As reported by Joao Wedson, a market expert and founder of Alphractal, Dogecoin is still in its early stages of development, and short-term holders are accumulating. This steady accumulation reflects growing confidence in the meme coin’s long-term resilience. Such persistent conviction could pave the way for a bullish recovery after the broader market sentiment stabilizes. According to the Hodl Waves chart, short-term holders are amassing more DOGE every day, which shows a supply increase of up to 6 months. Historically, this crucial pattern has driven prices higher for Dogecoin, Bitcoin , and other coins. The major reason for prices moving higher is due to the fact that new speculative capital entering the market raises the Realized Cap. In the meantime, the MVRV Z-Score has not yet displayed the same level of intense ecstasy as previous cycles or 2021. Therefore, it shows that the leading meme coin still has room for more price growth before the cycle comes to an end or reaches its top. DOGE’s Top For This Cycle Not In? Wedson has also shared insights on whether DOGE has reached its top for this current cycle. In December 2024, Wedson highlighted that DOGE reached its all-time high for the current cycle exactly at the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) Alpha, a key metric for determining cycle bottoms and tops. However, data from the Reserve Risk Indicator implies that DOGE’s top in 2024 was fragile and lacked robust on-chain interest. Wedson considers the reading from this key metric as it has accurately predicted every Dogecoin’s top in the past 9 years. While DOGE keeps facing bearish pressure, Wedson claims that monitoring holders’ actions daily is important to navigate the market direction. His statement is fueled by the fact that steady accumulation may suggest a potential rise in price in the near future . Related Reading: House Of Doge Reveals Why Institutions Are Now Closely Watching Dogecoin Bitcoinsensus has forecasted that DOGE could soon rise beyond the $1 price mark as the macro picture remains bullish. Despite the recent market volatility, DOGE is holding strong on high time frames. Presently, the price is positioned above the support line of a rising channel. Should the meme coin surge to the upper line of the channel alongside a steady bullish overall trend, it is likely to surpass the $1 level and head towards $1.40.",Dogecoin|Alphractal|Bitcoinsensus|Cumulative Value Days Destroyed|CVDD Alpha|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Joao Wedson|MVRV Z-Score|Realized Cap|Reserve Risk Indicator|Rising Channel,EN,0,0,DOGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-15 22:30:03

The announcement came during a High Court hearing in London on Wednesday, where the Director of Public Prosecutions informed victims’ lawyers about the possibility of establishing such a scheme, though specific details remain undisclosed. At the center of the dispute are 61,000 Bitcoin, worth $6.7 billion, seized by police in 2018 from devices found at a mansion in Hampstead, north London, now representing one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in UK history. The case has pitted British authorities against approximately 130,000 Chinese investors who lost money in the fraud and contend the UK state should not benefit from their losses. Zhimin Qian, left, and Seng Hok Ling, right | Source: FT The Fraud and Seizure Zhimin Qian, 47, also known as Yadi Zhang, masterminded an investment fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded victims of 43 billion yuan ($6 billion). She fled China after converting much of the investors’ cash into Bitcoin and settled in the UK under a false identity. Qian and her Malaysian associate Seng Hok Ling, 47, pleaded guilty to money laundering charges last month at Southwark Crown Court in London. Both are scheduled for sentencing in November. Bitcoin’s value has surged dramatically since the 2018 seizure, climbing from approximately $1.8 billion at the time to its current valuation of roughly $7.2 billion. UK authorities recently obtained access to additional cryptocurrency assets worth about £67 million after Qian disclosed access codes and passwords for a ledger and two cryptocurrency wallets . “The ledger had been found in a purpose-made concealed pocket within a pair of jogging bottoms which [Zhang] was wearing at the time of her arrest,” according to written submissions by Martin Evans KC, counsel for the Crown Prosecution Service. Compensation Proposal and Victim Response Evans told the court that the proposed compensation scheme would provide “adequate protection” for victims. The CPS stated it had maintained throughout legal proceedings that it intended to seek a civil recovery order to compensate victims for their lost investment, insofar as they have not otherwise been compensated. The agency said it would consider how all victims could be compensated, not just those participating in the UK legal proceedings. William Glover, director at law firm Fieldfisher representing a group of victims, said in a statement following the hearing that “the DPP has effectively accepted responsibility to create a form of compensation scheme for those who may be unable to seek redress through the existing statutory provisions.” However, lawyers for the victims face serious challenges in proving direct links between their clients’ investments and the confiscated coins. Jack Ding, assistant managing partner at Duan & Duan, which represents around 10,000 victims, noted that “some materials lack sufficient information to establish a clear connection.” Legal experts warn that victims are unlikely to recover Bitcoin’s appreciated value, as courts typically focus on returning principal amounts and reasonable interest rather than speculative gains. Treasury Implications and Market Concerns The Bitcoin spoils have drawn attention from UK Treasury officials, with some privately questioning whether the assets could help Chancellor Rachel Reeves address the country’s fiscal gap estimated at up to £30 billion by 2029. However, other government officials have cautioned that the haul is likely subject to protracted legal battles extending potentially into 2027. The Treasury has been advised it cannot include the seized assets in its fiscal calculations, as the Office for Budget Responsibility does not account for asset seizures in its forecasts. Meanwhile, authorities face the practical challenge of liquidating such a large Bitcoin position without triggering major market disruption . The UK government is attempting to retain over 61,000 Bitcoin that was seized from a Chinese national convicted in a massive investment fraud case. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/L7LPgA3fCW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 The case has sparked debate about cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement in cross-border fraud cases, with implications for how governments handle seized digital assets. A civil recovery case filed in September 2024 will determine the final distribution of assets, with proceedings scheduled to continue through January 2026. The outcome is expected to establish precedents for international cooperation in cryptocurrency-related financial crime cases and may influence how other jurisdictions approach similar seizures. The coordination difficulties are compounded by the fact that many victims have limited experience with digital finance, making documentation and claim verification particularly challenging.

The San Francisco-based AI startup is currently enjoying a rapid adoption of its products by enterprise customers, fuelling the ambitious revenue projections, as per sources cited by Reuters. Apart from strong AI demand, the projections are also reflective of the growing investor confidence and growth in the generative AI sector, even as spending especially in infrastructure buildout comes under scrutiny. Anthropic eyes rapid expansion supported by enterprise customers Anthropic is currently on course to meet its internal goal of $9 billion annual revenue run rate by end of this year, according to the two sources who requested to remain anonymous to discuss private financial matters. The sources further revealed that for this year, the company has set a base target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion, with a best case reaching as much as $26 billion. While Anthropic declined to comment of the projections, the company confirmed to Reuters that its current annual revenue run rate is approaching $7 billion this month, a significant increase from the $5 billion it reported in August. Anthropic, which is also a top rival for OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, was recently valued at $183 billion after raising $13 billion in a series F funding round led by ICONIQ. The AI startup on Wednesday launched a new version of its cheapest AI model, Haiku as part of a broader effort to appeal to companies that are looking for capable AI systems that are cheaper than its more advanced models. The latest model – Haiku 4.5 reportedly sells for about one third the price of Sonnet 4, one of its medium-sized models. Anthropic’s expansion is being spurred by a widespread uptake of its enterprise products. Recently professional services giant Deloitte inked an agreement to deploy Anthropic’s AI assistant Claude, to its more than 470,000 employees across the globe. The deal marked the largest enterprise deployment of the AI assistant to date, deepening a relationship the two firms first established in 2024. Anthropic currently serves more than 300,000 businesses and enterprise customers , contributing about 80% of its total revenue. Its models like Claude family of large language models, are sold via application programming interfaces (APIs). A notably successful tool is Claude Code, a code generation assistant, achieved an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $1 billion since its launch earlier this year, according to one of the sources. Its ambitious growth forecasts positions it as a strong competitor to OpenAI, which announced in August that it had surpassed $13 billion in annualized revenue and is aiming to exceeding $20 billion by end of this year driven by ChatGPT growth. The chatbot has over 800 million active users. Anthropic has been expanding its sales to governments and growing outside the US. The company revealed in August that it would offer its Claude to the US government for $1. Anthropic is also targeting to open its first office in Bengaluru in India next year, its second largest market after the US and aims to triple its international workforce. It is also aiming to expand its applied AI team fivefold this year to meet rising demand for AI products and services. Get seen where it counts.

Requires reclaim of $43.80 EMA cluster and continued fee generation leadership. Extended Consolidation (35% Probability) Breakdown below $38.11 could result in $35 – $40 consolidation, allowing infrastructure development while testing structural support before catalyst-driven recovery. Deeper Correction (20% Probability) Failure at $38.11 could trigger selling toward $27 – $30 , representing 23 – 31% downside. Recovery depends on protocol adoption metrics and major support hold.

Next Price Target: $35-$37 Within 30 Days, $47-$52 Within 90 Days Immediate trajectory requires hold above $38.11 to prevent breakdown toward $35 – $37 . From there, HIP-3 scaling and fee generation could push recovery toward $47 , with Polymarket expansion driving toward $52 + mid-October resistance reclaim.

Investors believe in its ability to pay up to 80x ROI when it lists on major exchanges later this year. Having verified audits and an Ethereum-based ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in high demand among retail and institutional investors preparing to make the next big presale success story of the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Investor Confidence Unlike normal presales that are based on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining the confidence of investors through transparency and independent verification. The project passed audits by Hashex and CertiK , which are most reputable blockchain security firms. Both audits attested that the smart contract does not have vulnerabilities or backdoors , ensuring all transactions and token minting are completely transparent on-chain. This kind of verification is not common among early-stage crypto projects. According to analysts, such degree of due diligence makes MAGACOIN FINANCE superior to its rivals in terms of dependability and long-term growth potential. The design of the presale also involves an anti-whale system, which denies a small number of investors the ability to control the supply of tokens and ensure a fair launching process. Moreover, the organized roadmap of the project and regular updates by the development team has helped in boosting investor confidence. All milestones have been implemented in a timely manner. Roadmap and Utility Ahead of Exchange Launch The exchange listing of the project expected in Q4 2025, is one of the most anticipated events by investors. Furthermore, market analysts believe that the listing will lead to a sharp price increase, as it has been with other high-performing presales in their early years. The projected 80x ROI is due to existing demand factors and presale velocity which are still above average. MAGACOIN FINANCE is also characterized as a utility-based approach. The token will enable a decentralized ecosystem with staking and liquidity incentives to reward holders. Moreover, the platform will incorporate live analytics to track the performance of tokens, which will serve as transparency to traders and long term investors. What Sets MAGACOIN FINANCE Apart Although numerous new tokens are introduced every day, only a few of them integrate audit-backed security, real-time transparency and systematic growth like MAGACOIN FINANCE . Its Ethereum foundation enables it to take advantage of security and scalability of the network, being compatible with major DeFi protocols. The other important distinguishing factor is the community-based approach which might lead to 80x ROI . MAGACOIN FINANCE has an excellent communication channel through social platforms where investors are updated on progress of the presale, exchange partnerships and roadmap implementation. Furthermore, its crypto presale model with distinct funding phases, has enabled investors to participate with ease, knowing their targets and allocation limits at each stage. This commitment to legitimacy by the project has also attracted the attention of influencers and analysts who rank it among the few 2025 presales that have both transparency and realistic growth expectations. Its performance potential and credibility is what helps MAGACOIN FINANCE attract early adopters prior to the start of listings. Conclusion Having already raised more than $16 million and boasting of audit-backed security, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already demonstrated legitimacy before its major exchange launch . Its well-organized roadmap and clear token utility, makes it one of the best-performing presales in 2025. With investor anticipation ahead of the listing stage MAGACOIN FINANCE is a safe project that will offer 80x ROI once listed on major exchanges.

However, according to prominent market analyst Egrag Crypto, there’s a critical signal to watch for that could determine whether the cryptocurrency’s bullish narrative remains intact or not. The expert’s analysis, shared on X social media, highlights that the behaviour of XRP’s 3-day candles could soon decide the direction of its next major move. XRP Price Integrity Hinges On 3-Day Candle Closes Below $2 In his post on X, Egrag Crypto explains the “measured move breakdown” for XRP, identifying a key technical formation in the form of a descending triangle that, based on its structure, points to a potential move toward $2.14. The accompanying chart shows XRP hovering between $2.40 and $2.60, with multiple retests of the same price levels over the past few months. Despite the brief wick to the downside, Egrag Crypto suggests that the structure continues to indicate consolidation within the range. Related Reading: Here’s How High The XRP Price Would Be With The Market Cap Of Bitcoin The analyst reiterates that $2.65 remains a critical price target for XRP. If the cryptocurrency breaks and sustains above it, he predicts that it could regain upward momentum, potentially paving the way for renewed bullish sentiment. However, failure to hold current levels around $2.5 might expose XRP to deeper retracements, particularly if 3-day candles start closing below the $2.00 to $1.91 range. Egrag Crypto warns that this specific candle behaviour is concerning, as it could signal a structural breakdown of XRP’s market cycle. It could also invalidate his bullish thesis, suggesting that the recent peak near $3.65 may have been the cycle top. Additionally, the analyst’s chart shows XRP’s price action hovering above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), serving as a long-term support level. Should XRP maintain its position above this moving average, Egrag Crypto asserts that the cryptocurrency’s bullish setup remains valid. He noted that the next 60 to 90 days are expected to be crucial, as XRP’s reaction around the levels mentioned above could define the trajectory of the rest of the year. XRP Faces 57% Chance Of Breaking To A New ATH In a separate analysis, Egrag Crypto introduced a 57% to 43% probability model, sharing his broader perspective on XRP’s potential price direction in the short term. He stated that there is a 57% probability that XRP could break into a new all-time high in the coming months. He also sees a 43% chance that the cryptocurrency could decline significantly, offering traders another opportunity to accumulate it at a price below $1. Related Reading: Market Strategist: What You Should Expect For The XRP Next Leg While the probabilities of XRP’s near-term price favor a more bullish outcome, the bearish case remains plausible given the lingering macroeconomic uncertainty and overall crypto market volatility. Egrag Crypto notes that he is personally positioning himself toward the bullish scenario, aligning his expectations with the 57% chance of a major price breakout.

The OG crypto that investors once treated as “digital gold” slumped as over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out within 24 hours, the largest single-day liquidation in history of the market. The crash was so huge it dragged Bitcoin from about $125,000 all the way to $102,000 in matter of hours, exposing how closely Satoshi’s dream still moves with risky assets instead of acting as a shield against them. For most of this year, Bitcoin was thriving on a new narrative. Exchange‑traded funds were attracting billions, and Wall Street giants were pouring in. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had grown to $91 billion in assets, trailing the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fund’s $136 billion, a symbolic race that investors said would prove whether crypto actually could rival gold as a store of value. That race is now over for the moment. Gold has reclaimed its dominance while Bitcoin’s safe‑haven credentials look weaker than ever. Gold rallies after Trump’s China tariff warning President Donald Trump’s new tariff threat against China sent investors scrambling for cover. Gold surged past $4,200 an ounce today, its highest level ever recorded, while Bitcoin fell in tandem with equities and oil. The selloff showed again that the token’s price still depends heavily on risk appetite and leverage rather than fear or capital preservation. “I have never considered Bitcoin a safe haven. I have always believed it to be a speculative risk asset,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. Gold’s centuries‑long reputation as a store of value remains intact. I mean, GLD stands above $130 billion in assets, IBIT hovers near $91 billion, and investors are again turning to bullion when volatility spikes. Even when volatility is factored in, gold is beating Bitcoin. The Sharpe ratio, which tracks risk‑adjusted returns, shows gold at 3 as of October 14, its highest in a year. Bitcoin has dropped to 1.91, down from 3.68 in January. Gold’s gains are steadier, while Bitcoin’s are fueled by momentum that vanishes once markets panic. Analysts call gold the new Bitcoin amid liquidity crunch Market veteran Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research, told clients on Wednesday that “Gold is the new Bitcoin.” He wrote that investors now view gold as “physical Bitcoin,” a more reliable hedge against rising geopolitical tension. Yardeni pointed out that while both assets posted strong returns this year, gold leads by a wide margin, jumping 60 percent in 2025 compared with Bitcoin’s 20 percent rise. Gold’s strength over the last month is striking, up 13 percent, while Bitcoin fell 3 percent. Over the past week alone, gold gained 4 percent as Bitcoin plunged 9 percent and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1 percent, a reminder that the token continues to trade like a tech stock rather than a hedge. Yardeni expects gold to hit $5,000 in 2026 and possibly $10,000 by the end of the decade. Yardeni blamed Bitcoin’s slide on liquidity pressure. He said exchanges triggered auto‑deleveraging to limit damage as markets collapsed, forcing even profitable or hedged traders to close positions to protect balance sheets. Market makers stepped back, spreads widened, and there were no buyers strong enough to absorb the avalanche of sell orders. Meanwhile, gold’s rally was helped by Trump’s tariff threats, as traders sought protection from policy shocks and global instability. Yardeni said, “Investors seeking protection from mounting geopolitical risks have been heading for the hills to mine for gold as well as for silver.” Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that institutional participation through ETFs proves the asset’s maturity and that the crash is temporary. Critics counter that as long as Bitcoin behaves like a high‑beta stock, its dream of becoming a hedge remains fantasy. The numbers leave little doubt. Gold funds continue to draw steady inflows as part of what traders call the “debasement trade,” while Bitcoin’s momentum has cooled. The token may still be the poster child of speculative finance, but for investors looking for safety in Trump’s world of tariffs, inflation worries, and geopolitical friction, gold is back in charge.

Here’s What $429M in ETF Outflows Really Means,https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-panic-pullback-or-bullish-setup-heres-what-429m-in-etf-outflows-really-means/,"Investors pulled nearly $430 million from Ethereum ETFs on Monday after Friday’s sharp sell-off, but analysts still favor a bullish Ethereum price prediction . According to Farside Investors , ETH ETFs saw eight straight days of net inflows before the crash, drawing in nearly $2 billion in fresh capital. This puts the recent outflow into perspective, suggesting that most investors aren’t shaken by the dip to $3,500 . Analyst Dean Chen from Bitnunix said that only if outflows continue for several sessions would it signal broader market fear. For now, the data suggests confidence in Ethereum remains strong despite short-term volatility. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Could Rise by 125% If It Breaks Out of Consolidation Ethereum is showing signs of strength as it enters a clear consolidation phase between $3,900 and $4,700 , holding this range for nearly three months. This type of setup has often preceded major breakouts — and ETH has done it before. The last time Ethereum traded sideways like this, it exploded 125% , climbing from $2,150 to $4,750 in just a matter of weeks. A similar breakout now could push the price beyond $8,000 , setting the stage for one of the biggest rallies of the year. However, momentum indicators haven’t confirmed the move just yet. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) still needs to break above the 14-day moving average to flash a clear buy signal, and $4,800 remains a key level to beat. For now, the signal isn’t confirmed. The RSI still needs to push above its 14-day moving average, and price must break through $4,800 to open the floodgates. Still, bullish sentiment remains strong after last week’s crash, and momentum is building fast. Presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are already seeing a surge in demand and with confidence returning to the market, early buyers could be positioned for massive upside. Bitcoin Hyper Nears $23M Raised to Launch The First-Ever Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is breaking new ground as the first true Layer-2 for Bitcoin , finally unlocking the full potential of the most popular blockchain. It cuts fees, adds smart contract functionality, and boosts transaction speed all by integrating the power and performance of Solana . For the first time, Bitcoin can do what Ethereum and Solana already offer , and early investors are taking notice. The Hyper Bridge is the gateway to this side chain. This solution will safely receive and store BTC tokens in their native blockchain and automatically mint the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2 with near-instant finality.

Buyers stepped in aggressively around the $2 level , showing confidence despite the market shakeout. In the last 24 hours, XRP has climbed 1.6% to $2.50, with trading volumes holding strong at 4% of its total circulating market cap — a sign that momentum may be shifting back in the bulls’ favor. Meanwhile, ETF assets held steady despite the downturn. The recently-launched REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) is still managing over $90 million worth of the token, which is pretty much what the fund had last week. It appears that diamond-handed XRP holders took advantage of last week’s decline to scoop up the token at a much lower price, meaning that this isolated Binance transfer is not necessarily indicative of an overall shift in market sentiment. XRP Price Prediction: Trend Line Support Bounce and Big Volumes Favor Bullish Outlook The daily chart shows that XRP bounced off a key trend line as it touched the $2 level. Above-average volumes reflect the technical relevance of this level and favor a bullish XRP price prediction for the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also jumped off oversold levels as the price climbed to $2.5. However, the token is still trading below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Moving forward, a bullish breakout above $2.70 would confirm that the token is once again en route to hitting the $3 level. Meanwhile, if positive momentum accelerates and a breakout above $3.5 occurs, that should set XRP on course to hit $5+ before the year ends. Ripple has been focusing its efforts lately on growing its ecosystem as regulations have turned in its favor. As institutional interest keeps growing, catching early crypto presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) while they are still flying below the market’s radar could deliver above-average returns during this cycle.

Per reports from the South Korean media outlets Newsis and Wow TV , the Naver-Dunamu merger is “expected to generate KRW 3 trillion in consolidated operating profits.” However, experts say that “regulatory uncertainties” remain, with others this month speaking about five major legal obstacles standing in the companies’ way .

(Source: CoinGecko) Naver-Dunamu Crypto Merger: Positivity Surrounding Deal, Says Expert The outlets interviewed Jang Ho-yoon, a researcher at the securities provider Korea Investment & Securities. The researcher explained that Naver “has always been relatively undervalued” on the South Korean market, despite its rival Kakao “receiving a high valuation through business expansion.” He explained: “The acquisition of Dunamu will allow Naver to fully enter the crypto industry. Stablecoins , in particular, could generate significant synergy with Naver’s existing advertising, commerce, and fintech businesses.” The Kospi surged past 3,600 mark for the first time ever in early trading Friday as Korean markets reopened after the long Chuseok holiday, fueled by a rally in semiconductor and biotech shares following strong momentum from U.S. chipmaker Nvidia. https://t.co/HMv6UQaJXd — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) October 10, 2025 Naver is the country’s biggest internet company. Its subsidiary Naver Financial already operates several banking and e-pay platforms. The firm hopes to merge Naver Financial with Dunamu, the owner of South Korea’s biggest crypto trading platform. The move would create Asia’s biggest fintech company. Jung explained: “The industry expects the new firm to create a stablecoin ecosystem centered on Dunamu’s exchange business and its GIWA protocol [Upbit’s Layer-2 Ethereum-based chain]. Combing this with Naver’s existing services will let it secure an advantageous position over competitors in both the crypto and general payment spheres.” We're thrilled to announce that $YGG is now listed on @official_Upbit spot (KRW).

The researcher also predicted a coming boom in crypto trading activity. He said that as the United States enters “a rate-cut cycle,” crypto trading volumes are likely to increase. Jung explained: “As advanced blockchain-powered businesses, such as stablecoins and tokenized securities, become popular in Korea, diverse business opportunities will open up for Naver.” Jang Ho-yoon, a researcher at the South Korean securities provider Korea Investment & Securities. (@joosik_school/YouTube/Screenshot) Jung opined that the merger would “open up various possibilities for Naver,” which has seen its valuation decline due to “a lack of new growth engines.” And while some continue to claim that regulatory approval for the merger is still up in the air, the researcher said there was a “relatively positive atmosphere” around the deal. While regulations still prevent banks from engaging in crypto-related business, some say that these rules do not apply to e-pay providers like Naver. Jung said that there is uncertainty over the question of whether fintech companies such as Naver Financial should be considered traditional financial companies. He said: “The levels of uncertainty surrounding the merger are not very high.” The researcher concluded that the proposed merger meant Naver would be “the most notable internet large-cap stock to watch next year.” Naver Financial last month announced a plan to effectively take over Dunamu in a proposed comprehensive stock swap deal. Upbit has cornered over 70% of the South Korean market share, per recent estimations . The merger talk has stoked speculation that Naver Financial-Dunamu could look to go public on the NASDAQ exchange.

In a recent analysis published on Tuesday, Matthew Dixon, a veteran trader and financial market strategist, identified one critical price point that could determine XRP’s next major rally. According to Dixon, once XRP clears this resistance, it could accelerate rapidly into new price territory. Key Resistance at $2.65 Dixon pinpointed the $2.65 level as the crucial barrier preventing XRP from initiating a sustained rally. This area previously acted as solid support but turned into resistance after XRP’s steep decline to $1.37 during the October 10 market crash. #XRP so far has failed to break back above the $XRP 2.65 resistance level but it should just be a matter of time. If we can break and retest that level then rapidly higher towards new ATH should follow the large WXY correction down that now appear complete pic.twitter.com/oCrTPcqMfQ — Matthew Dixon – Veteran Financial Trader (@mdtrade) October 14, 2025 Following that drop, XRP has made several attempts to reclaim the $2.65 region. On Monday, the token climbed to $2.647 before being rejected. Another attempt on Tuesday also failed, with the price retreating to $2.40 shortly after touching the resistance zone. Dixon emphasized that while XRP has struggled to move above this range, he expects the breakthrough to occur eventually. Once the $2.65 resistance is decisively cleared, he believes the price could advance quickly, potentially surpassing XRP’s current all-time high of $3.66. WXY Correction May Support Next Uptrend Dixon’s optimistic forecast is supported by his technical interpretation of XRP’s recent market structure. He argues that the token has completed a WXY corrective pattern, which often precedes a new bullish phase. His analysis outlines three main points, W, X, and Y, on XRP’s daily chart. The “W” point represents the low of $1.615 recorded in April. This was followed by an ABC pattern that led to a rally and peak around $3.66 in July, labeled as point “X.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Afterward, XRP entered a consolidation period, forming another ABC corrective wave, pushing prices downward to the “Y” point at $1.37 on October 10. Dixon considers this drop the final stage of the correction. He contends that a recovery from this zone could mark the beginning of a new bullish cycle, provided XRP reclaims the $2.65 resistance. Analysts Expect New All-Time High When asked about potential price targets, Dixon refrained from offering a specific number, noting instead that surpassing the previous all-time high would be the most immediate milestone following the resistance break. At present, XRP trades around $2.42 , roughly 31% below its record high. To establish a new peak, the token would need to climb at least 45% from current levels. Dixon’s outlook aligns with several other bullish forecasts for XRP. For example, market analyst CasiTrades recently projected that XRP could reach $4.50 as part of the final leg of a three-wave Elliott Wave pattern. Although short-term volatility remains, multiple analysts agree that XRP’s long-term trajectory depends on a clear break above the $2.65 resistance level. If that happens, they believe a rapid move toward new all-time highs could follow soon after. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

XRP and SUI have both posted decent gains in the past 24 hours, while hotly anticipated L1 cryptocurrency Monad shared details of its upcoming airdrop. These three coins are all likely to do well in the coming weeks, but so is another new token that’s also preparing to launch before the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETFs and Ripple Growth Will Drive Altcoin to Record-Breaking Highs XRP has bounced by 2% in 24 hours, although its current price of $2.52 still equals a 12% loss in a week and a 17% decline in the past month. Yet longer term momentum is undoubtedly on XRP’s side, given that it has posted a 360% increase in the past year. Bigger gains are still to come, especially when a whole raft of XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the near future , driving institutional investment in the token. This probability combines bullishly with the setup of XRP’s current chart, which shows the alt in an oversold position. Source: TradingView Its MACD (orange, blue) has recently plunged to a new low, while its relative strength index (yellow) has also bounced from a bottom. As such, XRP is ready for a big recovery, and the launch of ETFs may be the catalyst that triggers a big end-of-year rally. And when you add Ripple’s ongoing growth as a company – adding new partnerships and acquisitions in recent months – the future looks very bright for XRP. It could reach $3 in November, before ending the year above $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Monad ($MON) – Incoming Airdrop May Help New L1 Become the Next Big Thing in Crypto Monad is a new Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer-one blockchain, with its technical documentation stating that it’s capable of 10,000 transactions per second. It promises to improve on performance in five major areas, including block transmission, state access and consensus.

The airdrop is open to active members of the Ethereum and Solana communities, and will remain open until November 3. While there may be a dip in price once it does list (due to airdrop participants selling their holdings), its fundamentals put it in a strong position for medium- and long-term growth. It will have a total supply of 100 billion MON, and judging by other major tokens with a similar supply, this means its price could settle at around the Crypto Price Prediction: Sui ($SUI) – Network Growth and Canary ETF Increases Chances of Big Xmas Rally SUI has risen to $2.82 today, and while this makes for a 2% increase in 24 hours, the altcoin remains down by 19% in a week and by 22% in a month. It has also posted a 47% decline since reaching its ATH of $5.35 in early January, yet there’s an argument to be made that this indicates how much it could rally in the next few weeks. SUI does remain a very strong coin fundamentally, with its MOVE-based L1 now boosting a TVL of $2.2 billion , making it the ninth-biggest platform in crypto. It has also signed big partnerships in the past year (e.g. with World Liberty Financial ), and it’s looking forward to the launch of an ETF from Canary. Source: TradingView Its chart today also shows it in an oversold position, but because of its underlying fundamentals, we can expect it to recover strongly once the market is more favorable. It’s likely to retake $3 in the next few weeks, before ending November above $4 and then breaking the $6 barrier in December. $1.8 Million and Counting: PEPENODE Presale Sets Stage for Big Listing Rally The coins above are all showing massive potential, but so too are several newer tokens, some of which could rally big once they list for the first time. This includes presale coins such as PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has now raised over $1.8 million in its ongoing sale. Build. Mine.

Gramegna’s comments came during the International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings, where he said that if stablecoins ever became mainstream without being tied to central bank money, “there’s a risk to the whole financial system, not just in Europe, but the whole world,” according to Bloomberg. The IMF, in a report earlier this week, had said that the $305 billion stablecoin market could shake traditional lending, weaken monetary policy, and potentially trigger runs on the safest global assets. The Financial Stability Board backed that concern, warning that the explosive growth of stablecoins and their growing ties to the banking sector make them a rising threat to stability. IMF warns of run risks and central bank intervention The IMF’s semiannual financial stability report said a sudden loss of trust in stablecoins could create a “run risk,” because if investors rush to redeem their tokens, issuers might be forced into fire sales of reserve assets like government bonds or bank deposits. The report said such selloffs could spill into repo markets, push up volatility, and force central banks to step in to stabilize prices. Stablecoins are typically backed by US Treasuries, making them the most conservative slice of the crypto market. Yet the IMF said their size and the increasing overlap with traditional finance now pose global contagion risks. It warned that banks’ exposure to these assets could spread shocks across multiple markets if investors panic. Gramegna insisted that the European Union is not against stablecoins, but stressed that they must operate under a strict framework that protects both consumers and financial institutions. “It must be in a framework that is safe for consumers and financial actors,” he said. Gramegna also called on Europe not to fall behind the United States or Asia in crypto development, arguing that if the continent doesn’t produce stablecoins pegged to the euro, it will “lose an opportunity.” All these also came after Austrian central bank chief Martin Kocher said at the Bloomberg Global Regulatory Forum that he didn’t believe stablecoins would gain strong traction in the eurozone. “As 99% of stablecoins are denominated in dollars, if Europe doesn’t produce stablecoins denominated in euros we will eventually lose an opportunity here,” Gramegna said. “I do think there is a possibility of coexistence of cash, digital currency and stablecoins.” Banks expand stablecoin projects amid rising oversight The IMF’s admonitions come as banks and other financial institutions expand their stablecoin activities, following the passage of the US Genius Act, which establishes a new regulatory framework for the tokens. The total market value of stablecoins has soared this year do surpass $300 billion, data from DefiLlama show. Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Banco Santander announced plans to issue a 1:1 reserve-backed token on public blockchains. Citigroup joined nine European banks to develop a regulated euro-based stablecoin. Still though, the IMF is warning that as these dollar-linked tokens grow, they could limit central banks’ ability to manage interest rates and control inflation, especially in smaller economies where stablecoins may act as parallel currencies. They may also alter the structure of bond markets by prompting a preference for certain kinds of debt, which has implications for traditional lending, the IMF said. The report also cautioned that any large-scale loss of parity between a stablecoin and its reference currency would cause “direct losses and heightened uncertainty” for users. Over the weekend, Cryptopolitan reported that Ethena, the third-largest stablecoin, briefly lost its dollar peg as crypto markets saw their largest single-day liquidation in history. The Financial Stability Board joined the IMF in warning that stablecoins remain an “emerging threat” and promised to increase global oversight. Other major regulators, including the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, have also cautioned that without strong management, the stablecoin sector could create a crisis that no central bank is ready to contain.

The U.S. had slapped a 50% tariff on Indian goods earlier this year, split into two separate 25% rounds, after talks collapsed over trade and energy deals. India had protested that others like China and Turkey, who also buy Russian crude, weren’t hit with the same penalties. Trump pushes India and China to join the oil boycott Trump added that Modi could not end the purchases instantly because “it’s a little bit of a process,” but said the transition would be completed soon. The two leaders are expected to meet this month at the Southeast Asia Summit in Malaysia, their first face-to-face since tensions flared over the tariffs. “Modi is a great man, he loves Trump,” the president said, sounding confident about the partnership. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that China could face steeper tariffs if Europe joined the effort. He accused Beijing of “fueling the Russian war machine,” and Trump later urged China to follow India’s example. The White House decision came only days after Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, held a closed-door meeting with Modi in New Delhi. The pair reportedly discussed defense, technology, and trade, with Trump emphasizing that Gor’s appointment was part of his plan to stabilize relations after months of pressure over energy imports. Behind the scenes, Trump’s administration has been coordinating a broader international effort to limit Moscow’s oil profits through tariffs and financial restrictions. Officials described the goal as forcing nations still trading with Russia to shift away, using Washington’s trade tools rather than military ones. Britain expands sanctions as G7 debates frozen Russian funds Across the Atlantic, Britain announcement new sanctions aimed at Russia’s oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft, and 44 oil tankers accused of moving crude under Moscow’s so-called “shadow fleet.” Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the crackdown, part of a 90-item sanctions package, was designed to choke off funds used for the war in Ukraine. “We are sending a clear signal: Russian oil is off the market,” Reeves said during remarks in Washington D.C., ahead of meetings with international finance chiefs. Reeves also confirmed that the UK had sanctioned India’s Nayara Energy Limited, which she said imported 100 million barrels of Russian crude worth over $5 billion last year. The company’s inclusion marks the first time London has directly targeted an Indian firm in connection with Russian oil shipments. Reeves added that the UK government was also tightening the screws on four Chinese oil terminals linked to Russian exports. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper backed the action, saying, “Today’s action is another step toward a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and a more secure United Kingdom.” The two Russian energy firms under sanctions together ship about 3.1 million barrels of oil daily, with Rosneft producing nearly half of Russia’s crude, around 6% of total global output. The new measures were announced alongside meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose 190 member countries are tracking the global economic fallout from the war. Meanwhile, the G7 is preparing to debate next week a proposal to seize hundreds of billions in frozen Russian investments, much of it held in cash at the European Central Bank after maturing bond holdings. Earlier this year, both the U.S. and UK sanctioned Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, a move former Foreign Secretary David Lammy said would “drain Russia’s war chest.” Now, Trump’s latest push to align India with the oil boycott adds another layer of pressure on Moscow. The U.S. is also considering tariffs up to 500% on Chinese imports linked to Russian energy, though Scott Bessent did say that: “We will respond if our European partners will join us.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|India|Russia|USA,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|MACROECONOMICS|ASIA|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-15 23:37:53

Q4 Move Still Possible: XRP’s Bullish Potential Isn’t Gone Yet Crypto analyst CoinsKid recently shared an update confirming that the highly anticipated Q4 move for XRP is still a potential option. This optimistic outlook is heavily underpinned by the current data observed on the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which the analyst views as a crucial barometer for altcoin performance. If BTC.D shows weakness, capital typically flows into assets like XRP, supporting the potential for a significant surge in the coming months.

However, CoinsKid pointed out that the recent loss of the $1.90 low last Friday introduced what he described as a structural anomaly into the equation. This development adds a layer of uncertainty to XRP’s short-term outlook, even as the broader setup continues to show potential. He further explained that for this bullish scenario to remain valid, Bitcoin dominance must stay below its 5-day resistance level on the CoinskidRibbon. At the same time, XRP needs to hold above its own 5-day CoinskidRibbon as support. Wyckoff Blueprint In Motion: XRP Mirrors Its 2017 Setup EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL, in a recent update, highlighted that XRP is currently positioned within a major accumulation area, signaling that a crucial phase may be unfolding for the asset. According to the analyst, the current market structure strongly mirrors the early stages of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, a technical formation that often precedes large-scale bullish movements. Related Reading: XRP Bull Run Reloaded: Analyst Says Momentum Mirrors 2017’s Explosive Rally The Wyckoff method identifies this accumulation phase as a period where smart money quietly builds positions while the price remains range-bound. This typically occurs after extended declines, setting the stage for a powerful reversal once the market confirms strength. From a technical perspective, this accumulation structure indicates growing pressure beneath key support zones, which often leads to a strong bullish cycle once a breakout occurs. The repeated testing of support levels, combined with diminishing selling volume, strengthens the case for a potential upside breakout in the near term. EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL also drew parallels to XRP’s behavior in the 2017 cycle, when a similar accumulation phase preceded one of the asset’s most explosive rallies, with XRP climbing all the way to the distribution zone, where profits were eventually taken. If history repeats, the altcoin could once again be on the verge of a powerful upward run.

53203200,606375,1760572818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53203200.jpeg,Financial Expert Says The Bitcoin Flash Crash Exposed A Myth About BTC – Here’s What,https://bitcoinist.com/the-bitcoin-flash-crash-exposed/,"The recent Bitcoin flash crash has reignited debates over the true value of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Critics argue that the devastating episode highlights the difference between digital assets and traditional safe-haven investments, such as gold, exposing and challenging the long-held myth about BTC’s digital gold status . Bitcoin Flash Crash Highlights Fragility Of “Digital Gold” Narrative Veteran economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has been vocal in analyzing the flash crash that shook the crypto market last Friday. He stated in an X social media post that the sharp decline, which saw BTC drop from above $122,000 to $102,000 in a single day, was not a buying opportunity but a critical warning to investors. Notably, the Bitcoin flash crash came after US President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese tech imports , which added geopolitical pressure to markets. Reports from numerous analysts also indicated that internal pricing issues at Binance allegedly contributed to the massive liquidations the same day, exacerbating the broader market decline. Schiff highlighted in his post that the surge in gold price during the Bitcoin flash crash exposes the myth that BTC is digital gold, underscoring a stark contrast between volatility-driven digital currencies and traditionally tangible assets. He further argued that the notion of Bitcoin as a stable and reliable store of value is flawed, pointing out that the cryptocurrency’s price could collapse at any time in the future without warning. Addressing the crypto community, Schiff cautioned that many investors stand to lose significantly by choosing BTC over gold. He remarked that BTC enthusiasts seem to fear gold for “exposing Bitcoin for the fraud that it is,” highlighting the enduring resilience and stability that traditional assets continue to demonstrate over cryptocurrencies. Unsurprisingly, his remarks about Bitcoin provoked intense backlash from many Bitcoin maximalists and crypto investors, many of whom pointed to BTC’s record highs above $126,000 in contrast to Schiff’s past failed predictions or “warnings” that the cryptocurrency would never reach $100,000. Schiff Predicts Further Decline Ahead For BTC In a follow-up post on X, Schiff turned his attention to Bitcoin’s near-term outlook, forecasting another sharp decline from its present levels. He analyzed broader market trends, particularly the performance of Nasdaq futures , suggesting that if the index falls by an additional 7.5%, it would enter correction territory, potentially triggering a 15% drop in BTC prices. A 15% drop in the BTC price could send it tumbling below $95,000. However, Schiff went further, predicting that the cryptocurrency could continue sliding toward its next support level near $75,000, representing a steep 34% decline from current levels around $112,000. Moving on, the financial strategist highlighted the contrasting performance of traditional precious metals, noting that gold and silver continue to rise even as Bitcoin and Ethereum retreat . Schiff also warned that cryptocurrency buyers are likely in for a “rude awakening,” describing the experience as a costly but valuable lesson.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|ETH|Ethereum|gold|Peter Schiff,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-16 00:00:18

Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that the recent dip has created a rare opportunity for accumulation, particularly for investors seeking to move into the upper tiers of the XRP rich list. The XRP Rich List and Market Decline According to data compiled by the XRP community, wallets holding between 8,162 and 10,501 XRP currently fall within the top 5% of all XRP addresses. With XRP trading around $2.48 , this translates to an entry value of approximately $21,129 to $27,197. These figures represent a slight decline compared to earlier this month. On October 1, the threshold for inclusion in the top 5% ranged from 8,229 to 10,550 XRP, which was valued at $23,370 to $29,962 based on the token’s price at that time. The reduction in both token and dollar value means that investors can now join the top 5% segment with roughly $2,000 less than they would have needed two weeks ago. The decline in XRP’s value followed the broader market crash that affected most major cryptocurrencies on October 10, when XRP fell more than 43%, briefly touching $1.58 before recovering above the $2.40 region. Although sentiment remains cautious, several observers believe this period of weakness offers a favorable entry poin t for long-term investors. Analysts’ Perspective on Accumulation Market commentators such as Coach JV have recently emphasized that opportunities to buy XRP at lower valuations may not last long. He warned that once market momentum returns, XRP’s upward movement could be swift, leaving little time for new entrants to accumulate at current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other analysts, including DustyBC, have maintained bullish long-term expectations, with many placing the next significant target around $10 per XRP. While opinions differ on when such a rally might occur, the $10 projection remains one of the most cited price goals within the XRP community. Projected Returns for Top 5% Holders at $10 If XRP were to reach $10 , investors currently in the top 5% tier would see a substantial increase in their holdings’ value. Based on the present range of 8,162 to 10,501 XRP, their portfolios, now worth $21,129 to $27,197, would appreciate to $81,620 to $105,010. This potential increase represents profits between $60,491 and $75,048, assuming the holders maintain their current balances. Such returns highlight the financial leverage available to those already within the upper bracket of XRP ownership, particularly if the token’s price realizes the projected surge. While short-term uncertainty persists, the adjustment in the XRP rich list underscores how market downturns can shift entry requirements for top holders. With the current drop lowering the threshold for elite-level participation, new investors have an opportunity to join the upper percentile at a relatively reduced cost. If XRP succeeds in reclaiming bullish momentum and eventually approaches the $10 mark, these early entries could prove highly profitable. For now, analysts remain divided on the timing of such a move, but most agree that XRP’s present pricing offers a more accessible point for those looking to strengthen their positions before any potential market recovery.

UK prosecutors are preparing to confiscate Bitcoin worth about $6.8B connected to one of the largest cryptocurrency fraud cases ever uncovered. Prosecutors revealed during a court hearing in London on Wednesday that the funds are tied to a fraudulent investment scheme that swindled about 128,000 investors across China. Authorities plan to create a victim compensation program to return funds to those affected. Chinese victims are set to be repaid by the UK The $6.8 haul is from an investigation by the London Metropolitan Police, which uncovered 61,000 Bitcoins in 2018 during a money laundering probe involving two Chinese women. The women were involved in a 2017 fraud case that was first detected by Chinese authorities when investors began reporting losses linked to Tianjin Lantian’s promises of high-yield returns. The scheme eventually fell apart and exposed a vast network of false investment products and fake profits used to attract new participants. The structure was similar to a Ponzi-style scam . UK prosecutors stated that the company lured investors with promises of high returns and when it collapsed, it resulted in losses of more than 40 billion yuan. Fourteen Chinese nationals have already been convicted in China in connection with the scheme. One of the largest UK crypto seizures Yadi Zhang, also known as Zhimin Qian, played a key role in laundering the stolen cryptocurrency. Zhang pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges last month after years of investigation. Her accomplice, another Chinese woman, was convicted of fraud by a UK jury last year. Prosecutors revealed at the last hearing that Zhang had hidden additional cryptocurrency from investigators. The court filings show that Zhang told police in April 2024 that she had stored the passwords for two crypto wallets inside a pocket sewn into the pair of jogging bottoms she was wearing at the time of her arrest. Due to her confession, the police were able to recover another £67.3M worth of Bitcoin. “Some investors have suffered huge personal loss in the form of lives, marriages, fracturing families and businesses,” William Glover, a representative of a group of affected investors, stated. Glover added that the fraud had destroyed livelihoods and caused years of hardship for ordinary people who had invested their savings in what they believed were legitimate opportunities. Discussions are already being held to determine how the funds will be distributed. The court will have to decide on the process for verifying claims and determining which victims qualify for compensation . A lawyer representing another group of investors, Jackson Ng, stressed that the most important thing considering the amount involved in the case is to compensate the victims.

Muller noted that with interest rates currently at an appropriate level, policymakers should remain patient while closely monitoring developments that could sway inflation in either direction. Heightened trade conflicts in the market spark tension among investors During the 2025 IMF’s annual meeting, scheduled to take place from October 13 to 18 at the IMF and World Bank Group headquarters in Washington, D.C., Muller pointed out that China’s export controls are an example of how trade barriers set by other nations can have inflationary effects in Europe as well. The Governor of the Bank of Estonia also mentioned that insufficient essential material could raise prices for certain goods, even if it hurts the economy. Hence, according to Muller, this situation contradicts the belief that Trump’s additional tariffs would lead to European deflation. Regarding Chinese export limitations , Beijing’s new export regulations stipulate that foreign firms must obtain approval from the Chinese government before exporting products that contain even small quantities of specific rare earths sourced from the country. In response to this limitation, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an extra 100% tariff on Chinese goods. This heightened conflict between the US and China has sparked concerns among investors in the market regarding the possibility of a fierce trade war between the two. As a result, they have called on the ECB to consider the geographic risks that could affect their predictions. This has led the central bank to anticipate that price growth will decline drastically below its 2% target in 2026, before picking up pace again in 2027. “The risks linked to this forecast are currently more or less balanced,” said Muller. The ECB executive further explained that weakening the recovery process could lower inflation. However, he still pointed out the likelihood of higher inflation amid ignited trade conflicts. Therefore, with these considerations in mind, Muller speculates that the economy might recover swiftly, as it could turn out either way. Muller calls on officials to be patient as debates on interest rate cuts intensify After lowering the deposit rate to 2% eight times, several ECB officials think they should hold off on making further adjustments to borrowing costs until something truly surprising happens in the economy. This decision was weighed during Müller’s remarks, when he stated that with inflation at 2% and interest rates in a range that encourages economic recovery without resulting in slowdowns, officials need to be patient and make their decision based on what is likely to happen in the economy in the coming months. Even with this statement, some of his colleagues still hold the belief that further rate cuts are needed. In response to these contradictions, Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau mentioned in an interview this week that they expect to see a reduction rather than an increase next. Muller disagreed, saying the ECB could take action in either way. “It really depends on how things unfold, and it is very uncertain what we might need to do next in terms of changing rates,” he explained. Based on his argument, he has no reason to start leaning toward making things easier. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The forecast , delivered by Chief Financial and Operating Officer Robin Washington at the company’s investor event on Wednesday, does not include any revenue from a pending Informatica Inc. acquisition that Salesforce anticipates will close in the middle of 2026. Washington said the company was confident about returning to double-digit growth, noting that it would take about 12 to 18 months for the turnaround to materialize. She added that Salesforce had reported $37.9 billion in revenue for the fiscal year ended in January, its slowest growth since going public. AI agents drive Salesforce’s revival Having grown more slowly in recent years, Salesforce is making aggressive use of artificial intelligence to fuel its comeback. At the center of this is Agentforce 360 , an AI-powered automation platform that lets businesses deploy “digital agents” to perform tasks such as customer support, data entry, and early-stage sales conversations. The company stated that over 12,000 customers are already using Agentforce, which has also been adopted internally to reduce costs. The tool is saving Salesforce approximately $100 million per year, the company stated in figures shared during its Dreamforce 2025 conference earlier this week. To bolster its AI capabilities, Salesforce has strengthened its collaborations with OpenAI and Anthropic to integrate their latest models into the suite known as Agentforce 360. The integration enables customers to combine generative AI with Salesforce’s own Einstein Copilot system, which provides more intelligent, context-aware suggestions. The company also announced plans to invest $15 billion in San Francisco over the next five years, as it expands its data centers, supports local AI startups, and advances research on how AI can be used responsibly. The commitment aligns with CEO Marc Benioff’s efforts to establish the global AI economy in San Francisco. Benioff stated at Dreamforce that the company’s AI ecosystem was growing rapidly and described Agentforce as more than just a tool, calling it the future of how companies would interact with their customers. Salesforce boosts investor confidence with buybacks and acquisitions Washington also announced a $7 billion share buyback program over the next six months — part of an effort to help restore investor confidence after a turbulent year. The news lifted Salesforce’s shares about 4% in after-hours trading, although the stock is still off almost 29% year to date. The company’s struggles have additionally reflected investor fears that its corporate clients may be shifting their spending from traditional applications to AI startups and emerging tools. However, Washington has brushed aside those worries, calling talk of software applications dying a “myth.” Salesforce relies on its purchase of the data-integration and analytics firm Informatica as part of its growth strategy. Analysts have said the deal will enable Salesforce to integrate data more seamlessly across its products, which could help AI models operate with better information. Data is the basis for artificial intelligence, and acquiring Informatica would allow Salesforce to fully close that loop by combining customer data with automation and analytics in one place, according to technology analyst Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. The focus on AI and automation from Salesforce comes as the company battles to solidify its dominance in a cloud world that looks different than before. The competition is intensifying — Microsoft, Oracle, and ServiceNow are also incorporating generative AI into their enterprise software stacks. But Salesforce believes it is poised for its next growth chapter. Emphasizing AI, data, and efficiency more will help the firm recover from recent growth declines and restore investor confidence. Benioff noted the AI wave was real and Salesforce didn’t want to wait to take advantage of it. He said people were seeking smart software to do things for them, rather than the other way around.

XRP remains steady around the $2.70 support area, demonstrating strength and hinting that a potential push towards $5 might be in the future. Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, continues to impress with the steady development releases and expanding ecosystem, remaining the darling of long-term bullish believers. Against these established heavy-hitters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , as a presale project, is standing out as one to watch, now in Phase 6 with over 65% sold out, gaining interest with the innovative framework of the DeFi platform as well as the aggressive roadmap. As the go-to high-potential crypto assets under $5, these three tokens are taking the limelight this week among traders and investors. XRP Price Analysis Analysts are growing bullish on XRP, citing that the weekly chart could be taking shape within the form of a megaphone pattern, a formation that typically signals building volatility as well as market indecision. This pattern, defined by growing tops as well as bottoms, usually anticipates a watershed breakout once one side of the market succumbs. Should bulls take the helm, XRP might experience a strong continuation to the high side, consistent with general hopes based on its long-term fundamentals. As traders anticipate this possibility, most investors are putting their sights on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), too, as it continues to gather interest among investors anticipating a move into the next gen high-growth crypto assets. Cardano Price Analysis: The Rally Continues Towards $1 Cardano (ADA) remains to build on bullish strength as buyers continue the extension of the 3-day recovery, taking the price from about $0.63 to $0.70, a remarkable 11% increase since the previous update. This persistent move demonstrates the strength of the $0.60–$0.63 demand area, as this area continues to be the source of strong institutional buying interest. So long as ADA remains above this pivotal point, the bullish technical outlook remains good, with the near-term targets being $0.75, $0.85, as well as $0.95. The momentum bars continue to favor bulls, and with Bitcoin holding steady above the psychological $110K, ADA may soon threaten the psychological $1 barrier, giving way to potential gains towards $1.17–$1.33. As bullish momentum builds, investors are likewise expanding the scope of interest to a presale project gaining strong ground in the growing DeFi arena, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Surges in 2025 Mutuum Finance is the talk of the town nowadays within the DeFi market, as the presale has hit 17,000+ investors with a wonderful $17.35+ million worth of funds to-date. Already in Phase 6 with 65% snapped up during the current phase, the price of the token is currently at $0.035, indicating a consistent market demand with growing investors’ confidence. The platform will launch its lending and borrowing protocol . V1 will be launched onto the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature core product building blocks of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as a liquidator bot. ETH as well as USDT will be featured to be borrowed, collateralized, as well as lent, and will be provided at the time of launch to provide multi-asset, plug-and-play access to DeFi. Institutional as well as retail consumers will be provided with secure, efficient, as well as easy-to-use decentralised finance products. Inexpensive powerhouses to accelerate this week XRP, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance are emerging as three of the most intriguing crypto assets under $5 to watch this week. The bullish megaphone setup in XRP suggests a breakout could be possible, whereas the sustained Cardano rebound above crucial support demonstrates the regained belief among investors in the strength of its fundamentals. The spotlight, meanwhile, belongs to the early-stage DeFi project Mutuum Finance as one that offers innovation, security, as well as practical real-world utility. With over $17.35 million, 17,000+ investors participating, as well as 65% of Phase 6 presale sold, MUTM’s momentum builds upon the possibility of generating outsized returns this 2025. For value hunters and bulls looking to ride the upside in a fluctuating market, coming into the Mutuum Finance presale now might be the best early step towards benefiting from one of 2025’s largest crypto growth stories.

At the same time, altcoins like Ethereum, Avalanche (AVAX), and MAGACOIN FINANCE drew new attention from traders looking for the best altcoins to buy the dip. MAGACOIN FINANCE, in particular, continues to draw eyes for its consistent price movement and growing trust appeal. Bitcoin Price Path Below $112K Tests Trader Confidence Bitcoin price drop under $112,000 came after a sharp flash crash that erased about $15 billion in futures open interest. Despite reclaiming the $114,000 level briefly, caution still dominates the market. Analysts suggest the next push toward $125,000 could be delayed as investors weigh global macro issues. Weaker U.S. job numbers and fresh tension between the U.S. and China added pressure. Bond yields fell, signaling traders’ move toward safer assets. Some still view Bitcoin as a key hedge, but the current price zone shows how cautious participants have become. Even so, Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation asset, and its pullbacks often open opportunities in promising altcoins. As traders wait for volatility to settle, many now scan the broader market for the best altcoins to buy the dip before the next cycle recovery. Ethereum Price Eyes $4.5K as Market Regains Balance Ethereum’s recovery above $4,100 suggests confidence is returning. The heavy liquidations that hit futures markets on Friday have eased, with funding rates normalizing. Analysts now see Ethereum regaining its footing toward the $4,500 zone if sentiment continues to improve. ETH’s strength lies in its ability to stay resilient during sharp downturns. While many other assets dropped by 60% or more, Ethereum’s correction was softer, proving its deeper market presence. Options data also shows balanced activity, hinting that traders are not betting on heavy downside moves. The broader sentiment now sees Ethereum as one of the best altcoins to buy the dip , given its stability, long-term developer base, and steady institutional demand through ETFs and derivatives markets. As confidence rebuilds, ETH may lead the next leg of recovery. Avalanche (AVAX) Recovery Hints at a Broader Altcoin Turnaround Avalanche has started to show signs of life after one of its sharpest shakeouts in months. AVAX now trades near $22 , with analysts tracking a possible rebound toward $47 . Market watchers highlight its strong on-chain activity and network usage, which remain steady despite the price crash. The Bokcast and other analysts point to a clean structure forming, suggesting AVAX may have already cleared weak hands. Historically, such capitulations often mark macro bottoms. September saw Avalanche’s busiest month in nearly two years, a sign of real activity beyond speculation. As developers continue to build through the market noise, Avalanche’s growing base makes it one of the best altcoins to buy the dip for those looking to position early before the next uptrend. The network’s health, combined with price consolidation, supports the idea of an early accumulation phase underway. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Altcoin Traders Are Watching Closely Amid the market chaos, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown stability rarely seen during broad selloffs. Its price continues to rise steadily every hour with no major pullbacks, making it stand out as a safe haven altcoin in this volatile week. With a smaller market cap under $15 million , it offers room for growth and serves as a useful hedge for traders seeking diversification. The project has confirmed plans for a CEX listing soon , drawing further attention as one of the best altcoins to buy the dip during uncertain times. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s steady pace and community-driven structure make it a good find, agile enough to grow, yet stable enough to trust amid wider price crashes. How Traders Can Position in This Market Short-term fear often creates long-term opportunity. The recent dip has given traders a new chance to reposition in quality altcoins before sentiment flips again. Watching Bitcoin’s next moves remains key, but those who diversify early into names like Ethereum, AVAX, and MAGACOIN FINANCE may be better placed for the next recovery wave.

53202185,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86489,1760576438,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP’s Next Rally Would Threaten Bitcoin Dominance,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrps-next-rally-would-threaten-bitcoin-dominance/,"Crypto market analyst Alex Cobb has suggested that XRP’s next major price surge could significantly shift dynamics within the cryptocurrency sector, potentially posing a challenge to Bitcoin’s long-standing dominance. Cobb’s remarks come at a time when broader market sentiment remains uncertain. Despite recent corrections, XRP has managed to hold above crucial technical support zones, maintaining investor confidence amid volatility. His comments came after an independent analysis by market observer Charting Guy, who examined XRP’s long-term price structure using Fibonacci retracement levels. According to Charting Guy, XRP is currently hovering around the 0.888 Fibonacci retracement level near $2.44. The analyst identified a strong support range between $1.61 and $1.70, a zone that played a key role during XRP’s early 2021 price surge. He described XRP’s market structure as fundamentally sound, dismissing claims that the asset was turning bearish. Instead, he suggested that XRP is consolidating before another upward breakout. The next leg up on XRP will have Bitcoiners genuinely worried about their #1 spot https://t.co/U4damVkK3J — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 14, 2025 If the token manages to move past the $3.31 resistance zone, the next Fibonacci extension targets could position XRP for significant gains. Based on current chart projections, these levels include $8.29, $13.38, and $26.63, indicating potential returns ranging from threefold to elevenfold from current prices. At $2.50, XRP’s price would need a considerable rally to reach those upper targets, but doing so would give the asset an estimated market capitalization of around $1.6 trillion. XRP’s Growth Could Stir the Bitcoin Market Cobb remarked that such a development would likely raise concerns among Bitcoin investors, as a substantial XRP rally could draw capital and attention away from BTC. His comment implied that XRP’s next major move could reignite discussions about which asset leads the crypto market. Currently, Bitcoin retains a commanding lead with a market capitalization exceeding $2.24 trillion. XRP, valued at roughly $149 billion, ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. While XRP briefly reclaimed the third position earlier this year, its market value has since declined, leaving a significant gap between it and Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Long Path Toward Market Leadership Before XRP could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance, it must first overtake several major cryptocurrencies. Binance Coin (BNB) currently leads XRP by roughly $15 billion in market capitalization, while Tether (USDT) sits about $30 billion ahead. Surpassing these assets is feasible based on past performance. XRP previously reached a $210 billion market cap, but the larger obstacle lies in overtaking Ethereum. Ethereum’s current valuation stands near $500 billion, meaning XRP would need to triple in price to around $8 to match it. If Ethereum continues to rise, this gap would expand further. While Cobb remains confident in XRP’s long-term potential, other analysts such as Charting Guy have voiced caution, acknowledging Ethereum’s own strong technical structure and positive outlook. In theory, for XRP to surpass Bitcoin’s market value, it would need to appreciate by approximately 1,397%, reaching a price near $38, assuming Bitcoin’s value remains unchanged. This represents a substantial challenge in both the short and medium term. Although the idea of XRP surpassing Bitcoin remains speculative, many in the XRP community continue to view it as a long-term possibility. Some projections suggest that if market conditions align, XRP could achieve this by 2030. However, others predict that Bitcoin may rise to $1 million by then, further extending its lead. For now, XRP’s focus remains on sustaining its bullish structure and reclaiming higher resistance levels. Whether it can eventually compete with Bitcoin’s dominance will depend on how the market evolves in the coming years.

53202197,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=838542,1760576448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53202197.jpeg,"Dogecoin Now Poised For Its Biggest Run In 2025, Analyst Predicts",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-biggest-run-in-2025/,"The Dogecoin weekly chart structure may be setting up for a classic Elliott Wave “third wave” advance, according to trader and market commentator Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow), who argued that DOGE has reclaimed a critical Fibonacci level and could be transitioning from corrective price action into a new impulsive leg. Dogecoin Set For Takeoff As Wave 3 Kicks In Sharing a weekly chart, the analyst wrote: “Initially I thought DOGE wave 2 retraced to 0.5 of wave 1, which is valid, but it decided to get to 0.382 which is also possible for a wave 2 retracement. Now it’s reclaiming 0.618 and wave 3 could be starting… and wave 3 is the most bullish and most powerful of them all.” The chart posted by Cantonese Cat applies a Fibonacci grid to Dogecoin’s 2022–December 2024 advance (“Wave 1” on the graphic), with the 0.618 retracement anchored around ~$0.20088 on the weekly timeframe and the mid-range levels marked at 0.5 (~$0.15350) and 0.382 (~$0.11729). On the left axis, historical weekly candles show DOGE’s earlier cycle blow-off followed by a lengthy basing period near the ~$0.05–$0.10 zone (the 0.0 line sits at ~$0.04909), from which the advance began in mid-2022. Related Reading: Dogecoin Foundation’s House Of Doge Announces NASDAQ Listing Elliott Wave analysis proposes that markets trend in a five-wave impulse where the third wave is typically the strongest by both breadth and momentum. Within that framework, a “Wave 2” pullback frequently terminates in the 0.382–0.618 retracement band of Wave 1, while a decisive reclaim of the 0.618 level on higher timeframes is often treated by technicians as a structural pivot back in favor of the prevailing uptrend. The chart Cantonese Cat shared labels the recent decline as “Wave 2,” with wicks probing toward the 0.382 band and subsequent weekly closes gravitating back toward the 0.618 level. The current weekly candle plotted on the image sits almost exactly on that 0.618 line, indicating the market is testing whether buyers can convert it into support. Related Reading: Elon Musk Mentions Dogecoin Again — Is The Meme Coin About To Rally? The analyst’s emphasis on the 0.618 reclaim is consistent with how many systematic traders translate Fibonacci confluence into risk frameworks: closes and acceptance above the golden-ratio band raise the probability that the prior impulse has resumed, whereas sustained rejection there often keeps a market locked in a range. DOGE Price Targets The chart also visualizes potential topside waypoints should momentum expand. The Fibonacci projections drawn beyond the “Wave 1” peak display the 1.0 band at roughly $0.48 and classical extensions at 1.272 (~$0.89), 1.414 (~$1.23), and 1.618 (~$1.96). Elliott practitioners frequently monitor these zones for acceleration targets or distribution risk if a third wave unfolds. For now, the operative claim is straightforward and testable on chart: “Now it’s reclaiming 0.618 and wave 3 could be starting,” with the reminder that “wave 3 is the most bullish and most powerful of them all.” Whether price can hold above the ~$0.20088 pivot into weekly close and then demonstrate impulsive breadth—rising range, expanding volume, and leadership versus peers—will determine if this setup matures into the kind of third-wave advance Elliott theorists anticipate or fades back into consolidation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.20.

53203601,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=837065,1760578201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53203601.jpeg,Basel considers rule review amid stablecoin boom,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/basel-warns-stablecoin-may-spur-rule-review/,"The meteoric growth of stablecoins is prompting global banking regulators to reconsider how traditional banks should treat cryptocurrencies. Erik Thedéen, the chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and governor of Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, said that regulators are currently focused on stablecoins. Other central bankers also stated that they were closely monitoring developments related to these so-called stablecoins, which are digital tokens linked to traditional currencies such as the dollar or euro, providing one-to-one value. Thedéen said at a conference in Washington on Wednesday, during the IMF meetings, that the Basel Committee could revise its current crypto capital framework, given the significant changes in the digital asset landscape since 2022. Basel considers rule review amid stablecoin boom When, in 2022, the Basel Committee wrote its crypto capital rules, stablecoins were new. But policymakers at the time were more concerned about volatile assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, since then, stablecoins have experienced a surge in use and value — tokens like Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC), for example, now facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of transactions every day worldwide. Under the current regime, most stablecoins are considered highly risky crypto assets, and banks must maintain equal amounts of capital against them as they would against much more volatile cryptocurrencies. Thedéen admitted that this blanket approach may no longer be suitable for today’s evolving market, as newer stablecoins are increasingly backed by liquid assets such as short-term US Treasuries. The new capital rules, which were set to take effect in 2026, would have made it far more expensive for banks to dabble in crypto assets. The finance industry has stated that such treatment is excessively punitive and stifles innovation, especially at a time when several global banks have been experimenting with issuing their own stablecoins, which are pegged to major currencies, including the US dollar, the euro, and the yen. Thedéen emphasized that any revision of the rules would undergo a very thorough process involving all Basel member states. He noted that some members had already adopted parts of the package, suggesting that any amendments would require broad consensus. The Basel Committee’s latest signal comes as regulators worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing the stablecoin industry. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) had just cautioned that the widespread use of stablecoins could increase risks to the financial system , particularly if the tokens were to be used in payments and credit. The Systemic Risk Board, for its part, suggested that banks or shadow lenders could hold stablecoins issued in multiple countries to a range of users from across the world. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also urged closer supervision to close any regulatory gaps. In the United States, Congress passed the Stablecoin Act, establishing national standards for stablecoin issuers. The Act ensures that issuers maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets and provide clear redemption rights to holders. The Bank of England has just indicated that it will only lift its proposed cap on stablecoin payments when it is certain that there can be no impact whatsoever on financial stability as a result of this technology. Banks push back against punitive capital charges Key banks and trade associations, such as the GFMA, have warned the Basel Committee against delaying or reconsidering its forthcoming crypto framework. They state the market has advanced beyond 2022, with better governance, transparency, and collateralisation for the majority of top stablecoins. The GFMA stated in an August letter to the committee that the proposed rules could make it increasingly uneconomical for regulated UK financial institutions to offer cryptoasset custody and payment services. The group further urged the committee to adopt data-driven adjustments that would better reflect the reduced risk profile of stablecoin issuers with strong performance records.

53203202,606615,1760578252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53203202.jpeg,Tether And Circle Mint $4.5B In Stablecoins Since The Market Crash – Recovery Fuel?,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-circle-mint-stablecoins-since-market-crash/,"Tether (USDT) is back in the spotlight after minting another $1 billion in new tokens — just days after issuing $2 billion earlier this week. The timing has drawn attention from analysts and traders alike, as the market continues to recover from one of the sharpest sell-offs of the year. With Bitcoin struggling to hold above the $110K region and altcoins showing weak follow-through, Tether’s sudden burst of activity is being closely watched as a potential signal of renewed liquidity or strategic repositioning. This latest mint pushes Tether’s total new issuance to $3 billion in under a week, reinforcing its dominant position in the stablecoin market. During the sell-off, Tether dominance spiked to 5.5%, its highest level since April, reflecting a surge in demand for stable liquidity as traders fled risk assets. Since then, dominance has cooled slightly to 4.7%, but the stablecoin giant’s activity continues to draw intense scrutiny. While Tether mints don’t always translate into immediate inflows to crypto assets, they often hint at growing sidelined capital preparing to re-enter the market . Whether this surge in issuance reflects institutional demand, exchange liquidity provisioning, or broader market preparation for a rebound remains to be seen — but the timing is far from random. Stablecoin Issuance Surges After Market Crash According to data shared by Lookonchain, Tether and Circle have minted a combined $4.5 billion in stablecoins following last Friday’s market crash. The report reveals that Tether issued $3 billion USDT, while Circle minted $1.5 billion USDC, highlighting that liquidity is quietly rebuilding even as prices remain unstable. Lookonchain notes that Circle has minted 250 million USDC six times since the crash, each within short intervals, underscoring strong and consistent demand for dollar-backed assets. These minting events — often used to meet institutional or exchange-level liquidity needs — suggest that large players are positioning capital in anticipation of potential volatility or future accumulation opportunities. The timing is significant. The crypto market remains in a delicate and fearful phase, with Bitcoin consolidating around the $112K level after its sharp decline to $103K. Altcoins continue to trade at heavy discounts, and sentiment across social and on-chain indicators remains cautious. Yet, historically, such spikes in stablecoin issuance tend to precede aggressive market moves, as sidelined liquidity eventually flows back into risk assets once confidence begins to return. In this context, the surge in Tether and Circle’s minting could signal that institutional money is quietly preparing for a turnaround. While fear continues to dominate short-term price action, stablecoin activity suggests that deep-pocketed players are positioning for what could become the next major phase of recovery. USDT Dominance Spikes, But A Key Level Could Signal Recovery The chart shows USDT dominance rebounding to 4.78%, reflecting a cautious market still leaning toward stablecoins after last week’s sharp sell-off. During Friday’s crash, Tether dominance briefly spiked to 5.5%, its highest since April, as investors sought safety amid panic. While the ratio has since cooled, it remains elevated — a sign that traders are still hesitant to rotate back into Bitcoin and altcoins. Technically, dominance is now sitting above key moving averages, showing short-term strength for stable liquidity. However, analysts are watching a critical level at 3.96%. Historically, when USDT dominance falls below 3.96%, it signals that capital is flowing back into risk assets — often marking the early stages of altcoin recoveries. If dominance fails to sustain above 4.5% and trends downward, it could indicate that investors are beginning to redeploy capital into the broader crypto market. Combined with the recent $4.5 billion in new stablecoin issuance from Tether and Circle, the setup suggests that while fear still dominates sentiment, liquidity is quietly building on the sidelines — ready to re-enter once confidence returns. A sustained drop below 3.96% would therefore be a bullish signal for altcoins and a potential turning point for the market.

The platform has reaffirmed the sole official appeal channels for lifting withdrawal limits and, importantly, launched a new anti-fraud reporting mailbox . The initiative targets scams in which fraudsters impersonate HTX staff and demand illegitimate fees under the pretext of “unfreezing withdrawal limits”. This move marks a critical step in HTX’s evolving strategy toward user security education and systemic fraud prevention. Targeted Fraud Prevention: Official Channels as a Firewall In the crypto asset space, scams that exploit user anxiety—especially those involving fake “asset unfreezing” services—are alarmingly frequent. HTX’s announcement draws a clear boundary: the only valid methods to appeal withdrawal restrictions are via the platform’s in-app Help Center system and the official customer service email ( htxsupport@htx-inc.com ). The service is completely free of charge . Any attempt to bypass these channels, collect fees, or impersonate HTX staff is considered fraud. To combat such activities, HTX has also introduced a new reporting email: ia@htx-inc.com . Users who encounter impersonators or suspicious actors claiming to represent HTX are encouraged to report them. Once a case is verified, the platform will take strict enforcement actions and assist in recovering any associated funds. By designating these trusted channels —bound email and in-app support—HTX is cutting off fraudsters at the source. This simplifies the appeal process for users while neutralizing external attempts to exploit confusion or misinformation. From Process Control to Systemic Security: Building a Trust-Based Safety Framework As a globally recognized digital asset platform, HTX adheres to a “user-first, security-driven” philosophy. This latest update is more than a procedural clarification; it represents a shift from isolated defense tactics to a comprehensive anti-fraud system . On one hand, HTX has proactively integrated the sensitive issue of “withdrawal limits” into its broader risk control framework, presenting it as a protective mechanism rather than a punitive one. With a guaranteed 24-hour response time and real-time case tracking , users now benefit from a service experience defined by transparency and trust. On the other, by reiterating that all appeal-related services are completely free and by introducing an official reporting mechanism , HTX is encouraging its users to become active participants in fraud detection. This creates a shared ecosystem of platform-user co-governance , forming a more resilient and collaborative defense line against scams. Industry Implications: Fraud Prevention as a Shared Responsibility As crypto adoption expands, scam tactics are evolving—especially those exploiting “frozen funds” narratives. HTX’s proactive stance—clarifying its official processes and launching a fraud reporting channel—signals a paradigm shift: from reactive to preventative, from siloed to systemic. This model provides a valuable blueprint for the broader industry. Effective anti-fraud strategies are not just technological, but ethical and collaborative. Platforms must set clear policies, empower users, and act decisively against bad actors. Only through such unified efforts can the space maintain its integrity and ensure user confidence. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to strengthen its identity verification systems and behavioral risk controls, while collaborating with global regulators, industry partners, and cybersecurity firms to build a safer, more transparent crypto ecosystem.

Trump made the statement after days of rising tension following his threat to impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports. A reporter asked Trump if the U.S. was preparing for a trade war with China, to which he answered, “Well, we’re in one now.” He emphasized that the tariffs are America’s main tool of defense against unfair trade practices. His remarks mark the first official acknowledgment from the administration that trade hostilities with China have fully reignited. Trump defends tariffs and says they protect America President Donald Trump said, “If we didn’t have tariffs, we would have no defense.” He argued that the tariffs stop foreign nations like China from flooding the U.S. market with cheap goods and controlling critical industries that America depends on. Just last week, the President posted on social media, stating that he would impose a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports. His announcement triggered fear across global markets, as Bitcoin prices dropped quickly from around $121,560 to below $103,000 within a few hours. Traders and analysts said the sudden drop shows just how sensitive the market is to signs of rising tension between the world’s two largest economies. The reaction also reminds people just how much power Trump’s words still carry. People who support these trade policies argue that the tariffs will prompt companies to reconsider relocating production outside the United States and make trade more equitable. They also argue that the tariffs will push businesses to make goods locally, even if that means paying more in the short term, which will help the country become more self-reliant. On the other hand, critics argue that the tariffs will increase prices for everyday goods, including electronics, clothing, and machinery. They also warn that American farmers and exporters could lose access to key markets if China responds with its own tariffs. The markets did not crash as many people had expected following Trump’s announcements, and prices even began to stabilize after an initial shock. U.S. stock futures remained mostly steady, and Bitcoin prices increased by about 0.1% over the next few hours. Experts say this indicates that investors no longer panic as quickly as they did before, because they have grown accustomed to Trump’s strong language regarding China. A few analysts think Trump’s approach is a deliberate strategy to put more pressure on China and gain the upper hand before trade talks between the two governments. Bessent criticizes China’s “disappointing actions” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke on Wednesday and criticized what he called China’s “disappointing actions” in trade and resource control. He said the Chinese government is making choices that could slow down the entire global economy and cause serious harm to China’s own industries and workers at the same time. “If some in the Chinese government want to slow down the global economy through disappointing actions and economic coercion, the Chinese economy will be hurt the most,” Bessent said in his statement. Bessent said that China’s restrictions on exports, such as rare earth minerals, will disrupt global supply chains and make it difficult for companies everywhere to plan their production. The Treasury Secretary stated that these restrictions create fear and uncertainty, which will ultimately prompt companies to relocate their supply chains away from China. In the long run, this will reduce China’s influence and slow down its economic growth. Bessent said that China’s approach to trade is damaging its relationships with other countries. He explained that the U.S. and its allies have been working with Beijing for many years to encourage open trade and shared progress that would benefit everyone. However, countries are beginning to see China as a threat to stability because its actions make it difficult to maintain trust. “This is China versus the world,” Bessent said firmly, adding that “we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled by a group of bureaucrats in Beijing.” Bessent said that Washington is helping its allies establish new production centers and identify new sources of raw materials, thereby reducing their dependence on any single country.

This statement was made after Kent, who oversees the RBA’s engagement with financial markets, noted that narrower loan spreads and households making extra mortgage repayments amid lower interest rates signal improving conditions. Meanwhile, apart from the above considerations, analysts have also highlighted an increase in credit growth driven by escalating demand for housing. Moreover, stiff competition among lenders and reduced funding costs have inspired businesses to borrow more. Australia’s central bank anticipates a balanced economy amid lessened financial conditions While addressing the CFA Society Australia in Sydney, Kent mentioned that the RBA’s predictions suggest that the toughness of financial conditions has reduced, thus establishing a balanced economy in the future. This includes full employment and inflation approaching the center of their target range, said the assistant governor. Notably, the RBA wants to maintain an inflation range between 2% and 3%. Kent’s remarks came a day after his colleague, Sarah Hunter, forecasted that the country’s underlying inflation for the three months ending in September will probably be stronger than what the RBA had earlier predicted. This indicated a slightly tougher stance. In the meantime, Hunter and Kent’s statements collectively demonstrate the central bank’s belief that recent policy changes, particularly the three interest rate cuts this year and the improvement in credit conditions, are helping the economy stabilize after a tough period of tightening. Concerning the situation, several officials have weighed in on the topic of discussion. Based on their argument, this aligns with inflation gradually returning to its target. However, they warned of the uncertainties ahead as they await the review of the final price report for the third quarter. On November 3-4, the monetary policy board is scheduled to hold a meeting. Regarding this meeting, economists have predicted that a cut would be imposed on the benchmark rate. Traders, on the other hand, speculate that the decision will go either way. September’s employment data, which will be published in a few hours, is crucial in this decision. Kent illustrates the estimates of financial status in the current market conditions Kent cautioned that the outlook in the future will depend on how new figures impact views of economic growth, inflation, and potential risks. Meanwhile, the assistant governor mentioned that the RBA prefers the use of various methods to assess financial conditions because of the uncertainties involved. An example of these methods is to compare the cash rate with estimates of the nominal neutral rate. According to Kent, model-based estimates suggest that financial conditions have been strict, which helps reduce overall demand. While he does not specify a number, the assistant governor highlighted that the cash rate is expected to decline within a wider range, given the current market conditions. “The estimates of the neutral rate match with several indicators of financial conditions,” he said. “In fact, various indicators – including mortgage payments and housing credit growth – have already started to display early signs of responding to this year’s easing in financial conditions.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|RBA,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-16 01:57:51

His simple response — “True” — came after a widely shared post linking recent gains in gold, silver and Bitcoin to heavy government spending and currency debasement. Markets and crypto fans noticed fast.

Musk agreed with the thread. He added a view that echoes a common pro-Bitcoin line: fiat can be printed, while Bitcoin’s tie to energy gives it a different kind of backing. That single-word answer reopened a conversation many thought had cooled. The money is not the problem: AI is the new global arms race, and capex will eventually be funded by governments (US and China).

That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 14, 2025 Tesla’s Past Moves And Holdings Based on reports, Tesla bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in early 2021 and said it would take the coin as payment for cars. But the deal was short-lived. The company soon stopped accepting Bitcoin because of concerns about mining’s heavy energy use and said it might resume payments only after a major move toward renewable mining practices. By mid-2022, Tesla sold about 75% of its holdings, a move that happened near a market low and drew wide notice. According to Arkham Intelligence, Tesla still holds roughly 11,509 BTC, which is worth about $1.25 billion at current prices. What The Market Might Be Watching Traders read signals.

A close above the $113,700 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $114,500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $115,250 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $115,500. Another Decline In BTC?

The U.S. Department of Justice described the case as ‘first of its kind’ due to the complex nature of the scam. The two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, are facing conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering charges for allegedly exploiting the Ethereum blockchain’s transaction validation process in 2023. According to the prosecutors, the brothers used their advanced technical skills in the blockchain network to manipulate pending trades on the network. The brothers took away $25 million in Ethereum tokens in just 12 seconds. Ethereum ‘Exploit’ case puts blockchain integrity under legal scrutiny According to a release by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Peraire-Bueno brothers, who studied computer science and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, allegedly used their special skills in blockchain technology to compromise the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain. The two brothers have pleaded not guilty and are currently free on a $250,000 bail each. The trial sought an educated Jury panel, half of which holds a master’s degree in several areas of study, including finance and medicine. U.S. District Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke led the first trial. The education levels of the selected Jury reflect the complex technical nature of the case that they will have to evaluate. Prosecutors in the case will have to provide evidence showing that the two brothers studied the trading patterns of their victims before carrying out the code-based attack, which involved intercepting and rerouting pending Ethereum transactions. “Unfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for DOJ prosecutors and IRS agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme,” – Lisa Monaco , Deputy Attorney General The court filings revealed that the operation dubbed ‘the Exploit’ was meticulously planned over several months and carried out in seconds. They added that the two brothers analyzed blockchain data for several months, created shell companies, and created multiple wallets with foreign exchange accounts to conceal the proceeds. Prosecutors of the Exploit revealed that before and after the April 2023 incident, the two brothers conducted online searches for ‘how to wash crypto’, ‘fraudulent Ethereum addresses database’, and ‘money laundering statute of limitations’. They added that once the funds had been stolen, the two accused washed them through a network of transactions to hide the original wallet. Prosecutors say ‘Exploit’ case is key to safeguarding blockchain integrity Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described the alleged scheme as novel and has never been charged before. He acknowledged that, regardless of the sophisticated nature of the case, the Justice system will relentlessly pursue those who attack the financial system’s integrity. The defense attorneys argued that the prosecution mischaracterized the nature of the alleged attack. They stated that the brothers simply exploited flaws in the blockchain network. They added that the accused only exploited the predatory nature of automated trading bots in the decentralized ecosystem. The defense also argued that there were no direct interactions between the defendants and the alleged victims. Following the defense attorneys’ remarks, Judge Clarke barred them from making their claim based on the notion that the victims deserved the losses or from introducing expert testimony on the lack of crypto regulation. The move to bar the defense has created a setback for the defense’s legal strategy amid the trial, which is expected to continue into early November. If convicted, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno face up to 20 years in prison on each count. Prosecutors insist that safeguarding the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain is essential to maintaining investor confidence in decentralized ecosystems. Cryptopolitan reported last month on another sophisticated crime in which hackers hid malware inside Ethereum smart contracts. ReversingLabs’ research uncovered a malware campaign that used Ethereum smart contracts to conceal malicious software URLs. The findings revealed that the hackers used the npm packages colortoolv2 and mimelib2, which acted as downloaders.

The firm also revealed that it is working to add support for additional networks and ecosystems, aiming to provide its users with the best inventory of assets. It’s the first time Coinbase has signaled support for the native token of Binance’s ecosystem flagship asset, BNB. The firm added the digital asset and assured users that trading will commence once market-making support and sufficient technical infrastructure are established. Coinbase launches BNB perpetual futures on its platform Assets added to the roadmap today: BNB (BNB) https://t.co/lyEugQo7Cv — Coinbase Markets 🛡️ (@CoinbaseMarkets) October 15, 2025 Coinbase’s interest in BNB started on April 3, when Coinbase Advanced began supporting BNB perpetual futures. The firm argued that introducing BNB perpetual futures trading on its international platforms presents new opportunities for traders. The initiative enabled Coinbase users to access perpetual futures contracts, a type of derivative that doesn’t have an expiration date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. The listing of BNB perpetual futures on the platform enables traders to take larger positions with borrowed funds, thereby amplifying their gains and losses. Binance co-founder, Changpeng Zhao, said the introduction of BNB perpetual futures on Coinbase enhances the network’s accessibility and credibility. The initiative allowed Coinbase to expand its derivatives market and position itself as a competitor to leading exchanges like Binance, which already offer BNB futures. The initiative was launched on Coinbase International Exchange for non-U.S. users and on Coinbase Advanced for experienced traders. CZ responded to the news, stating that BNB’s growth occurs naturally, although increased trading activity on major exchanges may lead to higher liquidity. The crypto exchange is also planning to list other digital assets, including Bitcoin Hyper, Maxi Doge, PEPENODE, and Snorter Bot. Barron’s research revealed that new listings on Coinbase average 91% gains in the first five days. At the time of publication, BNB is exchanging hands at around $1,168, down nearly 4.3% in the last 24 hours. The digital asset has also dropped by more than 11% in the last 7 days, but is up 27.1% in the last four weeks. CEXs charge nearly 16% for new crypto listings The new BNB listing on Coinbase comes as Binance refuted claims on Tuesday that it profits from its token listing process. The exchange’s remark was in response to CJ Hetherington, CEO of Limitless Labs, who made the claim. Hetherington alleged on Tuesday that Binance receives a 1% airdrop on the day of listings and a further 3% airdrop six months after listings. He also revealed that the exchange requires a 1% marketing fee at its discretion and a $250,000 security deposit before any listing. Hetherington also said Binance requested 3%, which is reserved for the BNB HODLer programme. According to the announcement, the exchange also requires a $2 million BNB security deposit for spot listings. He made the remarks despite Limitless receiving backing from Coinbase Ventures as well as the Base Ecosystem Fund. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , Binance responded to the founder’s claims, stating that they’re false and discriminatory and that the exchange reserves the right to pursue legal action. The exchange also stated that it was surprised by CJ’s unauthorized disclosure of confidential communications with Binance. The firm acknowledged that CJ’s publications damaged the integrity of what the industry and community understand, arguing that he clearly understood and knew to be sensitive and confidential information. Binance assured its users that it doesn’t charge any listing fees. The firm also revealed that any cash and token security deposits are typically refundable within a 1-2 year period. However, the co-founder of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, previously stated that Binance charges a listing fee of up to 8% of the total token supply. He also revealed that the centralized exchange requires projects to purchase and stake BNB, which is equivalent to around $5 million. Hayes added that Binance requires projects to distribute 8% of their token supply to Binance users through airdrops and other activities. He also said listings on Binance cost around 16% of a token’s supply and $5 million in BNB purchases. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The approval, announced Wednesday, marks the first de novo bank to receive national authorization under Comptroller Jonathan Gould, according to the Financial Times. Erebor Bank, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, filed its application on June 11, and its approval follows a four-month regulatory review. The OCC granted preliminary conditional approval to Erebor Bank after thorough review of its application. In granting this charter, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all charter applications. https://t.co/9G7WkRRohN pic.twitter.com/tQhLqNbtM9 — OCC (@USOCC) October 15, 2025 “I am committed to a dynamic and diverse federal banking system, and our decision today is a first but important step in living up to that commitment,” Gould said. Gould’s accompanying remarks indicated a notable shift from the regulator’s previous restrictive look: the OCC “does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities.” That statement shows one of the clearest indications yet that U.S. banking regulators may be reconsidering their restrictive stance toward crypto-linked financial services, which was further exacerbated by the 2023 collapses of several crypto banks. Analysts view the OCC’s decision as a watershed moment for the industry, a sign that Washington is ready to experiment with responsible crypto banking, provided institutions can demonstrate robust compliance and risk controls. If Erebor secures full authorization, it could become a test case for how regulators manage digital asset exposure within federally chartered banks and a potential model for others seeking to bridge the gap between traditional banking and digital finance. The question now shifts to what Erebor will offer. After SVB’s Fall, Erebor Bank Steps In to Serve Tech and Crypto Businesses In the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s dramatic collapse in 2023, which sent shockwaves through the startup and venture capital ecosystem, Erebor Bank is emerging as a deliberate attempt to fill the vacuum left in the financing of America’s economy. Erebor seeks to serve clients in high-growth , high-tech sectors, including artificial intelligence, defense, manufacturing, and digital assets, as well as payment processors, venture funds, and trading firms. The bank’s charter aims to operate as a full-service national bank, offering both traditional deposit and lending services, while integrating digital asset operations under a tightly regulated framework. Peter Thiel @peterthiel joins tech billionaires in backing Erebor, a new US bank set to fill the funding gap left by Silicon Valley Bank’s 2023 collapse. #Erebor #PeterThiel https://t.co/x4NarhsPGz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 2, 2025 According to its filings, Erebor expects to hold approximately $1 million in cryptocurrency for transactional purposes, indicating limited but deliberate exposure to digital assets. Unlike the risk-heavy approach that defined some of its predecessors, Erebor’s model aims for conservatism and compliance. A source close to the company told the Financial Times that Erebor aims to be “a stable, low-risk, reliable bank doing normal banking things without screwing everyone over with undue risk.” The fall of SVB, along with Silvergate, Signature Bank, and First Republic , had left tech startups and crypto firms struggling to find stable banking partners. This disruption forced many to seek offshore or non-traditional solutions , a gap Erebor now seeks to fill with institutional discipline and Silicon Valley know-how. Still, Erebor is not fully operational yet. The OCC’s conditional approval means the institution must complete a series of compliance, cybersecurity, and capital adequacy reviews, a process that could take several months, before receiving a final charter. How Erebor’s Approval Reflects Washington’s Crypto Policy Pivot Erebor’s approval comes amid broader regulatory momentum in Washington. President Donald Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act , a landmark bill establishing oversight rules for stablecoin issuers, while Congress continues to debate broader crypto market structure legislation and limits on a central bank digital currency (CBDC). @SECGov Chair Paul Atkins has reaffirmed support for a crypto market structure bill as the White House expects the bill to pass by year-end 2025. #Bitcoin #Marketstructure #SEC https://t.co/cBbLNtKeS9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 The new policy climate has encouraged several crypto-linked firms, including Coinbase, Circle, and Ripple, to pursue national trust or banking charters with the OCC. In May, the OCC issued updated guidance confirming that banks may buy and sell cryptocurrencies held in custody at the direction of customers, an important reversal of prior restrictions. @Coinbase has filed an application with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a National Trust Company Charter. #Coinbase #Crypto https://t.co/WruBToItQd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 4, 2025 The policy also allows institutions to outsource crypto custody and execution to third parties, provided they meet strict safety and soundness standards. The clarification marked a clear shift toward integrating crypto activities within federally regulated banks. Gould’s appointment in June reinforced that direction. The former Bitfury executive and OCC veteran was confirmed by the Senate in a narrow 50–45 vote , becoming the agency’s first permanent chief since 2020. The US Senate has confirmed former crypto exec Jonathan Gould as OCC chief in a 50–45 vote, naming him the first permanent head since 2020. #OCC #JonathanGould https://t.co/ipM7YhaG8B — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 11, 2025 His background in blockchain and digital assets has shaped a more open stance toward innovation in banking. Under his leadership, the OCC has already removed references to “reputation risk” in its internal guidance, a change viewed as reducing barriers for banks engaging in crypto-related service s. Despite the shift, some lawmakers have voiced concerns about the growing ties between politics and cryptocurrency. In August, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Ron Wyden urged Gould to investigate potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump’s personal involvement in crypto ventures, particularly a stablecoin called USD1 issued by World Liberty Financial. The senators questioned whether the OCC could maintain impartial oversight as it becomes the primary regulator for stablecoins under the GENIUS Act.

A $1.3 billion LuBian-linked wallet transfer followed the DOJ’s $15 billion crypto seizure, while a proposed $9.3 trillion 401(k) bill could drive institutional inflows. At the same time, NFTs are rebounding after a $1.2 billion crash, and Bitcoin’s triple-bottom pattern signals a potential breakout toward $130,000 in Q4. $1.3B LuBian Wallet Move Follows $15B DOJ Seizure The U.S. Department of Justice revealed a $15 billion crypto seizure just a day after a wallet linked to China’s LuBian mining pool transferred $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin, its first major move in three years. Blockchain trackers Lookonchain and Arkham confirmed that 11,886 BTC were shifted amid the filing. The DOJ’s case names Cambodia’s Prince Holding Group for laundering illicit funds through LuBian and its affiliates. Under President Trump’s new executive order, any seized Bitcoin could be added to the U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve once approved. JUST IN: The US government just moved 9,756 BTC (≈$1.1B) linked to Chen Zhi’s “Pig Butchering” scam. One of LuBian’s wallets (39DUz) woke up after 3 years of dormancy, transferring all 9,757 BTC to new addresses.

The move follows the Labor Department’s rollback of Biden-era restrictions that discouraged crypto exposure in retirement accounts. JUST IN: Congressman Troy Downing to introduce bill that would cement President Trump's executive order allowing #Bitcoin in 401(k)s into law pic.twitter.com/egTr4wNnJo — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 14, 2025 If approved, the legislation would open long-term access to Bitcoin through 401(k) plans, which currently manage over $9.3 trillion in assets. Analysts say even a small allocation toward digital assets could channel billions into the crypto market. The proposal has fueled optimism across the industry, with investors viewing it as a pivotal step toward mainstream adoption and a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s next major price surge. Crypto and NFT Markets Rebound After $1.2B Crash The crypto market rebounded sharply after Friday’s $1.2 billion selloff, with NFTs recovering from a steep drop. According to CoinGecko, total NFT market value fell from $6.2 billion to $5 billion before stabilizing near $5.5 billion as Bitcoin and altcoins regained footing. Top Ethereum-based collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks saw mild losses, while others such as Mutant Ape Yacht Club began climbing again. Bitcoin also bounced back after briefly dipping amid market panic over Trump’s tariff comments. Investors invested $3.17 billion into cryptocurrency funds in spite of the enormous liquidations, indicating a growing confidence in digital assets. Despite heavy liquidations, crypto funds saw $3.17 billion in new inflows, signaling investor confidence in digital assets. Analysts say the swift recovery highlights resilience across NFTs and crypto, reinforcing optimism for sustained growth as market sentiment stabilizes. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Triple-Bottom Pattern Eyes $130,000 Breakout Zone Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is forming a strong triple-bottom pattern near $109,600, a key level that has triggered multiple reversals since late September. The setup signals easing selling pressure and growing accumulation, with higher lows forming along the neckline. On the two-hour chart, BTC trades below the 100-period SMMA at $116,054, aligning with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $116,108, creating a decisive resistance zone before a breakout. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI at 43 is curving upward from oversold levels, suggesting early bullish divergence and improving momentum. A confirmed close above $114,600 would validate the triple-bottom pattern and likely accelerate buying activity. While Bitcoin remains within a descending channel, TradingView’s path projection signals a breakout toward $117,600 and $119,800 if momentum strengthens. A sustained move above $120,000 could flip market sentiment bullish, opening targets at $125,000 and $130,000. Traders may look for long setups above $114,600, with stop-losses under $109,500 and initial targets at $117,600–$119,800. As institutional inflows build and volatility compresses, Bitcoin’s current consolidation could mark the base for its next upward phase, potentially defining the start of a stronger Q4 rally.
