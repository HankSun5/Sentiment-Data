Traders and whales from Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum communities are reallocating capital into high-momentum alternatives—most notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE. As the market transitions into Q3, the narrative is clear: smart capital is leaving overextended majors for early-stage projects with breakout setups, meme traction, and clear accumulation signals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of this strategic rotation. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Renewed Optimism XRP is holding firm around $2.35 after bouncing from recent lows, with bullish divergence emerging across multiple technical timeframes. Whale accumulation wallets have steadily increased, suggesting that larger players are quietly building positions. The conclusion of Ripple’s SEC case and improved on-chain metrics have made XRP a strong candidate for Q3 rotation flows. As developers continue to build financial tools on its fast, low-cost settlement network, sentiment is improving. While analysts are eyeing a push toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, many long-time XRP holders are now diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper upside as the altcoin cycle heats up. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to speculative play for traders rotating out of Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. What began as a niche meme coin is now dominating early-stage Telegram groups and discussion threads, thanks to its timely political branding and viral community-driven momentum. The project’s deflationary model, capped 100 billion supply, and alignment with election narratives have made MAGA a favorite for those chasing asymmetric upside. Whale activity is surging, with a recent 72.95 ETH buy ($133,743) marking the largest early-stage purchase of 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a true accumulation phase, and analysts now call it the last major 50x opportunity of the cycle. As retail and institutional capital flows in, MAGA is poised for breakout price discovery before listings hit the public charts. Solana, SUI, and Ethereum: Capital Rotation Underway Solana (SOL) remains resilient above $170, but faces near-term exhaustion as price action cools. Some traders are reallocating profits into more volatile tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is more attractive. SUI is gaining attention after recent network upgrades and rising developer interest, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a long-term accumulation target. ETH’s Layer-2 activity and validator growth keep it foundational, but for short-term explosive returns, many investors are now selectively rotating into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin: From All-Time Highs to Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000 has been fueled by institutional demand and bullish technicals, with analysts forecasting potential highs of $125,000–$150,000 in 2025. However, as BTC stabilizes, the options market and on-chain data show traders increasingly shifting focus to altcoins for higher multiples. This rotation is driving new volume and volatility into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now seen as the high-conviction play for those seeking exponential upside in the current cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The current market is witnessing a major rotation as Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum traders move capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. With whale accumulation at record highs, a $0.007 listing target, and the largest single early-stage buy of 2025 already on the books, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the breakout candidate for Q3. As the window for early entry closes, analysts agree: MAGA is set to lead the next wave of crypto gains, making it the top altcoin to watch as capital rotates out of overextended majors.

According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the market can expect several large deals to be announced in the coming weeks. This kind of statement from such a high-level official is significant and warrants attention, particularly for those navigating the complex waters of the financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Who is Scott Bessent and Why Does His Word Matter for Market Impact? Scott Bessent serves as the Secretary of the US Treasury , a pivotal role in the United States government. The Treasury Department is responsible for managing the nation’s finances, including tax collection, currency production, and managing government accounts and public debt. More broadly, the Treasury plays a crucial role in shaping economic policy, implementing sanctions, and overseeing financial regulations. Therefore, any forward-looking statements from the Treasury Secretary carry considerable weight and can provide insights into the government’s economic priorities and upcoming actions. When Secretary Bessent speaks of expecting “several large deals ,” he is likely referring to significant transactions or initiatives that could have broad economic implications. These might involve: Major mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that require regulatory review or government facilitation. Significant government contracts or infrastructure projects. International financial agreements or trade deals. Potential regulatory changes or enforcement actions impacting major industries. Large-scale bond issuances or debt management strategies. The specific nature of these deals remains undisclosed, adding an element of mystery and prompting speculation across various sectors. What Kind of Large Deals Could the US Treasury Be Signaling? While Secretary Bessent’s statement is concise, the term “large deals” from the perspective of the US Treasury can encompass a wide range of possibilities, each with distinct potential outcomes. Understanding the potential scope helps us gauge the possible market impact . Consider these possibilities: 1. Infrastructure and Public Works: The government often facilitates or funds massive infrastructure projects. Announcements here could involve billions in spending on roads, bridges, energy grids, or digital infrastructure. Such deals stimulate specific industries and can have a ripple effect on employment and economic growth. 2. Regulatory Actions and Policy Shifts: The Treasury is involved in financial regulation. A “large deal” might not be a transaction but a significant policy shift or a major enforcement action against a large financial institution or industry. These can reshape competitive landscapes and introduce new compliance burdens or opportunities. 3. International Financial Agreements: In a globalized economy, the US Treasury is constantly engaged in discussions and agreements with other nations regarding trade, currency stability, sanctions, and international debt. Major deals here could impact global markets, currency exchange rates, and international capital flows. 4. Strategic Industry Support or Divestiture: Occasionally, the government might be involved in supporting or divesting from strategically important industries or assets. This could involve anything from energy sector support to the sale of government-held stakes in certain entities. 5. Debt and Fiscal Management: While perhaps less a “deal” in the traditional sense, major announcements regarding US debt management, bond issuance strategies, or significant fiscal policy changes could be framed as large financial undertakings by the Treasury. The ambiguity allows for broad interpretation, which is why market participants are keenly awaiting further details. The timing, described as “coming weeks,” suggests these announcements are imminent rather than distant. How Could These US Treasury Announcements Create Market Impact, Especially for Crypto? At first glance, news about US Treasury deals might seem unrelated to the world of cryptocurrency. However, the traditional financial system and the crypto market are increasingly interconnected. Major macroeconomic events and significant developments in traditional finance inevitably have a ripple effect on digital assets. Here’s how Secretary Bessent’s anticipated announcements could create market impact for crypto: 1. Overall Market Sentiment: Large, positive economic deals (e.g., significant infrastructure spending, favorable international agreements) can boost overall market confidence and risk appetite. When traditional markets are bullish, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, announcements perceived negatively (e.g., regulatory crackdowns, unfavorable economic outlooks) could lead to a flight to safety, potentially causing sell-offs in crypto. 2. Liquidity and Capital Flows: Major deals often involve significant movements of capital. Increased economic activity or investment stemming from these deals could increase overall liquidity in the financial system. While not directly flowing into crypto, higher liquidity generally creates a more favorable environment for asset prices across the board. 3. Inflation and Economic Outlook: Depending on the nature of the deals, they could influence expectations about inflation, economic growth, or interest rates. For instance, large government spending could be seen as inflationary, which has historically been a narrative that benefits scarce assets like Bitcoin. Announcements signaling economic strength might reduce the appeal of safe havens but increase confidence in growth assets. 4. Regulatory Environment: If any of the “large deals” involve new financial regulations or the enforcement of existing ones, this could directly impact the cryptocurrency industry. Increased regulatory clarity (or uncertainty) is a major factor influencing institutional adoption and market stability for crypto. 5. US Dollar Strength: Treasury actions and major economic deals can influence the strength of the US dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes put pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in USD and seen by some as alternative stores of value. It’s crucial for those following crypto news to pay close attention to these developments from the US Treasury . While the connection might not always be direct, the macroeconomic environment shaped by these announcements is a powerful force influencing investment decisions globally. What Should Crypto Investors Do Ahead of These Large Deals? Given the potential for significant market impact stemming from the anticipated large deals announced by the US Treasury , how should crypto investors prepare? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on traditional financial news outlets and official US Treasury announcements in the coming weeks. Understand the details of the deals as they are revealed, not just the headlines. Assess Potential Implications: Once details emerge, try to analyze how the specific nature of the deals could affect the broader economy, inflation expectations, regulatory landscape, and overall market sentiment. Consider both positive and negative potential outcomes. Review Your Portfolio: Think about how different scenarios resulting from the announcements might affect your current crypto holdings. Are you heavily invested in assets sensitive to regulatory changes? Or perhaps assets seen as hedges against inflation? Manage Risk: Volatility can increase around major economic announcements. Ensure your portfolio is adequately diversified and that you are not overexposed to sudden market shifts. Consider setting stop-loss orders or taking other risk management measures if you trade actively. Avoid Panic Reactions: Initial market reactions can sometimes be overblown or based on incomplete information. Take time to understand the full picture before making significant changes to your investment strategy based solely on the immediate news reaction. The comments from Scott Bessent serve as a heads-up that significant financial news is on the horizon. Proactive preparation and informed analysis will be key to navigating the potential market movements that follow. Potential Benefits and Challenges for Crypto from Treasury Announcements Let’s quickly summarize the potential upside and downside for the crypto market based on the type and reaction to these anticipated large deals : Potential Benefit Scenarios Potential Challenge Scenarios Deals boost overall economic confidence and risk appetite. Deals signal tighter regulation impacting crypto directly or indirectly. Deals involve significant stimulus perceived as inflationary. Deals lead to a stronger USD, potentially pressuring crypto prices. Deals create new infrastructure or tech opportunities beneficial to blockchain. Deals reveal negative economic outlook or increased fiscal instability. Deals improve international financial stability. Market reacts negatively to the specifics of the announced deals. Increased liquidity flows broadly benefit asset markets. Capital flows are directed away from risk assets towards traditional safe havens. This table illustrates that the impact is not predetermined and will depend entirely on the specifics of what Scott Bessent and the US Treasury announce. Conclusion: Staying Alert in a Connected Financial World Scott Bessent ‘s statement about expecting several large deals in the coming weeks is a clear signal that significant economic activity is anticipated at the highest levels of the US Treasury . While the details remain under wraps, the potential for these announcements to create notable market impact across various sectors, including the increasingly integrated world of cryptocurrency, is undeniable. For anyone tracking crypto news , this serves as a reminder that macroeconomics plays a vital role in the performance of digital assets. Staying informed about these developments, understanding their potential implications, and managing risk are essential steps in navigating the markets during periods of significant government announcements. The coming weeks promise to be interesting, so keep your eyes peeled for news from the US Treasury .

Head of Pantera Capital Dan Morehead, in an interview, revealed that many crypto companies are preparing for public offerings. In the next few months, both Circle and Figure will prepare for their IPOs. This is a significant change for blockchain activity in the United States, as the rules surrounding the industry become friendlier rather than stricter. Morehead believes the change resulted from recent policy updates. The SEC’s decision to withdraw Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 is an example of this kind of change.

Casten, Smith Call for DOJ Inquiry Into Trump Gala In the letter from Casten and Smith, backed by 35 House Democrats, the lawmakers claim that the dinner for the top 220 $TRUMP investors held on Thursday “invites foreign influence over U.S. policy decisions and raises potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” https://twitter.com/Eleanor_Mueller/status/1925606223539269693 “It is just the latest example of President Trump disregarding ethics norms, introducing further conflicts of interest, and using his office for self-enrichment,” Casten and Smith said. In particular, the two representatives emphasized concerns over Chinese Tron founder Justin Sun’s recent announcement that he was the top investor of Trump’s namesake meme coin , exacerbating foreign influence concerns. Sun faced fraud charges from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission over his Tron blockchain, though those were recently dropped shortly after investing millions in the Trump-affiliated crypto platform, World Liberty Financial. “U.S. law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to U.S. political campaigns,” the lawmakers said. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” Democrats Question $TRUMP Dinner Ethics Hosted at Trump National Golf Club just outside of Washington, D.C., the $TRUMP gala dinner drew a wave of pushback from Democratic lawmakers who expressed issues over potential ethics concerns. On Thursday, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters (D-CA) introduced a new bill that would prohibit elected officials from owning a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. However, it is still unclear if Democrats hold enough sway to enact legislation against Trump’s crypto affairs.

For those plugged into the crypto and blockchain space, staying ahead of the curve on frontier tech like AI is crucial, as these innovations often shape future digital economies and investment opportunities. A major development just hit the wires: OpenAI Jony Ive are joining forces in a monumental deal that signals a bold new direction for AI. OpenAI Jony Ive: A $6.5 Billion Bet on the Future In a move that sent ripples through the tech industry, OpenAI has acquired io, the secretive device startup co-founded by legendary designer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This wasn’t a small cash purchase; it was a staggering $6.5 billion all-equity deal, representing OpenAI’s largest acquisition to date. The core of the deal brings Ive, the design genius behind iconic Apple products like the iPhone, iMac, and iPod, into the OpenAI fold. Through his creative firm, LoveFrom, Ive will now lead design and creative efforts for OpenAI. The clear objective behind this massive investment and high-profile partnership? To take AI beyond the screen and spearhead the creation of a new generation of AI consumer devices . This isn’t just about software anymore; it’s about building tangible products that integrate AI seamlessly into our daily lives, potentially creating entirely new markets and user experiences. Sam Altman OpenAI and the ‘AI iPhone’ Vision The narrative surrounding the Sam Altman OpenAI and Jony Ive partnership is unmistakable: OpenAI is positioning itself to replicate the kind of paradigm-shifting impact Apple had with the iPhone. Sam Altman is being framed as the visionary, akin to Steve Jobs, while Jony Ive is the design maestro tasked with making that vision a tangible, desirable reality. The staged photos of the duo circulating on social media only reinforced this carefully crafted message. The goal is clear: take the revolutionary impact of the iPhone launch and apply it to artificial intelligence, creating devices that redefine how we interact with technology. This focus on AI consumer devices highlights a strategic shift. While much of the AI conversation has centered on large language models, generative AI, and software applications, the next frontier is integrating this intelligence into hardware that users interact with directly, intuitively, and constantly. Think wearables, ambient computing, or entirely new form factors we haven’t even imagined yet. Ive’s expertise in human-centric design and creating beloved products is precisely what OpenAI needs to translate powerful AI models into accessible and appealing devices. Contrasting Strategies: OpenAI’s Bold Move vs. Google AI Strategy This aggressive push by OpenAI, securing a design legend and betting billions on hardware, starkly contrasts with how other tech giants are approaching the AI race, particularly the perceived Google AI strategy . While Google has been a pioneer in AI research and continues to integrate AI into its vast suite of services (as seen with their AI-powered search upgrades demonstrated at Google I/O), OpenAI’s move with Ive suggests a focus on creating disruptive, standalone AI hardware products from the ground up. This isn’t just about enhancing existing products; it’s about building entirely new ones. The recent Google I/O event, as discussed on Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast, showcased Google’s advancements, including the return of concepts like Google Glass (albeit in a different context) and developer reactions to AI search. However, OpenAI’s partnership with Ive positions them not just as a leader in AI models, but as a potential leader in the future of AI hardware design, directly challenging established players in the consumer device space. The Promise of AI Innovation Beyond the Screen The potential for AI innovation driven by this partnership is immense. Jony Ive’s design philosophy has always been about simplifying technology and making it feel intuitive and magical. Applying this approach to AI could result in devices that are not just smart, but truly enhance human capabilities and interactions without the need for traditional screens or interfaces. Imagine AI companions integrated into wearables that provide real-time information, context-aware assistance, or seamless control over your environment, all designed with the elegance and usability Ive is known for. The implications for the broader tech ecosystem, including areas relevant to cryptocurrency and Web3, are significant. As AI becomes more embedded in physical devices, it could drive new forms of data ownership, decentralized AI processing, or novel incentive structures that intersect with blockchain technology. The infrastructure required to support billions of AI-powered devices will also present opportunities and challenges for decentralized networks. Beyond the OpenAI and Google news, the Equity podcast also delved into other notable tech stories, including: Insights from Google I/O, touching upon developer sentiment regarding AI tools and the potential resurgence of concepts like Google Glass. Updates on Luminar, the lidar startup, navigating layoffs, CEO changes, and fundraising efforts. A look at 23andMe’s new direction and the potential uses of its vast DNA data repository under new ownership. These diverse topics highlight the dynamic and interconnected nature of the current technology landscape, where advancements in one area, like AI, can have ripple effects across multiple industries. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Devices The partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive is far more than just a high-profile acquisition; it’s a strategic declaration that OpenAI is serious about bringing AI into the physical world through thoughtfully designed consumer devices. By combining cutting-edge AI research with unparalleled design expertise, they are aiming for nothing less than creating the next foundational technology platform, much like the personal computer and the smartphone before it. This move sets the stage for an exciting era of AI consumer devices that could fundamentally change how we live and interact with technology, pushing the boundaries of AI innovation and potentially opening up new frontiers for the digital economy.

According to the release, this move aims to improve Alchemy’s smart wallet ecosystem. Although the acquisition was completed on April 30, the financial details are not public. Benefits of Alchemy Acquisition Meanwhile, integrating HeyMint’s team and technology is expected to significantly enhance Alchemy’s developer tools and increase user engagement. As part of the acquisition, the main teams from HeyMint and its related platform, HeyMint Quest, will join Alchemy. This collaboration will help Alchemy grow its smart wallet ecosystem. Notably, HeyMint is a user-friendly launchpad that helps artists, brands, and developers create NFT collections easily, without needing advanced coding skills. Its simple tools and focus on community support make it a standout choice in the busy NFT market. Integrating these tools will help Alchemy provide a better solution for Web3 developers. This move also emphasizes Alchemy’s goal of being a one-stop shop for creating, launching, and managing Web3 applications, focusing on tools that put users first. Alchemy Expands Web 3.0 Developers’ Education Recall that the blockchain startup acquired ChainShot , a Web 3.0 educational platform for prospective developers, in 2022. With the deal, more developers gained free access to Web 3.0 developer education. This also aligned with the everyday goal of the blockchain development company, which is to “bring Web3 to a billion people.” Before now, Alchemy had noticed a huge gap preventing individuals from hopping into Web3.0. This course gives aspiring developers enough knowledge to dive into the crypto industry unperturbed. It is worth noting that this is the first of Alchemy’s acquisitions. Smart Wallet Simplifies Crypto Trading Recall that last year, the Coinbase exchange launched a new smart wallet designed to tackle key challenges in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem. As reported by TheCoinRise, the smart wallet is in sync with eight other networks: Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Zora, and Avalanche. Others are Polygon, BNB , and Arbitrum. Intriguingly, Coinbase says the goal is to expand and incorporate other networks over time. The smart wallet features are designed to streamline the enrollment procedures for new users. Furthermore, the wallet simplifies all the hurdles in getting started with crypto. It is also user-friendly and allows new users to set up and use their wallet with little effort. These advantages position it for wider adoption.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Barak said corporate service providers and centralized servers are expected to become honeypots for AI-assisted hackers and malicious actors looking to steal valuable data, including private keys, financial metadata, medical records, and government documents. Hackers targeting centralized entities have a ""massive"" return on investment (ROI) and are incentivized to hack centralized targets that contain millions of valuable records, the CEO told Cointelegraph. Barak added that ZK-proofs, a way of verifying onchain data without revealing it, solve this problem: ""Blockchain is going to improve cybersecurity around the world, because, for a hacker to get to actual data, they need to hack individual wallets, but their ROI would be one record instead of millions — not worth it. They are going to go elsewhere."" Privacy solutions have become a major focus for many Web3 developers, as the need to shield metadata from AI algorithms grows and large institutions demand privacy tools to protect sensitive data as a prerequisite to bringing their business operations onchain.

While Solana and XRP are grabbing headlines with their surging price action, the real story is the strategic positioning of smart money into MAGA before its public debut. With Bitcoin’s momentum steady and whale activity at record highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the top early-stage altcoin on every analyst’s radar. Ethereum Whales Signal the Next Altcoin Season Recent on-chain data reveals a surge in Ethereum whale accumulation, a classic precursor to altcoin season. According to Crypto Rover, large ETH holders have been aggressively buying, with one wallet alone scooping up 5,000 ETH—worth over $13 million—in a single hour. This buying spree has historically triggered bullish momentum not just for Ethereum, but for the broader altcoin market. As ETH whales load up, many are also diversifying into high-upside presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is even more attractive. With ETH trading at $2,650 and whale wallets betting on a broad rally, MAGA is perfectly positioned to benefit from the next liquidity wave. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Buys and Institutional-Grade Conviction MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing record-breaking whale activity, with a single 72.95 ETH transaction—valued at $133,743—marking the largest early-stage crypto buy of 2025. This direct allocation is not opportunistic, but a calculated institutional-style move that cements MAGA as a high-confidence project. With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting both retail and strategic capital before its $0.007 listing. Analysts are forecasting returns of 25x–200x, and with whales moving in before CoinMarketCap tracking even begins, the opportunity for outsized gains is clear. Early adopters are locking in their positions now, knowing that the biggest returns come before the public even sees the chart. Solana and XRP: Price Action Heats Up Solana (SOL) continues its steady climb, trading in the $170–$180 range and maintaining its position as a DeFi and developer favorite. Meanwhile, XRP is experiencing renewed whale accumulation and robust trading volumes, currently priced between $2.39 and $2.60. With regulatory clarity and the prospect of an XRP ETF, analysts are targeting $2.85–$3.40 in the near term, and $5.50–$15 by year-end if adoption accelerates. While both SOL and XRP are attracting smart capital, the most aggressive investors are also rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for a shot at exponential early-stage upside. Bitcoin and the Broader Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s anchor, recently surging past $109,500 and drawing renewed institutional and retail interest. Yet, as BTC stabilizes and capital rotates, the spotlight is shifting to altcoins with higher-multiple potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral narrative, capped supply, and record-setting presale momentum, is now the frontrunner for those seeking the next 100x opportunity in the current cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Ethereum whales are quietly loading MAGACOIN FINANCE as Solana and XRP heat up, signaling a pivotal shift in smart capital allocation for 2025. With the largest single whale buy of the year, over $8 million raised, and Stage 8 nearly full, MAGA is setting the standard for early-stage ROI. As the window for entry narrows, analysts agree: the real breakout for MAGACOIN FINANCE is just beginning.

This investment is specifically earmarked to accelerate the growth and capabilities of QCAD , the company’s pioneering stablecoin pegged directly to the value of the Canadian dollar. Why is This Stablecoin Funding Important? The successful completion of this stablecoin funding round highlights growing investor confidence in the potential of regulated, fiat-backed digital currencies, particularly within specific national markets like Canada. For Stablecorp and its QCAD project, this capital infusion is not just about expansion; it’s about building robust, transparent, and accessible financial infrastructure on the blockchain. The funding round saw participation from notable names in the crypto and venture capital space, including support from Coinbase Ventures . The involvement of a major player like Coinbase Ventures signals a strategic interest in the development of regulated stablecoins that can bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning world of decentralized applications and digital payments. What Does This Mean for QCAD and the Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Market? QCAD stands out as one of the prominent stablecoins designed specifically for the Canadian market, aiming to provide a digital representation of the Canadian dollar that can be easily transacted on blockchain networks. This funding is set to bolster several key areas: Enhanced FX Integrations: Improving the ability to seamlessly convert between QCAD and other currencies, facilitating international transactions and broader adoption. Payment Rail Development: Expanding the use of QCAD for everyday transactions and business payments, making it easier for individuals and companies to use the stablecoin for transferring value. New Trust Structure: Implementing a more robust and transparent structure for holding the reserves that back QCAD . This is crucial for building user trust and ensuring the stablecoin maintains its peg to the Canadian dollar stablecoin value reliably. Transparency around reserves is a critical factor for stablecoin credibility. The focus on these areas indicates Stablecorp’s commitment to making QCAD a practical and trustworthy digital asset for the Canadian economy. By improving infrastructure and transparency, they aim to address some of the common concerns surrounding stablecoins and encourage wider adoption among consumers, businesses, and financial institutions. Who is Stablecorp and What is QCAD? Stablecorp is a Canadian financial technology company focused on building infrastructure for digital assets. Their flagship product, QCAD , was launched to provide a stable, reliable digital asset equivalent to the Canadian dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, QCAD is designed to maintain a stable value, making it suitable for transactions, savings, and acting as a safe haven within the crypto ecosystem during market volatility. The operation of a stablecoin like QCAD typically involves holding reserves (in this case, Canadian dollars or highly liquid, Canadian dollar-denominated assets) equivalent to the amount of QCAD in circulation. The new trust structure aims to provide clearer oversight and verification of these reserves, aligning with best practices for stablecoin issuance and potentially paving the way for increased regulatory acceptance. The Context: Coinbase Ventures and Market Dynamics The news of Stablecorp’s funding round, reported by Betakit, came at a time when one of its investors, Coinbase, was navigating its own set of challenges, including a significant cyberattack and ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite these broader market and company-specific headwinds, the investment from Coinbase Ventures into Stablecorp underscores a strategic long-term view on the importance of stablecoins and the potential for growth in regulated markets like Canada. Coinbase Ventures’ investment portfolio often reflects Coinbase’s strategic priorities, which include fostering the growth of the crypto ecosystem through infrastructure development, expanding global reach, and supporting projects that enhance the utility and accessibility of digital assets. Investing in a Canadian dollar stablecoin aligns with these goals, potentially opening up new corridors for Canadian users on platforms like Coinbase in the future, or simply supporting the broader adoption of stable assets globally. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for QCAD? Benefits: Stability: Offers Canadian users a digital asset without the price volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies. Efficiency: Enables faster, cheaper transactions compared to traditional banking methods, especially for cross-border payments within Canada or internationally. Accessibility: Provides easier access to the crypto ecosystem for Canadians, acting as a stable on-ramp and off-ramp. Transparency: The planned new trust structure aims to increase confidence in the reserve backing. Innovation: Supports the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain use cases denominated in Canadian dollars. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: While Canada has made strides in crypto regulation, the specific framework for stablecoins continues to evolve. Adoption: Widespread adoption by consumers and businesses requires significant education and integration into existing financial systems. Competition: While QCAD is a leading Canadian dollar stablecoin, it faces potential competition from other stablecoin issuers or future digital currencies, including potentially a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the Bank of Canada. Operational Risks: Ensuring the security and reliability of the underlying technology and reserve management is paramount. Actionable Insights: What Should You Know? For individuals and businesses in Canada interested in digital assets: Keep an eye on QCAD’s integration into more platforms and services as a result of this stablecoin funding . Understand the difference between volatile cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like QCAD and how they can serve different purposes in a digital asset portfolio or for transactions. Pay attention to announcements regarding the new trust structure for reserves, as this is key to the stablecoin’s credibility. If you use platforms supported by Coinbase Ventures , this investment might signal future interoperability or support for QCAD . Summary: A Boost for the Canadian Digital Economy Stablecorp’s successful $1.8 million stablecoin funding round, bolstered by participation from investors like Coinbase Ventures , marks a significant step forward for the development and adoption of the Canadian dollar stablecoin , QCAD . By focusing on critical areas like FX integrations, payment rails, and reserve transparency through a new trust structure, Stablecorp is laying the groundwork for QCAD to become a more widely used and trusted digital representation of the Canadian dollar. While challenges remain, particularly regarding regulation and widespread adoption, this investment provides the resources needed to navigate these hurdles and push the Canadian digital asset space forward. The support from prominent investors like Coinbase Ventures underscores the global recognition of the potential for well-regulated, national currency-pegged stablecoins.

45019310,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=162688,1748040643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45019310.jpeg,Trump Memecoin Event: Potential Federal Law Violation Sparks Controversy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-memecoin-law-violation/,"BitcoinWorld Trump Memecoin Event: Potential Federal Law Violation Sparks Controversy The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency continues to generate headlines, and a recent event involving former U.S. President Donald Trump and a specific digital asset has ignited significant debate. According to a report by Forbes, a dinner event held for holders of the Trump Memecoin – often referred to simply as $TRUMP or TRUMP Coin – may have inadvertently crossed a legal line, potentially constituting a Federal Law Violation . What Happened at the Controversial Trump Memecoin Dinner? Picture this: a private dinner gathering specifically for individuals who hold a particular cryptocurrency named after a prominent political figure. This isn’t a campaign rally or an official government function. It’s an event celebrating and engaging with a specific, highly speculative digital asset – the Trump Memecoin . During this dinner, held recently, former President Trump reportedly appeared on a podium. The detail that caught the attention of observers, and subsequently Forbes, was the decoration on that podium: the unmistakable presidential seal. While appearing at an event is one thing, the use of official government symbols in specific contexts is governed by strict regulations in the United States. The event itself highlighted the growing trend of political figures interacting with the crypto space, particularly the phenomenon of memecoins tied to their personas or political movements. For holders of the TRUMP Coin , having the former President attend their dinner was undoubtedly a significant moment, potentially boosting morale and visibility for the digital asset. However, the presence of the presidential seal has raised serious questions about compliance with federal statutes designed to prevent the misuse of such powerful symbols. Decoding the Federal Law Violation Claim At the heart of the Forbes report is the assertion that the use of the presidential seal at this specific, private event linked to a financial asset could constitute a Federal Law Violation . This isn’t a minor technicality; it involves a specific statute designed to protect the integrity and non-partisanship of the symbols representing the highest office in the nation. The core argument is that placing the presidential seal on a podium used by a former President at an event for holders of a coin named after him could create a misleading impression. The law aims to prevent the public from believing that a private activity, organization, or product has official government approval, sponsorship, or endorsement when it does not. In the context of the Trump Memecoin dinner, the concern is that the presence of the seal might suggest that the event, or even the TRUMP Coin itself, somehow carries the imprimatur or approval of the U.S. government or the office of the President, even if it’s a former President using the seal. Understanding the Presidential Seal Law: Rules and Restrictions So, what exactly does the law say about using the presidential seal? The relevant statute is 18 U.S. Code § 713. This federal law explicitly prohibits the knowing display of the presidential seal, or any facsimile thereof, in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the false impression that such use is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the U U.S. government or any department, agency, or official thereof. The purpose of the Presidential Seal Law is clear: to safeguard the dignity and authority of the symbols of the presidency and prevent their exploitation for private, commercial, or partisan purposes. It ensures that when the presidential seal is displayed, it genuinely represents the official capacity and authority of the U.S. government, not a private venture or personal endorsement. Key aspects of the Presidential Seal Law include: Prohibition: It is illegal to use the seal in a way that falsely suggests government approval or authorization. Intent: The law focuses on whether the use is “reasonably calculated to convey the false impression,” meaning the likely perception by an observer is key. Scope: It applies to the seal itself and any representation so similar as to be easily mistaken for it. Penalties: Violators can face significant consequences, including fines and imprisonment for up to six months. While there are specific instances where the seal’s use is permitted (like official government documents, military use, or certain historical/educational contexts), its use in connection with private events, especially those tied to financial assets like the TRUMP Coin , falls into a legally sensitive area. The TRUMP Coin Phenomenon and Political Endorsements The rise of the TRUMP Coin is part of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market: political memecoins. These tokens are created, often on decentralized networks, and gain value primarily through speculation, community hype, and their association with a political figure or movement. The TRUMP Coin ($TRUMP on exchanges) is arguably the most prominent example of a memecoin directly tied to a former President. Holders and proponents often view these coins as a way to support or signal allegiance to the associated figure. However, they are highly volatile, lack underlying fundamentals, and are often susceptible to significant price swings based on news, social media trends, or activities of the associated person. The event where the presidential seal was displayed was, from one perspective, an engagement with this community and, from another, an implicit interaction with a specific financial asset tied to the former President’s name. The question of political endorsements in the crypto space is complex. While individuals are free to express support, using official symbols, especially those protected by law like the presidential seal, in a context that could be perceived as endorsing a private financial product, blurs the lines between personal political activity and the authority of public office. This is precisely the scenario the Presidential Seal Law is designed to prevent. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Political Events The dinner event for Trump Memecoin holders isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of an increasing trend of political figures wading into the crypto world, attending conferences, accepting donations in crypto, or having memecoins created in their likeness. These Crypto Political Events highlight the growing influence and financial power of the crypto community, making it an attractive demographic for politicians. However, this interaction comes with significant risks, both for the politicians and the public. For politicians, there are legal and ethical considerations, particularly regarding endorsements, financial regulations, and the use of official symbols. For the public and crypto investors, these events can be misleading, potentially giving undue credibility to speculative assets like memecoins based on perceived political backing. Understanding the nature of Crypto Political Events requires recognizing that they often operate in a regulatory grey area. Memecoins, in particular, are often difficult to classify and regulate. When combined with the strict rules governing political conduct and the use of official symbols, events like the one involving the Trump Memecoin and the presidential seal underscore the need for caution and clarity. What This Means: Potential Consequences and Future Scrutiny So, what are the potential repercussions of this alleged Federal Law Violation ? While Forbes reported the potential violation, whether any action will be taken remains uncertain. Enforcement of laws like the Presidential Seal Law can depend on various factors, including the specific circumstances, the perceived intent, and the discretion of relevant authorities like the Department of Justice. Potential consequences could range from no action being taken to an investigation, and in theory, the penalties outlined in the statute (fines or imprisonment) could apply if a violation is found and prosecuted. Beyond the legal realm, the event highlights the potential for negative optics and increased scrutiny on how political figures engage with the crypto market, especially with assets as volatile and speculative as memecoins like the TRUMP Coin . This incident could also prompt further discussion and potentially regulatory attention on the phenomenon of Crypto Political Events and the creation and promotion of politically themed tokens. It serves as a stark reminder that even in the fast-paced, often unconventional world of cryptocurrency, established laws regarding the use of official government symbols still apply and can have significant implications. Key Takeaways for Investors and Observers For anyone involved in the crypto space, particularly those interested in political tokens, the situation surrounding the Trump Memecoin dinner offers valuable lessons: Official Symbols Matter: Be highly skeptical of any private event or financial product that prominently features official government symbols like the presidential seal. This is legally restricted for a reason. Distinguish Personal from Official: A political figure’s personal interest or attendance at an event is different from an official government endorsement or approval. The Presidential Seal Law helps reinforce this distinction. Political Memecoins are High-Risk: Tokens like the TRUMP Coin are driven by sentiment and speculation, not fundamentals. Their value can be heavily influenced by political events, statements, and potentially misleading associations. Legal Grey Areas Exist: The intersection of crypto and politics is new and evolving, leading to potential legal ambiguities and risks that participants should be aware of. Due Diligence is Crucial: Always research the legitimacy of events, endorsements, and the assets themselves, regardless of who is involved. This event underscores the importance of understanding not just the technology and market dynamics of crypto, but also the legal and regulatory environment, especially when it overlaps with established political norms and laws. In conclusion, the Forbes report raising the possibility of a Federal Law Violation at a Trump Memecoin event due to the use of the presidential seal serves as a critical reminder of the legal boundaries surrounding the use of official symbols. While the ultimate legal outcome remains to be seen, the incident highlights the complex and sometimes fraught relationship between politics, speculative digital assets like the TRUMP Coin , and the laws designed to protect the integrity of government symbols. As Crypto Political Events become more common, vigilance and a clear understanding of applicable regulations will be essential for all involved.

One recent anecdote making waves in the memecoin news circuit involves a high-profile Trump memecoin dinner and a rather unimpressed crypto influencer . The High Cost of a Crypto Dinner Experience Imagine paying a staggering amount of money – not in traditional currency, but in volatile digital assets – for a single dinner event. That’s precisely what happened recently, according to a report by Fortune. Nicholas Pinto, a 25-year-old social media influencer, reportedly shelled out a hefty sum equivalent to $360,000 at the time, paid entirely in TRUMP token s (specifically, the MVPD token ticker). The event in question was a dinner associated with the Trump memecoin , an asset class that has seen significant attention and volatility, particularly in political cycles. Attendees were presumably hoping for an exclusive experience, networking opportunities, and perhaps close proximity to the former president himself. Crypto Influencer Nicholas Pinto’s Blunt Assessment However, the reality of the event, at least according to Pinto, fell far short of expectations. His candid remarks quickly became a talking point, highlighting a significant disconnect between the perceived value and the actual experience. The Food: Pinto’s description of the culinary offerings was anything but glowing. He bluntly labeled the food as “trash.” For a dinner costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto value, one would expect a gourmet experience, not something warranting such a harsh review. The Speech: Beyond the meal, the substance of the event also seemed to disappoint. Pinto described Donald Trump’s speech as “pretty much like bullshit.” This suggests a lack of meaningful content or engagement, further diminishing the perceived value of the high-priced ticket. The Access: A key draw for such events is often the opportunity to interact with the central figure. Pinto claimed that attendees didn’t even come into close contact with Trump. This lack of access, despite the enormous cost, appears to be a major point of contention for the influencer. Pinto’s experience underscores a critical challenge in the world of high-ticket events funded by volatile assets: expectations versus reality. The hype surrounding a political figure and a popular Trump memecoin might build immense anticipation, but the execution of the event itself might not live up to the monetary or symbolic investment. Understanding the TRUMP Token and Political Memecoins The fact that the payment was made in TRUMP token s adds another layer of complexity to this story. Unlike traditional payments, paying with a volatile asset like a memecoin carries inherent risks and implications. What exactly is the TRUMP token (MVPD)? It’s one of several cryptocurrencies that have emerged, often capitalizing on the political landscape. These tokens are typically highly speculative, driven by community sentiment, social media trends, and political developments rather than underlying fundamentals or utility. Their value can skyrocket or plummet based on news cycles, endorsements, or even simple online chatter. Paying $360,000 worth of a volatile asset means that the actual dollar value of the payment could have fluctuated significantly before and after the transaction. It’s a high-stakes gamble for both the payer and potentially the recipient, depending on how quickly the tokens are converted or managed. This event shines a spotlight on the broader phenomenon of political memecoins. They represent a unique, albeit often controversial, intersection of finance, technology, and political fandom. While some see them as a way to engage supporters and potentially raise funds, others view them as purely speculative gambles or even potential scams. What This Memecoin News Tells Us About the Market The story of Pinto’s disappointing crypto dinner provides valuable insights into several aspects of the current crypto landscape: The Power of Hype: The willingness to spend $360,000 worth of tokens on a dinner speaks volumes about the power of hype and perceived exclusivity within certain crypto circles, especially those tied to specific personalities or movements. Volatility Risks: Paying for goods or services with highly volatile assets like memecoins is inherently risky. The value of the payment can change dramatically in a short period. Expectation Management: High-profile events, particularly those linked to charismatic figures or trending assets, can generate unrealistic expectations. Attendees might anticipate unparalleled access or value that isn’t actually delivered. Influencer Economy: This event highlights the significant capital circulating among some crypto influencer s and their willingness to spend it on experiences they believe will offer unique value or networking opportunities. The rapid spread of this story through memecoin news outlets and social media also demonstrates the intense interest and scrutiny surrounding these novel assets and the figures associated with them. Beyond the Plate: Why Attend a Crypto Dinner Like This? Given the reported disappointment, one might wonder about the motivations for attending such an event, especially at such a high cost in TRUMP token s. Several factors could be at play: Networking: Events like this can attract individuals with significant wealth or influence in the crypto or political spheres. Networking opportunities could be a primary driver. Publicity/Content: For a crypto influencer , attending and reporting on such a unique event generates content and publicity, which is valuable in their line of work. The controversy or exclusivity itself can be part of the appeal. Belief in the Asset/Figure: Attendees might be strong believers in the political figure or the associated Trump memecoin , viewing the expense as an investment in a community or movement. Exclusivity: The high price tag creates an aura of exclusivity, appealing to those who wish to be part of an elite group. However, Pinto’s experience serves as a cautionary tale that even with a massive investment, the tangible benefits and overall satisfaction are not guaranteed. The Influence Game: What Does This Mean for Crypto Influencer s? Nicholas Pinto’s willingness to share his negative experience is notable. It adds a layer of perceived authenticity in a space often criticized for hype and shilling. His candor, while potentially burning bridges, could also build trust with his audience by demonstrating a willingness to speak truth to power, or at least, truth to expensive dinners. The incident also raises questions about the role and responsibility of crypto influencer s. Their actions, investments, and public statements can impact their followers’ perceptions and decisions. Paying a massive sum in a specific token for an event inherently ties the influencer to that token and the associated figure, for better or worse. It highlights the pressures and incentives influencers face, navigating the line between creating engaging content, pursuing opportunities, and potentially promoting assets or events that might not deliver value. Challenges and Actionable Insights The story of the disappointing Trump memecoin dinner brings several challenges to the forefront: Challenge: Volatility Risk. Paying or being paid in volatile assets means the value is constantly in flux. Challenge: Hype vs. Reality. High-profile events can be overhyped, leading to significant disappointment. Challenge: Access and Value. Expensive tickets do not always guarantee meaningful access or a high-quality experience. Challenge: Influencer Credibility. Influencers need to balance opportunity with maintaining trust with their audience. Based on these challenges, here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insight: Do Your Own Research (DYOR). Before investing in tokens like the TRUMP token or spending large sums on related events, thoroughly research the asset, the event organizers, and what is actually being offered. Actionable Insight: Manage Expectations. Be realistic about what you will gain from high-cost, high-hype events. Exclusive access or guaranteed returns are rarely part of the deal. Actionable Insight: Be Wary of Hype. Don’t let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or the perceived status of an event dictate your financial decisions, especially in the volatile memecoin market. Actionable Insight: Consider Payment Method. Understand the risks involved when paying for goods or services using volatile cryptocurrencies. Summary: A Costly Lesson in the World of Political Memecoins and Crypto Events The tale of the crypto influencer who paid $360,000 worth of TRUMP token s for a disappointing dinner is more than just a quirky anecdote. It’s a potent illustration of the dynamics at play in the current crypto landscape: the intense interest in political memecoins, the significant capital wielded by some figures, the risks associated with volatile assets, and the potential for high-profile events to fall short of lofty expectations. As the memecoin news cycle continues to churn out stories, this incident serves as a vivid reminder for investors and enthusiasts alike to approach hype-driven opportunities and exclusive events with a healthy dose of skepticism and rigorous due diligence. Not every expensive seat at the table guarantees a satisfying meal or meaningful access.

If so, you’ve likely noticed the persistent strength of TRON (TRX). Recent analysis suggests that the TRX bullish momentum is far from over, presenting an interesting scenario for traders and investors. Decoding the Persistent TRX Bullish Momentum The current performance of TRX has caught the eye of many market observers. Unlike typical scenarios where extended upward trends show signs of fatigue, TRX continues to push forward. This resilience is a key factor driving the current optimistic sentiment around the cryptocurrency. Several factors contribute to this sustained momentum: Network Activity: The TRON network maintains high levels of transaction volume and user engagement, driven by its focus on dApps, stablecoins, and a low-fee structure. Stablecoin Integration: TRON is a significant player in the stablecoin market, particularly with USDT, which drives utility and demand for TRX for transaction fees. Ecosystem Growth: Continued development and adoption within the TRON ecosystem contribute to the underlying value proposition of TRX . What Does CryptoQuant Data Reveal? Insights from on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant are crucial for understanding market dynamics beyond simple price charts. According to a recent observation shared by CryptoQuant on X (formerly Twitter), TRX exhibits high buying pressure. Typically, a sustained period of high buying pressure can sometimes signal an impending price top. This is because intense buying can exhaust available supply at certain price levels, leading to a potential reversal as demand wanes or profit-taking begins. However, the notable point highlighted by analysts, including Joao Wedson, Founder & CEO of Alphractal, is that despite this significant buying pressure, TRX has not shown the expected signs of peaking. This divergence from the usual pattern suggests that the demand absorbing this pressure is substantial and persistent, indicating potential for further price appreciation. Expert Price Prediction : Is Further Upside Likely? The observation from CryptoQuant and analysts like Joao Wedson feeds into the current price prediction narrative for TRX . The lack of a top signal, even amidst high buying pressure, suggests that the market believes there is still room for growth. What could this mean for the future TRX price prediction ? Continued Ascents: If buying pressure remains strong and is met with continued demand without significant sell-offs, the price could continue its upward trajectory. Target Levels: Analysts often look at historical resistance levels and Fibonacci extensions to identify potential next targets. A persistent bullish trend suggests these higher levels are becoming increasingly probable. Market Sentiment: The positive sentiment generated by this analysis can itself become a self-fulfilling prophecy, attracting more buyers. It’s important to remember that while current data is positive, the crypto market is inherently volatile, and predictions are not guarantees. How Does TRX Fit into Broader Crypto Market Trends? Understanding the performance of TRX requires context within the broader crypto market . While Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead market cycles, altcoins like TRX can exhibit unique trends driven by their specific ecosystems and use cases. Currently, the overall crypto market sentiment is influenced by various factors, including: Macroeconomic conditions Regulatory developments Institutional adoption trends Technological advancements TRX’s ability to maintain bullish momentum despite potential market fluctuations or sector-specific rotations highlights its relative strength or unique market positioning, possibly due to its utility-driven demand and stablecoin infrastructure. Actionable Insights for TRX Holders and Potential Investors Given the current analysis indicating sustained TRX bullish momentum , what should you consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange flows, active addresses, and transaction volume on platforms like CryptoQuant for early signs of trend changes. Set Price Alerts: If you’re looking to enter or exit a position, setting price alerts can help you act quickly on market movements. Risk Management: Always employ sound risk management strategies. The absence of a top signal doesn’t eliminate the possibility of a sudden reversal. Use stop-loss orders if trading. Stay Informed: Follow updates from the TRON foundation, news related to the crypto market , and analyses from reputable sources. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This article provides insights based on available data and analysis, but it is not financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. The observation that high buying pressure isn’t currently leading to a peak is a significant point for the TRX price prediction . It suggests underlying strength that could propel the price higher. Conclusion: The Unfolding Story of TRX ‘s Ascent The narrative for TRX remains compelling. The persistent bullish momentum , validated by on-chain data from sources like CryptoQuant , indicates a market dynamic where strong demand is continuously absorbing buying pressure without the typical signs of exhaustion. While no price prediction is guaranteed in the volatile crypto market , the current technical and on-chain signals point towards potential for further upside for TRX . Keeping a close watch on market developments and managing risk are essential as this story unfolds.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.” Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.” He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets. Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: Cointelegraph Akshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?” He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code. In the Solana ecosystem, the ""Non-Chief Marketing Officer"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.

Markets remain above historical averages Public equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time. According to data from market analytics firm Multpl, the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has consistently remained above 19.6 since December 2018, higher than the index’s historical average P/E ratio of around 16.1 and suggesting that investors have been willing to pay a premium for earnings in recent years. Zooming out, the S&P 500’s average valuation has been gradually rising for decades, driven by factors such as low interest rates, growing corporate gains, and investor optimism about technology. However, high valuations have also coincided with periods of market corrections, like the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. S&P 500 P/E ratio since inception. Source: Multipl According to Akshay, a way to combat this overheating is to open up certain markets to retail investors, a lofty goal that some sectors of crypto, like RWA tokenization , aim to facilitate. Akshay noted that some entrepreneurs had tried this before, but the available technology didn’t support this view. “[Crypto] starts with the game, and very quickly becomes profound.” “What it gives you is the ability for you to financialize all the productive assets in an economy, so you can have anybody who participates in that economy be an owner of that economy,” he said.

45019964,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68190,1748042113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Best Crypto to Buy Right Now? Market Turns Green as Bitcoin Charges Past $111K—Here’s What That Means for Qubetics, XRP, and NEAR",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-buy-right-now-market-turns-green-as-bitcoin/,"Is the market flashing green for a reason or is it just another temporary push? Bitcoin’s breakout past $111,861 has reignited bullish momentum across the board, pushing the crypto market back into price discovery territory. As reported today, this surge isn’t isolated—it’s spilling into the broader market with Ethereum, Solana, and several other altcoins bouncing back as confidence returns. This shift is backed by a clear uptick in trading activity and liquidity as macro sentiment stabilizes and crypto-specific narratives take center stage. In moments like this, coins with a strong foundational thesis and ongoing development cycles typically outperform—making timing, narrative, and utility more crucial than ever. Qubetics , currently in its structured presale stage, stands out for exactly those reasons: its strong ecosystem utility and clear roadmap offer a different kind of value play in a momentum-driven market. While many crypto projects are still catching up to real-world integration, Qubetics ($TICS) is already solving long-standing issues that past tokens couldn’t fully address. By offering a decentralized VPN built directly into its ecosystem, Qubetics answers growing concerns around online privacy, data monopolies, and censorship. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining traction as major wallet holders are increasingly aligning with global payment firms, and Near Protocol is being rated “very bullish” by nearly half of its user base. These signs of activity across the board point to a market where fundamentals are beginning to matter again. In this context, understanding how Qubetics compares alongside XRP and Near offers a clear perspective on identifying the best crypto to buy right now—not just for short-term surges but for long-term functionality and adaptability. The Real-World Case for Qubetics: How Its dVPN Is Solving Privacy Issues at Scale Qubetics is going beyond speculative tokenomics to address practical internet problems—starting with online privacy. Its decentralized VPN (dVPN) operates through a peer-to-peer blockchain protocol that doesn’t rely on centralized data routing. Unlike traditional VPN services that may log user data or be forced to comply with government surveillance demands, Qubetics’ dVPN offers censorship-resistant connectivity with no single point of failure. This makes it especially beneficial for journalists in high-censorship regions, remote professionals needing secure cross-border access, or even enterprise firms looking to decentralize their cybersecurity frameworks. By rewarding bandwidth providers through $TICS tokens, Qubetics also builds an incentive structure that naturally supports service stability and reach—without relying on centralized vendors. For example, a freelance researcher in a politically restricted country could use Qubetics’ dVPN to bypass firewalls without fear of being traced, as traffic routing is anonymized and encrypted. Similarly, a U.S.-based startup dealing with confidential IP could ensure its data remains outside third-party access points. What sets Qubetics apart is the added benefit of multi-hop routing and complete encryption—both user identity and usage logs are protected from all forms of tracing. And since the protocol is open and self-sustaining, it aligns with broader Web3 goals of sovereignty and user ownership. This makes Qubetics not just a speculative presale—it’s an application-driven network that’s actually shaping how privacy-first internet infrastructure could look. That’s why it continues to gain momentum in a market now leaning heavily toward utility-driven tokens—and it positions Qubetics as the best crypto to buy right now for users seeking more than just market exposure. Qubetics Presale Hits Stage 35 with $17.2M Raised and 513M Tokens Sold—Next Price Hike in 7 Days The Qubetics presale isn’t just another crypto campaign—it’s a fully structured rollout with predictable progression and real-world integration. Currently in Stage 35, Qubetics tokens are priced at $0.2785. With over 513 million $TICS sold, more than $17.2 million raised, and over 26,800 holders onboard, this presale reflects more than speculative excitement—it reflects community trust. Each presale stage lasts exactly 7 days, and prices increase by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, ensuring that early adopters are consistently rewarded for their timing. With the mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, this phase offers a timely opportunity to buy before exchange listings and utility unlocks begin. For those calculating returns, the upside is substantial. At current prices, an investment of $5,000 translates into 17,950 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s $17,950 back—already a 258.95% ROI. At a $5 price point, the same bag delivers $89,750 (1,694.74% ROI), and if it reaches $15 post-mainnet, the same investment becomes $269,250, marking a 5,284.21% ROI. These projections aren’t random guesses—they’re based on actual sales structure and historical returns from tokens with utility-focused launches. This structured system, coupled with the growing interest in privacy solutions, makes Qubetics presale a standout among many offerings right now. That’s why it holds weight in the conversation around the best crypto to buy right now , especially for those exploring utility-based early-stage entries in the best crypto presale space. XRP Whale Activity Heats Up as PayFi Pushes Toward Global Remittance Integration XRP has captured fresh attention after a series of whale moves aligned with emerging payment infrastructure. According to a May 22 update, multiple top XRP holders are now becoming affiliated with Remittix, a fintech platform aiming to power cross-border transactions through the blockchain. Simultaneously, PayFi—a separate payments entity—has started using XRP’s ledger to explore frictionless global settlements. These are not minor partnerships; both platforms are considered to be at the forefront of transforming international value transfer, a space that Ripple Labs has long aimed to dominate. This activity follows a sustained effort by Ripple to rebuild after regulatory headwinds. Now that legal battles have subsided and institutions are warming back up to Ripple’s offerings, the use of XRP for real-world remittances may be on track to expand faster than expected. Such partnerships suggest a higher transaction volume and more consistent liquidity in the months to come, which is particularly relevant for those watching XRP’s role beyond speculation. The move also points to a shift in strategy—from platform-level integrations to user-level adoption—putting XRP in an increasingly relevant position within the global payments infrastructure. Near Protocol Scores “Very Bullish” Sentiment as Price Forecast Shows Steady Rebound Near Protocol is showing signs of resilience despite broader market volatility. As of May 21, the token is trading around $2.83, with a +0.78% daily gain—small but meaningful during this kind of rebound phase. What’s more important is the platform’s long-term forecast: user-submitted projections suggest a potential 5% growth in the short term, with a steady upward trajectory through 2030. The current sentiment score reveals that 49.12% of participants rated NEAR as “Very Bullish,” supported by consistent engagement across Near’s application ecosystem and its scalable tech stack. This sentiment trend is notable considering the market had recently experienced stagnation among mid-cap tokens. NEAR, however, has continued to show upward price momentum and strong community trust. This level of consistent bullish sentiment often precedes heavier institutional interest, particularly in protocols offering both developer tooling and end-user simplicity. The combination of organic adoption, positive user perception, and realistic growth expectations places NEAR in a strong category of layer-1 tokens that aren’t driven solely by temporary market surges. As Bitcoin Surges, Market Stability Improves—But Long-Term Picks Still Matter Today’s crypto market trend—Bitcoin’s clean break above $111,861—is more than just a price headline. It’s the kind of event that resets sentiment and pulls liquidity into both majors and altcoins. With broader green candles appearing across charts, it’s clear this shift is breathing new life into previously sluggish portfolios. For XRP, it adds a tailwind to institutional remittance adoption. For NEAR, it reinforces community confidence, which is already trending high. And for Qubetics—which is currently in presale—this macro movement validates its long-term thesis. Unlike many tokens tied to hype cycles, Qubetics offers structural stability due to its fixed weekly 10% price jumps, giving early buyers a predictable growth runway. Conclusion: Why Now’s the Moment to Watch These Three From XRP’s strategic positioning in global payments to Near Protocol’s steady bullish sentiment and Qubetics’ utility-backed growth path, each of these projects presents a timely opportunity in the current bullish cycle. What separates them from short-term plays is the presence of real integrations, measured adoption, and clear incentive structures. XRP is finally seeing strategic traction post-litigation, NEAR is riding high on trust and consistent performance forecasts, and Qubetics is building an infrastructure layer for digital privacy—something the crypto space needs now more than ever. For those watching the charts while evaluating substance, these three deserve a deeper look. For those eyeing early-phase utility projects with proven ROI systems and ecosystem potential, this is the right time to join this best crypto presale and experience what may soon be one of the best crypto to buy right now.

While Bitcoin and Litecoin continue to anchor the market, all eyes are now on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum—each presenting compelling reasons to believe that a staggering 10,000% return could be within reach for early adopters. Among these, MAGACOIN PRESALE’s presale is rapidly becoming the focal point for those seeking the next crypto phenomenon. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Sensation With Monumental Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is electrifying the crypto sphere as its presale approaches a critical juncture, having already surpassed $8 million in contributions. With each stage filling faster than the last and the entry price still under $0.001, market forecasters are signaling a potential windfall of 10,000% or more for those who position themselves early. The project’s limited supply of 100 billion tokens, combined with rigorous security audits and a politically charged narrative, is sparking a frenzy of both retail and institutional interest. As the countdown to the $0.007 listing ticks on, MAGA is emerging as a once-in-a-cycle chance for exponential returns—a prospect that is drawing comparisons to the meteoric rises of other viral tokens, but with enhanced transparency and strategic tokenomics. XRP: Surging Confidence and Institutional Tailwinds XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism, currently priced above $2.30 and bolstered by regulatory victories and the introduction of CME futures. Market strategists anticipate a climb toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bold outlooks even eyeing $4.50 if current trends persist. The resolution of Ripple’s legal battles and the green light for institutional participation have cleared the path for broader adoption. While XRP’s trajectory is undeniably positive, the allure of early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—where the runway for explosive gains remains wide open—is proving irresistible to forward-thinking investors. Ethereum: Robust Tech and Expanding Horizons Ethereum continues to stand as a pillar of innovation, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 amidst ongoing network enhancements and growing institutional engagement. Despite market fluctuations, ETH’s technical foundation remains sound, with analysts projecting a move toward $3,000 and potentially beyond as upgrades and adoption accelerate. Some visionary forecasts even hint at a five-figure future, though such a leap would require a seismic shift in market dynamics. While Ethereum offers a stable and proven platform, the most ambitious capital is gravitating toward high-growth presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the promise of outsized returns is impossible to ignore. Bitcoin and Litecoin: Steady Hands in a Volatile Market Bitcoin maintains its dominance, trading above $100,000 and attracting unprecedented institutional inflows.

If this trend continues, BTC may see further price appreciation in the near term. Buyers Regain Control Of Bitcoin Spot Market According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by crypto analyst ibrahimcosar, buyers appear to be dominating the BTC spot market. The analyst observed that the Bitcoin Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has shifted back into green territory. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD measures the difference between taker buy and taker sell volumes on spot exchanges over time. A rising Spot Taker CVD indicates that aggressive buyers are dominating the market, signalling potential bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market – New ATH Soon? BTC Spot Taker CVD turning green is signficant. Most notably, it means buy orders have regained dominance after an extended period in which sell orders led the market. A higher volume of buy orders over time suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum may persist. As shown in the chart shared by ibrahimcosar, the CVD remained mostly red for the majority of Q1 2025 – indicating strong selling pressure. This selling behavior aligned with BTC’s price action, which saw the asset fall from its previous ATH in January to a low of around $76,000 in April. The fact that BTC’s Spot Taker CVD has turned green while the asset is setting fresh ATHs makes this trend especially noteworthy. It indicates that buyers are willing to accumulate BTC even at historically high prices, likely in anticipation of continued upside. That said, recent price action might temporarily interrupt BTC’s momentum. In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that BTC could soon break down from its current range of $110,400 to $111,100. A Different Kind Of Rally Typically, BTC hitting a new ATH is usually met with wider market euphoria, leading to a sharp price decline that catches most investors off-guard. However, experts opine that the current rally is different from previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk suggests that new and short-term BTC investors are sitting on substantial unrealized profits, and not showing any signs of panic selling amid the cryptocurrency’s price surge to new highs. Similarly, whale reaction to BTC’s bullish price trajectory has been mixed. While new whales have been taking major profits during the ongoing rally, old whales have resisted selling their holdings, showing minimal selling activity. Finally, the neutral funding rates in the BTC futures market reinforce the idea that the current rally is more organic and less driven by speculation than those in the past. At press time, BTC trades at $108,553, down 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

While BTC’s ascent captures headlines, savvy investors are increasingly directing attention toward altcoins with explosive growth potential—notably MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana. With XRP and Ethereum also posting strong technicals, the stage is set for a dynamic period of gains across the digital asset landscape. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon With 25x–35x Potential While Bitcoin’s trajectory is impressive, the most aggressive capital is flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly establishing itself as 2025’s leading presale opportunity. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion, analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum persists. The project’s capped supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation by both retail and institutional investors. As each stage fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGA is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with enhanced transparency and scarcity-driven tokenomics. Bitcoin: The Macro Beacon With Unprecedented Momentum Bitcoin has recently shattered records, trading above $111,000 amid a wave of institutional inflows, corporate adoption, and robust ETF demand. Analysts now suggest that a sustained rally could propel BTC to $200,000 by year-end, driven by a combination of macroeconomic tailwinds, reduced supply post-halving, and global liquidity expansion. The options market reflects this bullish outlook, with traders placing bets on BTC reaching $300,000 by June. As Bitcoin solidifies its role as digital gold, the market’s risk appetite is broadening—opening the door for high-upside altcoin plays. Solana: Technical Breakout and Ecosystem Growth Solana is another standout, with its price consolidating between $158 and $175 as it builds momentum for the next leg higher. Analysts are eyeing a breakout above $175, which could open the door to a retest of $183 and beyond. Long-term forecasts suggest SOL could reach $240–$270 later in 2025, supported by robust DeFi activity, developer engagement, and whale accumulation. As Solana’s ecosystem matures, the network is attracting both institutional attention and speculative capital, making it a top pick for those seeking significant gains alongside Bitcoin. XRP and Ethereum: Strong Fundamentals and Upside Catalysts XRP is trading above $2.30, buoyed by legal clarity, the launch of CME futures, and ongoing ETF speculation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85–$3.40 in the near term, with some optimistic scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if bullish momentum persists. Ethereum, meanwhile, remains the backbone of DeFi and Web3, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades. Some analysts project ETH could reach $6,700 by year-end if institutional adoption and network improvements continue to accelerate. While both XRP and ETH offer stability and long-term value, the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. Near Protocol: Building Momentum for the Next Cycle Near Protocol (NEAR) is quietly building momentum, trading near $2.93 and showing strong technicals and developer activity. Analysts expect NEAR to stabilize at current levels before pushing higher in 2026, with long-term forecasts suggesting significant growth as the network’s scalability and ecosystem attract more users. While NEAR is a dependable hold, the most dramatic returns are currently being sought in presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin’s journey toward $200,000 is igniting market-wide confidence, but the real action is unfolding in high-upside altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are positioned for significant gains, with MAGA’s presale momentum and Solana’s technical strength drawing both retail and institutional capital. XRP and Ethereum remain core holdings, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender of 2025. As Bitcoin leads the charge, the window for early entry into the next crypto supercycle is closing fast.

This strategic focus on functionality and community engagement is attracting significant whale interest, signaling a shift towards more utility-driven meme coins. INPEPE’s Origins Uncovered: A Forgotten Founder Returns to Reclaim the Meme Throne Insiders suggest that a co-founder of the original Pepe coin, who was sidelined before its meteoric rise, is now leading the INPEPE project.

The Math Doesn’t Lie: INPEPE’s 100x Path Looks Realer by the Day With a current price of $0.0000002051 per token, INPEPE presents a compelling opportunity for early investors. The project’s presale has already raised over $150,000 out of a $505,881 goal, indicating strong market interest. Analysts suggest that if INPEPE reaches price levels comparable to established memecoins like PEPE, investors could realize returns exceeding 60 times their initial investment. Additionally, INPEPE offers a staking reward of up to 4754% APY, incentivizing long-term holding and contributing to supply scarcity. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is rapidly emerging as a next-generation memecoin, strategically placed at the crossroads of Web3 innovation and the thriving $25+ billion influencer economy. Unlike conventional meme coins, INPEPE is designed to serve as the primary currency for influencer transactions.

Legacy tokens like Polkadot and Polygon are starting to face hesitation, weighed down by technical hurdles and market uncertainty. Amid this shift, Unstaked ($UNSD) is emerging with a fresh narrative. Backed by artificial intelligence, DeFi-based incentives, and over $6.8 million in presale funding, it is capturing the attention of both retail participants and large wallet holders. Its platform rewards smart engagement and outlines a roadmap focused on long-term Web3 utility. With a current presale stage 14 price of $0.009545 and a projected launch value of $0.1819, Unstaked offers ROIs of up to 27x for early holders. As Polkadot and Polygon struggle to regain momentum, Unstaked is quickly gaining ground in the race for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Polkadot Struggles to Hold Gains Ahead of ETF Rulings Polkadot saw a 30% surge that lifted DOT above $5.30, but the momentum quickly faded as the price fell back to around $4.82. This move came just ahead of critical ETF decisions from the U.S. SEC, with Grayscale’s verdict expected on June 11 and 21Shares following on June 24. These decisions could serve as a spark or further suppress the current drift. Technically, DOT is trading below the Ichimoku Cloud, suggesting bearish sentiment. RSI has slipped below the neutral zone, and support at $4.45 is now under pressure. With capital inflows slowing, traders are approaching DOT with increased caution while exploring new high-upside alternatives. Polygon’s zkEVM Upgrade Could Shape POL’s Long-Term Value Polygon is progressing with its zkEVM rollout, a key step in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap aimed at improving scalability and reducing gas fees. This upgrade positions the network as a powerful Layer 2 solution for Ethereum and supports its transition from MATIC to the newly launched POL token, which is trading near $0.258. Price forecasts vary across platforms. CoinCodex expects a small climb to $0.27, while Coinpedia predicts $0.47 over the next year. DigitalCoinPrice offers the boldest target at $3.91 by late 2025. As adoption of the Agglayer Breakout Program expands, real-world traction will be the deciding factor for POL’s growth. New AI Coin Unstaked Goes Viral with 27x ROI & $1M Giveaway Unstaked is making waves in a market dominated by legacy networks chasing ETF approvals and technical upgrades. With $6.8 million raised and a presale price of $0.009545 in stage 14, the project stands out by offering a clear path to a $0.1819 launch value. That scenario presents ROIs of up to 27x, giving early participants a compelling reason to pay attention. The platform operates on a Proof of Intelligence model, which shifts rewards away from passive holding and toward informed, quality-driven participation. Users earn based on decisions and engagement, creating a system that feels more like an evolving ecosystem than a typical crypto launch. This intelligent structure adds long-term credibility to Unstaked’s model. The roadmap outlines future integration with utility-driven dApps, access to DeFi tools, and a strong emphasis on liquidity protection. These features are designed to reduce manipulation and encourage steady growth. Looking ahead, Unstaked also plans to scale into core Web3 functions such as decentralized identity, secure data exchange, and governance systems. Driving community energy is a $1,000,000 giveaway. Twenty winners will each receive $50,000 in $UNSD, with entry based on completing tasks, referrals, and a $100 contribution. Unstaked is quickly becoming a serious entry in the best crypto to buy 2025 conversation, powered by real structure and smart engagement. The Future of Crypto Polkadot’s ETF potential and Polygon’s zkEVM rollout may dominate headlines, but neither offers the immediate clarity or user-centric design that Unstaked brings. DOT is showing signs of slowing, and POL’s future depends heavily on broader adoption, which remains uncertain in the near term. Unstaked, on the other hand, is gaining real traction with over $6.8 million raised, a 27x return projection, and a Web3 roadmap that prioritizes utility and intelligence. For those exploring the best crypto to buy in 2025, Unstaked is no longer just an early-stage contender. It is building the foundation for something far more impactful.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Are Leading the Political Crypto Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/500-to-1m-magacoin-finance-bitcoin-and-xrp-are-leading-the-political-crypto-surge/,"A new era is dawning in the crypto world, where political narratives and market momentum are converging to create extraordinary opportunities. While Bitcoin remains the bedrock of digital finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are surging ahead as the vanguard of a political crypto movement. With Solana and Aptos also in the mix, early investors are positioning for what could be the most lucrative cycle yet—where a modest $500 investment might just pave the way to a million-dollar windfall. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Meme Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just another meme token; it’s a cultural force driving the 2025 political memecoin boom. Unlike fleeting trends that fade as quickly as they rise, MAGA stands out by combining a compelling political identity with real market traction and community engagement. The project’s presale has already attracted thousands of buyers and raised millions, with analysts projecting 25x–35x returns for those who enter before the $0.007 listing. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to sustain attention and volume—turning viral energy into lasting momentum. Built-in upside mechanics, a scarcity-focused supply, and a grassroots-driven community are fueling organic demand and real transaction activity. As traders migrate from established coins like XRP and SHIBA, MAGA is rapidly becoming the go-to destination for those seeking the next crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin: The Foundation of the Crypto Revolution Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, trading above $100,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors and ETFs. Analysts forecast a possible run to $116,000–$137,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. As Bitcoin solidifies its role as digital gold, its strength provides a stable backdrop for the explosive growth of political and narrative-driven altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum XRP is riding a wave of optimism, buoyed by regulatory breakthroughs, ETF speculation, and strong technical momentum. Currently trading above $2.30, XRP has surged more than 300% since late 2024 and is now poised for further gains. Analysts project a move to $2.80–$3.40 by June, with some scenarios even eyeing $5.50 by year-end if adoption accelerates. With pending ETF proposals and growing institutional interest, XRP is positioned for a supply shock that could drive prices to new highs. The combination of regulatory clarity, real-world utility, and political tailwinds makes XRP a core holding for those betting on the next phase of crypto adoption. Solana and Aptos: Technical Strength in a Shifting Market Solana remains a top Layer-1 contender, with robust DeFi activity and developer engagement supporting its price near $170. Aptos, meanwhile, is gaining traction with network upgrades and expanding partnerships. Both tokens offer strong fundamentals, but for investors seeking the highest upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is where the real action lies. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion The political crypto surge is here, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP are leading the charge. With MAGA’s presale offering unprecedented early-stage potential, Bitcoin’s macro strength, and XRP’s bullish setup, the stage is set for a transformative cycle. For those willing to act early, a $500 investment could unlock life-changing returns—making this trio the breakout stars of 2025.

The space is seeing renewed interest with investors pouring into coins that blend hype with community rewards. Web3 ai is grabbing headlines with a $777K giveaway, open to anyone holding a minimum of $100 worth of $WAI in its ongoing presale. Dogecoin holds its position as a meme giant, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 launch is gaining traction, and Pepe keeps returning to the spotlight with its surprise market movements. Each of these projects is driving serious buzz. Among them, Web3 ai stands tall by mixing viral appeal with long-term use cases. Together, these four are shaping what many consider the top cryptos to buy now. Web3 ai ($WAI): $100 Qualifies for $777K Prize Pool and 1,747% ROI Web3 ai is changing how crypto presales are perceived. With a huge $777,000 giveaway and a low entry of at least $100, the project is turning heads among both new buyers and experienced traders. This low-barrier format gives regular users a chance to enter something that feels exclusive, like a jackpot. This model triggers viral appeal, similar to lottery mechanics, but with more than just luck involved. Unlike random prizes, entering the giveaway means becoming a $WAI holder, and that comes with genuine potential. Priced at $0.000383 in stage 6, it targets a listing at $0.005242, which equals an ROI of up to 1747%. So far, it has brought in nearly $5 million in presale funding. With only a $100 purchase needed to qualify and 10 winners sharing the giveaway, the excitement is spreading quickly. Web3 ai shows that success doesn’t require billion-dollar support, just the right mix of tools, timing, and vision. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community-Driven Meme Coin Dogecoin’s name remains strong thanks to its loyal fan base and unmatched popularity. While it started as a joke, DOGE now has a real place in the crypto world, with notable mentions from Elon Musk and speculation about possible integration with X. In 2025, meme coin excitement is back, and DOGE is once again gaining attention. For many, its brand power and community size make it one of the top cryptos to buy now. Though its wild 100x days might be over, it still has the strength to climb during retail-driven bull waves. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Real Ecosystem With Growing Features Shiba Inu’s growth story is no longer just about memes. It has launched Shibarium, a Layer 2 chain, and is now adding staking, governance features, and virtual world components. The “ShibArmy” continues to push for more adoption and development. In the search for top cryptos to buy now, SHIB is evolving into a serious Web3 player. With Ethereum’s high gas fees, Shibarium could draw more users. At its still-low price, SHIB offers potential for those seeking affordable entry into a growing platform. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Energy Still Turning Heads in 2025 Pepe came into the spotlight with its wild moves in 2023, and it’s not done yet. Its strength lies in its pure meme energy and unpredictable price action, earning listings on major exchanges. Pepe’s link to internet culture sets it apart. While risky, that very nature makes it one of the top cryptos to buy now. The coin’s price jumps catch many off guard, rewarding those who act fast. For those who thrive on volatility, Pepe may be both the wildest and most profitable play. Final Thoughts The strongest contenders in 2025 aren’t winning just by building tech, they’re gaining by standing out, exciting users, and offering real incentives.

A lot of analysts and crypto fans believe it’s coming, but some are also convinced that when it does arrive, it will be the biggest one yet. One of those is Dan Krupka, head of Coin Bureau Research. He shared a video on Coin Bureau Trading’s YouTube channel, sharing his thoughts and expertise on why this altcoin season just might explode (in a good way). For starters, Krupka outlines spot Ethereum ETF approvals and rate cuts by the Fed, which are expected to come late this year. Additionally, crypto-friendly sentiment is increasing, especially in the US, adding fuel to the possibility of an altcoin season. Plus, the potential ETF applications for Solana, Layer-2 innovations, and growing user bases on new chains could all play an important role in a possibly huge altcoin season.

Neither avenue is supportive of employment growth.” The economists say that reshoring manufacturing jobs would likely take “many years and come at high cost.” “US labor costs are a hurdle. Labor cost differentials with the rest of the world require US manufacturing firms to be highly capital-intensive to compete in a global marketplace. Thus, an expansion in manufacturing employment would require significant capital investment. In order for manufacturing employment to return to its historic peak, we estimate at a minimum $2.9 trillion in net new capital investment is required. While sizable, we view this estimate as a lower-bound. The build out of new of capacity would likely unfold over multiple years, with further increases in capital intensity and inflation requiring a higher amount.” The Wells Fargo analysts also note that lower fertility rates and a recent reduction in immigration could negatively impact working-age population growth.

While ETH’s technicals and upgrades are drawing institutional eyes, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are already surging ahead—capturing both speculative capital and analyst acclaim. With Bitcoin anchoring the market and Kaspa quietly building, the stage is set for a summer of high-stakes gains and strategic positioning. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Frontrunner With Unrivaled Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the rules for early-stage crypto projects, commanding attention with a presale that has already surpassed $8 million and continues to shatter expectations. Analysts are not just bullish—they’re calling MAGA the breakout contender of 2025, with forecasts of up to 18,500% returns and a possible $1 valuation by year-end. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are driving a groundswell of demand from both retail and institutional investors. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing looms, MAGA is rapidly becoming the definitive early-stage play for those seeking life-changing upside. Solana: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is not just holding its ground—it’s accelerating, with price action consolidating between $158 and $175 and technicals hinting at a breakout above $175 to retest $183. Analysts are eyeing a summer run toward $200 and beyond, fueled by robust DeFi activity, developer traction, and whale accumulation. The network’s speed, low fees, and expanding ecosystem make it a magnet for both speculative and long-term capital. As Solana’s momentum builds, it’s clear that the smartest traders are already positioned for the next leg up. Ethereum: On the Brink of a Major Milestone Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators and bullish sentiment pointing to a potential surge past $3,000 in the coming weeks. The 50-day EMA, rising RSI, and recent bounce from key support levels all signal a robust uptrend. Analysts project that a sustained move above $2,700 could open the door to $2,900 and beyond, with some forecasts even targeting $3,200 by late summer. As Ethereum’s upgrades and institutional adoption continue to unfold, ETH remains a cornerstone for both stability and growth. Bitcoin and Kaspa: Steady Anchors in a Dynamic Market Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto universe, trading above $100,000 and drawing unprecedented institutional inflows. Forecasts suggest a possible run to $120,000 and beyond in the near term, with BTC’s strength providing a stable backdrop for altcoin surges. Kaspa, meanwhile, is quietly building momentum, with bullish technicals and a growing community of supporters. While KAS may not match the explosive presale potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, its steady progress and scalability make it a reliable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Ethereum’s bid for $3,000 is capturing headlines, but the real action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana—where early-stage momentum and analyst optimism are already delivering outsized gains. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion and Solana’s technicals pointing higher, the window for transformative returns is wide open. Bitcoin and Kaspa provide stability, but for those seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender of 2025.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days. May 30 Bitcoin options open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.ch The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry. Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels. Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.ch Among the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price. Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price decline If Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches. The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions . Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions. Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust. Ultimately, bears’ main hope lies in a weaker macroeconomic environment, which could increase risk aversion and reduce demand for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin bulls aim for $110,000 by May 30 Below are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies. Between $102k and $105k: $2.75 billion in calls (buy) vs. $900 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $1.85 billion. Between $105k and $107k: $3.3 billion calls vs. $650 million puts, favoring calls by $2.65 billion. Between $107k and $110k: $3.7 billion calls vs. $350 million puts, favoring calls by $3.35 billion. Between $110k and $114k: $4.8 billion calls vs. $120 million puts, favoring calls by $4.7 billion. Bulls can maximize their gains by driving BTC above $110,000, which could help set a new all-time high. However, the ongoing bullish momentum depends on developments in the ongoing tariff war, which has been a key focus in recent weeks.

While Bitcoin remains the bedrock of digital finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are rapidly emerging as favored destinations for smart capital. With XRP and TRON also seeing notable inflows, the current cycle is defined by a flight to quality and momentum, as investors position for the next wave of outsized returns. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Magnet Drawing Major Whales MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the standout presale of 2025, with whale wallets quietly amassing large positions ahead of the project’s public debut. The presale has already surpassed $8 million, and analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation—both from retail and institutional investors. Notably, even holders of XRP and Aptos are rotating profits into MAGA, eager to capitalize on what could be the most explosive early-stage opportunity of the year. As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as a rare ground-floor entry for those seeking transformative gains. Bitcoin: Whales Double Down as Retail Exits Bitcoin is experiencing a dramatic redistribution of holdings, with whales and institutions quietly accumulating while retail investors take profits. Between mid-April and mid-May, large holders increased their BTC positions by over 83,000 coins, signaling robust confidence in the market’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin’s price currently hovers above $100,000, and analysts forecast a possible surge toward $115,000–$140,000 in the near term. The options market is even more bullish, with bets on BTC reaching $200,000 by year-end. This silent accumulation by whales and institutions underscores Bitcoin’s enduring appeal as a core holding, while also highlighting the growing appetite for high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana: Whale Buys Signal Unshakable Confidence Solana is another top target for whale accumulation, with large investors withdrawing over 145,000 SOL (worth $21.8 million) from exchanges in recent weeks. On-chain data reveals that two wallets—likely controlled by the same entity—have scooped up more than 250,000 SOL (valued at $60 million) in the past month. This aggressive buying is a clear vote of confidence in Solana’s technical strength, DeFi ecosystem, and long-term growth prospects. Analysts are targeting the $200 level as a near-term milestone, with forecasts suggesting further upside as institutional adoption accelerates. Solana’s robust fundamentals and expanding developer activity make it a standout among Layer-1 platforms, drawing both speculative and long-term capital. XRP and TRON: Steady Accumulation, But MAGA Steals the Show XRP continues to attract whale attention, with over 880 million tokens accumulated in May alone as regulatory clarity and institutional adoption fuel optimism. Analysts project a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if sentiment remains strong. TRON, meanwhile, is seeing steady accumulation and remains a reliable hold for those seeking stable returns. However, neither XRP nor TRON can match the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly becoming the go-to allocation for whales seeking the next crypto supercycle. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Whale accumulation is intensifying across the crypto market, with MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and Solana emerging as the top targets for smart capital. MAGA’s presale is drawing unprecedented interest, Bitcoin’s macro strength is unshaken, and Solana’s technicals are signaling further upside. As the window for early entry narrows, these tokens are setting the tone for the next phase of crypto growth—offering investors a rare chance to ride the wave of outsized returns.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of them. Currently priced under $0.03, this developing DeFi project is not just riding the presale momentum — it’s actively laying the foundation for long-term value. With multiple utilities in progress and a rising number of investors positioning early, including participants from established communities like Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX), MUTM is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to invest in before the next wave of adoption kicks in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale, with a token price of $0.03 and a confirmed launch price of $0.06. That means early backers are already positioned for 100% upside even before the token reaches public exchanges. But the price itself isn’t the headline — it’s what’s being built behind the scenes. With over $9,1 million raised and more than 11,000 holders already participating, the presale reflects growing belief in the project’s design, roadmap, and future token performance. As more investors search for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, the MUTM presale is gaining traction not from buzz — but from a clear path to utility. Lending and Borrowing With Real Yield Potential At the heart of Mutuum’s protocol is a decentralized system for lending and borrowing digital assets. Here’s how it works: Lenders deposit supported assets into smart contract pools and receive mtTokens — digital tokens that represent their deposits and grow in value as borrowers pay interest. Borrowers provide collateral and access liquidity without selling their original assets. The protocol uses a Loan-to-Value (LTV) model to calculate how much can be borrowed, helping protect lenders and balance the system. For example, a user could deposit stablecoins to earn passive income through interest-bearing returns, while another user borrows against their crypto holdings to fund short-term opportunities — all on-chain, without intermediaries. This model brings utility to the token ecosystem and gives real function to MUTM beyond trading — a critical factor in long-term crypto investing. Utilities That Will Drive Future Demand Mutuum isn’t stopping at lending. The team is also developing a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin — one that will be backed entirely by assets held within the protocol. This stablecoin will be algorithmically controlled, ensuring stability and transparency while generating revenue through borrowing activity. That revenue becomes part of a broader buy-and-redistribute system. As revenue is generated through interest and user activity on the platform, a designated share will be allocated toward acquiring MUTM tokens directly from public markets. These tokens are then redistributed to mtToken holders — creating a system that rewards long-term participation and increases token demand organically. It’s a self-sustaining model that supports price growth through platform activity. And with each new feature planned for post-launch, the value proposition for MUTM continues to expand. With a beta platform set to launch alongside the token, early users will be able to interact with key lending and borrowing features from the beginning — a rare advantage for presale participants. This immediate access puts MUTM in a different category from many new tokens that launch first, then build. The upside isn’t theoretical. As more investors look beyond high-cap coins and into top crypto coins under $1, tokens like MUTM offer something critical: real structure with future earnings potential. And with infrastructure like Layer-2 scaling being built in, Mutuum Finance is addressing both cost-efficiency and user experience from the start. Many early investors from ecosystems like Solana and Tron have already joined the Mutuum presale — not because of hype, but because of vision. With its protocol design, stablecoin integration, and planned token rewards, the project is assembling a complete DeFi structure while the token remains accessible. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now before the next market breakout, MUTM is proving that you don’t need to chase trending coins to find long-term value — you just need to look where the structure is being built.

Its presale has already pulled in over $264 million, with more than 21 billion BDAG coins sold. Buyers still have access to the fixed $0.0020 entry until June 13, offering a potential 2,400% profit with the launch price set at $0.05. This isn’t just another presale. BlockDAG is fully EVM-compatible, meaning developers can easily port or launch Ethereum dApps on its fast, low-cost Layer 1 setup. That opens the door to major dApp migration and adoption. And with a strong focus on infrastructure, this project has legs beyond market hype. The June 13 GO LIVE reveal will confirm 15 new exchange listings, in addition to MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com already onboard. The testnet is active, the X1 Miner App has over 1 million users, and 17,000+ ASIC miners have been distributed. With serious development, accessibility, and exchange support, BlockDAG stands apart from hype-driven names. It’s not just another trend. It’s one of the altcoins to watch with real substance and massive upside. Pepe (PEPE): Price Action and Utility Fuel New Growth Pepe is proving it belongs on the list of altcoins to watch this May. It’s trading near $0.00001277 and showing a 13% gain in the last seven days. Analysts expect a potential jump to $0.000030 based on bullish chart patterns. Its upcoming Ethereum-based AI token, MIND of Pepe, has stirred more interest. Though it’s down from its December high of $0.00002824, PEPE is still nearly 5x up year-over-year. With strong community support and a growing development team, Pepe is evolving beyond its meme origins. If the current momentum continues, Pepe could remain one of the altcoins to watch throughout Q2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Whale Accumulation Sends a Signal Shiba Inu continues to gain traction, making it a strong candidate among altcoins to watch. It currently trades around $0.00001558, with May bringing a 16% increase. Analysts are closely watching after whales picked up more than 530 trillion SHIB. This activity points to a possible supply crunch that could lift prices toward $0.000025. While some drop-off has been seen on the Shibarium network, overall outlook remains positive. SHIB may finally break out of its extended consolidation. Those tracking altcoins to watch are monitoring this closely. If SHIB clears its resistance levels, it might unlock the upside that’s been building for months. Dogecoin (DOGE): Bullish Chart Sets Up Possible Rally Dogecoin is flashing bullish signals and stands out among altcoins to watch. The coin trades near $0.2462, with technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout. A bull pennant and a strong RSI reading suggest DOGE may climb toward the $0.45 range. Despite recent whale sell-offs totaling $40 million, trading volumes are rising. This could signal renewed confidence in DOGE’s price movement. Memecoins tend to thrive in waves, and Dogecoin’s large following gives it an edge when retail buyers return. Its liquidity, brand recognition, and new use cases keep it relevant. As the charts align, DOGE is holding its place as one of the altcoins to watch this season. Final Thought Altcoins to watch in 2025 come in different forms. Pepe brings AI and price momentum. SHIB has sparked attention through whale accumulation. DOGE shows clear bullish patterns. Each coin offers a different strength, from community backing to chart appeal. But BlockDAG is more than momentum. It offers tech, adoption readiness, and a solid roadmap. With $264 million raised and over 21 billion coins sold, its $0.0020 price remains frozen until June 13. With a $0.05 launch price and the GO LIVE reveal set to unveil 15 more exchange listings, the timing could not be better. If you’re narrowing down the altcoins to watch right now, this mix of memecoins and a Layer 1 project gives both fun and function. From here, the next breakout could come fast, so staying early matters.

The altcoin has not only broken resistance levels but is currently maintaining a stronghold above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). BNB Price Set To Catapult To $1,000 With momentum building, Binance Coin (BNB) could be gearing up for a significant price move to $1,000, taking it well above all-time high levels. This forecast, published in an analysis report by TradingView crypto expert Unichartz, notes that the BNB price action has broken above a long-standing descending resistance line, indicated by the red line in the chart. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Releases Next Potential Targets For Cardano, Is $1 ADA Still Possible? The breakout from this downtrend signals the end of a multi-month consolidation phase and a potentially imminent trend reversal. More notably, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed a historical support-resistance zone marked in the shaded gray area around the $460 – $535 range, which previously acted as a ”battleground for bulls and bears.” This key level is now serving as a potential launchpad for further gains, reinforcing the BNB chart’s bullish structure. Moving forward, the 50 EMA, highlighted by the orange line in the chart, has repeatedly acted as a dynamic support for the BNB price during pullbacks. The TradingView analyst has revealed that on multiple occasions, BNB bounced off this moving average, confirming it as a reliable foundation for a potential rally. As long as the price continues to trade above this 50 EMA and within the reclaimed zone, Unichartz’s outlook for BNB remains optimistic. With sustained bullish momentum, a retest of the all-time high zone around $793 is likely. A successful breakout above this level could trigger a 45.99% climb toward the psychological $1,000 mark. BNB Bulls In Control As Price Aims For Fresh Breakout Market analyst Wise Crypto has issued a bullish forecast for the BNB price, anticipating a massive breakout that could see the altcoin surge above $700 soon. According to the analyst, several technical indicators and bullish developments are aligning in favor of this projected price surge. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says “Altseason Is Dawning” As Bitcoin Dominance Reaches HTF Resistance, What To Expect On the technical side, Wise Crypto pointed to indicators like the EMA, DMI, and Ichimoku Clouds flashing bullish. Fundamentally, the analyst emphasized Binance Coin’s growing Decentralized Exchange (DEX) volume. Notably, BNB’s DEX volume has skyrocketed by an impressive 85.66% increase within one week. The DEX trading volume saw a rise of about $34.85 billion, placing it well above its major competitors, Ethereum and Solana. Moreover, Wise Crypto has declared that BNB bulls have finally taken control, with the market trend demonstrating strength. Supported by positive technical indicators and growing DEX volume, the BNB price is expected to climb approximately 2.21% from its current price of $684.85 to reach $700 in the near term.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout performer, leveraging its political meme appeal and presale momentum to attract both retail and institutional capital. Meanwhile, XRP and Ethereum are experiencing renewed interest as investors seek refuge in projects with strong fundamentals and upside potential. With Bitcoin and Solana providing stability, the stage is set for a dynamic period of growth and strategic positioning. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Meme Powerhouse Defying Uncertainty MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the leading political-themed token of 2025, with its presale already surpassing $8 million and a price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Unlike generic memecoins that rely on fleeting hype, MAGA taps into deep-rooted political energy and American identity, building a community-driven movement that transcends typical crypto cycles. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and scarcity-driven model are fueling a surge in early-stage accumulation, with analysts projecting returns of 25x–35x or more by launch. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to maintain momentum even as broader markets react to political turbulence. The project’s grassroots support and strategic marketing have created a sense of urgency among investors, many of whom are rotating out of established altcoins to secure early entry before listings. As each presale stage fills, MAGA is solidifying its reputation as a breakout contender in an otherwise unpredictable landscape. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism, buoyed by regulatory clarity and the prospect of an ETF. Analysts forecast a move to $2.65–$2.85 in the near term, with some bullish scenarios targeting $3.40 or higher if sentiment remains strong. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the appointment of a crypto-friendly SEC chair have removed longstanding uncertainties, making XRP a more attractive hold for both retail and institutional investors. Despite recent market volatility, XRP’s technicals and fundamental outlook remain robust. The launch of CME futures and ongoing ETF speculation are driving increased liquidity and visibility, positioning XRP for further gains as the political and regulatory environment evolves. Ethereum: Steady Growth and Institutional Adoption Ethereum continues to anchor the smart contract ecosystem, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 as of May 2025. Analysts expect ETH to target $2,800–$2,900 in the near term, with long-term forecasts suggesting even greater upside if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. Ethereum’s recent upgrades and the anticipation of spot ETFs have bolstered investor confidence, making it a core holding for those seeking both stability and growth. While ETH’s price action is more measured compared to early-stage presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, its resilience and institutional support make it a reliable choice in uncertain times. Bitcoin and Solana: Market Anchors in a Volatile Landscape Bitcoin remains the bedrock of the crypto market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $115,000 or higher if current momentum holds, with the $100,000 level acting as critical support. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, even as political and economic uncertainty persists. Solana is also holding firm, with price action consolidating between $158 and $175 and technicals hinting at a breakout above $175 to retest $183. Analysts are targeting $180–$190 in the near term, with further upside possible as DeFi activity and developer engagement continue to expand. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Strength Amid the Fray Stellar Lumens (XLM) is quietly building momentum, trading near $0.28 and benefiting from its role in cross-border payments and DeFi applications. Analysts project a range of $0.24–$0.64 by year-end, with some optimistic forecasts even suggesting $0.80 or higher if adoption accelerates. While XLM may not match the explosive presale potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, its steady growth and real-world utility make it a dependable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Conclusion As political uncertainty drives market volatility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is surging ahead with strong presale momentum and a unique political narrative. XRP and Ethereum are also attracting renewed attention, offering investors a blend of regulatory clarity, institutional support, and upside potential. With Bitcoin and Solana providing stability, the crypto market is poised for a dynamic period of growth—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the breakout contender to watch in 2025.

Yet, amid the excitement around established tokens, a quiet revolution is unfolding: MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the dark horse of 2025, with analysts projecting returns that could dwarf even the most bullish XRP forecasts. While Hedera and Bitcoin round out the picture with steady gains, it’s MAGA’s presale momentum and scarcity-driven model that are capturing the imagination of forward-thinking investors. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Contender That’s Redefining Early-Stage ROI While XRP is making headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly stealing the show. With over $8 million raised and a presale price still under $0.001, analysts are calling MAGA the breakout contender of 2025. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. What sets MAGA apart is its potential for outsized returns: forecasts suggest a conservative 35x gain, with some models projecting up to 50x or more if current momentum continues. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $130,000—highlights the conviction behind this early-stage gem. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing target nears, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle. XRP: Breaking Barriers and Building Momentum XRP’s recent surge to $2.45 marks a significant milestone, driven by a confluence of regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and technical strength. Analysts are eyeing a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the short term, with some optimistic models even targeting $3.40 if bullish sentiment holds. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the launch of CME futures have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional adoption and ecosystem expansion. Despite these bullish signals, XRP’s upside is seen as steady rather than explosive—making it a core holding for those seeking stability, but not necessarily the next crypto moonshot. Hedera: Quiet Strength and Consolidation Hedera (HBAR) is holding steady near $0.21, consolidating after a strong rally earlier in May. While HBAR’s technicals remain bullish, its near-term upside is more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts project a range of $0.19–$0.78 for 2025, with steady growth expected as the network expands its real-world use cases. For investors seeking stability, HBAR is a dependable hold—but for those chasing the next 50x, MAGA is the clear standout. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Unshakable Confidence Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. For those seeking exponential returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are the new frontier. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP’s climb to $2.45 is a testament to its resilience and institutional appeal, but the real action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With analysts projecting up to 50x returns and a presale that’s drawing unprecedented demand, MAGA is quickly becoming the breakout contender of 2025. Hedera and Bitcoin offer stability and steady growth, but for those seeking the next crypto moonshot, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the name on every smart investor’s radar.

On Monday, the Senate advanced an industry-supported regulatory bill called the Genius Act. Meanwhile, the House Financial Services Committee has approved its stablecoin legislation , though the full House has not yet passed it. According to Paolo Ardoino, chief executive officer of Tether Holdings SA , they need to see how the Genius Act distinguishes between foreign and domestic issuers. He notes that their main interest will remain outside of the US. Genius Act could reshape oversight for foreign issuers Tether’s USDT stablecoin, based in El Salvador , represents over 60% of the stablecoin market and serves 420 million users across emerging markets. Despite facing conflicts with state and federal regulators over the years, the company has grown more active in the US, encouraged by a more crypto-friendly regulatory climate under President Donald Trump’s administration. Ardoino made his first trip to the US in March, stopping in Washington during Trump’s inaugural digital-asset summit. He noted that they are looking at the Genius Act in a way that will allow them to be compliant. He continued to say they could comply while focusing strongly on foreign markets. The stablecoin bills currently under consideration in the House and Senate mandate that these tokens—typically pegged to the dollar or another currency—be fully backed by cash and “safe assets” like short-term Treasuries. They also require issuers to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering regulations. Additionally, both bills would permit regulators to approve foreign issuers like Tether if they are governed by “comparable” regulations abroad. However, uncertainty remains regarding how strictly the law will enforce compliance for those who fail to meet the requirements. Ardoino said that stablecoins are important in the United States, but there are tons of ways to pay each other, such as Zelle, PayPal, debit cards, credit cards, and cash. Although Tether does not currently serve US customers, most of the private company’s reserves consist of assets that would comply with the proposed US legislation. Tether eyes compliance while targeting the unbanked However, the firm also backs its token with assets not permitted under the rules, such as Bitcoin and secured loans. Given its size, Tether would fall under federal regulation if it sought a US license under these regulations. In 2021, Tether settled with US authorities over accusations that it misrepresented its reserves. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., formerly led by Howard Lutnick, who served as Trump’s Secretary of Commerce, manages those reserves. Ardoino has indicated that the company may issue a new stablecoin designed to meet these regulatory requirements, potentially making it more appealing to institutional investors. The more supportive regulatory climate in the US has also motivated Tether to move closer to obtaining a full audit of its reserves by a Big Four accounting firm, which Ardoino said is still under discussion. Currently, Tether provides quarterly attestations certified by BDO Italia SpA. “They are going through a phase of adjustment, but a full audit is our priority,” Ardoino said. Stablecoins have become crucial to the functioning of crypto markets, with about $243 billion of them in circulation in May 2025. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a consortium of major banks, including JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, are exploring whether to issue a stablecoin jointly. Ardoino expressed confidence that competition from traditional banking giants would have minimal impact on Tether’s core business. While major U.S. banks are considering launching their own stablecoin, Tether remains focused on underserved global markets.

He is stepping down from the Polygon Foundation board and ending his role at the main development studio, Polygon Labs. Bjelic shared an X post stating, “After much thought and reflection, I’ve decided to step down from the board of the Polygon Foundation and wind down my day-to-day involvement with Polygon Labs.” This makes him the third founder to leave the team. He joins co-founders Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun, who had also stepped away from their active roles in the blockchain project. Kanani left the company in October 2023, while Arjun stepped down in March 2023 to concentrate on his modular blockchain project, Avail. Bjelic claims he can no longer give his best to Polygon Bjelic has played a pivotal role in taking Polygon to greater heights. In 2017, he co-founded the well-known Ethereum Layer 2, originally named Matic Network , along with Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun. Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions provide many advantages for the Ethereum network. These benefits include faster transaction times, lower fees, and better scalability. As a Layer 2 solution, Polygon uses these features to boost its own performance and improve the experience for its users. In support of this, it is evident that the firm has made significant contributions to blockchain research and development, particularly in zero-knowledge and proof-of-stake technologies. Polygon introduced MATIC for POL-on a one-to-one basis in late 2024 and initiated a token migration as a part of its 2.0 plan. This change was to drive more usage of the network’s main token for gas fees, staking, and infrastructure such as AggLayer. Following Polygon’s success, Bjelic’s 10+ years of experience as an IT engineer building technology products and platforms were greatly honored. However, on Friday, May 23, Bjelic shared an X post stating that he could no longer give his best to Polygon. Based on his explanation, as projects developed and evolved, it was natural for ideas to shift and sometimes become divided up. Afterward, Bjelic mentioned that Polygon leaders seemed sincerely dedicated to seeing the project prosper. He then offered support to them from the sideline and for whatever he could do to assist. Following his resignation, Nailwal praised Bjelic in an X post , stating he was not only a co-founder but also a brother to him. He added, “From the earliest days — whiteboards full of ideas, endless whitepapers, governance frameworks, strategy calls deep into the night — you have been a force behind so much of what makes Polygon.” Bjelic reveals himself as a strong crypto believer Bjelic revealed that he first learned about cryptocurrency in 2013. By 2017, he was really diving into it, excited by the idea of creating a worldwide, inclusive economy. Since then, he has dedicated himself to making that amazing vision a reality. This is evident since Polygon’s launch in 2019, as Bjelic and his colleagues have made great progress. According to reliable sources, they have achieved important advancements in zero-knowledge technology and brought on some of the biggest brands in the world, moving closer to that big dream. By undertaking this great journey, Bjelic initially highlighted taking pride in this and felt lucky to collaborate with many skilled individuals. Concerning his resignation, he mentioned that he still felt just as enthusiastic about the potential of cryptocurrency to change systems, empower people, and build a fairer world. Therefore, he added that this belief continues to motivate him, and as a result, he will probably be seen around. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

His resignation drew reactions across Polygon and the wider crypto community, with several seeing it as a loss for Polygon, which has been tied to several major developments in recent months. Bjelic winds down ‘day-to-day involvement’ “After much thought and reflection, I’ve decided to step down from the board of the Polygon Foundation and wind down my day-to-day involvement with Polygon Labs,” Bjelic said in a May 23 X post. “I’ll always be cheering from the sidelines and supporting however and whenever I can,” Bjelic added. “As projects evolve and mature, it is natural for visions to evolve, and sometimes diverge. With this in mind, I can no longer contribute to Polygon to the best of my abilities.” Fellow Polygon co-founder, Sandeep Nailwal, commended Bjelic’s contributions over the years, adding that Bjelic has always been “a force behind so much of what makes Polygon what it is today.” Source: Sandeep Nailwal Bjelic said that he remains “as passionate as ever” about crypto, and suggested he will stay active in the crypto industry. “You will likely still see me around,” Bjelic said. Aave-chan Initiative founder Marc Zella said it was a “Big L for Polygon.” Polygon’s head of marketing Leon Stern said the company is going to miss Bjelic. “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Polygon, and best of luck,” Stern said. Meanwhile, Skale Network CEO Jack O’Holleran said Bjelic should “be very proud” of all he has accomplished at Polygon and is excited to see what he does next. Source: Maggie Love Over the past two years, two of Polygon Labs’ early founders, Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun, also stepped away from the company. Arjun’s departure coincided with the Polygon spin-off Avail, a Web3 data availability and consensus layer, becoming an independent entity, with Arjun taking the lead. Bjelic has yet to reveal his next plans. Related: Crypto market cycle permanently shifted — Polygon founder Bjelic’s resignation follows several major announcements tied to Polygon this year. On March 25, Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform DigiShares announced it would bring tokenized real estate trading to Polygo n with the launch of RealEstate.Exchange, also known as REX. Just two months before, on Jan. 16, Jio Platforms, an Indian mobile network operator owned by Asia’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani, partnered with Polygon Labs to upgrade some of its existing offerings with Web3 and blockchain capabilities.

Yet, while XRP’s ascent captures headlines, savvy investors are turning their gaze toward MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—two projects where early-stage positioning and structural catalysts could unlock even higher returns. With Ethereum and Cosmos also in the mix, the stage is set for a summer of strategic portfolio shifts and explosive growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon With 35x–50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts are projecting returns of 35x–50x, with some models even suggesting a $1 valuation by year-end—a move that would eclipse the gains of most established altcoins. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $133,000—marks the largest single early-stage crypto investment of the year, underscoring the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking outsized returns before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. XRP: Bullish Breakout and Institutional Catalyst XRP is trading near $2.45, riding a wave of positive sentiment fueled by regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and growing adoption in cross-border payments. Technical indicators show a strong breakout setup, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the near term and some optimistic models even targeting $5 by year-end if bullish momentum persists.The recent resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the launch of CME futures have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional inflows and price appreciation. Despite these bullish signals, XRP’s upside potential is seen as steady rather than transformative—making it a core holding for those seeking stability, but not necessarily the next crypto moonshot. Cardano: Technical Strength and Growth Forecast Cardano is quietly building momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential rise toward $0.90 in the near term and a bullish target of $1.88 by year-end if key support levels hold. The project’s double bottom pattern and rising on-balance volume signal strong accumulation and growing investor confidence. While Cardano’s price action is less dramatic than MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale surge, its robust fundamentals and ecosystem expansion make it a compelling choice for those seeking steady, long-term growth. However, for investors chasing the highest multiples, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage entry and explosive upside potential are hard to ignore. Ethereum and Cosmos: Steady Performers in a Dynamic Market Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades. Analysts expect ETH to target $2,800–$2,900 in the near term, with long-term forecasts suggesting even greater upside if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. While Ethereum offers stability and proven value, its upside may be more measured compared to the explosive potential of early-stage presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cosmos (ATOM) is also gaining traction, with its focus on interoperability and developer engagement attracting a loyal following. While ATOM’s price action is subdued compared to MAGA’s presale momentum, its steady growth and real-world utility make it a dependable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP’s momentum is building, but the real excitement is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—where early-stage positioning and structural catalysts could unlock even higher returns. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion and a $0.007 listing target, the window for outsized gains is closing fast. For those seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender of 2025.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Shot Up Recently The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the sentiment held by the average trader in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The metric uses a numerical scale running from 0-100 in order to represent the sentiment. All values above 53 represent greed among the investors, while those below 47 indicate fear. The index lying between these two cutoffs implies a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals Besides these three main zones, there are also two ‘extreme’ regions called the extreme greed (above 75) and extreme fear (below 25). At present, the market sentiment is inside the former of the two, according to the latest value of the Fear & Greed Index. Historically, the extreme sentiments have held much significance for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as they have been where major tops and bottoms have tended to form. The relationship has been an inverse one, however, meaning that an overly bullish atmosphere makes tops likely and an excess of despair bottoms. Some traders exploit this fact in order to time their buy and sell moves. This trading technique is popularly known as contrarian investing. Warren Buffet’s famous quote sums up the core idea: “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” With the Bitcoin sentiment now making a return into the extreme greed region, it’s possible that followers of this philosophy may be starting to look toward the exit. That said, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of ‘just’ 78 at the moment. For comparison, the December top occurred at around 87 and the January one at 84. Earlier in the rally, the metric even hit a much higher peak of 94 in November. As such, it’s possible that the current market may not be quite that overheated in terms of sentiment just yet, assuming demand from the investors doesn’t let off. It only remains to be seen, though, how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would evolve under this extreme greed. Speaking of demand, whales have just made a significant amount of withdrawals from the Binance platform, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Exchange Netflow,” which tells us about the net amount of Bitcoin that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with a centralized exchange, which, in this case, is Binance. Clearly, the Binance Exchange Netflow has observed a large negative value, implying that the investors have shifted a notable amount of coins out of the exchange. More specifically, net outflows for the platform have stood at 2,190 BTC or about $237 million. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target?

Yet, as established giants like Bitcoin, XRP, and Polkadot trade in tighter ranges, the spotlight is shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose momentum and upside projections are eclipsing even the most established names. As Q3 2025 approaches, smart money is increasingly positioning for the next breakout, and MAGA is emerging as the top candidate for exponential gains. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, But Capital Is Rotating Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold its ground above $110,000, with institutional inflows and ETF adoption providing a strong foundation for further growth. Analysts forecast a potential surge to $116,000–$137,000 in the coming weeks, but as BTC’s momentum steadies, capital is rotating into altcoins with higher-multiple potential. Early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now drawing aggressive capital rotation, as investors look to maximize returns in the next phase of the bull cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Powerhouse With 12,000%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing the competition, with Stage 8 now live and over $8 million raised. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—has made it the #1 altcoin entry for ROI-focused buyers in 2025. Analysts are projecting up to 40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting a path to 12,000%–18,500% upside if momentum continues. A recent $132,000+ whale buy marks the largest single early-stage investment of the year, underscoring the conviction behind MAGA’s explosive setup. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next supercycle winner. Each stage is filling rapidly, and as visibility grows, MAGA is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. XRP: Bullish Momentum, But Limited Multiples XRP is trading between $2.36 and $2.65, having surged over 300% since late 2024 on the back of regulatory clarity and institutional partnerships. While technicals and ecosystem developments remain bullish, short-term momentum has slowed as XRP consolidates below recent highs. Analysts now project a breakout above $3.40 could push XRP toward $4.50–$7.50 by summer, but for now, the asset is in a holding pattern as the market awaits the next catalyst. Many traders seeking sharper upside are now looking to early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for more dramatic returns. Polkadot: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Polkadot (DOT) is holding steady around $7.50, with ongoing development and ecosystem expansion. While DOT remains a dependable hold for long-term investors, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 40x winner. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Solana’s approach to $190 is a testament to its resilience and institutional appeal, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 12,000%–18,500% upside are keeping it firmly in the spotlight. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery.

Bitcoin (BTC) is stepping into what many observers are calling a new era; one that could fundamentally defy past expectations and reshape its very role within the global financial system. While skeptics often point to its notorious price volatility, a quieter, more profound revolution is taking place beneath the surface. Key political changes, pivotal regulatory shifts in the U.S., and surging institutional interest are all now aligning to drive Bitcoin towards genuine mainstream adoption. Investors who are only watching the day-to-day price swings might just be missing the bigger picture: Bitcoin is steadily embedding itself into the fabric of the global economy.

While past epochs saw triple-digit rallies, a new story may be unfolding: one of rising maturity, deeper adoption, and network resilience.” The tweet landed minutes after the firm released “2024 Bitcoin Halving: One Year Later,” authored by senior analyst Daniel Gray, who contends that the apparent lull in price action masks “a strengthening foundation.” Fidelity Flags Bitcoin’s Silent Surge “Bitcoin presents a nuanced narrative a year after its fourth halving, with signs pointing toward consolidation, network resilience, and growing institutional adoption,” Gray writes, adding that structural indicators “suggest a strengthening foundation.” While previous cycles delivered triple- and even quadruple-digit percentage gains by this stage, Gray argues the softer trajectory signals maturation: “History suggests that we would be well into the bull run at this point in the fifth epoch — but this cycle may be unfolding more cautiously.” From a market-share perspective the data are unequivocal. “Bitcoin’s market dominance excluding stablecoins has risen to just over 72.4% as of 11 May, a new eight-year high,” Gray notes, pointing out that Ether and Solana have surrendered ground even as “fragmentation on the long tail of assets has failed to produce a clear alternative leader.” Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals On-chain security metrics tell a similar story: “Bitcoin’s daily hash-rate rose above one zetta hash per second twice in April, reflecting continued investment in mining infrastructure despite a 60 percent collapse in hash price since the halving,” he observes. Spot-market behaviour has begun to echo those fundamentals. Bitcoin printed a record intraday high of $109,486 on 21 May before extending above $111,000 on so-called Pizza Day, holding near $110,600 at press time. The move has been underwritten by renewed demand from US spot ETFs, which drew $934.8 million of net subscriptions yesterday, May 22— the heaviest single-day haul in almost four weeks. Derivatives activity mirrors the trend: aggregate futures open interest reached a record $80 billion on May 23, up roughly 30% since the start of the month, according to CoinGlass data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Blasts To $111,867 All-Time High—Here’s What’s Driving The Surge Meanwhile, funding rates in most crypto exchanges are at the baseline or below it. “This is the least euphoric new all-time highs in the history of Bitcoin,” crypto analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) wrote via X. Gray cautions that investors should focus less on headline returns and more on the architecture taking shape beneath them. “Although returns have been more measured compared to previous cycles, structural metrics suggest a strengthening foundation. Overall, it appears Bitcoin is potentially maturing—something investors may find more notable than short-term price movement,” he writes. His closing assessment is blunt: “One year post-halving, Bitcoin’s price performance may seem muted, but its fundamentals appear stronger than ever … this may be a cycle that redefines Bitcoin’s role in a modern portfolio.” In other words, Fidelity’s message for would-be spectators is as clear as its headline: do not blink. At press time, BTC traded at $109,563.

By glossing over this problem, we risk allowing governments and corporations to control the global conversation. Both AI technology and industry have gone parabolic. Its censorship potential becomes greater every day. Every one to two years since 2010, the computational power of training AI systems has increased by a factor of 10, making the threat of censorship and control of public discourse more real than ever. Corporations worldwide ranked privacy and data governance as their top AI risks, while censorship didn’t register on their radar. AI – which can process millions of data points in seconds – can censor through various means, including content moderation and control of information. LLMs (large language models) and content recommendations can filter, suppress or mass share information at scale. In 2023, Freedom House highlighted that AI is enhancing state-led censorship. In China, the CAC (Cyberspace Administration) has incorporated censorship strategy into generative AI tools, requiring chatbots to support “core socialist values” and block content the communist party wants to censor. Chinese AI models, such as DeepSeek’s R1, already censor topics like the Tiananmen Square massacre, in order to spread state narratives. “To protect the free and open internet, democratic policymakers – working side by side with civil society experts from around the world – should establish strong human rights–based standards for both state and non-state actors that develop or deploy AI tools,” concludes Freedom House. In 2021, UC San Diego found that AI algorithms trained on censored datasets, such as China’s Baidu Baike, which associates the keyword ‘democracy’ with ‘chaos.’ Models trained on uncensored sources associated ‘democracy’ with ‘stability.’ In 2023, Freedom House’s ‘Freedom on the Net’ report found that global internet freedom fell for the 13th consecutive year. It attributed a large part of the decline to AI. Twenty-two countries have laws in place requiring social media companies to employ automated systems for content moderation, which could be used to suppress debate and demonstrations. Myanmar’s military junta, for instance, used AI to monitor Telegram groups and detain dissidents and carry out death sentences based on their posts. The same happened in Iran. Additionally, in Belarus and Nicaragua, governments sentenced individuals to draconian prison terms for their online speech. Freedom House found that no fewer than 47 governments used comments to sway online conversations towards their preferred narratives. It found that in the past year, new technology was used in at least 16 countries to sow the seeds of doubt, smear opponents or influence public debate. At least 21 countries require digital platforms to use machine learning to delete political, social and religious speech. A 2023 Reuters report warned that AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation could “undermine public trust in democratic processes,” empowering regimes that seek to tighten control over information. In the 2024 US presidential elections, AI-generated images falsely implying Taylor Swift endorsed Donald Trump demonstrated that AI is already manipulating public opinion. China offers the most prominent example of AI-driven censorship. A leaked dataset analyzed by TechCrunch in 2025 revealed a sophisticated AI system designed to censor topics like pollution scandals, labor disputes and Taiwan political issues. Unlike traditional keyword-based filtering, this system uses LLMs to evaluate context and flag political satire. Researcher Xiao Qiang noted that such systems “significantly improve the efficiency and granularity of state-led information control.” A 2024 House Judiciary Committee report accused the NSF (National Science Foundation) of funding AI tools to combat ‘misinformation’ on Covid-19 and the 2020 election. The report found that the NSF funded AI-based censorship and propaganda tools. “In the name of combating alleged misinformation regarding Covid-19 and the 2020 election, NSF has been issuing multi-million-dollar grants to university and non-profit research teams,” reads the report. “The purpose of these taxpayer-funded projects is to develop AI-powered censorship and propaganda tools that can be used by governments and Big Tech to shape public opinion by restricting certain viewpoints or promoting others.” A 2025 WIRED report discovered that DeepSeek’s R1 model includes censorship filters at both the application and training levels, resulting in blocks on sensitive topics. In 2025, a Pew Research Center survey found that 83% of US adults were concerned about AI-driven misinformation, with many showing concerns about its free speech implications. Pew interviewed AI experts, who said that AI training data can unintentionally reinforce existing power structures. Addressing AI-driven censorship A 2025 HKS Misinformation Review called for better reporting to reduce fear-driven calls for censorship. The survey found that 38.8% of Americans are somewhat concerned, and 44.6% are highly concerned, about AI’s role in spreading misinformation during the 2024 US presidential election, while 9.5% held no concerns, and 7.1% were unaware of the issue altogether. Creating an open-source AI ecosystem is of the utmost importance. This means companies disclose training dataset sources and biases. Governments should create AI regulatory frameworks prioritizing free expression. If we want a human future, instead of an AI-managed technocratic dystopia, the AI industry and consumers need to build up the courage to tackle censorship.

Cardano’s surge and Bitcoin’s stability are drawing headlines, but the real buzz is around MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin that’s outpacing even the most established names. With Solana, XRP, and SUI consolidating, analysts are calling MAGA the leading early-stage play as Q3 approaches. Cardano: Academic Partnerships Fuel a Bullish Run Cardano (ADA) has broken past $0.82, powered by a series of global academic collaborations and real-world blockchain integrations. The network’s commitment to research and education is paying off, with analysts forecasting ADA could reach $0.90–$1.00 by early summer. While Cardano’s fundamentals and ecosystem expansion are earning it long-term credibility, some investors are looking to amplify returns by rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Presale and 35x Upside Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the 2025 presale cycle, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—capped at 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, and audited by HashEx—are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code MAGA50X , MAGA is being positioned as the rare ground-floor opportunity before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Unlike fleeting meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding a wave of real investor confidence, strategic rollout, and viral political energy—making it the top allocation for smart money heading into Q3. Bitcoin: Macro Strength and Capital Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s anchor, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. While Bitcoin’s macro strength is unshaken, its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. As retail investors take profits, smart capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early-stage entry points offer the kind of asymmetric potential that built fortunes in previous cycles. Solana, XRP, and SUI: Solid, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is consolidating near $170, with technicals hinting at a breakout above $175. XRP is trading between $2.36 and $2.65, holding steady after a 300% rally since late 2024. SUI is gaining traction with network upgrades and developer activity, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates out of consolidating assets and into high-upside plays, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next breakout. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s academic partnerships and Bitcoin’s resilience are impressive, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 35x are making it the breakout coin to watch for Q3 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar.

Yet, while Solana’s performance remains impressive, the spotlight is quickly shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose momentum and potential upside are dominating analyst conversations. With XRP, SEI, and Cardano also drawing attention, the race for the next major breakout is heating up, and MAGA is rapidly emerging as the must-watch contender. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 40x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage altcoins in 2025, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—has fueled a surge in demand from both retail and institutional buyers. Analysts are projecting 35x–50x returns as a conservative estimate, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if current momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGA is quickly becoming the primary entry point for those seeking exponential gains before listings reshape the market. Solana: Bullish Structure and Institutional Confidence Solana (SOL) continues to impress, trading in a tight range around $170 and supported by bullish momentum across all timeframes. Technical analysis points to a possible breakout above $175, which could pave the way for a retest of $183 and beyond. Experts predict that, with continued ecosystem growth and institutional adoption, SOL could revisit the $240–$260 range later this year. While Solana’s upward movement is now more gradual, its strong fundamentals and rising spot volumes keep it a top pick for long-term growth alongside explosive early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Bullish Structure and ETF Tailwinds XRP is showing renewed strength, trading near $2.50 and maintaining a bullish structure supported by multiple moving averages. After bouncing from the $2.10 range and breaking past key resistances, XRP is consolidating above $2.30. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate, with some stretch targets as high as $15. While XRP remains a core institutional asset, many long-time holders are now diversifying into early-stage assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper upside before the next leg up. SEI and Cardano: Quiet Accumulation, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight SEI and Cardano (ADA) are both quietly attracting smart capital, with ADA’s development ecosystem and staking rewards making it a favorite among long-term holders. However, neither SEI nor ADA offers the early-stage entry or explosive upside that MAGACOIN FINANCE brings to the table. As traders seek breakout returns, MAGA’s structured presale and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation heading into Q3. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion While Solana’s bullish trend continues and XRP maintains institutional momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a locked-in $0.007 listing price, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA stands out as the breakout altcoin to watch.

History shows that early participation is where the real gains are made, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to more recent wins like Solana and Avalanche. Even Monero, once dismissed by many, eventually delivered major returns to those who held on. Today, all eyes are starting to turn toward Qubetics ($TICS), a rising project gaining traction for its practical tech, strong token dynamics, and growing support from early adopters. Qubetics has sparked substantial interest due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. As of May 2025, its presale is actively progressing, and the stage-based pricing model is already rewarding early adopters. With its strategic allocation for early investors, a cutting-edge technological framework, and a mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, Qubetics offers far more than speculative appeal — it offers timing, technology, and traction. For those still seeking one of the top altcoins to buy, Qubetics may be that overdue shot at a transformative ROI. Qubetics: One of the Top Altcoins to Buy Before This Presale Ends Missing out on Qubetics ’ earliest phase — where $TICS was available for just $0.01 during its quiet September 2024 rollout — is something many investors already regret. Multiple presale stages have already passed, each bringing a 10% price increase, and now the token is at Stage 35, priced at $0.2785. More than $17.3 million has been raised, over 513 million $TICS tokens sold, and more than 26,900 investors are now holders. Yet despite this traction, the door is still open. This top crypto presale is not out of reach yet. With each stage lasting only seven days and a 10% discount incentive on current pricing, Qubetics still qualifies among the top altcoins to buy. Backed by its upcoming Q2 2025 mainnet launch, Qubetics is built for sustainability. The project allocated 12.85% of the total token supply for early adopters — demonstrating a long-term commitment to community-driven growth. ROI projections remain exceptionally promising. At the current $0.2785 price, an investor could see a 258.95% ROI if $TICS hits $1 after launch. If it reaches $5, that return spikes to 1,694.74%, and at $6, the ROI rises to 2,053.68%. More ambitious scenarios show a 3,489.47% ROI at $10 and a staggering 5,284.21% ROI at $15. For example, a $2,000 investment now could yield up to $107,700 at a $6 valuation or as high as $179,500 at $10 — all while remaining below major cap thresholds. This ROI trajectory places Qubetics firmly among the top altcoins to buy for high-upside market plays. Qubetics stands apart because it solves a fundamental pain point in blockchain: interoperability. In the fragmented Web3 ecosystem, users and enterprises face siloed blockchains that don’t communicate natively. Qubetics bridges this gap. Whether you’re a supply chain company needing cross-chain transaction verification between Ethereum and Solana, or a Web3 developer building on Bitcoin but needing real-time access to Ethereum’s liquidity pools, Qubetics offers seamless asset transfer and protocol compatibility. Enterprises benefit through cost efficiency and reduced integration overhead, while individual users gain frictionless access to decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 dApps from multiple chains — through one unified, interoperable chain. Monero’s Story: The Silent Riser in the Privacy Coin Arena Monero (XMR), known for its robust privacy protocol, is a perfect example of a crypto that eventually delivered but only after years of waiting. It launched in 2014 with an ICO price under $1 and was largely ignored in its early stages. The project’s focus on fungibility and anonymity didn’t immediately translate into mass investor interest, as competitors like Ethereum were capturing the spotlight. Yet, Monero steadily built a core user base that valued its unique privacy advantages — and when privacy coins gained popularity, XMR skyrocketed. Its all-time high came years later, rewarding early believers with life-changing gains. Throughout its development, Monero has maintained a niche but loyal presence in the crypto space. Its Proof-of-Work model, RingCT technology, and fungibility features give it unmatched privacy capabilities. However, Monero’s slow climb and long dormancy periods meant that many only joined after the major growth occurred. While XMR still holds relevance, it highlights the importance of getting in early on crypto projects that offer real, differentiating use cases. The Monero narrative reflects why identifying top altcoins to buy before the masses catch on is a critical factor in building substantial ROI. Conclusion: The Next Wave Is Here — Will You Ride It? Cryptocurrency history repeats itself — and not always kindly for latecomers. Whether it was Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Monero, the highest gains have always gone to those who acted early with conviction. Today, Qubetics represents one of those rare moments of opportunity. Its ongoing presale structure, ambitious interoperability framework, and clear market utility all point to significant post-launch potential. If you’re still looking for top altcoins to buy, Qubetics checks every box — from ROI forecasts to real-world utility. The truth is, you still have time to join this top crypto presale before the final stages drive prices further. Qubetics is still accessible and poised for a breakout in 2025. For those tired of looking back with regret, this may be your moment to participate in what could become one of the top altcoins to buy for the upcoming expansion cycle.

With the SEC’s friendlier stance and ETF approvals in the spotlight, ETH’s resurgence is emboldening investors to explore new opportunities. In this climate, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP have become focal points for those seeking both early-stage momentum and institutional-grade upside. Avalanche and Bitcoin remain foundational, but the most aggressive capital is now chasing the next breakout in MAGA and XRP. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum and Whale Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the early-stage landscape, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling a wave of demand from both retail and institutional buyers. Analysts are forecasting 25x–40x returns for those who enter before listings, with some models even suggesting a $1 target by year-end if momentum holds. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts underscore the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential, while a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code MAGA50X is amplifying demand. As each presale stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the go-to allocation for those seeking the next 10x–40x winner in Q3 2025. Ethereum: Regulatory Wins and Renewed Bullishness Ethereum’s 2025 narrative has shifted from uncertainty to resurgence, with a 90% rally off its April lows and bullish technicals now pointing toward a possible $3,950 breakout. The SEC’s friendlier approach and ETF approvals have removed longstanding barriers, giving ETH a clear path for institutional adoption and price appreciation. As regulatory clarity returns, Ethereum is once again viewed as a stable springboard for capital—enabling investors to confidently rotate into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Institutional Momentum and ETF Speculation XRP is consolidating above $2.30, buoyed by legal victories, ETF buzz, and its growing role as a global settlement asset. The SEC’s resolution of its lawsuit against Ripple and the appointment of a pro-crypto chairman have eliminated years of uncertainty, making XRP a magnet for both retail and institutional capital. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some models targeting $5.50–$15 by year-end if ETF approval and institutional inflows accelerate. While XRP’s upside is robust, the window for exponential returns is now shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the entry price and risk/reward profile are even more compelling. Avalanche and Bitcoin: Steady Growth, but MAGA Steals the Show Avalanche (AVAX) is trading between $18.50 and $22.06, with analysts seeing a modest recovery for 2025. While AVAX and BTC remain dependable core holdings, their near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the surge potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates out of sideways-trading assets, early-stage opportunities like MAGA are capturing the attention of traders looking for outsized returns before listings go live. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s regulatory clarity is revitalizing confidence across the crypto market, but the biggest opportunities are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With whale accumulation, a scarcity-driven model, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA stands out as the most promising early-stage play of 2025. For those seeking to maximize returns before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout altcoin to watch as Q3 approaches.

The platform ends yield-generating services, opting for a 1:1 bitcoin custody system to reduce client risk. The change responds to rising BTC loan demand and regulatory pressure, distancing from altcoins and risky lending. On May 23, 2025, crypto lender Ledn confirmed it will stop supporting Ethereum (ETH) and shift entirely to a bitcoin-only lending model. The move takes effect on July 1, 2025, and comes as part of a broader strategy to simplify services and minimize risk. Ledn stated that it will no longer use client assets to generate yield. Instead, it will adopt a full custody model. This approach means users’ bitcoin will either remain in direct custody or with trusted custody partners, removing intermediaries and lending loops from the process. The decision reflects Ledn’s response to rising competition in the BTC-backed loan sector. It also signals the company’s commitment to reduce client exposure to lending risks that led to past collapses in the crypto lending space.

He pointed to the fact that XRP sits at about $2.35 right now. That price is low compared with where he thinks it will go. He told followers to pick up as much as they can while the chance is there. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight XRP Trading Below $3 XRP has climbed about 350% over the past year. That beat gains in some of the top altcoins in the market today. Yet many still see the move as slow. At $2.39 per coin, that view is easy to understand. Even so, BarriC calls anything under $3 a bargain. Predictions For A Rally Based on examination from his Twitter thread, BarriC expects XRP to hit $10 first. He then sees it pushing to $20 in the months ahead. Those moves would set a new high during what he calls the next alt season. If those figures come true, buyers who got in under $3 would see roughly a seven-fold gain at the $20 mark. $XRP will become very expensive to buy in the next few months and the next few years Right now, you can accumulate $XRP below $3 And somehow that’s considered a failure When $XRP skyrockets over the next few months and hits $10-$20 per #XRP That’s the new all time high… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 17, 2025 … But Possible Correction Ahead BarriC also warned of a pullback after a big rise. He thinks XRP could drop by about 50% once it reaches $20. That would put it back in the $5–$10 range. He sees that dip as a fresh chance to buy in. Even then, $5 is still higher than today’s $2.39. Long Term Vision For XRP Looking past the next cycle, BarriC outlined a bold scenario. He believes banks and big payment firms will use XRP for daily money transfers. In that case, demand could send the price all the way to $1,000 within 10 years. When banks start using $XRP We will know because of the insane price per $XRP We will see prices like $100, $500, $1,000 Per #XRP The fact that we can still accumulate $XRP at approx $2 means that banks aren’t utilising $XRP …. YET Once that day comes Once banks and… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 3, 2025 To reach that level, XRP’s market cap would top $58 trillion. That would put it on par with major pieces of the global money system. Technical Signals And Short-Term Outlook Technical indicators point to a possible drop to around $2.21 by June 22, 2025, which would be a -9.20% change from now. The current sentiment gauge reads Bullish, but the Fear & Greed Index sits at 0. Over the past 30 days, XRP had 13 out of 30 green days and showed about 5.10% price swings. Those numbers hint at mixed views. Some traders see room to run. Others expect more choppy action before the next big move.

If those start to speed up, we could see more buzz around XRP’s real-world uses. Until then, buying under $3 could look smart—or it could stay quiet for a while. Either way, investors will have to decide how much risk they want for the chance at a big payout in the years to come.

While ADA’s academic partnerships and technical progress are fueling its climb, the real excitement is building around early-stage tokens and blue-chip giants poised for even greater gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral presale momentum, and Ethereum, backed by robust fundamentals, are quickly becoming the top picks for investors seeking outperformance as summer 2025 approaches. Cardano: Bullish Surge and Real-World Progress Cardano (ADA) has rallied impressively, recently pushing above $0.82 and attracting fresh capital on the back of bullish technicals and expanding academic collaborations. Analysts predict that if ADA can sustain momentum above key support levels, it could test the $0.90–$1.00 range by the end of May, with further upside possible if the broader market remains favorable. While Cardano’s commitment to education and real-world adoption is earning it long-term credibility, its near-term price action is still influenced by overall market sentiment and Bitcoin’s performance. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Breakout Presale With Explosive Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing the competition as 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—a capped 100 billion supply, 45% allocated to presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next 100x opportunity before listings go live. As the broader market consolidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the watchlists of traders and analysts alike, with some even suggesting a $1 target by year-end—a move that would eclipse the gains of most established altcoins. Ethereum: Bullish Structure and Institutional Confidence Ethereum (ETH) is quietly building momentum, trading between $2,400 and $2,900 as of May 2025 3 . Technical indicators point to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900, with the Ichimoku Cloud and MACD both signaling a continuation of the uptrend. Analysts expect that sustained momentum above $2,650 could see ETH retest $3,000 as summer trading heats up. With institutional adoption, Layer 2 expansion, and the prospect of spot ETFs on the horizon, Ethereum remains a core holding for those seeking both stability and significant upside in the next cycle. Solana, XRP, and HBAR: Solid, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $158 and $175, with forecasts calling for a move to $180–$210 if macro conditions stay favorable. XRP is holding steady at $2.35, with analysts targeting $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks and $5.50–$15 by year-end if momentum persists. Hedera (HBAR) continues to build quietly, with price predictions for May 2025 averaging around $0.25. While each of these tokens offers solid fundamentals and growth prospects, none currently match the explosive presale momentum and upside potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Cardano’s surge past $0.82 is a testament to its progress and growing ecosystem, but the most aggressive capital is now flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion, a $0.007 listing target, and analysts forecasting up to 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast. For those seeking the next breakout winner as the market heats up, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum are the names on every smart investor’s radar.

Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fresh altcoin, is drawing investor eyes with its phase 5 presale at $0.03. Since its debut, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $9,200,000, selling over 505 million tokens to 11,500 holders. This new cryptocurrency offers a decentralized lending model, sparking curiosity of its potential in the crypto market. As Cardano (ADA) eyes a 500% rally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as a top crypto to buy now, blending utility with growth. Let’s explore these assets’ paths forward. Cardano’s breakout signals Cardano (ADA) is flashing bullish hints, testing the upper edge of its descending channel. After rebounding from $0.68, it’s gaining traction for a potential rally. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 59.46 shows rising buyer interest. A push past 60 could ignite stronger momentum. The MACD is nearing a bullish crossover, often a prelude to price jumps. If Cardano (ADA) breaks $1.17 resistance, it might climb to $1.90, then $2.60, with $3.40 as a long-term target. Over $932 million in ADA has left exchanges in 2025, hinting at a supply shock. This makes Cardano (ADA) a top cryptocurrency for investors seeking the next big crypto. Binance leads ADA trading volume at $2.19 million, with Bybit showing strong inflows. This activity suggests growing confidence in Cardano (ADA). Investors are locking up tokens, reducing available supply. Such moves often precede sharp price spikes. As the crypto market heats up, Cardano (ADA) stands out as a top crypto to invest in for 2025. Its technical strength and investor interest fuel optimism. The question remains: can it hit $10? A 500% surge seems plausible, but sustained momentum is key. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now enters the spotlight, offering a different kind of opportunity. Mutuum Finance’s presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powering through phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, priced at $0.03. This marks a 200% rise from the first phase’s $0.01. Phase 6 looms, bringing a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. Buying now locks in a 100% ROI at the $0.06 listing price. Analysts see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hitting $2.50 in 2025, yielding an 8,233% return from the current price. This positions it as a top crypto to buy for investors chasing high returns. The project’s focus on decentralized lending sets it apart in the altcoin space. Mutuum Finance’s lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers real utility through its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system lets users deposit assets like USDT into smart contract pools, earning interest based on pool demand. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model allows direct lending, ideal for niche assets like meme coins. Overcollateralized loans, like $7,000 in ETH for $5,000 in USDT, ensure stability. The platform’s mtTokens, such as mtETH, grow in value as interest accrues, offering passive income. These tokens are transferable, boosting flexibility across DeFi platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto for those seeking practical crypto investment options. The team is securing investor trust with a Certik audit of its smart contracts. Once finalized, results will appear on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s social channels. A leaderboard dashboard rewards the top 50 token holders with bonus tokens, encouraging long-term commitment. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates steady demand, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a best cryptocurrency to invest in. Its $100,000 giveaway for early investors adds excitement, drawing more into this new crypto coin. As phase 5 progresses, the window for low-price entry narrows. Mutuum Finance’s growth engine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fuels growth with dynamic interest rates, adjusting to market conditions. Lenders earn competitive APYs, while borrowers choose fixed or variable rates for flexibility. The upcoming stablecoin, backed by user collateral, enhances ecosystem trust. Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes sustainable demand through its tokenomics. The presale’s success, with $9,200,000 raised, reflects strong investor faith. Over 11,500 holders signal Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a crypto to buy now. Its structured approach positions it among the best cryptos to invest in for 2025, outpacing less utility-focused altcoins like Cardano (ADA). Pathway to crypto wealth Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer distinct routes to crypto riches. Cardano (ADA) banks on technical strength and whale accumulation, aiming for $10. Its market activity makes it a top crypto to buy for long-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its lending utility and presale momentum, promises a 100% ROI at launch and potentially 8,233% by hitting $2.50 in 2025. This new cryptocurrency stands out among the best altcoins to buy for investors seeking stability and growth.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor the market, analysts are increasingly highlighting the explosive potential of early-stage altcoins—especially MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With capital rotation intensifying and bullish sentiment building, these tokens are now at the center of the conversation for those seeking outsized gains in 2025. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Acceleration and 15,000% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% returns, with some forecasting a $1 target by year-end if current momentum continues. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation and early-stage investor enthusiasm. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with more transparency and a scarcity-driven model. Even a modest $500 stake could multiply many times over if projections hold true, making MAGA the breakout bet for the next supercycle. Ethereum: Technical Structure and Breakout Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators pointing to a possible surge toward $2,800–$2,900 if momentum holds. Analysts note that ETH is trading above its 50-day EMA and forming a bullish flag, with the RSI rebounding and volume poised to increase as summer approaches. A decisive move above $2,800 could trigger a multi-month rally, with some forecasts calling for a climb toward $4,500 by late 2025. As Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem expands and institutional adoption grows, ETH remains a cornerstone for both stability and upside in the evolving crypto landscape. XRP: Bullish Structure and Renewed Accumulation XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts closely watching as futures and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Whale accumulation has surged, historically a precursor to major rallies. Technicals show XRP forming higher lows and breaking above resistance, with projections of $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. While XRP’s legal clarity and infrastructure are positives, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. HBAR and Bitcoin: Steady Growth, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight HBAR continues to build through enterprise integrations and real-world use cases, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding above $103,000, with price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. Yet, as capital rotates for higher multiples, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the attention of those seeking the next 10x–100x opportunity. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s consolidation phase is fueling analyst interest in breakout altcoins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP now leading the charge for potential 15,000% gains in 2025. With MAGA’s presale nearly complete, a $0.007 listing target, and projections as high as 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast. For investors seeking the next big crypto success story, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender that could define this cycle’s upside.

The company says investors deserve clear and timely decisions instead of silence without explanation. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel shared a post on X showing frustration with the SEC for delaying the company’s CBOE’s 19b-4 filing without explanations. SEC again delays ruling on CBOE’s 19b-4 to list options on VanEck $HODL ETF. We find the lack of explanation confounding & frustrating. Investors deserve transparency and timely action. @HesterPeirce — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) May 23, 2025 VanEck asks for answers after the SEC delays a decision on Bitcoin ETF options The SEC has again delayed a decision on whether to approve options trading for VanEck’s spot Bitcoin ETF trading under the ticker symbol $HODL. This delay further frustrated other crypto asset managers waiting for the SEC to decide on their applications. VanEck also awaits approval on a similar request to include in-kind creations and redemptions for the same Bitcoin ETF. Still, the SEC has not moved forward on that either. The feature would allow investors to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares and vice versa directly. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Matthew Sigel, posted on X claiming that the SEC does not explain why it keeps pushing back these decisions. He added that the lack of feedback makes the process more confusing and makes it difficult for applicants to understand what they need to fix or improve. Matthew described the SEC’s silence as “confounding and frustrating” because it makes the process feel unfair and unpredictable for companies trying to follow all the rules. He also tagged SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, expecting her Crypto Task Force to step in, provide answers, and show some leadership on an issue affecting many crypto players. The repeated delays without clear reasoning hurt investor confidence and slow growth and innovation as people feel uncertain about whether the SEC will ever make firm decisions or continue stalling indefinitely. The SEC keeps delaying crypto ETF decisions while new filings keep coming in The SEC has again delayed a decision on a major crypto ETF proposal affecting CoinShares’ application for a spot XRP ETF, which would be exposed to XRP through a regulated product. The SEC pushed back the decision from May 26 to Aug. 24 and sought public comments and rebuttals to the proposal rather than approving or rejecting it. This delay is one more instance in a trend where the SEC takes longer than usual without providing any explanation for the delay, leaving the applicants and the entire market wondering. The agency also stalled Fidelity’s proposals for in-kind redemptions in its spot Bitcoin ETF and a similar Ethereum-based product. The in-kind redemption is more efficient and tax-friendly because investors can swap actual crypto for ETF shares rather than using cash. The pace of new ETF applications is accelerating despite these repeated roadblocks because asset managers believe the rewards of being first to market with new crypto ETF products outweigh the frustrations of dealing with regulatory restraints. Firms have filed for ETFs based on a range of altcoins, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and XRP for the past few weeks. These products allow investors to access blockchain ecosystems and technologies outside the Bitcoin-Ethereum duopoly. Canary Capital recently filed to launch a staked Tron ETF that would track the price of the Tron token (TRX) and pass on staking rewards to investors. The SEC acknowledged this application, which shows that it might be warming up to innovative structures, even if it is not ready to approve them yet. Similarly, companies won’t stop applying because they believe the Trump administration favors crypto more than its predecessor. Industry leaders have also pointed to leadership changes and evolving political sentiment as signs that the regulatory climate may become more supportive or, at the very least, more predictable. The SEC has not released new crypto-specific guidance, but it continues to accept and publish new applications through its formal processes, which gives some hope that the agency may be preparing for a new phase of regulatory clarity KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-24 05:00:51

The price is continuing to form higher lows and higher highs on the daily chart — a positive sign for traders and investors. Current Support and Resistance Levels At the moment, XRP is finding strong support around $2.30 to $2.34. As long as the price stays above $2.30, the bullish trend remains intact. However, if XRP falls below this level with a confirmed daily candle close, there’s a chance it could drop further toward the $2.10–$2.15 zone. On the upside, there’s significant resistance at the golden pocket area between $2.55 to $2.62. A clean breakout above this zone could open the doors for a strong upward move. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Might Be the Next Crypto to Surge? , What’s Next for XRP? According to market patterns, XRP is currently following a local uptrend, though without strong momentum just yet. Analysts are watching for a potential five-wave upward move, which could confirm either a short-term rally or the start of a bigger bullish wave. There are two possible scenarios: Orange Scenario (Most Bullish): XRP needs to form five consecutive waves upward. After the first five waves, a higher low (called Wave 2) would need to hold above the May 19 swing low. If that happens, we could see further upside in Waves 3, 4, and 5, targeting $2.52, $2.58, and possibly up to $2.61. Blue Scenario (Still Bullish): This outlook allows for a slightly deeper pullback but remains positive as long as the price stays above the $2.15 support area. Even if a bigger correction happens, the market could recover strongly after. While XRP’s short-term momentum has cooled slightly, the overall trend is still bullish. As long as the key support at $2.30 holds, the market looks set for a potential climb towards $2.60 and beyond . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Some analysts predict XRP could reach targets from $3.20 to $5.00 in 2025, with highly optimistic forecasts even suggesting over $10 or much higher if specific conditions align.

Currently in Stage 1 of its presale , Mantix is tipped to surge 100x in 2025 and investors are taking notice. As established platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX fight to maintain dominance, Mantix enters the scene with bold innovation, lightning-fast cross-chain trading and up to 1000x leverage. With momentum building fast, Mantix is setting the pace for the next era of DeFi trading. HYPE token climbs to global top 20 as momentum builds Hyperliquid has quietly become a serious force in crypto derivatives trading. As of May 21, 2025, it boasts a total value locked of $443 million, backed by nearly $147 million in daily volume and a staggering $7.92 billion in perpetuals trading. Unlike many of its peers, Hyperliquid hasn’t relied on aggressive VC funding or over-the-top incentive programs to draw attention. Its growth has been mostly organic, led by real traders who value performance over hype. This authenticity is reflected in its HYPE token, currently priced at around $35.28 with a market cap of $8.77 billion, ranking it among the top 20 globally. Price forecasts suggest an average of $45 this year, with possible highs near $70. Even with the usual market dips, longer-term predictions paint a bullish picture, with expectations stretching as high as $250 by 2030. DYDX news: Platform commits 25% of fees to monthly token buybacks dYdX is taking bold steps to reposition itself in a market that’s getting more competitive by the day. In an effort to reinforce token utility and strengthen network security, the platform recently rolled out a strategic buyback initiative. Announced on March 24, this program allocates 25% of dYdX’s monthly net fees to purchase tokens from the open market, which are then staked to support the protocol. If successful, that figure could scale up to 100% of platform revenue, an ambitious move designed to inject new confidence into the dYdX ecosystem. This development comes at a time when over 85% of dYdX tokens are already unlocked and actively circulating. The initiative sent the token price climbing nearly 8.5% to $0.6581 , offering a brief respite from a tough year that’s seen it drop more than 78%. New DEX Mantix targets gaps left by Hyperliquid and dYdX As platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX fight to defend their positions in the decentralized trading scene, a new contender is stepping in with serious firepower. Mantix is here to outperform. This new DEX offers everything traders want: cross-chain swaps, ultra-deep liquidity, instant settlement and leverage up to 1000x. But what truly sets it apart is its reward-driven ecosystem powered by the $MTX token. Holders get a slice of platform revenue without even needing to provide liquidity directly. Think of staking rewards but smarter. Mantix is built on transparency, speed and real ownership. No centralized gatekeepers. No silent whales making decisions in the dark. With decentralized governance, token holders shape the platform’s future. And thanks to its buyback and burn mechanism, MTX is deflationary by design. With its presale now live, Mantix is gearing up to go viral, because the market is ready for something better. Investors can pick up their MTX tokens for just $0.02, the lowest price it will ever be, as analysts project 100x gains by mid-2026.

Ethereum Ethereum (ETH) has seen significant price changes recently. In the past month, its price surged by 69.04%. Over the last week, it increased by 2.31%. However, over the past six months, the price decreased by 19.77%. This suggests a recovery from earlier losses. Currently, Ethereum’s price ranges between $2303.83 and $2715.19. The nearest resistance level is $2932; if the price breaks this, it could reach the next resistance at $3343. The nearest support level is $2109, with a secondary support at $1698. Breaking above the first resistance could lead to an 8% increase. Falling below the support may result in a 9% decrease. Technical indicators show possible future movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 68.30, close to the overbought level of 70. This may suggest a price correction soon. The Stochastic indicator is at 88.60, also indicating overbought conditions. The MACD level is 28.7005, pointing to bullish momentum. The 10-day simple moving average is $2608.14, above the 100-day average of $2509.58, which is a positive sign. Binance coin Binance coin (BNB) has been on a consistent rise. In the past week, its price went up by 4.86%. Over the last month, it increased by 14.53%, and in six months, it climbed 8.05%. The current price ranges between $626.63 and $684.83, showing a steady upward trend. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $680.39, above the 100-day SMA of $652.46, indicating short-term bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 69.47, nearing overbought levels, but suggests potential for further growth. The Stochastic oscillator reads 70.41, pointing to a bullish sentiment. BNB is approaching its nearest resistance at $717. Breaking this could lead to the next resistance at $776, representing potential gains of around 5% and 13% from current prices. Support levels are at $601.47 and $543.27, which could limit downside risks. Traders are watching these levels as BNB’s upward movement continues. Conclusion Just as ETH and BNB rose quietly to the top, XYZVerse now stands poised to lead the 2025 bull run with its unique sports-focused ecosystem.

IBIT’s one-day inflow of $877.18 million underscores the intensified investor frenzy following Bitcoin’s recent push to all-time highs, propelling the total net flows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to an impressive $44.5 billion since inception. $IBIT was #1 among ALL ETFs in flows yesterday, a first I believe (the Mighty VOO took a rare day off), and a byproduct of the ATH-induced feeding frenzy volume mentioned below.

Will BTC Price Go Down to $100K?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-bitcoin-price-dropping-now-will-btc-price-go-down-to-100k/,"The post Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Now? Will BTC Price Go Down to $100K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price faced a notable pullback after a failed attempt to sustain itself above the gained levels. The BTC price dropped below $107K while Ethereum and the other altcoins also witnessed a similar pullback. The ongoing crypto crash occurred at times when the stock market has also been facing a sell-off. The BTC price recovered despite the Moody’s shockwaves in the financial market by downgrading the US credit rating . Regardless of the upward pressure, Bitcoin displays huge upward potential of marking a fresh ATH in the coming days. While the institutions are piling up Bitcoin , the retailers do not seem to have entered the space. The Google search trends show retail interest is still only half of what it was in November 2024, which suggests smart money is buying while retail stays silent. This can be considered a huge bullish signal, as there was no hype, no frenzy, despite the BTC price forming new highs. On the other hand, funding rates are neutral, which hints that the leverage is under control. While there are no signs of overexposure in futures, a healthy structure is expected to continue. With the BTC price holding up above $100K, the trade setup hints at more upside ahead. Will Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Rise to $120K or Drop to $100K? Bitcoin saw a sharp and aggressive drop following Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a 50% tariff on EU imports . The sudden macro triggered broad risk-off flows, with BTC quickly selling off from local highs near $111.3K and tapping into a key fair value gap around $107.5K. Although the price witnessed a short-term bounce since the low, it failed to be validated as a bullish reversal. Currently, the momentum remains fragile, and the overall structure still favors caution as Bitcoin trades within a compression zone. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Run Could Last Until 2027, Says Top Crypto Analyst , The BTC price is trapped between two major fair value gaps, which are currently the threshold for the upcoming market direction. If the bulls reclaim the $109K to $110K area, the bulls could gain strength and push the levels towards the higher resistance beyond $112K. These levels line up with a larger supply zone and could become a key-magnet zone. On the flip side, if the BTC fails to hold the lower FVG and breaks below $107,000, it may enter the liquidity pool around $106K, which could be supported by price inefficiency and unmitigated demand just below. The current trade setup hints towards a major compression, and hence it is important that the Bitcoin (BTC) price does not get trapped in the middle range. Therefore, it would be important to witness which FVG will be filled ahead of the monthly close. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

How does the downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s impact Bitcoin’s price?

Bitcoin is rising. Institutions are joining. And yet, the market doesn’t feel like it used to. Popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe recently shared a bold thought, this market cycle is unlike the one we’ve seen before. In fact, he believes it could be longer, more powerful, and very different from the classic four-year pattern everyone’s been expecting. Despite this, he believes Bitcoin could hit $400,000 to $600,000 by 2026 or 2027. Here’s why! Forget the Old 4-Year Rule Bitcoin, the biggest player in the crypto world, continues to hit new highs of $112k and claim a larger share of the overall market. Usually, Bitcoin goes on a big run, then altcoins catch up, and eventually, everything dips before starting over. But this time? The whole rhythm seems off. In the last 18 months, Bitcoin has been taking center stage—breaking highs and growing stronger while everything else follows. It’s now holding about 60% of the total crypto market cap, a number we haven’t seen in a while. That kind of dominance usually signals that Bitcoin might slow down soon. But this time, it’s not just retail traders behind the push—it’s big players too. Institutions Are Here—and They’re Changing the Game From spot Bitcoin ETFs to interest from government leaders, the stage is being set for something much bigger. Institutions now see crypto not just as risky bets, but as real investments with long-term potential. As Matthew Kimmell from CoinShares explains , Bitcoin usually gains strength in early recoveries, then cools off when traders chase riskier coins. But today, things feel more stable. That’s why van de Poppe says we need to open our minds, maybe this cycle won’t peak in 2025. Perhaps we’re looking at 2026 or even 2027. And yes, he even sees Bitcoin reaching $400K to $600K , with altcoins flying even higher. Bigger Game for Altcoins And it’s not just about Bitcoin. If this extended cycle plays out, altcoins could see even greater growth. With more real-world use cases, better infrastructure, and rising investor interest, coins beyond BTC might finally have their breakout moment. This isn’t just speculation—it’s a shift in thinking. Van de Poppe urges investors to approach the market with an open mind.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 05:41:44

The altcoins have also bled out on a daily scale, with more than $100 billion leaving the space within this timeframe. BTC Pushed Below $107K In general, it was a very good, some would say historic, week for the primary cryptocurrency. It started on a volatile foot as it pumped from $104,000 to $107,000 on a couple of occasions on Sunday and Monday but was stopped in its tracks and driven south hard. However, the bulls kept the pressure on, and that upper boundary finally gave in on Wednesday. Moreover, bitcoin rocketed past its January all-time high of $109,100 and set a new one at almost $110,000. It was met with immediate resistance there and a drop to $106,500, but that was short-lived. Bitcoin began another, even more impressive leg up in the following hours and tapped a fresh peak at $112,000 on Pizza Day. It retraced slightly to $111,000 on Friday but remained at around that level until the POTUS recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU to start from June 1. In minutes, BTC’s price tumbled below $107,500, bounced off, and then slipped again to under $107,000. It has recovered some ground now and sits above $108,000, but it’s still over 2% down on the day. Its market cap has plunged to $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Red The altcoins have followed BTC on the way south, with substantial losses of up to 10% from the likes of DOGE, ADA, SUI, SHIB, LINK, and AVAX. Ethereum has slipped by over 5% and is now down to $2,550. XRP has dropped to just over $2.3 after a 4.4% daily decline. Even more painful price drops are evident from ENA, WIF, TIA, S, IP, and PEPE as all of them have plunged by double digits. The total crypto market has lost over $100 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.530 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For Second ‘Price Discovery Uptrend’ Following $109,000 Breakout – What’s Ahead For BTC? Litecoin Attempting Key Breakout Litecoin has seen a remarkable 63% rally from April’s lows over the past month and a half, surging above crucial levels in the past few weeks. Just this month, the cryptocurrency has recovered the $80 and $90 support levels and attempted to reclaim the $100 barrier again. Fueled by the market recovery and Bitcoin’s rally past the $100,000 mark, LTC hit a two-month high of $107 nearly two weeks ago. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to hold the $100 mark. However, analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show recently suggested that Litecoin “is about to pump.” The analyst highlighted a bullish pattern on LTC’s chart, which could see the cryptocurrency rise 20% toward the $117.5 mark for the first time since early March. According to Runefelt’s chart, the cryptocurrency formed a bullish flag pattern after hitting its two-month high. Since then, LTC has hovered between the upper and lower boundary, bouncing once before from the support line toward the pattern’s resistance line. Earlier this week, Litecoin bounced again from the support after touching the $92 level, which led the analyst to suggest it has “every chance to break out of this bullish flag to the upside.” On Friday, the altcoin jumped 11% from the pattern lows, briefly breaking out and hitting the $102 mark before retracing to the $96 mark. The cryptocurrency now hovers between the $98-$99 levels, just 1% below the pattern’s upper boundary. A surge above this level to confirm the breakout could set the stage for the pattern’s $117.5 target and mark a significant push toward a key horizontal level. LTC Preparing For Rally To $150? Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Litecoin needs a Monthly Close above its key resistance level to target the $150 mark and above. He highlighted the $110-$125 horizontal level, explaining that LTC “spends most of its time below it and very little time comparatively beyond it.” The analyst noted that since 2019, the rejection from this resistance level has been getting “progressively weaker over time to the point where only a couple of months ago, LTC tried to retest this region as support” during the early 2025 rally. Despite failing to reclaim this level, this could suggest that the resistance is “struggling to hold price down,” which is why the next breakout above this area could signal that “the chances of a successful retest are high.” Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? Moreover, the weakening of the resistance could be partly attributed to its multi-year Marco Higher Low, as Litecoin has bounced from the ascending trendline toward this resistance each time it has been retested. Based on this, the analyst considers that a Monthly Close above the key horizontal level, followed by a retest to confirm the breakout, would give the necessary strength for a 30% rally above the $150 mark for the first time since 2021. As of this writing, Litecoin trades at $98.60, a 2.7% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Yet, as Cardano’s ecosystem expands, the political meme coin sector is capturing the imagination of both traders and analysts. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its explosive presale momentum and viral narrative, is emerging as the breakout contender—offering a unique blend of political relevance and early-stage upside that’s hard to ignore. Cardano: Cutting-Edge Tech and Real-World Integration In 2025, Cardano is leading blockchain development with a suite of technological breakthroughs. Its Plutus smart contract language and Layer 2 scaling solution, Hydra, are enabling more efficient, secure, and automated business processes. Cardano’s smart contracts now power everything from instant supply chain payments to decentralized finance, while the network’s focus on interoperability is breaking down barriers between blockchains and fostering seamless asset transfers. Academic partnerships, such as the Cardano Foundation’s collaboration with PUC-Rio, are fueling research in blockchain economics, DeFi, and DAO governance, further cementing Cardano’s role as a research-driven blockchain leader. These advancements are not only attracting enterprise adoption but also inspiring new business models and decentralized applications that could reshape industries. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Momentum in the Political Crypto Arena While Cardano’s technological progress is impressive, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the playbook for political meme coins. Unlike fleeting trends, MAGA leverages a scarcity-driven model—capped at 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, and audited by HashEx—to create a foundation for exponential growth. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% ROI, with a $1 target by year-end seen as plausible if current momentum holds. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to channel political sentiment into tangible market traction. The coin’s presale has already raised over $8 million, with whale allocations and rapid sellouts highlighting strong conviction among early backers. MAGA’s blend of grassroots energy, viral marketing, and structured tokenomics is positioning it as the political crypto to watch as the 2025 election cycle heats up. Why the Market Is Watching MAGA Political meme coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are doing more than just riding election headlines—they’re building communities around shared identity and purpose. This emotional and financial engagement is driving unprecedented capital inflows, making MAGA not only a symbol of political culture but also a high-conviction investment for those seeking outsized returns before exchange listings. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering a rare ground-floor opportunity as the next wave of political and meme-driven crypto gains takes shape. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Cardano’s technological advancements are pushing blockchain into new territory, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s viral rise in the political crypto arena is redefining what’s possible for early-stage investors. As Cardano powers the next generation of decentralized applications, MAGA is seizing the moment with a blend of scarcity, community, and political relevance. For those seeking the next breakout in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the political meme coin that’s impossible to overlook.

Table of Contents A step forward for Solaxy…But questions remain The next Pepe that will spread everywhere: PEPETO The untold origin story that crypto can’t stop talking about: PEPE…TO ? Behind PEPETO, there’s real tech and real plans Currently at $0.000000130, Tier 1 listing could hit any moment For those who have invested in Solaxy or are thinking about it, here’s something worth seriously considering. Solaxy markets itself as the first Layer 2 built on Solana, and while that sounds bold, ask: does Solana even need it? Layer 2 solutions make a big impact on Ethereum, where high gas fees and slow transaction speeds hold back usability. But Solana is already known for lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low fees. Adding another layer to an already efficient system might not bring the same level of improvement. Solaxy could still see short-term gains on hype alone, maybe even a 5x, but when it comes to long-term value, it’s not clear how this tech fills a real need. That raises a bigger question: without solving a clear problem, can Solaxy stay relevant? You might also like: Pepe climbs 60%: Which memecoin will be the next 100x this bull run, Pepe or Pepeto? A step forward for Solaxy…But questions remain Everyone’s watching what Solaxy does next , but is it building something people will remember? Recently, the team teamed up with Hyperlane to launch a testnet bridge. This lets users send SOL quickly and safely on a trial version of the network. They’re building a system that could later connect Solana to Ethereum, making it easier to move assets between blockchains. It’s a solid step forward. But let’s be honest, a testnet is just that: a test. It doesn’t prove long-term impact yet. It’s progress, yes, but it doesn’t have the kind of viral energy that turns a memecoin into a breakout star. Solaxy still doesn’t have a strong story. And in today’s crypto world, story matters just as much as technology. Solaxy is good, but good alone doesn’t guarantee staying power once the spotlight moves on. The next Pepe that will spread everywhere: PEPETO While others are still finding their footing, Pepeto is gaining serious momentum. Early buyers are stacking in before the noise hits, and this might be the memecoin everyone regrets missing in 2025. Let’s see why it checks every box for the next x 100 memecoin: The untold origin story that crypto can’t stop talking about: PEPE…TO ? Born from what many say was the original Pepe blueprint, Pepeto steps in with something the market hasn’t seen: purpose . While Pepe went viral, Pepeto brings back what was left behind — a full identity built on P recision, E nergy, P ower, and E fficiency… and the two missing pieces that change everything : Technology and Optimization . That’s what makes this more than a meme. It’s a comeback. Behind PEPETO, there’s real tech and real plans Most memecoins stop at community and jokes. Pepeto, aka God of frogs doesn’t. With its own multi-chain swap (PepetoSwap) being built, a staking system that rewards loyalty, and plans to support real movement between chains like Ethereum and Solana, it’s giving holders more than hope, it’s giving them tools. Here’s what sets Pepeto apart: Cross-chain PepetoSwap in development Early staking rewards to reward long-term holding A real story with viral potential Active community rooted in more than memes A meme coin that’s actually building something useful Currently at $0.000000130, Tier 1 listing could hit any moment Crypto whispers are getting louder: a Tier 1 exchange listing could be next for Pepeto. And yet, the token is still priced at just $0.00000013 . That’s the kind of number that made early Pepe (same market supply as PEPETO) and Shiba buyers millions. The difference? This time, you’re early. The price is low, the story is strong, and listing rumors are gaining traction. For those curious, take a look at the website and see what’s being built , this might be an early window before the spotlight arrives.

Bessent, speaking to Bloomberg, said the government is “going big” on crypto, a striking contrast with the previous administration, which took a restrictive approach that left many companies struggling to survive. In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bessent said that, instead, the White House plans to tighten up anti-money laundering (AML) standards for digital assets, especially stablecoins. He said the administration will pursue strong compliance while encouraging innovation, stating, “Digital asset companies deserve regulatory clarity, and that’s exactly what we are working toward.” Bessent also highlighted one of his key projections that stablecoins will generate $2 trillion in demand for U.S. Treasuries and bills in the near term, far more than the current $300 billion. According to the Treasury Secretary, this shift will inject a lot of liquidity into traditional markets without weakening oversight. Legislative momentum is also building in Washington. A bipartisan stablecoin bill that recently cleared a procedural roadblock in the U.S. Senate could soon become a reality. The measure had been stalled by a filibuster, which the Senate voted to end 66–32 earlier this month, allowing debate on the floor. Key changes to the bill brokered by crypto-supporting Democrats led by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks brought the breakthrough. They also dropped demands for a ban on former President Donald Trump profiting from his family’s crypto investments. The legislation marks a pivotal step, but even though a final vote might not take place until after the Memorial Day recess, industry insiders say. If it passes, it will create a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, ending years of legal limbo and inviting more institutional participation to the industry. Bessent eyes relief for the Treasury market Bessent hinted at heavily transforming the traditional financial system beyond digital assets. He said U.S. regulators are nearing the end of a process that will remove the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) requirement on banks that trade Treasuries. As a post-2008 crisis safeguard, the SLR currently requires banks to hold more capital against holding trading Treasuries in their reserves. Bessent said that removal could increase liquidity in the $29 trillion market and lower Treasury yields by a few basis points. The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC are in discussions. This would represent a significant regulatory change and may help digital asset markets. Trump’s crypto dinner stirs debate Meanwhile, President Trump is seizing the opportunity to brand himself as crypto’s political champion. In a recent Truth Social post, he said the U.S. is ‘dominating in crypto, bitcoin, etc.,’ vowing to ‘keep it that way.’ The top 220 holders of Trump’s TRUMP meme coin were invited to a high-profile crypto dinner at Trump’s Virginia golf club. Legislators raised concerns about the VIP event’s transparency and its ethical implications. It was reported to have raised $148 million. They questioned the concentration among Trump-linked entities and the risk of foreign influence. Despite the criticism, attendees viewed the dinner as indicative of just how politically relevant crypto is becoming. The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the president was there in his personal time and that no official guest list will be released. Several guests attended with the intent of changing Trump’s stance on crypto regulation, the New York Times later reported.

The commentator outlines a broad vision where XRP, along with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s infrastructure, becomes an essential component in the digital transformation of global financial systems. According to this analysis, banks are preparing to leverage XRP for payments and a foundation for CBDCs, asset tokenization, digital custody, DeFi, and liquidity services. The post asserts that XRP is already integrated into significant financial systems. Over 100 financial institutions are reportedly utilizing RippleNet for cross-border payments. However, the commentary emphasizes that Ripple’s strategic direction is evolving. The original focus on remittances and international transfers is now being complemented by ambitions to embed Ripple’s technology deeper into the core operations of banking infrastructure. WILD TAKE: XRP won’t just power payments. Banks are eyeing it to run entire digital ecosystems — from CBDCs to custody to asset tokenization. This isn't just speculation. Let me show you why. pic.twitter.com/kOm9iQrQiA — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 21, 2025 CBDCs and XRP as Multi-Function Infrastructure The commentator points to the partnership between Ripple and Colombia’s central bank , which tests central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) using Ripple’s platform. This initiative is described as more than a pilot. The tweet suggests XRP could serve as the transmission layer, the storage system, and the transaction coordinator for CBDCs. If adopted broadly, banks could generate revenue through the distribution, settlement, and custody of these digital currencies. Further, the commentary addresses the XRP Ledger’s capacity for real-world asset tokenization . This includes tokenizing assets such as real estate, bonds, and commodities. The post proposes that banks could use these features to mint and manage tokenized versions of physical assets. According to the author, the potential mirrors traditional asset managers like BlackRock, but with blockchain-native mechanisms that streamline trading and management. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Digital Custody, DeFi, and Institutional Growth The analysis also focuses on digital custody . As institutional involvement in cryptocurrency grows, secure storage of digital assets becomes critical. The post claims that Ripple’s infrastructure could position banks to take on this custodial role, storing XRP and other crypto assets on behalf of clients. This service could provide banks with recurring revenue through custody fees, a model aligned with how traditional finance handles securities and vault services. DeFi, though still in an early stage within the XRP ecosystem, is identified as another area for growth. With emerging smart contract capabilities on XRPL, banks may one day offer services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming directly on-chain. According to the tweet, Ripple is preparing for this possibility now, setting the groundwork for a broader rollout once regulatory conditions are clarified. Liquidity Services and the Role of Regulation Liquidity provision is another proposed use case. Banks could supply XRP liquidity for foreign exchange (FX) markets, profiting from spread differentials, lending, and market-making activities. The author emphasizes the benefits of speed and scale, suggesting that XRP-based liquidity could eliminate the need for intermediaries and allow banks to handle volume with greater efficiency. The commentary acknowledges that many of these applications are still in development and not mainstream. However, the author insists the infrastructure is already in place, and interest from financial institutions is increasing. As regulatory clarity improves, particularly in the United States following the high-profile SEC lawsuit against Ripple, banks are becoming more confident in exploring XRP for a wider range of functions. In closing, All Things XRP proposes that the financial sector’s interest in XRP is not limited to accelerating payments. Rather, banks may be preparing to use XRP and Ripple technology to construct a new layer of global financial infrastructure. The message is clear: XRP is not just a tool for transactions but potentially a foundational component of future banking systems.

Despite the buzz surrounding this major exchange debut, PI’s price has fallen 3.5% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $0.7821, highlighting growing concerns about its volatility and centralization. Kraken Offers 20x Leverage for U.S. Traders With the new perpetual futures contracts, users on Kraken Pro can now go long or short on Pi with up to 20x leverage. The contract supports over 360 markets and accepts more than 40 different collateral options. This move makes it easier than ever for U.S. traders to access Pi futures without additional regulatory or platform hurdles. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts do not expire, allowing traders to hold their positions indefinitely—though funding fees may apply based on market conditions. This listing is seen as a potential signal of growing institutional interest in Pi, despite its absence from top-tier exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Centralization and Privacy Issues Raise Red Flags Despite development efforts, Pi Network continues to face criticism over its token distribution and privacy practices. Currently, about 60% of the total PI supply is still controlled by the core team. Dr. Altcoin, a prominent supporter of the project, has voiced serious concerns about the lack of transparency from the Pi Core Team, particularly regarding how user data is collected and used. He warns that this data could potentially be used for: AI training Identity theft Tracking users’ real-world movements Without proper disclosure, he believes user trust and data privacy remain at serious risk. New Ecosystem Updates from Pi Network Amid these controversies, Pi Network has introduced several ecosystem improvements, including: Five new community apps integrated into the Pi Mainnet Ecosystem Interface A simplified account recovery process, aimed at boosting accessibility and user participation These updates reflect ongoing efforts to enhance Pi’s utility and ecosystem engagement, though questions remain about transparency and market readiness. Final Thoughts Pi Network’s listing on Kraken’s futures platform marks a major milestone, giving the project more visibility and market tools for traders. However, the price slump, transparency concerns, and centralized token holdings may continue to weigh on sentiment. As institutional attention increases, the Pi Core Team’s next moves—especially regarding communication and decentralization—will be closely watched.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ZRX|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 06:08:22

What It Means for XRP Price and XRP News,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/why-solaxy-and-pepeto-are-the-fastest-growing-cryptocurrencies/,"The post Why Solaxy and Pepeto Are the Fastest Growing Cryptocurrencies? What It Means for XRP Price and XRP News appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Crypto Market Is Heating Up , And XRP Is in the Spotlight Bitcoin has surged past $110K, while XRP is making waves again with bullish price forecasts and rising interest. But outside the usual headlines, two lesser-known coins , Solaxy and Pepeto , are quietly building momentum. One leans on technical development, the other on community firepower and viral storytelling. The difference? One might trend , the other might take over. Solaxy’s Bold Claim , Is Solana’s Layer 2 Necessary? Solaxy is attracting attention by branding itself as the first Layer 2 project built on Solana. But Solana already processes transactions quickly and cheaply. Unlike Ethereum, it doesn’t struggle with speed or gas fees. So what value does a Layer 2 really add? Solaxy might still generate some early excitement and short-term returns, but it’s unclear if this tech delivers something game-changing in the long term. Building Behind the Scenes , But Not Breaking Out Yet Solaxy recently teamed up with Hyperlane to launch a testnet bridge, which lets users send native SOL in a secure test environment. The goal is to eventually support transfers between Solana and Ethereum. It’s a positive step, but testnets are still early-stage. They don’t typically create hype. Without a compelling story behind the product, even solid development can fly under the radar. Solaxy is progressing, but it hasn’t captured the spotlight , yet. Pepeto Steps Up , The Meme With a Mission Then there’s Pepeto. Not just a meme coin , it’s a mission coin. Backed by a fiery origin story and growing support, Pepeto has become the talk of meme circles. Some believe it revives the true roots of Pepe, but adds depth and structure. Its name says it all: P recision, E nergy, P ower, E fficiency, Technology, Optimization . That’s not just branding , that’s a blueprint for going viral in 2025. More Than Hype , Pepeto Is Building Real Tools That Matter Pepeto isn’t just riding a wave. It’s building it. PepetoSwap , a multi-chain swap platform , is already in the works, aiming to connect major ecosystems like Solana, Ethereum, and BNB Chain. Staking is live, with jaw-dropping early returns.

While established players like SUI and Dogecoin capture headlines with impressive price movements, a revolutionary newcomer is quietly building momentum that could reshape the entire gaming and DeFi landscape. BitLemons ($BLEM) isn’t just another token riding market waves—it’s a revenue-generating powerhouse that’s already proven its mettle with over $2 million raised and a fully operational crypto casino disrupting the $450 billion traditional gaming market. Smart money is flowing toward projects with real utility and sustainable tokenomics, and BitLemons delivers on both fronts with its groundbreaking 30% Gross Gaming Revenue allocation model. While SUI tests new highs and DOGE attempts crucial breakouts, seasoned investors are recognizing that BitLemons represents something far more valuable: a chance to get in early on a protocol that generates revenue 24/7, burns tokens systematically, and rewards holders through high-yield staking—all while being backed by dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof. Is SUI’s Momentum Sustainable at Current Levels? SUI has been commanding attention with its impressive surge to $3.86, driven by expanding adoption across the DeFi ecosystem and growing institutional confidence. The blockchain’s unique approach to parallel transaction processing has attracted developers and users alike, creating a virtuous cycle of growth that’s reflected in both price action and network activity. Technical analysis reveals SUI has maintained strong bullish momentum over the past seven days, with trading volume surging approximately 23% as the token broke through key resistance levels. The $3.80-$3.90 range has emerged as critical support, while bulls are eyeing the psychological $4.00 barrier. RSI readings suggest the token isn’t yet overbought, leaving room for continued upward movement if broader market conditions remain favorable. Can DOGE Finally Break the $0.40 Ceiling That’s Held for Months? Dogecoin is staging what could be its most significant breakout attempt in recent months, currently trading at $0.2451 while building pressure against the stubborn $0.40 resistance level. The meme coin’s community-driven momentum has intensified, with social media engagement and whale accumulation patterns suggesting renewed institutional interest in the original meme cryptocurrency. The past week has seen DOGE consolidate within a tight $0.23-$0.25 range, with volume increasing by roughly 18% as traders position for the anticipated breakout. Technical indicators show the 50-day moving average providing solid support around $0.22, while the $0.40 resistance remains the key level to watch. If DOGE can finally pierce this ceiling, analysts project a potential rally toward $0.48, representing nearly 100% upside from current levels. Why Are Savvy Investors Calling BitLemons the “Stealth Rocket” of 2025? While market participants debate whether SUI can maintain its momentum and DOGE can break its ceiling, BitLemons ($BLEM) is quietly executing a strategy that traditional crypto projects can only dream of achieving. This isn’t just another speculative token—it’s a fully operational crypto casino generating real revenue from over 8,000 games provided by industry giants like Evolution and Pragmatic Play. What sets BitLemons apart is its revolutionary tokenomics model that allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue directly to token holders through a dual mechanism: 15% funds systematic token buybacks and burns, creating deflationary pressure, while the remaining 15% flows to stakers as high-yield rewards. With dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof—validation that competitors simply cannot match—BitLemons has established itself as the institutional-grade choice in the GambleFi space. The numbers tell an incredible story of momentum and demand. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, Stage 2 has completely sold out, and Stage 3 is already 11.23% filled with tokens currently priced at $0.03. Having raised over $2 million including $1 million in seed funding, BitLemons is methodically advancing through its 13-stage presale structure, with each stage increasing the token price by $0.01. Industry insiders continue to whisper about potential listing prices between $0.17 and $0.18, representing extraordinary upside for current participants. BitLemons operates in a league of its own because it never sleeps—the platform generates revenue 24/7 while systematically reducing token supply and rewarding loyal holders. This creates a perfect storm of deflationary mechanics, passive income generation, and exposure to the massive $450 billion traditional casino market that’s ripe for blockchain disruption. Are you ready to position yourself ahead of the institutions who are quietly accumulating positions in the next generation of revenue-generating crypto protocols? While others chase momentum plays and hope for breakouts, BitLemons offers something far more valuable: a fundamentally sound investment backed by real revenue, audited security, and tokenomics designed to reward early believers. The window for seed-round pricing won’t remain open forever. With each presale stage bringing higher prices and growing investor demand, the opportunity to secure allocation at current levels represents a rare chance to participate in what could become the defining success story of the 2025 crypto cycle. Don’t let this incredible seed entry opportunity slip through your fingers while you’re watching others chase yesterday’s winners.

45032265,https://nulltx.com/?p=149901,1748068882,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"SOON Token Debuts with Volatility, Binance Airdrop, and Jump Crypto’s Return",https://nulltx.com/soon-token-debuts-with-volatility-binance-airdrop-and-jump-cryptos-return/,"Today, a prestigious newcomer arrived in the Solana Layer 2 ecosystem with the launch of the SOON token , the native asset of the SOON project (@soon_svm). The token entered the market with some fanfare, briefly spiking to $1.37 before promptly correcting and heading down to around $0.54. The project has created a lot of excitement in the crypto world, and for good reason—the price is moving, and it’s moving upward. Beneath the surface, though, what we’ve got is a project that is well supported and well financed, with some serious industry players behind it. This is all to say that it’s potentially very much a thing. SOON Trading Debut and Market Dynamics The SOON token was greeted by a wave of opportunistic trading, making its first hours of existence a spectacularly profitable affair for those who bought and sold it then. By the end of that initial trading day, it seemed that SOON had established a new normal around the 54-cent mark. But in the hours leading up to that new normal, SOON had become an instant hit, peaking at $1.37 before dropping almost 60% back to that 54-cent normal. At present levels, the circulating market cap of SOON is around $106 million, and the fully diluted valuation (FDV) is close to $530 million. These numbers—almost doubled from a month ago—certainly show some kind of a spotlight around the recent launch of SOON, shining investor interest and putting in long-term expectations for it to play some kind of role within the Solana ecosystem. Speculative trading might be the major force driving early price action on the market, but that doesn’t mean we’re just seeing a situation of buy and sell orders going through and nothing else. What Bitcoin’s price behavior right now shows is just how uncertain the market as a whole is. Not just about Bitcoin itself, but also about the myriad of narratives and stories the overall crypto-sector trade tells. Both to itself and to the outside world. Solana L2 project SOON @soon_svm debuted trading today, surging to $1.37 before dropping to ~$0.54. Current circulating market cap sits at $106M, with an FDV around $530M. @Binance to airdrop 180 $SOON (≈$97) to users with Alpha Points ≥190. #Solana #SOON pic.twitter.com/RltegXCGMn — Followin (@followin_io) May 23, 2025 Binance SOON Airdrop and Alpha Points Rewards The launch is generating some excitement, and adding to that, Binance has announced an exclusive airdrop campaign for SOON. It was said that there were users who had accumulated 190 or more Alpha Points—a measure of engagement and loyalty within Binance’s promotional ecosystem—and those users were to receive an airdrop of 180 SOON tokens. At the time, 180 SOON was valued at around $97. This airdrop creates not just a way to engage users but an actual incentive to balance the books of a newly traded token. For SOON, the airdrop is a way to drive liquidity and user acquisition in a methodical and, frankly, institutional fashion. That Binance would underwrite a moment like this in the creation of the SOON token is awash with institutional confidence. Also, the initial user response to the airdrop is quite upbeat, with a number of users noting that this is among the biggest rewards so far owing to the Alpha Points program. All this puts Binance squarely in the middle of a token’s launch and keeps the market moving. Jump Crypto’s Market-Making Comeback The apparent return of Jump Crypto as a market maker tied to SOON’s launch offers an intriguing storyline. And this time? Under the leadership of Donald Trump’s administration. Two days before trading commenced, blockchain data revealed that 2.5 million SOON tokens were transported from BNB Chain (BSC) to Solana utilizing LayerZero, a cross-chain interoperability protocol. The address to which these tokens were sent was 7kuKG…1pDqc. One day later, 2 million of those tokens were sent to Jump Crypto’s known public wallet (Gtxgn…LxKdq). Jump Crypto now seems to be actively supporting the SOON market, its first known market-making engagement since Donald Trump became president. This marks the firm’s apparent return to the market in what has been a relatively quiet period since the disruptions of 2022.

They are often seen as bringing joined-up thinking and acting to the sometimes-ungainly world of crypto token trading. In the past, they have been allies and partners to at least some extent in Solana. Conclusion: SOON Hype Meets Fundamentals With an eye-catching debut, a sizeable airdrop from Binance, and the re-emergence of a big institutional player like Jump Crypto, SOON has become one of the most buzzworthy token launches of late. Despite the fact that its initial price movement was volatile, the groundwork for this thing being a long-term vehicle of positive change seems good. With cross-chain technology, Solana integration, and institutional backers, SOON may be more than just another vehicle for speculators to push around — it could be the start of something genuinely and undoubtably transformative. Once launch day finally comes to a close, the spotlight will very quickly switch to SOON itself, and everyone will watch closely to see how it performs—will it keep right on rolling, or might it regress in the wake of launch as things so often seem to do in this life? We in the space will also watch for how SOON performs on specific verticals—business, politics, and soc. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45032266,https://nulltx.com/?p=149900,1748068975,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"BNB Chain Shows Resilience Amid Price Pressure, Institutional Optimism",https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-shows-resilience-amid-price-pressure-institutional-optimism/,"This week, the price of BNB has been performing disappointingly, but the ecosystem is showing strong fundamentals and moving forward with development. BNB Chain has encountered setbacks but is making major progress, painting a complex, but overall optimistic, picture for BNB Chain—a principal Layer 1 blockchain in the market. Recent developments in decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and institutional reinforcement mean that BNB Chain has advanced — seems to be advancing — even if that elevation hasn’t yet shown itself in the token’s price and market capitalization. BNB Price Dips Slightly as Bitcoin Dominance Weighs on Altcoins This week, the total market cap of the BNB Chain ecosystem saw a slight dip, falling 1.4% to just over $7 billion. BNB itself shed some weight, falling to just under $280 and holding a market valuation of about $91.8 billion as of Friday afternoon. This week, the decline of the BNB Chain ecosystem is a direct effect of the rising tide earlier in the week of Bitcoin. Short-term weaknesses notwithstanding, BNB Chain’s monthly performance still reveals a very healthy 15.7% gain that shows a longer-term uptrend. “Greed” is presently the market sentiment for Bitcoin, indicating that investors are generally optimistic about the leading cryptocurrency. Trading across the altcoin market has remained muted in recent days, with BNB and other altcoins seeing paltry volumes, as the market patiently awaits more significant Bitcoin price action. BNB price pullbacks look to be not so much about weakness in the chain but more about macro trends. All eyes are on Bitcoin, and as it goes, many altcoins are barely hanging on by a thread. This seems to be the case with BNB, which has actually flipped bullish on the BTC pair, but then again, that’s the kind of dynamic that too many altcoins are struggling with these days. DeFi Thrives: PancakeSwap V3 and Ecosystem Metrics Surge The price of BNB can be unstable, yet the DeFi infrastructure based on it seems to be thriving. This week, the leading decentralized exchange on BNB Chain, PancakeSwap, gave us a prominent metric to look at. It had a trading volume that surged by an unbelievable 152% from the week prior. What this looks at kind of at a top layer is: this is one of the major platforms on BNB Chain. It’s an interface through which a lot of folks are accessing the chain’s DeFi infrastructure. So to see it doing 152% better, that is quite an eyepopper. Increased activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the BNB Chain is offsetting a minor decrease in the total value locked (TVL) in the network’s DeFi protocols. The DEX week-over-week activity metric is up 81%, which is substantial and suggests that user preference is shifting to DEXs. In the DeFi layer of the BNB Chain, even with this small downturn of 2.4%, the total value locked (TVL) today is still the third-largest amount among all Layer 1 blockchains. Week in BNB Chain: Weak Price Performance, Fundamental Strength. PancakeSwap V3 volume surges 152%! Wello launches global PayFi app! Standard Chartered forecasts BNB at $1,275 by year-end! Let's examine BNB Chain's mixed signals this week 1/6 pic.twitter.com/Pf7JBFNTaR — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 22, 2025 The Platform Update The BNB Chain’s transaction costs are very low, and that’s a big part of the chain’s appeal. Right now, the average transaction cost is just $0.06. That’s about as low as it gets. And for those who want to do business on the BNB Chain, that’s a very nice price. Wello Launch and Institutional Confidence Paint a Bright Future Apart from DeFi, BNB Chain witnessed a notable development in the payments sector with the worldwide unveiling of Wello PayFi. The platform allows for rapid, inexpensive cross-border payments and plays nicely with Apple Pay, Visa, and more than 120 fiat onramps. Wello merges the decentralized security of blockchain with the user-friendly centralization necessary for mass adoption. This makes it a potentially huge player in the global remittance market. This product launch is the real-world adoption step for BNB Chain; it shows that BNB Chain can do what we really want — impact the world with user-facing financial applications. And it isn’t just a narrative; it shows that BNB Chain isn’t just a DeFi playground. It’s positioning itself as a viable full-stack blockchain ecosystem. Possibly the most encouraging aspect is the long-term look from institutions. Analysts at Standard Chartered are giving a very bullish forecast for BNB. They see it reaching $1,275 by the end of 2025, which would be a gain of more than 300% from current levels. Their report cites ongoing ecosystem growth and rising adoption as the main reasons they are confident in BNB’s future. Conclusion This week saw a slight drop in price, but the BNB Chain remains durable and full of potential. Surge in DEX Activity A group of 40 decentralized exchanges launched a global app on the same day. Bullish Institutional Sentiment Last week, news broke that the BNB Chain raised $3 billion in fresh capital from more than 100 institutional investors. Price Stability Stable growth in the Bitcoin dominance number suggests that BNB has a good chance of recapturing the kind of sustained price growth that rewards dollar-cost-averaging investors.

You could even say that as the Bitcoin ball kept rolling downhill—past $17,000, $18,000, and even $19,000—the excitement and participation level of the crypto space kept rising. At the same time, the crypto-killer ice storms of 2014 and 2018 seemed to be occurring further in the past than they really were. And then came late May 2019. The fresh dangers encompass a far-reaching 50% duty on all merchandise coming in from the European Union and a sharp 25% tax on imports that targets Apple directly if the company maintains its current course of building iPhones anywhere but in the U.S. Tariffs Target EU and Apple Amid Trade Frustration The announcement from President Trump was accompanied by some very sharp criticism of both the trade policies of Europe and of Apple’s global supply chain strategy. Expressing what he saw as frustrations with the negotiating process—specifically, he called the negotiations “stalled”—Trump made it very clear that unless things in trade talks started to improve, we could expect to see the proposed tariffs go into effect on June 1. One of the most valuable and famous companies in America, Apple, found itself in the political crosshairs. The tech giant was directly cited by Trump for moving much of its iPhone production to India, an American company in an American-style business move. Apple made this move to diversify its manufacturing base and reduce dependence on China, not in deference to any foreign government. The president warned, however, that unless Apple got the message and began relocating more of its production back to U.S. soil, it would face a 25 percent tariff on devices made overseas. Trump stated in a press release that the tariffs impose a balance and fairness to trade. He asserted that they are about bringing manufacturing to America and defending American workers. Although Trump’s rhetoric has always concentrated on the theme of economic nationalism, the sudden appearance and the sheer scale of these new threats caught lots of folks off guard. And it struck that way for a couple of reasons. First, the rhetoric had just recently begun to cool down, and we were in the middle of a global economic outlook conference when Trump poured fresh fuel on the fire. Crypto Markets React Swiftly to Tariff Uncertainty The immediate and intense effect on financial markets was evident. Bitcoin had only recently attained a new all-time high of $112,000, but in the blink of an eye, it lost more than 3%, with some brave (or foolish) souls even forecasting a price as low as $107,600. Analysts blamed the uncertainty unleashed by the tariff threat. The S&P 500 also slipped, and tech stocks took a notable hit in the aftermath of the announcement. Traders are becoming more uneasy about the unpredictable nature of U.S. tariff policies, which have the potential to disrupt global supply chains and investor confidence. Just a day after Bitcoin's new $112K all-time high was established, tariff drama was quickly brought back on to the menu and has temporarily spoiled the crypto party. President Trump has announced two new major tariff threats as the U.S. heads into Memorial Day weekend: … pic.twitter.com/6hgdBqGY6r — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 23, 2025 A crypto analyst said, “This is classic FUD,” referencing the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that often drives sharp market reactions. “Just as things were stabilizing post-China tensions, we’re right back to uncertainty. People are hesitant to make bold moves right now. Many are simply holding and hoping for clarity.” The atmosphere today mirrors the worries evident in early April, when surging trade tensions made the cryptocurrency markets uneasy. From April 7 to 9, crypto traders experienced significant volatility as it was predominantly the talk of tariffs that was lighting up the headlines. This latest round of threats seems to have revived that same anxiety uptrend. A Cautious Outlook Heading Into June With the June 1st deadline for tariffs fast approaching, markets will likely continue to be on edge. Investors and traders in virtually all sectors are now battening down the hatches for what is expected to be a pretty significant volatility spike, especially if the U.S.-EU trade talks don’t manage to get off the ground. If the talks do fail, that also opens the door for Apple to become the next poster child for the administration’s punitive tariff policy, a scenario that would truly rock the global tech supply chain. For traders in cryptocurrency, this situation reveals the larger truth that digital assets are not protected from the kinds of seismic macroeconomic shifts that can happen to any nation or region. Altogether, decentralized by design, the crypto market is more connected to the global financial system—and to the political decisions that impact the health of that system—than it often seems. The dust is settling, and the weekend is approaching; the mood that followed Bitcoin’s ATH has shifted to cautious optimism. The exuberance that came with this year’s all-time high for Bitcoin seems likely to continue only as long as the political and economic conditions that produced it remain unchanged.

This explosive growth means that the platform now finds itself in the unlikely position of occupying the fifth slot in the global crypto derivatives market. The only names it trails are those of four very large cryptocurrencies: Binance, Bitget, Bybit, and OKX. Not just the platform’s surging popularity but also its groundbreaking way of trading through a transparent, Web3-native infrastructure—one that is redefining how traders interact with digital assets—is what this achievement reflects. Web3 Transparency Brings New Era of Trust in Trading What distinguishes Hyperliquid in a surging field is its commitment to transparent on-chain activity. Its Web3 infrastructure allows users to directly observe trading behavior and positions on the blockchain. And traders can access a whole set of stats—from the behavior of their own trades to those of large players—in building a more informed trading environment. A kind of visibility that is rare among centralized exchanges, where most of the trading activity occurs behind closed doors. By putting data on-chain, Hyperliquid gives users real-time, verifiable information about what’s going on. This is clearly striking a chord with the crypto community and is part of the transparency demand that we see growing in all financial systems. As traders grow more aware of the dangers linked to unclear platforms, a good number of them are now opting for services like Hyperliquid. These services provide the twin benefits of decentralization and combined usability with that of centralized exchanges. Such a platform seems to be on the fast track for success and to popularize the hybrid approach it represents. Record-Breaking Trading Activity Marks Key Turning Point Hyperliquid recently reached new heights of activity and set a new all-time high (ATH) for both open interest and trading volume. Open interest—the total value of outstanding derivative contracts—soared to $8.92 billion. At the same time, the platform enjoyed an impressive $18.91 billion in 24-hour trading volume. These numbers mean more than simply being statistics. They indicate that trust in this platform is increasing. It also tells us that liquidity is on the rise, too. And both of these things—trust and liquidity—are absolutely essential if any exchange wants to seriously position itself as a market leader. Hyperliquid Hits New ATH @HyperliquidX has become a key hub for the crypto community when it comes to trading derivatives. Its Web3 infrastructure allows users to see on-chain activity directly tied to trading on the platform. This transparency — such as the ability to view the… pic.twitter.com/2bxw4bpioF — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 23, 2025 Hyperliquid now sits comfortably in the fifth position among exchanges globally, having surpassed many competitors that have been around far longer. These figures indicate that not only is the platform technologically strong, but it has also implemented a robust marketing and community strategy. The crypto market is far from static, and in this space, the winning platforms seem destined to be the ones that combine community engagement with innovative changes and incremental improvements. $HYPE Token Gathers Steam Amid Buyback Strategy Adding even more boosters to the platform’s march skyward is its homegrown token, $HYPE. The token has seen dazzling price action of late, and this appears largely down to Hyperliquid’s very ongoing buyback. By purchasing tokens from the open market, the team is not only making a very loud statement about the long-term value of the token but is also quite obviously helping to reduce the circulating supply. And that reduced supply, given the same sort of demand, should quite obviously lead to a higher price. This financial reward is congruent with the platform’s growth, providing both early adopters and loyal users with more reasons to stay engaged. What’s more, it evinces a level of financial maturity and foresight that investors can appreciate — and that’s a nice change in a market often characterized by volatility and uncertainty. The increasing user adoption and record-setting trading activity seem to be strengthening the positive feedback loop between the utility of the platform and the value of the token. Conclusion Hyperliquid’s ascent has been anything but normal. By synthesizing blockchain openness with the smoothness of contemporary trading platforms, it has hewn out a one-of-a-kind niche in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. With unprecedented growth, a buzzing community, and a clear token economy, Hyperliquid is not merely in pursuit of the field’s front-runners; it is rapidly closing in on them. All eyes in the crypto universe are on Hyperliquid as it makes its next moves. They could cement its status as a solid fifth or take it even higher in the global rankings.

Bitcoin fell from a daily high of $111,200 to just over $107,000 on Friday, causing a swift change in sentiment. The drop came as President Donald Trump revived fears of a tariff war with the European Union — threatening a 50% levy as talks were “going nowhere.” Market cap shed 5% and the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, fell 2.2% as traders moved to lock in gains amid rising volatility. The move comes despite bitcoin touching fresh highs above $111,500 just days earlier, with ETF inflows, stablecoin legislation, and institutional buying supporting its rally. But those same tailwinds haven’t kept altcoins afloat in the short term. “Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high also carries altcoins toward a bullish direction,” said Haiyang Ru, co-CEO of HashKey Group, said in a Telegram message. “But if BTC’s volatility picks up again, traders may rotate into regulated stablecoins — especially with new frameworks in the U.S. and Hong Kong easing that transition.” Alex Kuptsikevich, chief analyst at FxPro, crypto sentiment recently hit levels last seen in January, just as BTC and ETH reached critical resistance zones. “Unlike previous BTCUSD rallies, the current movement is not just momentum-driven but backed by real demand and macro factors,” he noted. Still, markets are showing signs of fatigue. Ethereum is struggling to break past its 200-day moving average near $2,650, while altcoins that previously surged — such as HYPE and EIGEN — are now cooling off after double-digit gains. Analysts warn that if BTC doesn’t establish a new support zone, altcoin losses could deepen.

If so, you might have noticed something significant happening with Spot Bitcoin ETF products. These investment vehicles, which offer investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin without requiring them to directly hold the cryptocurrency, saw an extraordinary surge in activity. This isn’t just a minor blip; the total Bitcoin ETF trading volume for the day was truly remarkable, hitting a figure that underscores growing market participation. What Triggered This Impressive Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume? According to data shared by Watcher Guru on X, the cumulative trading volume across all U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 23 exceeded a staggering $4.5 billion. This figure represents a significant uptick in activity and is a key indicator of the current sentiment surrounding BTC ETF products and the broader crypto market. But what factors might have contributed to such a high volume on this particular day? Several elements could be at play: Market Momentum: Bitcoin’s price movement leading up to and on May 23 likely played a crucial role. Positive price action often correlates with increased investor interest and trading activity in related investment products like ETFs. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or shifts in investor risk appetite can drive capital towards or away from assets like Bitcoin, influencing ETF volumes. News and Developments: Specific news related to regulations, institutional adoption, or technological advancements within the crypto space can spur trading. Rebalancing and Flows: Large institutional players might have been rebalancing portfolios or executing significant buy/sell orders, contributing to the high volume. Understanding the context of this volume requires looking at the overall market environment at the time. Was Bitcoin experiencing significant volatility? Were there major announcements from asset managers or regulators? These external factors are often intertwined with the trading patterns observed in ETFs. Why Does High Spot Bitcoin ETF Volume Matter for Crypto Investment? The volume seen on May 23 is more than just a number; it carries significant implications for the market. High trading volume generally indicates strong liquidity and robust interest. For crypto investment , particularly through regulated products like ETFs, this is a positive sign. Here’s why it’s important: Liquidity: High volume means it’s easier for large buyers and sellers to trade shares without significantly impacting the price. This makes the ETF market more efficient and attractive, especially for institutional players. Institutional Interest: A substantial portion of this volume likely comes from institutional investors – hedge funds, asset managers, and financial advisors – who are increasingly comfortable using ETFs to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This points towards growing institutional crypto adoption. Market Validation: High trading volume validates the demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure and reinforces the role of ETFs as a primary gateway for traditional finance participants entering the crypto space. Price Discovery: Active trading in ETFs contributes to the overall price discovery mechanism for Bitcoin, as large flows can influence spot market prices. Think of it this way: the higher the volume, the more capital is flowing into or out of these regulated Bitcoin products, providing clearer signals about market demand from traditional investment channels. Who Are the Key Players in the BTC ETF Space? While the original snippet provides a total volume, it’s worth noting which ETFs typically contribute the most to the overall Spot Bitcoin ETF trading volume. Since their launch in January 2024, several funds have emerged as leaders. Prominent examples include: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT): Has consistently seen high inflows and trading volume. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): Another major player attracting significant investment. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): Although it started as a trust and converted to an ETF, it holds a large amount of Bitcoin and sees substantial trading volume, often related to outflows as investors switch to newer, lower-fee options. Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB): Also holds a notable share of the market. The competition among these funds, particularly regarding management fees and performance, also influences where the volume flows. Investors often compare these options based on costs, liquidity, and the reputation of the issuing firm. How Does This Volume Compare Historically? To fully appreciate the $4.5 billion+ figure, it’s helpful to compare it to previous trading days or weeks. While this wasn’t necessarily an all-time record volume day (which were often seen shortly after the ETFs launched), it represents a strong level of sustained interest. Days with volume exceeding several billion dollars indicate periods of heightened activity, often coinciding with significant price movements or market events. Looking at historical data for Bitcoin ETF trading volume helps us understand trends. Are volumes increasing over time? Are they becoming less volatile? Consistent, high volume suggests maturation of the market and increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. What are the Benefits and Challenges of Investing via a Spot Bitcoin ETF? The high trading volume on May 23 highlights the popularity of this investment method. But what are the pros and cons? Benefits: Accessibility: Easily tradable on traditional stock exchanges through brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: Operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection compared to some direct crypto exchanges. No Custody Hassle: Investors don’t need to worry about setting up wallets, managing private keys, or securing their Bitcoin directly. Liquidity: High trading volume ensures you can typically buy or sell shares easily. Familiarity: ETFs are a well-understood investment product for traditional investors. Challenges: Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) that can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror Bitcoin’s price due to fees, operational costs, and tracking methods. Not Your Keys: You own shares in a fund that holds Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin itself. This goes against the core crypto principle of self-custody. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure is familiar, the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is highly volatile, meaning the ETF price can experience significant swings. Despite the challenges, the significant volume indicates that for many investors, particularly institutions, the benefits of accessibility and regulatory clarity offered by a BTC ETF outweigh the drawbacks. What Does This High Volume Suggest for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The consistent, and at times surging, volume in spot Bitcoin ETFs is perhaps the strongest signal yet of increasing institutional crypto adoption. Institutions require regulated, familiar, and liquid pathways to invest in new asset classes. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide exactly that. The willingness of large funds and wealth managers to allocate capital through these products suggests a shift in perspective. Bitcoin is moving from being seen purely as a speculative retail asset to a legitimate, albeit volatile, component of diversified portfolios. This trend is likely to continue as more data becomes available and confidence in the regulatory framework grows. Actionable Insights for Investors For individuals interested in crypto investment , the high volume in spot Bitcoin ETFs offers several insights: Monitor Volume: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF volumes as an indicator of overall market demand, especially from larger players. Understand the Gateway: Recognize that ETFs are a primary way traditional finance interacts with Bitcoin. Their activity can influence the spot market. Evaluate Your Options: If considering Bitcoin exposure, compare direct ownership vs. ETF investment based on your comfort with technology, security, and fees. Stay Informed: Follow news related to ETF flows, regulatory changes, and the performance of the major funds. The $4.5 billion+ day on May 23 wasn’t just a random event; it was a data point reinforcing the growing integration of Bitcoin into the mainstream financial system via regulated products like ETFs. Conclusion: The Expanding Footprint of Spot Bitcoin ETFs The significant Bitcoin ETF trading volume exceeding $4.5 billion on May 23 serves as a compelling indicator of the robust and growing interest in regulated Bitcoin exposure. This high volume reflects strong liquidity, increasing institutional crypto participation, and the successful integration of Spot Bitcoin ETF products into traditional investment frameworks. As more investors, both retail and institutional, utilize these vehicles for crypto investment , the BTC ETF market is poised to play an even more critical role in the overall health and development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The trend points towards continued maturation and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets. The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case. Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform. Related: US DOJ seizes $24M in crypto from accused Qakbot malware developer Judge sides with Eisenberg The Justice Department argued that he deceived Mango’s smart contract-based lending system, but Eisenberg’s defense maintained that he merely exploited poorly designed, permissionless code — without making any false representations. Judge Subramanian agreed, writing that “Mango Markets was permissionless and automatic,” meaning the system couldn’t be deceived in a legal sense. “There was insufficient evidence of falsity,” the judge added, siding with Eisenberg’s interpretation of DeFi mechanics. US judge siding with Eisenberg on nature of the exploit. Source: Bwbx.io The judge also rejected prosecutors’ argument that the case should be heard in New York. Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York. The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue. The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC. While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars. Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material charges Eisenberg charged with child pornography In a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.

FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation. A jury found Eisenberg guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation in April 2024. The defense argued that the exploit was not a cybercrime and represented a “successful and legal trading strategy.” Magazine: Crypto scam hub expose stunt goes viral, Kakao detects 70K scam apps: Asia Express",,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-24 07:00:16

In a new post on Truth Social, Trump says that he’s going to recommend a hefty tax on EU goods starting June 1st due to their unfair economic practices and unwillingness to negotiate. “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with. Their powerful trade barriers, VAT taxes, ridiculous corporate penalties, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans companies, and more, have led to a trade deficit with the US of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable. Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1st, 2025. There is no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Regarding Apple, Trump says that he’s imposing tariffs on the tech giant until the firm relocates its manufacturing base to the US. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” News of the new tariff recommendations caused US stock markets as well as Apple stocks to pull back. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw dips of 0.67% and 1%, respectively, and Apple shares fell 3%.

Understanding the collective mood of the market is crucial, and one popular tool for this is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . This index offers a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly optimistic (greed) or overly cautious (fear). Recently, we’ve seen a notable shift that every investor should pay attention to. What Does the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Tell Us? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, provided by Alternative.me, serves as a barometer for crypto market sentiment . It aggregates data from various sources to assign a score between 0 (Extreme Fear) and 100 (Extreme Greed). Think of it as a quick way to gauge the prevailing emotional state driving market decisions. A score closer to 0 suggests that investors are highly fearful, often indicating potential buying opportunities according to contrarian investment principles. Conversely, a score closer to 100 signals extreme greed, which can sometimes precede a market correction as assets may be overvalued. As of May 24th, the index registered 66, a decrease of 12 points from the previous day. This movement caused the index to transition from the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (typically above 75) into the ‘Greed’ zone (55-75). While still indicating positive sentiment, this drop signifies a cooling off from the recent peak. How is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a single factor but is a composite score derived from six key market indicators. Understanding these components helps demystify how the index arrives at its score and what forces are influencing crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): This measures the current crypto volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility in an upward trend can signal a greedy market, while high volatility during a downturn points to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component looks at the current volume and market momentum compared to average values. High buying volume in a positive market trend suggests a greedy market. Social Media (15%): Analyzes social media sentiment using algorithms that scan posts and hashtags related to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. High levels of positive or overly excited posts can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused by Alternative.me, historically this involved weekly polls asking users about their market perspective. (Note: The weight of this factor might be distributed among others when surveys are not active). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks the market capitalization share of Bitcoin compared to the total crypto market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be moving funds from altcoins back into the perceived relative safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance can signal increasing greed or confidence, as funds flow into riskier altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search data for cryptocurrency-related terms. A surge in search queries for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ often indicates fear, while terms like ‘buy Bitcoin’ can signal increasing public interest and potential greed. Each of these factors contributes to the final score, providing a multi-faceted view of the market’s emotional state. Understanding the Shift: From Extreme Greed to Greed The move from ‘Extreme Greed’ to ‘Greed’ isn’t necessarily a bearish signal, but rather a moderation of sentiment. The ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (75-100) is often seen as a potential warning sign for a pullback, as it suggests the market might be overheating. A score in the ‘Greed’ zone (55-75) still indicates positive sentiment and buying pressure, but without the same level of potential irrational exuberance seen in the higher range. This shift could be attributed to various factors, including minor price pullbacks, changing news cycles, or simply a natural ebb and flow of market psychology after a period of rapid gains. It’s a reminder that even in bullish phases, market sentiment is rarely static. How Does This Impact Your Investing Strategy? For many traders and investors, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it shouldn’t be the only one. It’s best used as a complementary indicator within a broader investing strategy . Some investors use the index as a contrarian signal: buying when the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (indicating potential undervaluation) and selling or taking profits when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (indicating potential overvaluation). The current shift to ‘Greed’ might lead some to become more cautious or consider adjusting their positions, while others might see it as a healthy consolidation phase before further upward movement. Consider how the index reading aligns with other technical indicators, fundamental analysis, and overall market conditions. For example, pairing the index with an analysis of crypto volatility or recent trends in Bitcoin dominance can provide a more complete picture. Challenges and Considerations While useful, the index has limitations. It’s based on publicly available data and algorithms, which may not capture all market nuances. Sentiment can change rapidly, and the index is a lagging indicator to some extent. Furthermore, relying solely on this index without considering other factors or having a well-defined investing strategy is risky. The index is primarily focused on Bitcoin sentiment, although it reflects the broader crypto market to a significant degree due to Bitcoin’s influence (reflected in the Bitcoin dominance factor). However, altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Conclusion: Navigating Market Sentiment The recent drop in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index from ‘Extreme Greed’ to ‘Greed’ signals a moderation in market enthusiasm. While still positive, this shift is a timely reminder for investors to stay vigilant and base their decisions on more than just emotion. By understanding the factors that influence the index – including crypto volatility , momentum, social sentiment, and Bitcoin dominance – and integrating this knowledge into a robust investing strategy , market participants can better navigate the complexities of the crypto landscape.

45032838,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=162812,1748070135,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45032838.jpeg,An Interview With Tranchess,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/an-interview-with-tranchess/,"BitcoinWorld An Interview With Tranchess In an exclusive interview with BitcoinWorld , we got the chance to speak with Danny Chong , Co-founder of Tranchess Danny, you’ve had a significant career in TradFi before co-founding Tranchess. How has this experience shaped your approach to building DeFi solutions, particularly in designing products that appeal to both traditional investors and crypto natives? As Co-founder of Tranchess, I have over 17 years of experience in investment banking at firms like Société Générale, BNP Paribas, and Crédit Agricole which have taught me the importance of structured risk management and clear investment options, principles that TradFi has refined over decades. My journey in decentralised finance began with an opportunity to run a “build-a-bank” project during my career in investment banking. Leading a team of IT professionals, I built emerging products that are client-facing and new to the traditional finance system. TradFi’s strength lies in its ability to segment risk and align products with diverse investor needs, but it often stifles innovation with bureaucracy. DeFi, by contrast, is liberating, open, and permissionless, yet it can overwhelm users with complexity and high-risk volatility. My experience shaped Tranchess to bridge these worlds by simplifying DeFi without sacrificing sophistication. Our products draw on TradFi’s risk tranching concepts used in structured finance to create varied risk-return profiles from a single asset and make DeFi accessible. The name “Tranchess” came from the words “tranche” and “chess”. “Tranche” is a TradFi term for varied risk solutions, whereas “Chess” is based on international chess, a game centred on strategy and optimisation. For traditional investors, we offer familiar structures with clear risk levels, like fixed-income-style yields, which resonate with their preference for stability. For crypto natives, we provide high-yield, leveraged options catering to their appetite for risk and innovation. By combining TradFi’s clarity with DeFi’s transparency and automation, we create a platform that empowers both groups to engage confidently, addressing the bottleneck of DeFi’s complexity. Tranchess recently highlighted its $CHESS Token Buyback Programme. Could you elaborate on the strategic thinking behind this initiative and how it compares, from your TradFi lens, to corporate equity buybacks in terms of signaling confidence and delivering value to token holders? The $CHESS Token Buyback Programme is market agnostic, reliant on Tranchess’ roadmap rather than on the ever-changing market dynamics. It is a strategic move to enhance value for our token holders and signal Tranchess’s confidence in our long-term growth. In DeFi, token economics are critical, and buybacks help manage circulating supply, potentially stabilising or increasing token value while rewarding our community. The programme uses a portion of revenue to repurchase $CHESS tokens from the open market, reducing supply and aligning with our commitment to sustainable ecosystem growth, signalling our confidence in $CHESS. In TradFi, buybacks signal financial health, indicating that companies believe their stock is undervalued and have excess capital to return to shareholders. Similarly, our $CHESS buyback demonstrates Tranchess’s robust revenue, showing we’re not just surviving but thriving in a volatile market. Unlike TradFi, where buybacks often benefit institutional shareholders, our programme directly supports our decentralised community, enhancing $CHESS’s utility in governance and rewards. The key difference is DeFi’s transparency, where every buyback transaction is on-chain and verifiable, unlike in TradFi. This initiative reflects my honed belief in disciplined capital allocation, adapted to DeFi’s open ethos to deliver tangible value to holders. Tranchess aims to offer more than basic yields through its structured products like QUEEN, BISHOP, and ROOK. Can you explain the core concept behind these offerings and how they cater to different risk appetites while aiming for sustainable, layered yields? Tranchess’s structured products, QUEEN, BISHOP, and ROOK, are designed to bring TradFi’s risk tranching to DeFi, offering tailored risk-return profiles from a single underlying asset, like BTC or ETH, to meet diverse investor needs. The core concept is to segment risk and reward, making DeFi accessible and appealing to varying risk appetites. QUEEN tracks the underlying asset’s price with staking rewards, ideal for crypto natives seeking market exposure with added yield. BISHOP offers fixed-income-style yields, appealing to risk-averse investors, including those from TradFi, who prioritise stability. ROOK provides leveraged exposure, catering to high-risk, high-reward seekers comfortable with volatility. These products are denominated in USDC for clarity, lowering entry barriers by making profit and loss intuitive. By leveraging DeFi’s automation, we enable users to switch between tranches seamlessly on one platform, ensuring simplicity, stability, and cost efficiency, unlike TradFi’s complex derivatives markets. Sustainability comes from diversified revenue streams, such as yield farming and validator services, which reduce reliance on volatile token emissions. This approach, inspired by TradFi’s structured finance but enhanced by blockchain’s transparency, ensures layered yields that balance risk and reward, attracting conservative investors and DeFi enthusiasts. You’ve spoken about RWA tokenization as a pivotal trend. How does Tranchess view the integration of RWAs into its yield-focused offerings, and what role do you see regulatory clarity playing in accelerating the adoption of tokenized real-world assets on platforms like the BNB Chain? RWA tokenisation is a game-changer. We see it as a natural extension of our yield-focused structured products. Tokenised stocks, bonds, or real estate, or RWAs, add real value to DeFi and support our objective of providing modular, risk-adjusted yields. We must explore how to integrate RWAs into our framework, potentially allowing users to stake tokenised assets or create tranches with RWA-backed yields, combining TradFi’s familiarity with DeFi’s efficiency. Regulatory clarity is critical to accelerate RWA adoption, especially on scalable platforms like BNB Chain, which is seeing a push by VanEck for a spot ETF which could pave the way for innovation. Clear frameworks, like those emerging in the UAE or Singapore, legitimise tokenised assets, assuaging institutional concerns about compliance and security. As evidenced by the RWA category’s explosive growth from $200 million to $2 billion in just six months, RWAs run the risk of becoming niche if they are not regulated. If they are, however, they could greatly accelerate DeFi’s TVL. Beyond structured products, Tranchess also offers liquid staking. Could you shed some light on your liquid staking solutions and how they provide users with both yield and liquidity, and the security measures Tranchess employs? Tranchess’ liquid staking solutions allow users to stake assets like Ethereum while maintaining liquidity through tokenised staking positions, which can be traded or used in DeFi protocols. This addresses a key pain point in traditional staking, where assets are locked, limiting flexibility. By staking through Tranchess, users earn validation rewards, which are often higher than TradFi savings rates. This benefit of yield and liquidity appeals to both crypto natives seeking DeFi composability and TradFi investors accustomed to liquid assets. Security is paramount, especially given DeFi’s history of breaches. Tranchess employs rigorous measures, including regular smart contract audits, multi-signature wallets for treasury management, and robust governance to prevent centralised failures. Our team prioritises network security, drawing on my TradFi experience where risk controls were non-negotiable. While staking carries risks, we mitigate them through diversified validator partnerships and transparent on-chain operations, ensuring user funds are protected and accessible. The $CHESS token is central to Tranchess’s governance and rewards system. Beyond the buyback, how does Tranchess ensure active community participation and align the protocol’s growth with the interests of $CHESS holders, especially through mechanisms like veCHESS? The $CHESS token is the backbone of Tranchess’s governance and rewards, empowering our users to shape the protocol’s future. Beyond the buyback programme, we foster active community participation through the veCHESS mechanism. veCHESS allows users to lock $CHESS for a set period to gain enhanced voting power and higher yield boosts on our products, incentivising long-term commitment. This aligns holder interests with protocol growth by rewarding those who contribute to governance and stability, drawing on my TradFi understanding of stakeholder alignment. We encourage participation via transparent governance proposals, where veCHESS holders vote on upgrades, fee structures, or new products, ensuring community input drives Tranchess’s evolution. Regular X spaces and talking to users on social media keep users engaged, while $CHESS staking rewards distribute protocol profits, reinforcing economic incentives. By balancing accessibility with incentives, we make governance inclusive yet rewarding for dedicated holders. This approach has helped sustain our community since our $1.5 million seed round in 2021, and it’s key to maintaining protocol health in DeFi’s competitive landscape. Given Tranchess’ success, such as reaching over $1 billion in TVL relatively quickly, where do you see the broader DeFi space evolving in the next couple of years, and what is Tranchess’s vision for continuing to innovate and lead in this evolving landscape? A deeper integration with real-world assets, more institutional adoption, and more transparent regulatory frameworks are probably going to be characteristics of DeFi’s next few years. We at Tranchess see this as a chance to further our objective of providing yield strategies that are adjusted for risk while preserving transparency and composability. As we have done from day one, we will continue to innovate at the intersection of structured products and liquid staking, developing tools that serve experienced DeFi users and new institutions alike. Finally, for our audience looking to explore DeFi or deepen their involvement, what key piece of advice would you offer, particularly when considering protocols that aim to bridge the best of TradFi and DeFi like Tranchess? Instead of focussing only on short-term yield attractiveness, start with protocols that prioritise long-term sustainability, cybersecurity, transparency, strong team setup, and sound risk frameworks. As DeFi matures, those who successfully strike a balance between innovation and resilience will rise to the top. Anyone bridging the gap between TradFi and DeFi, as we do at Tranchess, is embracing the agility and innovation that DeFi allows whilst introducing the discipline and standards of traditional finance into a decentralised, open-access setting.

Bitcoin, which had been trading above $111,000, dropped quickly to around $108,600, wiping out intraday gains and rattling broader market sentiment. BTC’s drop was mirrored across the crypto complex, with futures tracking ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) showing losses from $30 million to over $100 million. Bitcoin futures saw roughly $181 million in losses, while Ether futures accounted for nearly $142 million. Altcoins added another $100 million in liquidations, including notable wipeouts in SOL, DOGE, and XRP. pic The largest single liquidation was a $9.53 million BTC-USDT swap on OKX, CoinGlass data shows. A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the trader's inability to meet the margin requirements. Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying. A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment. The pullback arrived just as bitcoin was gaining momentum on ETF inflows and growing institutional interest, leading some to expect a calm weekend. Instead, volatility returned in full force.

In a new interview on Market Disruptors, Edward Dowd forecasts an incoming recession and market meltdown driven in part by a housing crisis and a bursting AI bubble. Dowd points to collapsing new home permits since 2022 and falling tenant rents as early signs of a housing crash. He also warns that government spending cuts and a slowdown in illegal immigration will sap economic growth, with stock markets facing a potential 50% drop based on historical patterns. “The idea here is you have a recession that we think manifests itself pretty soon, and the stock markets bottom sometime in the first quarter of 2026. Then you have a recovery, that’s the ideal situation… We’re not claiming anything’s going to go systemic. We’re not doom and gloom. It’s just we think it’s an old-fashioned deep recession and hopefully it’s quick. Typically speaking in recessions like in the dot-com recession and the great financial crisis, stocks went down 50% before they recovered, so we’re nowhere near down 50% yet and we think that’s coming.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from its all-time high of 45,073 in December of 2024 to a low of 38,314 last month, registering a 15% decline. Dowd traces the crisis to a global debt problem, temporarily masked by COVID-era money printing and spending, with commercial real estate and rising auto loan delinquencies signaling a broader credit crunch. In the long run, he expects deflationary pressures to force the Federal Reserve to slash rates and print money. For protection, Dowd advocates holding cash, pointing to Berkshire Hathaway’s massive position in T-bills/bonds, as well as physical gold, while cautioning against Bitcoin’s volatility and historic correlation with risk assets.

Elon Musk is bullish on Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/rNbzOP1QPJ — Arkham (@arkham) May 23, 2025 Tesla sold part of its BTC holdings in 2022 Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment in Q1 2021. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2021, the automotive company disclosed that it had invested around $1.5 billion to purchase 43,200 BTC and intended to incorporate Bitcoin into its payment system. Shortly after, the firm began accepting BTC payments for vehicle purchases before halting the option in May 2021. However, the suspension led to a more than 10% drop in Bitcoin’s value and Tesla’s stock price decline. Musk claimed they were obliged to halt BTC payments over concerns about the increasing reliance on fossil fuels, particularly coal, for Bitcoin mining and transactions. He argued that crypto investments have great potential; they shouldn’t come at the expense of the environment. However, skeptics suggested that the billionaire’s decision was just another attempt to influence the crypto market. In Q2 2022, the car manufacturing firm also sold about 75% of its Bitcoin holdings, valued at $936 million, remaining with only 9,720 BTC. Nonetheless, Musk clarified that their decision to sell their holdings had nothing to do with the asset’s market performance but rather the firm’s need for cash. Since then, Tesla has added more BTC to its portfolio, holding roughly 11,900 BTC worth $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, the crypto community began speculating that Musk’s X Money will incorporate Bitcoin after Tesla’s Q4 2024 net income increased to $600 million due to crypto. Metaplanet and Strategy are still growing their BTC holdings Multiple firms are also ramping up their Bitcoin holdings. For instance, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC, with its most recent purchas e on May 19, when it acquired 7,390 BTC for $764.9 million. Metaplanet is on pace to reach its target of holding 10,000 BTC, being only a little over 2,000 coins short. So far, the firm has 7,800 BTC. The firm’s stock, 3350.T, also soared 15% after the company recently purchased 1,004 BTC. Aside from corporations investing in BTC, there is growing interest in the US among certain states in integrating Bitcoin reserves, especially after Donald Trump took office. More than 25 states have proposed bills in favor of Bitcoin reserve legislation, with Texas and New Hampshire among the first to pass their bills. However, Arizona’s Governor, Katie Hobbs, recently rejected two crypto reserve bills after Florida dropped discussions on their bills. Nevertheless, there are still 13 active crypto bills at the federal level, which, if passed, could promote Bitcoin integration and establish a Bitcoin reserve. President Donald Trump named five cryptocurrencies for his proposed strategic reserve at the start of the month. His list included Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. His announcement did stir the crypto market, with Caradona surging by over 70%, Solana by 20%, and XRP by 30%. Bitcoin and Ethereum also saw a rise in market value, jumping by over 10%. Trump has consistently insisted that a digital asset reserve would elevate the country, reduce inflation, and build the crypto industry.

According to a compelling observation by Bradley Duke, Head of Europe at Bitwise Asset Management, publicly reported Bitcoin purchases by listed companies in 2025 have already reached an astonishing level, tripling the amount of New Bitcoin Supply generated through mining so far this year. Why is Corporate Bitcoin Demand Skyrocketing? This dramatic statistic, shared by the Bitwise executive on social media platform X, paints a clear picture: institutions and corporations are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. While the exact reasons vary, several key drivers are pushing companies towards the premier cryptocurrency: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unpredictable economic policies and potential currency devaluation, Bitcoin is seen by many corporations as a robust store of value, similar to digital gold. Balance Sheet Diversification: Holding a portion of corporate reserves in Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional fiat currencies and assets. Long-Term Value Proposition: Companies are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term appreciating asset, driven by its fixed supply and growing network effects. Investor and Shareholder Interest: Some companies may also be responding to growing interest from investors who see Bitcoin exposure as a positive sign. It’s crucial to note the caveat mentioned by Duke: this figure strictly accounts for disclosed acquisitions by publicly traded firms. Purchases made by privately held corporations, sovereign wealth funds, or other large private entities are not included in this calculation, suggesting the actual total Corporate Bitcoin Demand could be considerably higher. The Scarcity Factor: Demand vs. New Bitcoin Supply The significance of corporate buys tripling the New Bitcoin Supply cannot be overstated. Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition is rooted in its scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely, the creation of new Bitcoin is governed by a predetermined, algorithmic schedule known as BTC Mining . Approximately every ten minutes, a new block of transactions is added to the blockchain, and miners who successfully add a block are rewarded with newly minted BTC. However, the rate at which new Bitcoin is created is halved roughly every four years in an event called the ‘Halving’. The most recent Halving occurred in April 2024, significantly reducing the daily issuance of new BTC. This means the available New Bitcoin Supply entering the market each day is now considerably lower than in previous cycles. When you combine this reduced supply from BTC Mining with surging demand, particularly from large-scale corporate buyers, you create a powerful supply shock dynamic. These large purchases absorb the limited new supply entering the market, potentially putting upward pressure on the price, assuming other market factors remain constant or are also positive. Understanding Bitcoin Institutional Adoption The statistic shared by the Bitwise executive is a clear indicator of deepening Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . While early Bitcoin cycles were primarily driven by retail investors and enthusiasts, recent years have seen a marked increase in interest and investment from major financial institutions, asset managers, and corporations. Key catalysts for this surge in Bitcoin Institutional Adoption include: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, have provided a regulated, accessible, and familiar investment vehicle for institutions and corporations. These ETFs allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of direct ownership, custody, or security. Improved Custody Solutions: The development of robust and secure institutional-grade custody solutions has alleviated concerns about storing and protecting large amounts of Bitcoin. Increased Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies is becoming clearer in many parts of the world, providing institutions with more confidence to enter the market. Peer Effect: As more high-profile companies and institutions disclose their Bitcoin holdings or involvement, others may feel compelled to explore similar strategies to remain competitive or appealing to investors. Companies like MicroStrategy have been pioneers in adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, a strategy that has proven highly successful and has likely inspired others. The trend highlighted by Bitwise suggests this is not an isolated phenomenon but a growing corporate movement. The Role of BTC Mining in the Supply Equation While Corporate Bitcoin Demand represents the significant inflow side of the equation, BTC Mining represents the supply side. Miners perform the crucial function of validating transactions and securing the network, and their reward (the block subsidy plus transaction fees) is their incentive. The Halving mechanism ensures that the issuance rate of new Bitcoin decreases over time, making it an increasingly scarce asset. The fact that disclosed corporate purchases alone are three times the amount of BTC mined in 2025 illustrates the immense buying pressure relative to the natural supply creation rate. This dynamic fundamentally shifts the supply/demand balance compared to earlier periods when mining output represented a larger portion of available sell-side pressure. Insights from Bitwise and Future Outlook Bradley Duke’s observation from Bitwise serves as a crucial data point underscoring the evolving market structure for Bitcoin. It suggests that institutional and corporate treasuries are becoming significant accumulators of BTC, potentially absorbing much of the new supply as well as liquidity from the open market. What does this mean for the future? Continued strong Corporate Bitcoin Demand , coupled with the constrained New Bitcoin Supply from BTC Mining post-Halving, could act as a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin’s price in the long term. It signals a maturation of the asset class and its increasing acceptance within traditional financial frameworks through Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges, such as market volatility, macroeconomic shifts, and unforeseen regulatory actions that could impact corporate strategies. Nevertheless, the trend highlighted by Bitwise is a bullish signal for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system. Conclusion: A New Era of Bitcoin Accumulation The statistic shared by the Bitwise executive is a powerful testament to the current state of the Bitcoin market. Corporate Bitcoin Demand in 2025 is significantly outpacing the rate at which new coins are being mined, highlighting robust Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . This dynamic of high demand meeting limited New Bitcoin Supply from BTC Mining creates a compelling environment for Bitcoin’s future price discovery. As more corporations and institutions follow this trend, the foundational support for Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class continues to strengthen, marking a new era of institutional accumulation.

The potential for more sophisticated crypto trading just took a significant step forward. Nasdaq PHLX, a well-known options trading platform, has reportedly filed a proposed rule change with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding Bitcoin options . This move, if approved, could open up new avenues for investors and traders looking to engage with Bitcoin in different ways. What Does This Nasdaq PHLX SEC Filing Mean? The core of the news is the SEC filing by Nasdaq PHLX . This isn’t just a casual inquiry; it’s a formal proposal submitted to the regulatory body that oversees securities markets in the United States. The filing seeks permission to list and trade options contracts based on a Bitcoin index. While the specific index wasn’t detailed in the initial report, the implication is clear: Nasdaq wants to bring regulated, exchange-traded options tied to Bitcoin’s price movements to its platform. Think of it this way: Nasdaq PHLX: A major, regulated options exchange. SEC Filing: A formal request to regulators for approval. Bitcoin Index Options: Derivatives contracts allowing traders to speculate on or hedge against the future price of Bitcoin, based on an underlying index value, without directly owning the Bitcoin itself. This development underscores the growing interest from established financial institutions in providing regulated access points to the cryptocurrency market. It’s a sign that major players see demand and potential in offering sophisticated products like Bitcoin options . Why Are Bitcoin Index Options Important for Crypto Trading? The introduction of regulated Bitcoin options on a platform like Nasdaq PHLX could be a game-changer for several reasons, primarily enhancing crypto trading strategies and market maturity. Potential Benefits Include: Hedging Opportunities: Investors holding Bitcoin could use options to protect against potential price declines. For example, buying put options could provide a form of insurance. Speculation: Traders can speculate on Bitcoin’s price direction with potentially less capital outlay compared to buying Bitcoin outright. Options offer leverage, meaning a small price movement in the underlying asset can result in a larger percentage gain (or loss) on the option contract. Income Generation: Sophisticated strategies like selling covered calls could allow Bitcoin holders to generate income from their existing positions. Price Discovery: Increased trading activity in a regulated environment can contribute to more efficient price discovery for Bitcoin. Accessibility: Trading on a platform like Nasdaq PHLX might be more accessible or familiar to traditional finance participants compared to native crypto derivatives exchanges. These tools offer flexibility that simply buying and holding Bitcoin does not. They allow for more nuanced strategies tailored to different market outlooks and risk tolerances. Does This Filing Signal Increased Institutional Adoption? Absolutely. An SEC filing from a major exchange operator like Nasdaq PHLX is a strong indicator of increasing institutional adoption interest. Large financial institutions, asset managers, and hedge funds often prefer to trade on regulated exchanges using familiar financial instruments like options. This provides them with: Regulatory Clarity: Trading on a regulated platform offers more legal and compliance certainty. Established Infrastructure: They can leverage existing trading systems and relationships with brokers and clearers. Risk Management Tools: Regulated options come with established clearing processes, reducing counterparty risk compared to some unregulated venues. Meeting Client Demand: As client interest in crypto grows, institutions need regulated ways to offer exposure. The move by Nasdaq PHLX suggests they see sufficient institutional demand to warrant the effort and cost of pursuing regulatory approval for Bitcoin options . This isn’t just about retail traders; it’s a significant step towards integrating Bitcoin into the broader financial ecosystem for large-scale participants. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the SEC Filing? While the filing is a positive step, approval from the SEC is not guaranteed. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving, and the SEC has historically taken a cautious approach, particularly with products directly tied to cryptocurrencies. Potential Hurdles Include: Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators often worry about the potential for manipulation in the underlying spot Bitcoin market, which could impact the options market. Investor Protection: Ensuring that retail investors understand the risks associated with options trading, especially on a volatile asset like Bitcoin. Regulatory Framework: Determining how Bitcoin index options fit within existing securities regulations. Index Methodology: The SEC will likely scrutinize the methodology of the underlying Bitcoin index to ensure it is robust and resistant to manipulation. The approval process can be lengthy and involve public comment periods. It’s not uncommon for such filings to face questions or requests for more information from the SEC staff. The outcome will heavily depend on the SEC’s current stance on crypto-related financial products and whether Nasdaq PHLX can adequately address their concerns regarding market surveillance, liquidity, and investor protection. How Do Bitcoin Index Options Compare to Other Crypto Products? It’s helpful to understand how potential Bitcoin options on Nasdaq PHLX might fit into the existing landscape of crypto trading products. Here’s a quick comparison: Product Description Key Difference from Index Options Spot Bitcoin Direct ownership of Bitcoin. Requires full capital outlay, no leverage (unless margin trading), limited to price appreciation/depreciation. Options offer leverage and complex strategies. Bitcoin Futures Agreement to buy/sell Bitcoin at a future date/price. Obligation to buy/sell (for physical settlement) or cash settlement based on price difference. Options give the right , but not the obligation, to buy/sell. Options offer more flexible strategies (e.g., spreads, combinations). Bitcoin ETFs (Spot) Fund holding actual Bitcoin, traded on stock exchanges. Provides indirect exposure to spot price via shares. Options are derivatives offering leverage and hedging capabilities beyond simple price exposure. Bitcoin ETFs (Futures) Fund holding Bitcoin futures contracts. Provides exposure via futures, subject to roll costs. Options offer different risk/reward profiles and strategy flexibility. Index options, specifically, are cash-settled and based on the value of an index rather than the physical delivery of Bitcoin. This is typical for index options in traditional markets and simplifies the settlement process for large institutions. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors While this is still a proposal, the possibility of regulated Bitcoin options on Nasdaq PHLX offers potential insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the SEC’s response to the filing. Regulatory approval timelines can be unpredictable. Educate Yourself on Options: If you’re new to options trading, now is a good time to learn the basics – calls, puts, strike prices, expiration dates, and key strategies. Options involve significant risk and are not suitable for all investors. Understand the Index: If approved, familiarize yourself with the specific Bitcoin index the options will track. How is it calculated? What exchanges does it source data from? Assess Your Strategy: Consider how regulated options might fit into your existing crypto trading or investment strategy, whether for hedging, speculation, or income. Institutional Watch: The progress of this filing is a key indicator for the pace of institutional adoption in the crypto space. This development highlights the ongoing maturation of the crypto market and its increasing intersection with traditional finance. It reflects growing demand for diverse and regulated financial products tied to digital assets. Summary: A Milestone Filing for Bitcoin Options The filing by Nasdaq PHLX with the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin options is a significant development. It signals strong interest from a major exchange in expanding regulated crypto trading offerings. While regulatory approval is far from certain and potential challenges exist, this move represents another step towards greater institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset class. It could potentially provide traders and investors with powerful new tools for hedging, speculation, and income generation within a familiar, regulated framework. The market will be watching closely to see how the SEC responds to this important proposal.

Strategy will own $70T of Bitcoin by 2025, says Myers Myers further forecasted that Michael Saylor’s Strategy will own $70 trillion worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) by 2045, “making it by far the most valuable company in the history of the world.” At the time of publication, Strategy holds 576,320 Bitcoin, worth approximately $62.24 billion, according to Saylor Tracker. Source: Jesse Myers Myers said, “To set the stage, there is $1,000T of asset value in the world.” He added that Bitcoin represents just 0.2% of that total amount. He explained that, since half of all capital in the world is essentially seeking the best store of value, more capital will “osmotically flow” into Bitcoin over time. “Over the last 2 years, an exodus from fiat assets (bonds and money) has already begun. Hard money assets (Bitcoin and gold) are where things are shifting,” he said. Source: Jesse Myers Myers said that there is around $318 trillion of capital in bonds “looking for greener pastures.” He said most of this capital is tied up in fixed-income institutional vehicles with “strict mandates.” “That’s where Bitcoin Treasury Companies come in,” Myers said. “Treasury Cos will be the primary bidders for BTC over the coming decades, deploying an ocean of SoV capital to BTC.” Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high, and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yet While Strategy has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, other treasury companies are starting to emerge. On April 24, Twenty One Capital formed, which is a Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm is looking to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” According to Bitbo data, publicly traded and private companies, ETFs, and nation-states collectively hold 3.23 million BTC, valued at approximately $348.25 billion.

The Treasury Department made the move official on Friday, labeling it “immediate sanctions relief.” These were sanctions originally enforced during the Assad dictatorship, which collapsed last December when rebel forces seized Damascus and forced Bashar al-Assad to flee to Moscow, ending nearly 14 years of civil war. According to the announcement , Trump’s administration is attempting to open up Syria’s economy for investment while keeping several core restrictions in place. Although the president has the authority to cancel executive orders, many parts of the sanctions, especially the 2019 Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, still require Congressional approval to be removed. That Act punishes any attempt to conduct business with the Syrian government, unless it’s strictly for humanitarian purposes. Trump team pushes for waiver, Rubio outlines 180-day plan Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the administration is applying for a 180-day waiver to buy time while working with lawmakers to repeal the broader legislation. The move is being framed as part of a larger strategy to bring back economic activity without immediately clearing the country’s name. Trump’s decision followed a high-level meeting with Sharaa, who came to power after leading a successful offensive against Assad. Sharaa was previously a commander of an Islamist-run zone in northwest Syria, and many of his key allies, including Shaibani, are former militants linked to Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups. The United Nations Security Council has already flagged members of the new Syrian administration in connection with war crimes during the civil war. The concern is less about strategy and more about who exactly is running the new Syrian government. While Assad is gone, Sharaa and his circle aren’t widely trusted across Capitol Hill. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said on Wednesday that although major steps still need to be taken by the Syrian administration , “Syria won’t be alone — the kingdom and the rest of our international partners will be at the forefront of those supporting this effort and economic rebirth.” Qatar to inject $30 million per month, investors line up cautiously One major development is that Qatar, with US support, is preparing to deliver $30 million every month to fund the salaries of Syrian civil servants. This was confirmed by four individuals familiar with the deal, including two involved in finalizing it. It’s not enough to fully rebuild, but it gives the new administration something to work with as it faces more than $400 billion in economic damage, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. During a televised speech on Wednesday, Sharaa said, “We welcome all investors: children of the nation inside and outside, our Arab and Turkish brothers and friends from around the world.” His allies inside and outside the region — especially Saudi Arabia — believe the easing of sanctions helps sideline extremists inside the government and reduces outside influence from Iran, which had been Assad’s strongest ally. This also blocks any immediate economic expansion by China, giving US-friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates early access to whatever business environment forms in the country. Still, risks remain. Syria is technically still at war with Israel, and US sanctions date back to 1979, when President Jimmy Carter listed it as a state sponsor of terrorism. A short thaw happened in the 1990s, when Damascus joined the US-led Gulf War coalition and entered peace talks with Israel, but that didn’t last. Assad’s deeper ties with Iran and his support for insurgents in post-invasion Iraq triggered more restrictions from Washington. Things got worse after 2011, when Assad’s forces cracked down violently on protests, leading to a conflict that left nearly 500,000 people dead and millions displaced. Within Trump’s own administration, some have been strongly against any effort to cooperate with Sharaa. People like Sebastian Gorka viewed him as a radical who simply traded military gear for suits. The State Department has demanded that Sharaa’s team show clear improvements on “a number of critical issues” before permanent sanctions relief is considered.

Mutuum Finance Presale Investors flock to Mutuum Finance due to its revolutionary decentralized finance model for crypto loans while decentralization funds its innovative financial services. The project maintains a rising momentum since it has raised over $9.1 million in investments and now attracts more than 11,000 investors. The Phase 5 token price at $0.03 presents investors with a limited opportunity as an upcoming 16.67% price boost charts the completion of early investment entry. Investors in this phase who join during the presale period could earn 100% ROI since the token has defined a listing price at $0.06. As the decentralized market grows, Mutuum Finance is leading the charge with its groundbreaking lending model and solid market positioning. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance offers a modern lending platform that joins Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models for better access to assets as well as transparency and user empowerment. Through the Peer-to-Contract model users can add stablecoins to smart contract pools to earn passive income as they instantly allow borrowing access to platform users. Smart contracts manage automatic interest rate adjustments that provide enhanced earnings for lenders at reduced borrowing expenses. When people utilize the P2P model they create immediate lending relationships free of intermediaries that fulfill decentralization goals and let users exercise complete negotiation capabilities. Borrowers together with lenders operate in a system which offers complete transparency and efficiency to form custom agreements for loan transactions creating enhanced user-centric borrowing situations. Transforming Crypto Lending The Mutuum Finance stablecoin will soon launch on Ethereum chain pegged to the USD. Secure financial transactions will rely on this stablecoin system because it uses a resistant structure which prevents algorithmic stability problems. The combination of next-generation financial lending approaches with robust infrastructure elements enables Mutuum Finance to create the path for decentralized finance development. While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to thrive on community hype and viral momentum, its lack of real-world utility may limit long-term upside. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building tangible value through an innovative dual-lending DeFi model, audited smart contracts, and a USD-pegged stablecoin—all while still in presale. With a 100% ROI already locked in for early investors and a roadmap aimed at reshaping decentralized lending, MUTM may deliver the kind of sustainable growth and explosive returns that meme coins simply can’t match. For investors seeking more than speculation, Mutuum Finance could be the smarter move in 2025.

While XRP’s technicals remain bullish and regulatory tailwinds persist, the most compelling action is unfolding elsewhere—particularly in early-stage projects where outsized returns are still within reach. Against this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout contender for 2025, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional capital with its explosive presale momentum. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Powerhouse with 12,000%+ Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly distinguishing itself as the must-watch presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—is fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x from current entry levels, with some models suggesting up to 12,000%–18,500% upside if momentum holds. A recent $132,000+ whale buy highlights the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential, and with a $0.007 listing target and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the standard for early-stage momentum and investor confidence. XRP: Steady Performance, Bullish Catalysts XRP’s current price action, trading between $2.37 and $2.45, signals a period of consolidation after a strong rally earlier in the year. Analysts remain optimistic, with short-term forecasts pointing to a potential breakout above $2.56, which could trigger a move toward $3.00–$3.40 in the coming weeks. However, with XRP’s volatility moderating and whale accumulation slowing, many traders are diversifying into higher-multiple opportunities—chief among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is setting the pace for early-stage growth. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Market Anchors with Rotating Capital Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors and ETFs. Analysts forecast a near-term range of $110,000–$115,000, with bullish scenarios projecting even higher levels if macro momentum persists. Ethereum, meanwhile, is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators suggesting a potential breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. While both assets remain core holdings for stability and long-term growth, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for those seeking transformative gains. Aptos: Quiet Strength, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos (APT) is quietly building momentum, trading in a tight range between $4.41 and $4.66 in May 2025. While its fundamentals remain solid and long-term forecasts are positive, APT’s near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s presale structure and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 40x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion: The Next Wave of Crypto Growth As XRP holds steady at $2.37 and the broader market consolidates, the real excitement is unfolding in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Bitcoin and Ethereum providing a stable foundation and Aptos offering quiet growth, MAGA stands out as the breakout contender for 2025. Each presale stage is filling rapidly, and as visibility grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is poised to ignite the next wave of price discovery—making it the name on every smart investor’s radar as the crypto rotation accelerates.

Exciting times in the digital asset space! The Bitcoin price has just achieved a significant milestone, pushing past the $108,000 mark. This latest move is capturing the attention of investors and analysts worldwide, signaling strong momentum in the market. According to real-time monitoring data, the BTC price is currently trading around $108,009.99 on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market, confirming the breakout above this key psychological and technical level. What’s Fueling This Latest Bitcoin Rally? When Bitcoin price makes such a decisive move, it’s rarely due to a single factor. A combination of elements typically contributes to a significant Bitcoin rally . Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone navigating the crypto market . Several potential catalysts are being discussed: Increased Institutional Interest: We continue to see growing adoption and investment from large financial institutions. Their entry often brings significant capital and lends credibility to the asset class, positively impacting the Bitcoin price . Positive Macroeconomic Signals: Shifting global economic conditions, inflation concerns, or changes in monetary policy can sometimes drive investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge. Technical Breakouts: Surpassing key resistance levels, like the recent $108,000 mark, can trigger automated trading systems and attract momentum traders, further propelling the price upwards. Supply Dynamics: Events like the recent Bitcoin halving reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, tightening supply over time if demand remains constant or increases. This fundamental scarcity is often cited as a long-term bullish factor for the BTC price . Improving Market Sentiment: Positive news cycles, favorable regulatory developments, or successful technological upgrades within the Bitcoin network can boost investor confidence and contribute to a positive Bitcoin rally . Analyzing the Current BTC Price Action: What Does $108,000 Mean? Breaking above $108,000 isn’t just a random number; it holds significance from a technical and psychological perspective. For traders and analysts, hitting or surpassing such a level can confirm upward trends and potentially set new targets. Let’s look at some aspects of this price movement: Historical Context: While $108,000 is a new high, understanding previous price cycles provides perspective. Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by periods of rapid growth followed by corrections. Each new peak builds on the foundation of prior cycles. Key Levels: Technical analysts watch specific price points. $108,000 likely acted as a short-term resistance level. Breaking it suggests the bulls are in control and could target higher levels next. Support would now likely be found at previous resistance levels. Volume Analysis: Often, a strong price move is accompanied by healthy trading volume. Increased volume during the breakout suggests strong conviction behind the move, rather than just a low-volume anomaly. Checking volume indicators provides further insight into the strength of the Bitcoin rally . Navigating the Crypto Market: Opportunities and Challenges A surging Bitcoin price naturally brings opportunities for those holding the asset. However, the crypto market is known for its volatility, and this rally is no exception. It’s important to consider both sides. Opportunities: Potential for Gains: For existing holders, a price increase translates directly into unrealized or realized profits. Increased Attention: Rallies attract new participants and capital to the market, potentially creating further upward pressure. Ecosystem Growth: A healthy BTC price often fuels development and innovation within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Sharp price increases can be followed by sudden pullbacks. The higher the price goes, the potentially larger the dollar value of price swings. Risk of FOMO: Fear Of Missing Out can lead to impulsive decisions, like buying at the peak without proper research. Market Corrections: Rallies are rarely linear. Expect pullbacks and corrections along the way. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? Actionable Insights In light of the recent Bitcoin rally and the BTC price reaching new highs, what steps should investors consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand why the price is moving. Look beyond the headlines at the underlying factors. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: The crypto market is high-risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Have a Plan: Whether you are buying, holding, or selling, have a strategy based on your financial goals and risk profile. Avoid making decisions based purely on emotion triggered by price movements. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying across different asset classes, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies. Stay Informed: Keep up with reliable Bitcoin news and market analysis. Understanding the landscape helps you make better decisions. What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin News and the Market? Predicting future price movements in the crypto market is challenging, but the current momentum is undeniable. The breakout above $108,000 is a significant technical event. The focus will now likely shift to whether Bitcoin can consolidate above this level and target the next potential resistance zones. Factors to watch include: Continued institutional flows. Global regulatory developments. Technological advancements in the Bitcoin network. Overall macroeconomic environment. Sentiment shifts in the broader market. Reliable Bitcoin news sources will be key to staying updated on these developments. Conclusion: A Powerful Move in the Bitcoin Price The surge in Bitcoin price past the $108,000 threshold marks a significant moment in the current market cycle. Fueled by a confluence of factors including potential institutional adoption, favorable technical conditions, and supply dynamics, this Bitcoin rally demonstrates the continued strength and volatility inherent in the crypto market . While the excitement is palpable, investors are reminded to approach the market with caution, conduct thorough research, and manage risk effectively. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be dynamic, and reaching this new price point is a testament to its evolving position in the global financial landscape.

Ethereum Net Flows Bounce Around Net flows refer to the difference in the number of coins entering or leaving crypto exchanges over a given period of time. If net flows are positive, then it means more ETH are flowing into crypto exchanges, which could point to sell-offs are investors take advantage of the price increase. However, if net flows are negative, then it suggests that more coins are leaving exchanges than those going in. Thus, it could point to buying pressure being higher than sell-offs. Related Reading: Analyst Says This Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Contender Could See ‘Impulsive Move’ Currently, Coinglass data shows that Ethereum net flows have been skewing toward negative for a while now. 24-hour net flow volumes show a -$182.86 million figure as more coins moved out of crypto exchanges during this time. This has also persisted with six out of the last seven days showing that net flows are negative. This means that there have been more ETH leaving crypto exchanges than those going into exchanges for selling. Thus, showing that buying remains the order of the day. In this 7-day period, net flows for Ethereum are sitting at -$140 million. However, going further back, on the 15-day timeframe, investors are still skewing more toward selling. This time period shows a positive $186.48 million in net flows as well, which would explain why the Ethereum price seems suppressed despite Bitcoin making new all-time highs.. The 30-day period is no different, showing even larger deposit trends. In total, Ethereum investors have moved more ETH into crypto exchanges, causing net flows to fall to rise to $483.54 million during this time. What Could Happen To Price If Net Flows Remain Negative If the Ethereum net flows continue to remain negative and even grow from here, then it would signal a rise in buying pressure. Once the buyers are able to outbid sellers, then the Ethereum price could begin to rally again.

This initial step, marked by the purchase of 21 BTC, positions DDC Enterprise among a growing list of companies exploring the integration of cryptocurrencies into their treasury strategies. What Does DDC Enterprise’s Initial BTC Purchase Signify? According to a recent Business Wire press release, DDC Enterprise completed its first BTC purchase as part of a larger, phased plan. While 21 BTC might seem like a modest start compared to some corporate giants, it represents a concrete commitment to their previously announced digital asset strategy. The firm isn’t stopping there; they intend to execute two more transactions in the immediate future to reach an initial target of 100 BTC. This initial phase is just the tip of the iceberg for DDC Enterprise’s vision. Earlier this month, the company laid out a much grander plan: accumulating up to 5,000 BTC over a 36-month horizon. They’ve set an aggressive near-term goal of acquiring 500 BTC within the first six months alone. This structured approach suggests a deliberate strategy, likely aimed at mitigating volatility risk through dollar-cost averaging or tactical buys based on market conditions. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: A Trend Gaining Momentum? DDC Enterprise’s decision is part of a broader, albeit still nascent, trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) have famously added significant amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Their motivations vary but often include: Treasury Reserve Asset: Treating Bitcoin as a store of value to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, offering a potential alternative to traditional cash holdings or low-yield bonds. Investment Potential: Speculating on Bitcoin’s price appreciation as a way to potentially boost company value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to their financial holdings. Strategic Alignment: Signalling innovation and embracing future financial technologies, potentially appealing to tech-savvy investors and customers. While DDC Enterprise operates in e-commerce, its move highlights that the interest in Bitcoin as a corporate asset isn’t limited to the tech or financial sectors. Their dual presence in China and the U.S. adds an interesting layer, given the differing regulatory landscapes surrounding cryptocurrencies in these regions. Decoding DDC Enterprise’s Ambitious Bitcoin Accumulation Plan The scale of DDC Enterprise’s proposed Bitcoin accumulation – up to 5,000 BTC – is significant for a company of its presumed size, especially compared to smaller public companies that have made similar moves. The phased approach (21 initial, 100 short-term, 500 within 6 months, 5,000 over 3 years) allows flexibility. It suggests they are managing risk and adapting to market price fluctuations rather than making one massive lump-sum purchase. This strategy could involve buying on dips, setting specific price targets, or allocating a fixed amount of capital at regular intervals. The transparency in announcing these targets also provides insight into their long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Is This Institutional Bitcoin Investment a Sign of Things to Come? The term Institutional Bitcoin often brings to mind large asset managers, hedge funds, or major corporations like MicroStrategy. However, DDC Enterprise’s entry suggests that this trend might be filtering down to a wider range of public companies, including those outside the traditional finance or tech spheres. This could be a leading indicator of increasing mainstream corporate interest. For the cryptocurrency market, more corporate buyers, regardless of size, contribute to demand and potentially reduce the circulating supply available on exchanges, which could have long-term price implications. It also adds legitimacy and visibility to Bitcoin as a viable asset class for treasury management. Potential Benefits for DDC Enterprise Asset Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s price increases, the value of DDC’s holdings could significantly boost their balance sheet. Inflation Hedge: Protect the purchasing power of their treasury against potential fiat currency inflation. Market Attention: The move could attract investors interested in companies with exposure to digital assets. Future Flexibility: Potentially leverage BTC for future strategic initiatives or even customer payment options down the line. Potential Challenges and Risks Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which could negatively impact DDC’s reported earnings and balance sheet value in the short term. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, particularly complex for a company operating in both China and the U.S. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require companies to report Bitcoin as an intangible asset, potentially leading to impairment losses if the price drops below the purchase cost. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Actionable Insights For investors, DDC Enterprise’s move serves as another data point indicating growing corporate interest in Bitcoin. It underscores the potential for continued demand from non-traditional sources. While this specific purchase is small, the stated long-term goal is ambitious and worth monitoring. For other companies, DDC’s strategy provides an example of how a phased approach can be used to enter the crypto space, potentially mitigating some of the risks associated with volatility. It prompts questions about the role of digital assets in modern corporate treasury management. Conclusion DDC Enterprise’s initial BTC purchase marks a significant step in its stated plan for substantial Bitcoin accumulation . As an e-commerce firm with international operations, their entry into the space highlights the expanding scope of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . While challenges remain, the strategic rationale behind such Institutional Bitcoin investments appears to be gaining traction beyond the usual suspects. The coming months will reveal how DDC’s phased approach unfolds and whether they meet their ambitious 500 BTC short-term target, providing further insight into the evolving relationship between traditional businesses and digital assets.

According to crypto researcher SMQKE, the document highlights the XRP Ledger as the infrastructure behind a significant $1 billion private equity tokenization initiative. Additionally, it points to Ripple’s strategic acquisitions of BitGo and Metaco as central to the custodial and compliance mechanisms underpinning this transformation in financial markets.

Among these developments, key management providers such as BitGo and Metaco—both acquired by Ripple —are recognized for offering specialized custodial services. These entities support the safekeeping of tokenized assets and assist financial institutions in meeting regulatory compliance requirements. The report positions these providers as essential contributors to the secure handling of digital assets and the broader enablement of tokenized financial ecosystems. Institutional Validation Through Tokenized Private Equity In a section focused on private equity, the report details an example of real-world application: Aurum Equity Partners’ launch of the world’s first combined private equity and debt tokenized fund, reportedly valued at $1 billion. This fund is hosted on the XRP Ledger and described in the report as an open-source and decentralized Layer-1 network.

The report also affirms the role of Ripple’s ecosystem, particularly through its acquisitions, in addressing key compliance and custody challenges—two long-standing hurdles in the path to widespread asset tokenization. Furthermore, the WEF outlines how these developments contribute to evolving financial architectures, including digital-native service providers and programmable financial instruments. These services, enhanced by composability and automation, are expected to reshape capital markets, streamline settlement processes, and enable greater financial product innovation.

Speaking on his show Mad Money , Jim pointed out that Trump’s trade orders are damaging both Nvidia and Apple, and he warned that investors are underestimating just how much the White House is involved in corporate decision-making. Jim told viewers, “We have to make our peace with it and, yes, add it to the risk factors of owning stocks here. It puts a premium on companies that Trump and his people play no role in.” He said fewer and fewer companies are being left alone. “The list of companies that are exempt from presidential meddling grows shorter by the day.” Trump hits Nvidia with China chip crackdown The White House recently restricted artificial intelligence chip exports to China, citing national security concerns. That decision wiped out a major piece of Nvidia’s business, cutting its China market share from 95% to 50%, according to the company’s CEO Jensen Huang. He called the move a “failure” and said it’s damaging US interests more than Chinese ones. Huang added that the rules are pushing China to make its own chips faster, which could end up backfiring on US companies in the long run. Jim supported that warning and said it would actually be safer to let China buy from Nvidia instead of helping it become independent in advanced chip production. The damage isn’t just theoretical. Nvidia’s future growth in China has already taken a direct hit. These AI chips are not just side products — they’re core to Nvidia’s long-term plans. Trump’s orders are now directly reshaping what US tech can and can’t sell, and to who. Apple targeted after India move fails to dodge tariffs Apple, meanwhile, tried to get ahead of the game. The company began moving production from China to India to avoid getting caught in the middle of the US-China trade battle. That strategy didn’t work. Trump announced on Friday that iPhones made outside the US will face 25% tariffs anyway. Jim criticized that move, saying it could make iPhones too expensive for regular American buyers. He also reminded the public that Apple has already done a lot to create jobs in the US, but that didn’t stop the penalties. “American-made iPhones will be too expensive for consumers,” Jim said bluntly. He made it clear that no amount of cooperation with the administration guarantees safety anymore. Trump is making the rules, rewriting them, and enforcing them how he wants. Companies trying to adapt are still getting punished. Jim said there’s precedent for the government stepping into business, like when Harry Truman took control of railroads in 1964 to avoid an economic crash, or when John F. Kennedy pressured steel companies in 1962 to cut price hikes. But in both of those cases, the government had clear national interests. “The president is simply telling companies what to do and where to go, and going after them hard if they don’t,” Jim said. He added, “No matter what, the president’s functioning as the chairman of the board, overruling company execs about business decisions. He’s not accepting their rationales. He wants it his way. In that sense, he’s inching step by step toward running what I call a command economy.” Trump’s tweets still shake markets ahead of earnings Jim also gave a heads-up about the week ahead on Wall Street. He said companies like Nvidia, Costco, Dell, and Salesforce are all dropping quarterly reports. Normally, that would be enough to drive market action. But this week, Jim said, that might not be the case. “We’re headed into a fickle week,” he said , warning that Trump’s tweets could overshadow everything. He said to expect fresh posts about “our trading partners, their intransigence, their negligence, their perfidiousness.” Basically, the president’s social media could have more impact than actual earnings data. Jim added that on Friday, markets ignored some negative Trump tweets because the ten-year Treasury yield held steady. That gave investors a reason to focus on other things. But he doesn’t think that will last long. “I hope that can continue next week,” he said, “but I’ll tell you something, I wouldn’t count on it.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Apple|Nvidia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-24 07:45:23

Ever wonder what’s driving the recent positive sentiment in the market? A significant factor is the performance of US spot Bitcoin ETF products. These investment vehicles have been making waves, and the latest data shows a promising trend that’s catching everyone’s attention. What’s Happening with Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows? On May 23rd, US spot Bitcoin ETF s collectively recorded a net inflow of $212.02 million. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the eighth consecutive day of positive net flows into these funds. This consistent buying pressure indicates growing investor confidence and demand for exposure to Bitcoin through regulated financial products. Let’s break down where these flows are going, based on the data shared by Trader T on X: ETF Ticker Issuer Daily Flow (May 23) IBIT BlackRock +$431.05 million HODL VanEck +$17.72 million GBTC Grayscale -$89.17 million ARKB ARK Invest / 21Shares -$73.89 million FBTC Fidelity -$73.69 million Other ETFs Various $0.00 million As you can see, BlackRock IBIT continues to dominate the inflow charts, attracting a substantial amount of capital. While some funds like Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC saw outflows on this particular day, the overall trend across the ecosystem remained strongly positive, driven by the significant inflows into other products, especially IBIT. Why Are These BTC ETF Inflows a Big Deal? The consistent positive BTC ETF inflows are crucial for several reasons: Institutional Adoption: ETFs are familiar investment vehicles for traditional finance players and large institutions. Sustained inflows signal increasing comfort and allocation of capital from these major players into the Bitcoin space. Market Liquidity and Price Support: When ETFs receive inflows, they typically purchase the underlying asset (Bitcoin) to back the new shares. This creates consistent buying pressure on the spot market, providing price support and potentially driving prices higher. Accessibility for Retail Investors: Spot Bitcoin ETFs make it easier for everyday investors to get exposure to Bitcoin through their standard brokerage accounts, without the complexities of managing private keys or dealing directly with crypto exchanges. This broadens the potential investor base. Validation of the Asset Class: The success and increasing adoption of these regulated products lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a recognized and investable asset class within the traditional financial system. The fact that we’ve seen eight straight days of gains in net flows suggests that the initial volatility around the launch and subsequent outflows from GBTC are stabilizing, and a new phase of accumulation might be underway. Exploring the Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance The performance of the Spot Bitcoin ETF market is closely watched by analysts and investors alike. The competition among issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK Invest, VanEck, and others is driving innovation and fee adjustments, ultimately benefiting investors. While BlackRock IBIT has consistently led the pack in terms of inflows since its launch, the performance of other funds also contributes to the overall market sentiment. Outflows from funds like GBTC, which was converted from a trust, were anticipated as investors sought lower fees or moved to newer, more efficient ETF structures. However, the key takeaway from the recent data is that the *total* inflows across all products are outweighing the outflows, leading to a net positive trend. This dynamic flow data provides valuable insight into investor behavior and market trends. It helps us understand where capital is moving and which products are currently favored by the market participants looking for a regulated way to invest in Bitcoin. The Role of Crypto ETF Products in the Ecosystem Beyond just Bitcoin, the broader Crypto ETF landscape is evolving. While spot Ethereum ETFs are currently awaiting regulatory decisions, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs sets a precedent and builds confidence in the potential for other crypto-based investment products to gain regulatory approval and investor traction in the future. The existence of regulated crypto investment vehicles like the spot Bitcoin ETF provides a bridge between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning digital asset space. They offer a familiar wrapper for a novel asset, making it more accessible and less intimidating for a wider range of investors. However, it’s important to remember that investing in any ETF, including a spot Bitcoin ETF, carries risks. The value of the ETF is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin, which is known for its volatility. Market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and other factors can impact performance. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. What Could Drive Future BTC ETF Inflows? Several factors could continue to fuel positive BTC ETF inflows : Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainty in traditional markets, inflation concerns, or changes in monetary policy could drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Performance: A rising Bitcoin price often attracts more investor interest and can lead to increased inflows into related investment products. Further Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions like pension funds, endowments, or wealth managers begin allocating small percentages of their portfolios to Bitcoin via ETFs, significant capital could flow in. Regulatory Clarity: Continued positive regulatory developments globally could increase confidence and reduce perceived risks for investors. The eight consecutive days of positive net flows are a strong indicator that these drivers might already be in play or gaining momentum. In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal? The recent streak of positive net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, totaling over $212 million on May 23rd and marking eight straight days of gains, is undoubtedly a significant development. Led by strong performance from funds like BlackRock IBIT , these flows highlight increasing institutional and retail interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated and accessible investment products. While individual fund flows fluctuate, the overall trend of positive net inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETF market provides a compelling signal of growing confidence and potential future growth for Bitcoin as an asset class.

According to reports, 37-year-old John Woeltz tortured the victim with a chainsaw in a Manhattan apartment before the unnamed victim escaped. In the reports made by the police, Woeltz was arrested by the authorities after the 28-year-old tourist broke out of the apartment and made a daring escape and located the nearest police station. The officers on duty also noted that the victim had blood and bruises all over his body. The police rushed to the luxurious Prince Street pad, which Woeltz has been allegedly renting for about $30,000 to $40,000 a month. They discovered photos that pointed out that the tourist had been tortured at the location by the crypto. The pictures showed the tourist being tied up with electric wires and tortured, including being bound to a chair with a gun pointed at his head, according to police sources. Crypto investor arrested in connection with kidnapping and assault According to sources, John Woeltz bound his victim with an electric cord, tased while his feet were in water, whipped with a pistol, and forced to take cocaine. Police sources also confirmed that the crypto investor even threatened to cut off the victim’s limbs with a chainsaw if he refused to cooperate with him. The kidnap and torture allegedly blew up from a dispute over cryptocurrencies , in which the suspect allegedly tried to extort millions of dollars from the man using scare tactics. The ordeal started on May 6, when the Italian tourist arrived in New York City from Italy. After his arrival, he made his way to see Woeltz, whom he had been dealing with in the past. But when he got to the luxurious apartment, Woeltz snatched him and bound him, the sources added. According to the police, the man suffered torture for days, with polaroids of the events taken. The police believed that those were taken to either be used to extort money from him or to be sent back to Italy to extort money from his family. Police mentioned that they found the picture in where they described as a torture chamber, with blood on the floor. Other torture equipments found at the scene include broken glass, night vision goggle, a bulletproof vest, and a gun. The victim has since been rushed to Bellevue Hospital for treatment while the cops have arrested Woeltz and he is expected to face charges related to assault. Police promise to apprehend every suspect linked to the crime Woeltz has since been charged on Friday night, with the authorities charging him with two counts of second-degree assault, first-degree kidnapping, first-degree unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a weapon. In addition, a second person, 24-year-old Beatrice Folchi, who lives in Manhattan has also been arrested and charged with first-degree kidnapping and first-degree unlawful imprisonment.

Meanwhile, two other people, who authorities believe were employed by Woeltz, are still waiting to be interviewed by the police. According to the police, the Italian tourist had a wound on his arm, which was believed to have been inflicted by the perpetrator through the Chainsaw. In addition, the victim was also tagged with an Apple AirTag in case he tried to escape from custody. He eventually made his escape on Friday, because he believed that was the day the suspect planned to kill him. According to an eyewitness at the scene, Woeltz was apprehended by the police in the apartment. He was clad in a robe and handcuffed on his way away from the luxurious apartment. “This is definitely the strangest thing I’ve seen in my time here,” he said. “Normally, this is a pretty quiet block.” Another vendor who lived nearby mentioned that he got a weird vibe from the crypto guys who just moved into the apartment. The police, on the other hand, have promised to apprehend other suspects linked to the crime, while ensuring that no other victims remain. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In 2025, one name is climbing the radar faster than most: MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Solana rallies to $183 and XRP investors look for fresh momentum ahead of exchange debuts and regulatory milestones, a growing number are accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE. Alongside it, Kaspa (KAS) is quietly building—but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum and positioning are sparking serious speculation: Could this be the next major crypto breakout? HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating 2025 Altcoin Picks MAGACOIN FINANCE launched into the 2025 cycle with undeniable force—selling out stage after stage and drawing comparisons to early SHIBA INU and even Bitcoin’s earliest days. With a listing target of $0.007 and investors already anticipating a major exchange debut, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now viewed as a realistic 25x–35x play by early entry analysts. Key reasons investors are watching MAGA closely: Political narrative that cuts through noise and captures community energy Early-stage positioning with strong tokenomics and limited supply Rapid stage progress—Stage 8 is nearly at capacity and filling fast Analyst forecasts pointing to 15,000%–18,500% upside potential Unlike most meme-themed tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is combining sentiment with structure—and that’s the exact combination that early Bitcoin investors once recognized before the market caught on. Solana’s Consistent Climb Draws Institutional Eyes Solana (SOL) is making headlines as it reclaims the $180–$183 range, a key inflection point that could set the stage for new all-time highs. After a strong rebound from April lows, Solana’s price has surged nearly 30% in recent weeks, fueled by robust DeFi activity, low fees, and growing institutional interest. Analysts now see SOL potentially reaching $213–$362 in 2025 if the bullish trend continues, with a clear path to $240–$260 later this year. While Solana isn’t early-stage anymore, it still offers strong performance for those wanting exposure to a leading smart contract platform. That said, some SOL holders are now rotating into smaller-cap options like MAGACOIN FINANCE to chase outsized returns ahead of listings. XRP Inches Toward Futures and Institutional Access XRP remains one of the most actively discussed altcoins—trading between $2.35 and $2.65 and benefiting from regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and renewed institutional interest. Analysts say a confirmed futures launch could drive XRP into the $2.85–$3.40 range rapidly, with long-term believers eyeing $5.50 or more as adoption grows. As XRP holders seek the next wave of upside, many are reallocating to pre-listing opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve hasn’t even begun. Kaspa: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Kaspa (KAS) is quietly building momentum, trading around $0.11 and up over 80% since the start of the year. With its unique GHOSTDAG protocol and expanding ecosystem, KAS is attracting developers and users alike. Analysts expect Kaspa to test resistance at $0.37 by year-end, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 15,000% winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion While Solana’s climb to $183 is impressive and XRP’s institutional momentum is building, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the bold, attention-grabbing pick that’s catching investor eyes across the market. With Stage 8 heating up, analyst targets pointing to 15,000%–18,500% potential, and momentum still building, MAGACOIN FINANCE may not just be another altcoin—it could be this cycle’s defining early entry moment. For investors seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar.

As institutional players increasingly look to enter the cryptocurrency space, the need for expert guidance is paramount. This is precisely the trend that New York-based financial services firm , Clear Street , is capitalizing on with a significant expansion of its digital assets capabilities. Why is Institutional Interest in Crypto Booming? Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies have moved from niche technology to a recognized, albeit volatile, asset class. This maturation, coupled with clearer regulatory frameworks emerging in some regions and the potential for diversification and high returns, has piqued the interest of large financial institutions. Potential for High Returns: Despite volatility, crypto markets have historically offered significant growth opportunities. Diversification: Digital assets can offer low correlation with traditional asset classes, providing portfolio diversification benefits. Technological Innovation: Institutions are exploring the underlying blockchain technology for efficiency gains in various financial processes. Client Demand: A growing number of institutional clients are demanding access to digital asset investments. However, navigating this new frontier presents unique challenges compared to traditional markets. Navigating the Complexities of Institutional Crypto Entering the institutional crypto space isn’t as simple as buying Bitcoin on a retail exchange. Institutions face hurdles such as: Regulatory uncertainty and compliance requirements. Security concerns related to custody and trading large volumes. Lack of familiar infrastructure and trading tools. The need for specialized knowledge in blockchain technology and crypto market dynamics. This is where experienced advisors become crucial. As John D’Agostini and Nicholas Hemmerly, co-heads of Clear Street ‘s Investment Banking division, highlighted, the convergence of traditional and emerging financial systems requires professionals who understand both worlds. Clear Street’s Strategic Expansion into Digital Assets Recognizing this growing need, Clear Street has announced a significant expansion of its Blockchain and Digital Assets Investment Banking Franchise. This move positions the firm to provide specialized advisory services tailored to the unique demands of institutions looking to engage with crypto. The expansion includes bringing in new talent with specific expertise in the crypto sector. Nakul Mehta and Collin Finnerty are joining Clear Street to lead the crypto segment of the expanded division. Their experience is expected to bolster the firm’s ability to offer sophisticated guidance in this rapidly evolving market. What Services Will Clear Street Offer in Crypto Investment Banking? The expanded division aims to provide a comprehensive suite of advisory services for companies operating in or looking to enter the digital assets space. These services are designed to help clients navigate the complexities and capitalize on opportunities within the market. Key services include: Public Listing Strategies: Guidance for crypto-native companies considering going public. Capital Raising: Assistance with securing funding through various mechanisms relevant to the digital asset ecosystem. Crypto Treasury Planning: Advisory on managing corporate treasury holdings in cryptocurrencies. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Support for M&A activities involving companies in the digital asset sector. Strategic Guidance: Providing expert advice for traditional companies looking to enter or integrate digital assets into their operations. This range of services underscores Clear Street ‘s commitment to becoming a key player in crypto investment banking , offering institutional-grade support for complex transactions and strategic decisions. The Future of Financial Services and Digital Assets The move by Clear Street is indicative of a broader trend: the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. As more financial services firm s build out their crypto capabilities, it signals a growing confidence in the long-term viability and importance of this asset class. This expansion is not just about offering new products; it’s about bridging the gap between the established financial world and the innovative, fast-paced crypto market. It provides institutions with the expertise and infrastructure they need to participate confidently and compliantly. Conclusion: Clear Street’s Strategic Position in Institutional Crypto Clear Street ‘s expansion of its digital assets division, bolstered by new hires with specialized expertise, is a strategic response to the undeniable growth in institutional crypto interest. By offering a robust suite of crypto investment banking services, the financial services firm is positioning itself as a crucial partner for institutions seeking to navigate the complexities and opportunities within the crypto market.

Some Pi supporters are calling it a step forward, saying it shows growth and rising adoption. After all, the Pi coin is still trading around $0.77, even after a slight drop in the price. While some people are celebrating the on-chain activity and others are doubting, and they don’t like what they see. Insider Selling Rumors Stir Worry Meanwhile, well-known blockchain investigator, Dr. Altcoin, pointed out that 1.4 million Pi coins were moved from a wallet that hadn’t been used before. Shortly after, those coins were sold on the Gate.io exchange. This wasn’t just a one-time thing. Several other big transfers have been spotted, and they all seem to lead back to wallets that might be connected to the Pi Core Team. Some reports even suggest these wallets could be holding over 90 billion tokens. That’s made many in the community question how much control the team has and whether the project is as fair as it claims to be. Pi Coin’s Price Struggle & Faces Unlocking Pressure In the meantime, Pi coin price has been trying to break past the $0.85 resistance zone, but it’s been stuck. Technical experts warn that if it can’t move higher soon, the price could drop further, possibly down to $0.66 or even $0.55, which we saw earlier this year. Adding to the worries, over 1.4 billion more Pi tokens are expected to enter the market in the next year. In May alone, 110 million tokens entered circulation.

Firms known for backing the next big thing are now looking at established, mature businesses – think traditional call centers, accounting firms, or professional services. This isn’t just about buying old companies; it’s about applying cutting-edge AI to fundamentally change how they operate, a strategy sometimes called AI-Infused roll-ups. This approach is gaining traction among prominent VCs, including the notable firm, Khosla Ventures . What is this New Venture Capital Strategy? Traditionally, venture capitalists seek out nascent companies with groundbreaking technology or business models aiming to disrupt markets or create entirely new ones. Their focus is high growth, often with significant risk. However, some VCs are now adopting a different approach, one that looks more like private equity but with a distinct tech twist. This Venture Capital Strategy involves: Acquiring existing, mature businesses that operate in traditional sectors. Implementing advanced artificial intelligence solutions to automate processes, improve efficiency, and enhance service delivery. ‘Rolling up’ multiple similar businesses under one umbrella to achieve scale and operational synergy. Firms like General Catalyst, Thrive Capital, and solo investor Elad Gil are already experimenting with this model. General Catalyst, in particular, is championing this as a new asset class, having already invested in several such ventures. One example is Long Lake, a company acquiring homeowners’ associations to streamline management using technology, which has secured significant funding. Khosla Ventures Explores AI Investing Adding significant weight to this trend, Khosla Ventures , a firm renowned for its early, often risky bets on foundational technologies with long development horizons, is now considering this PE-flavored approach. This move is particularly interesting given Khosla’s typical focus on unproven technologies rather than established businesses. Samir Kaul, a general partner at Khosla Ventures, confirmed the firm’s interest, stating they would ‘look at a few of these types of opportunities.’ This suggests a cautious but deliberate exploration into the world of AI Investing in mature companies. The Appeal of AI Business Optimization Why are VCs interested in applying AI to seemingly mundane businesses? The core idea is AI Business Optimization . Mature companies often have established customer bases, predictable revenue streams, and well-defined processes. However, they may lack the technological edge to scale efficiently or offer modern, automated services. By injecting AI into areas like customer service (call centers), data processing (accounting firms), or operational management (service firms), these businesses can: Serve more customers without proportionally increasing headcount. Reduce operational costs through automation. Improve service quality and consistency. Extract valuable insights from data using AI analytics. This transformation can unlock significant growth and profitability potential that wasn’t previously accessible. Potential Benefits for AI Startups Interestingly, this trend could create a beneficial ecosystem for the very AI startups that VCs are already funding. If a VC firm acquires and optimizes a network of, say, accounting firms using AI, their portfolio of AI startups specializing in financial automation or data analysis gains instant access to a large, established client base. Samir Kaul highlighted this point, noting that such access would be invaluable for new startups that often struggle with long enterprise sales cycles and customer acquisition, especially in the rapidly evolving AI market. Navigating Private Equity Roll-ups with a VC Lens While this strategy borrows elements from traditional Private Equity Roll-ups , the emphasis on deep technological transformation via AI sets it apart. PE firms often focus on financial engineering, operational efficiencies, and market consolidation. This new VC approach adds a layer of disruptive technology implementation as a primary driver of value creation. Khosla Ventures is approaching this cautiously. Kaul emphasized the importance of protecting their strong return track record and being responsible stewards of their investors’ money. While the acquired businesses might be less likely to lose money compared to early-stage startups, ensuring they can deliver venture-like returns after AI implementation is the key challenge. Khosla’s Measured Approach Khosla Ventures plans to ‘dabble’ initially, undertaking a few deals to assess the performance of these AI-infused roll-ups. If the early results are promising and demonstrate strong returns, they might consider scaling the strategy, potentially even raising a dedicated investment vehicle for it. However, Kaul indicated that Khosla would likely partner with a firm experienced in acquisitions and operational roll-ups rather than building that expertise in-house. ‘We wouldn’t do it alone, we don’t have that expertise,’ he noted. Conclusion: A New Frontier in VC Investing? The exploration by firms like Khosla Ventures into AI-Infused roll-ups represents an exciting evolution in the world of venture capital. By combining the stability of mature businesses with the transformative power of AI, VCs are opening up new avenues for value creation and providing valuable opportunities for their portfolio of AI startups. While still in its early stages, this strategy of AI Investing in traditional sectors could redefine how VCs approach growth and disruption in the years to come, proving that innovation isn’t always about building from scratch, but sometimes about intelligently optimizing what already exists.

This milestone is not just a psychological boost; it is igniting serious confidence among both retail investors and institutional players. From macro traders to long-term holders, this rally is being seen less as a spike and more as a structural shift. Many are now watching to see whether Bitcoin’s behavior will begin to mirror more mature assets like equities or gold, which often continue climbing after setting new records. In short, this is not a moment investors are ignoring—it is one they are leaning into. Bitcoin’s Strongest Accumulation Wave Since January Signals a Bullish Continuation Fresh insights from Glassnode reveal that Bitcoin has entered its most aggressive accumulation phase since the start of the year. Their Accumulation Trend Score, now at its peak of 1.0, indicates that every major wallet cohort—from small holders to whales—is in buy mode. This is not passive interest. This is coordinated conviction. What makes this surge different is that it is happening after months of distribution. Between January and April, large holders were consistently reducing exposure. Now, that pattern has reversed. Whales holding over 10,000 BTC led the charge in early May, triggering a domino effect where smaller investors followed with confidence. Accumulation is now visible across nearly the entire wallet spectrum. Even $BTC holders have flipped from distribution to light accumulation (~0.55), joining larger cohorts like 100–1K (~0.9) and 1K–10K #BTC (~0.85). Only 1–10 #BTC remain net sellers. pic.twitter.com/C4C9ZLlwNs — glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 Backing this sentiment is the options market. June calls for 200,000 dollar and even 300,000 dollar BTC are gaining traction, with 620 million and 420 million in notional value, respectively. This pricing behavior reflects trader expectations for a continued breakout, not a cooldown. In contrast to previous post all-time high pullbacks, Bitcoin’s current setup resembles a maturing asset and may be entering a long-term rally. When accumulation and conviction align this tightly, the case for strategic buying becomes difficult to ignore. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Bitcoin Makes a New High SUBBD The reacceleration of Bitcoin accumulation by all wallet cohorts is more than just bullish—it’s a reminder that participants are favoring systems that emphasize control and long-term ownership. That context makes SUBBD especially relevant. It does not aim to mimic the creator platforms of Web2, but instead rebuilds the system from the ground up using decentralized architecture. SUBBD gives creators something they rarely have—leverage. Every content piece, stream, and interaction becomes monetizable through $SUBBD, a token that powers gated content, direct tipping, fan-tiered rewards, and on-chain subscriptions. But it’s not just another “social token.” With the platform’s smart contract-based payout mechanism, creators and fans maintain verifiable, non-revocable access terms. There are no hidden fees, delayed withdrawals, or banned accounts. In the same way that Bitcoin gave users custody over their wealth, SUBBD is allowing creators to take custody over their business models. The platform allows voting rights for token holders, meaning community interests are prioritized without reliance on advertisers or opaque platform rules. For investors, this transforms $SUBBD into more than a niche asset—it becomes a claim on a decentralized creator ecosystem, still in its early adoption curve. Top creators like ClayBro have already dubbed it one of the best crypto presales in the space right now. As institutional capital watches Bitcoin break new highs with record accumulation levels, it is also seeking projects that reflect real transition stories. SUBBD fits into that thesis—not by promising exponential hype, but by solving a problem that affects millions of creators right now, with a framework that rewards participation at every level. Best Wallet Token As Bitcoin’s price hits unprecedented highs and accumulation hits full throttle across all wallet sizes, the narrative around custody is back in focus. The logic is simple—if institutions are accumulating, self-management tools need to keep up. Best Wallet steps into this moment not just as another crypto wallet, but as a fully integrated platform built for user engagement and asset control. At the center is the BEST token . While most wallet tokens sit idle, BEST actually opens access to native staking, presale listings, and in-app decentralized trading. With more than 60 chains supported, it caters to investors who refuse to silo their assets. But the core value lies in its role as a toolkit: from AI-driven portfolio insights to a presale aggregator and DEX interface, everything is usable without ever leaving the wallet environment. Security-wise, the wallet is non-custodial, with all access keys controlled by the user. It even integrates iGaming rewards for users who engage with the broader Best Wallet ecosystem. This matters because investors are no longer looking for passive storage—they want participation with upside, especially as early-cycle momentum builds. Best Wallet reflects that shift. As Bitcoin’s renewed trust drives a fresh round of market interest, tools that let users directly access and act on that momentum—without hopping between apps—gain added relevance. BEST is not a bet on speculation; it is a play on infrastructure that supports participation at the exact moment participation is peaking again. Solaxy The uptick in Bitcoin buying is now systemic, spanning every wallet cohort. This points to renewed institutional and long-term confidence—confidence that tends to flow toward infrastructure, not just hype cycles. Solaxy enters that conversation as a Layer 2 protocol that doesn't need loud narratives because its value lies in execution. Rather than picking a side in the Ethereum versus Solana discussion, Solaxy integrates both. It operates as a cross-compatible Layer 2 that brings faster transactions and reduced gas fees across ecosystems, with validator node support designed for scale. The SOLX token is more than just a native asset—it anchors the network through staking, liquidity support, and protocol incentives. Early participants benefit from a transparent APY model, with tracking tools built directly into the interface for real-time visibility. What separates Solaxy is its quiet alignment with what institutions now seek: modular scalability, cross-chain operability, and risk-averse design. Solaxy has not plastered itself across crypto Twitter or released viral memes—but its architecture is attracting early adopters who are watching this accumulation-driven cycle not as traders, but as builders. This signal is all green! 🟢 🪐39M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/c3dAiUkTsm — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 22, 2025 The project has already raised upwards of $39 million and is currently looking to go live in less than 25 days. Solaxy’s focus on predictable, transparent performance metrics mirrors the sort of sober infrastructure plays that capital typically rotates into once Bitcoin shows sustained strength. With $SOLX still in its early phases and utility baked into the protocol’s staking, validation, and reward layers, the setup looks less like a trend and more like a quietly maturing bet on blockchain’s connective tissue. BTC Bull With Bitcoin breaking into new highs and entering its strongest accumulation phase since January, it’s worth watching how this bullish confidence filters into adjacent narratives. BTC Bull is one such project—built not to replicate Bitcoin’s technical model, but to echo its spirit: decentralization, long-term conviction, and community-first ideology. BTC Bull wraps itself in the philosophy that made Bitcoin what it is today: distributed power and shared ownership. Rather than offering a grand utility promise, it offers participation—staking, holding, and supporting a token designed to reward involvement, not just early speculation. Essentially, every holder will be able to win airdrops and enjoy benefits from burns as Bitcoin reaches new price milestones. The project runs on a fixed supply model and maintains transparency through public audits and an open roadmap that prioritizes organic growth over marketing flash. The community element isn’t an afterthought—it’s the core. The more BTC Bull gets staked or held, the more its incentives scale, aligning directly with what Bitcoin’s accumulation wave is currently proving: that conviction compounds value. In a market increasingly driven by utility but underpinned by sentiment, BTC Bull becomes relevant not because it tries to be a better Bitcoin, but because it works alongside it. As retail and mid-size investors look to align with this moment’s momentum, BTC Bull reflects a parallel track—one that’s early enough to matter, yet mature enough to carry weight beyond hype. MIND of Pepe Amid Bitcoin’s all-cohort accumulation frenzy, a surprising pattern is emerging: tokens that seem like memes are gaining real traction—not because of irony, but because of how they engage with modern investor behavior. MIND of Pepe is at the center of that pattern, offering something rare: a self-aware memecoin with actual utility built around real-time market engagement. What sets MIND of Pepe apart isn’t just its AI layer, but how that AI interacts with holders. It’s not passive data or abstract analytics—the token gives access to an on-chain sentiment engine. This AI agent observes social media, tracks viral trends, and synthesizes what the broader investor base is thinking in real time. Token holders don’t just speculate—they observe crowd behavior as it unfolds. As Bitcoin options traders begin pricing in 200,000 and 300,000 dollar strike prices, retail investors are hunting for leverage in less saturated zones. MIND of Pepe responds by offering a reflection of crowd psychology, not just price charts. For a market that’s becoming more reflexive—where what people believe ends up influencing outcomes—this token functions like a mirror with predictive capability. There’s no illusion here about replacing Bitcoin. MIND of Pepe works because Bitcoin is working—its accumulation drives attention, and attention fuels sentiment. In that loop, MIND of Pepe becomes a filter for interpreting what people might do next. It’s a speculative play, yes—but one informed by a level of feedback most tokens do not even attempt to provide. Conclusion As Bitcoin pushes into record territory and accumulation activity intensifies across every wallet tier, the broader crypto market is beginning to reflect a similar sense of renewed purpose. In conditions like these, tokens with clearly defined roles, early-stage traction, and thoughtful design often find themselves well-positioned to benefit from the overflow. While nothing in crypto is without risk, the projects discussed above present concepts that align with the current mood of the market—and for that reason, they may be worth keeping on the radar.

Although many might seem far-fetched, at least for the current market prices, ChatGPT noted that a double-digit price tag is not out of the question. $29, $55? Although XRP has been the object of countless massive price predictions, even before its explosive rally at the end of last year, we will focus on a more summarized version from this article , where the first two targets were set at $29 and $55. The AI chatbot described the more modest one as “ambitious yet conceivable,” since it came from more renowned industry experts, such as Bitwise Research’s Oscar Ramos, who believes the asset can surge to such an impressive price tag if certain conditions are met. At first, he highlighted the significance of a potential approval of a spot Ripple ETF in the States. Although the US SEC has delayed making a decision on a few listings, the chances for such products to hit the US markets this year are above 75%, according to Polymarket. XRP’s price can also benefit if the token continues to gain traction in global financial systems and sees “widespread institutional adoption.” The $55 target was categorized as “highly optimistic” by ChatGPT. It explained that such a price per token would require a market cap above $3 trillion, given the current available supply, which would put XRP above BTC. “Such a surge would necessitate unprecedented adoption and utility, making this target highly optimistic under current market conditions,” – added the AI tool. What About $100? The last price target set by analysts was an entry triple-digit price. ChatGPT kindly dismissed it by putting it in the “speculative and unlikely” category. After all, such a price tag would put XRP’s market cap above those of Apple and Nvidia… combined. “While some proponents argue that XRP could capture a significant share of global financial transactions, including SWIFT replacements and derivatives settlements, these scenarios are highly theoretical and face numerous regulatory and practical challenges,” – concluded the AI chatbot. Although the predictions above might sound a bit (or a lot) far-fetched at the moment, this doesn’t mean that XRP lacks any market potential this year. In fact, you can check what ChatGPT thinks about the possibility of a $10 price tag for Ripple’s cross-border token – here .

Mistral AI , the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is quickly gaining recognition as a formidable OpenAI competitor . Valued at $6 billion just a year after its creation, Mistral AI represents Europe’s strongest bid yet to compete at the frontier of AI technology. While its global market share is still growing, its rapid ascent, fueled by substantial AI funding and strategic partnerships, signals a serious challenge to established players. What Exactly is Mistral AI and Its Mission? Founded in 2023, Mistral AI was established with a clear mission: to put frontier AI in the hands of everyone. This ambition, while not a direct critique of OpenAI, highlights the company’s advocacy for openness in AI development. Unlike some proprietary approaches, Mistral AI aims to provide powerful AI models that are accessible and adaptable. Key offerings from Mistral AI include: Le Chat: An AI chat assistant available on web, iOS, and Android, positioned as an alternative to ChatGPT. It saw rapid adoption, reaching 1 million mobile downloads quickly after launch, even topping download charts in France. Foundational Models: A suite of large language models catering to various needs, including: Mistral Large 2 (successor to Mistral Large) Pixtral Large (multimodal model) Mistral Medium 3 (optimized for efficiency, coding, and STEM tasks) Devstral (coding model, openly available under Apache 2.0 license) Codestral (earlier coding model with commercial restrictions) Les Ministraux (models optimized for edge devices) Mistral Saba (Arabic language model) Mistral OCR: An optical character recognition API launched in March 2025 to facilitate text extraction from PDFs for AI processing. This range of products showcases Mistral AI’s focus on developing diverse generative AI capabilities, from conversational agents to specialized tools for developers and businesses. Who Are the Minds Behind Mistral AI? Mistral AI’s leadership team brings significant experience from major U.S. tech companies with strong European presence. The three co-founders have backgrounds in AI research at Google DeepMind and Meta: Arthur Mensch: CEO, formerly at Google DeepMind. Timothée Lacroix: CTO, formerly at Meta. Guillaume Lample: Chief Scientist Officer, formerly at Meta. Their combined expertise in cutting-edge AI research forms a strong foundation for the company’s technical ambitions. The co-founding advisers also include notable figures from the French tech scene, adding strategic depth. Is Mistral AI Truly Open Source? Mistral AI adopts a nuanced approach to openness. While some of its premier models are not open-weighted for commercial use, it actively promotes open access for others. Several research and developer-focused models, like Devstral and Mistral NeMo (developed with Nvidia), are released under permissive licenses like Apache 2.0, allowing for unrestricted commercial use. This mixed model balances the need to monetize advanced research with a commitment to fostering open AI development, distinguishing it in the competitive landscape of AI models . How Does Mistral AI Generate Revenue? Despite offering free tiers and open models, Mistral AI has a clear path to monetization. Revenue streams include: Le Chat Paid Tiers: The Pro plan, introduced in February 2025, offers premium features for a monthly subscription. API Access: Monetizing premier models through usage-based pricing APIs for businesses. Model Licensing: Enterprises can license Mistral AI’s advanced models directly. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with large companies and government entities provide significant revenue opportunities. While reports suggest revenue is still in the eight-digit range, the company’s valuation indicates strong investor confidence in its future earning potential, particularly as it expands its enterprise offerings and continues to develop advanced generative AI capabilities. What Key Partnerships Fuel Mistral AI’s Growth? Mistral AI has secured impressive partnerships that bolster its distribution and market reach: Microsoft: A strategic partnership in 2024 included distributing Mistral AI models via Azure and a €15 million investment. Agence France-Presse (AFP): A deal in January 2025 allowing Le Chat to query AFP’s extensive text archive. Government & Industry: Partnerships with France’s army, job agency, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis. AI Campus Initiative: Participating in a joint venture to create an AI Campus in Paris with MGX, NVIDIA, and Bpifrance. These collaborations highlight Mistral AI’s ability to integrate its technology across various sectors and leverage global infrastructure like Microsoft Azure to compete more effectively with an OpenAI competitor . How Much AI Funding Has Mistral AI Raised? Mistral AI’s funding journey has been rapid and substantial, showcasing significant investor confidence in its potential to challenge dominant players and develop cutting-edge AI models . June 2023: Record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, valuing the company at $260 million. December 2023: Series A of €385 million ($415 million) led by Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at $2 billion. February 2024: Microsoft’s $16.3 million convertible investment presented as a Series A extension. June 2024: €600 million mix of equity and debt ($640 million) led by General Catalyst, reaching a $6 billion valuation. As of February 2025, Mistral AI had raised around €1 billion (approximately $1.04 billion), positioning it as one of the most well-funded AI startups globally and a serious contender in the race for AI funding . What’s Next for Mistral AI? An IPO? According to CEO Arthur Mensch, an Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the plan for Mistral AI. This indicates the company is focused on scaling its operations and revenue significantly, rather than pursuing an acquisition. An IPO would allow Mistral AI to remain independent, a goal aligned with its self-definition as a leading independent AI lab, and provide the necessary capital for continued growth and development of its generative AI technology. Conclusion: A European AI Force to Watch Mistral AI has quickly established itself as a major player in the global AI scene and a credible OpenAI competitor . Its combination of experienced founders, significant AI funding , a diverse portfolio of AI models , and strategic partnerships positions it for continued growth. While challenges remain in scaling revenue to match its valuation and navigating the complex AI landscape, Mistral AI’s rapid progress and commitment to its vision make it a key company to watch in the future of generative AI .

Investors are eyeing these tokens for their unique strengths and potential for significant returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, raising $9,200,000 with over 505 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders. DOGE is stabilizing after a recent dip, while XRP shows promise after breaking key resistance. Dogecoin’s Resilient Bounce Dogecoin (DOGE) is regaining its footing after a 9.7% drop from $0.237 to $0.214. Buyers are stepping in at the $0.215 support level, creating a “panic zone retest” that holds firm. The token is navigating a falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal for potential upward movement. Technical indicators show DOGE trading between $0.212 and $0.225, with resistance near $0.219. Investors watching crypto prices today see DOGE as a speculative bet. If support holds, the next big cryptocurrency rally could lift DOGE to $0.244. Failure to break resistance might see prices slide to $0.20. For those asking what crypto to invest in, DOGE offers short-term potential but lacks the utility of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Its community-driven hype drives crypto news, but long-term stability remains uncertain. Investors should monitor crypto charts closely, as DOGE’s path hinges on breaking the $0.220 resistance in 2025. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing significant attention in its phase 5 presale, priced at $0.03. This marks a 200% increase from the opening phase’s $0.01, reflecting strong investor demand. Phase 6 is approaching, bringing a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return for current buyers. Analysts predict a post-launch price of $2.50, offering a potential 8,233% ROI. The project has raised $9,200,000, with over 505 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders, signaling robust confidence in this new crypto coin. This mechanism positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto for long-term investors seeking passive income. The team is also developing a leaderboard dashboard, rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance’s Security Focus The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is prioritizing trust by pursuing a smart contract audit with Certik. An announcement will follow on social platforms once finalized. This step underscores the project’s commitment to transparency, vital in today’s crypto market. Unlike DOGE’s volatility or XRP’s regulatory hurdles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structured DeFi ecosystem. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, MUTM’s utility and presale success make it a standout choice. The buy-and-distribute system reduces sell pressure, supporting price stability. Investors asking which crypto to buy today for long-term gains find Mutuum Finance (MUTM) compelling. Its current $0.03 price offers a rare entry point before the $0.06 launch. As crypto prices rise, MUTM’s structured approach positions it as a top cryptocurrency in 2025, outpacing less utility-focused tokens like DOGE. XRP’s Bullish Momentum XRP is trading at $2.35, up 0.25% in 24 hours, with trading volume surging 31.95% to $3.77 billion. A breakout from a falling wedge pattern signals potential for a rally to $3.87. After a 26% jump from $1.85, XRP is consolidating between $2.30 and $2.35. Technical indicators, like the hourly MACD and RSI above 50, support bullish momentum. Resistance at $2.45 looms, but a break could push XRP toward $2.55. Crypto predictions for 2025 range from $2.10 to $5.16, though regulatory risks temper its appeal compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Despite a 7.69% weekly dip, XRP’s volume surge reflects growing interest. The $2.30 support level holds firm, suggesting potential for the next crypto to hit $1 or beyond. Investors tracking crypto news today see XRP as a solid but less innovative option. For those exploring what’s the best crypto to buy, XRP offers short-term gains but trails MUTM’s long-term potential. Crypto Market’s Bright Horizon The crypto market is poised for growth, with altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), DOGE, and XRP leading the charge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its DeFi utility and presale success, offering a 100% ROI at launch and potential for 8,233% gains at $2.50. DOGE’s meme-driven volatility and XRP’s technical breakout provide short-term opportunities, but MUTM’s structured model promises lasting value. Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in should act now, as phase 5 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a prime entry point.

Unilabs (UNIL) , a new altcoin, is slowly gaining momentum and may challenge Ethereum’s dominance in 2025. Powered by advanced AI and innovative DeFi investment strategies, Unilabs offers smart, automated portfolio management. This offering, coupled with other rewards and perks, could make Unilabs one of the best DeFi projects in the market. Binance Coin (BNB) Targets $700 Resistance The Binance Coin price has been retesting the $680 level in the past few days but bulls have held their ground. The cryptocurrency is currently starting an uptrend on the weekly chart. Its value has soared by 5.3% in this timeframe. Going forward, the Binance Coin price could climb to $700 based on technical analysis. Technical indicators such as the RSI show that buying pressure is high, supporting more upside. Rose Premium Signals in a recent post on X said the Binance Coin price chart was strong. The expert predicts the Binance Coin price is about to enter discovery. If this happens, the BNB price could climb to $743 and $789 in the next few weeks. Another expert, BATMAN said the Binance Coin price has formed a bullish flag and is waiting for a breakout. The analyst expects the Binance Coin price to soar to $700 when this happens. Analyst Forecasts Uptrend For Ethereum (ETH) Rose Premium Signals tweeted recently that the Ethereum price has broken from a descending trendline. It has also turned the former resistance zone at $2,000-$2,200 into a strong support. As long as the Ethereum price stays above this breakout zone, Rose Premium Signals says its value might climb higher. The analyst believes the Ethereum price is gearing up for the next leg up. They posted three potential targets which are $3,063, $3,566, and $4,201. At the moment, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Ethereum price has risen on the weekly timeframe by 4.5%. Meanwhile, the head of research at OnchainHQ, Leon Waidmann revealed that the Ethereum network has witnessed massive growth. The number of weekly active addresses has been above 15 million. Also, over 564k addresses are active on multiple chains. This ecosystem growth could push the Ethereum price to new levels in the months ahead. Unilabs (UNIL) Presale, A Channel To AI-Powered Funds Investment As AI reshapes investment strategies globally, Unilabs (UNIL) offers a unique chance for investors to join its live presale, with tokens priced at just $0.0051. This early opportunity promises access to AI-managed portfolios designed to optimize returns with little effort.

Unilabs is different from hype driven tokens like DOGE as it is focused on real utility and growth. The presale is currently open, offering referral perks, tiered staking rewards, and a share in 30% of platform fees redistributed to token holders. Early participation is crucial to maximize benefits. With DeFi’s market cap surpassing $120 billion, even a small market share could push Unilabs to a valuation of $250 million or more. Those who join the ongoing blockchain ICO, which has raised over $930k, stand to see up to 15x returns when Unilabs’ market cap increases. With AI-powered funds, smart trading algorithms, and rewarding referral programs, Unilabs represents a rare chance for investors to get ahead in the DeFi space. Why Unilabs Could Be the Next Best Crypto To Hold As the Binance Coin price approaches $700, Unilabs is gaining momentum with its cutting-edge technology and strong crypto ICO.

Now, a new contender is quietly gaining traction in crypto circles, priced at just $0.007 and catching the attention of seasoned speculators who’ve seen this story before. This emerging token, Lightchain AI, is in the middle of a record-breaking presale that has already raised $19.3 million, hinting at powerful investor momentum. Unlike many past meme coins, this crypto brings strong utility backed by real-world AI integration, giving it a foundation beyond hype. With early backers now positioning themselves aggressively, some are whispering that the path from $1,000 to $1,000,000 might just be unfolding again—this time, led by a project built to bridge AI, decentralization, and next-gen blockchain infrastructure. Can This New Altcoin Deliver the Next Life-Changing Return in Crypto This innovative structure makes it distinct from run-of-the-mill altcoins and a genuine contender for life-changing gains. Decentralized AI infrastructure aren’t just riding hype with their Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, it’s already attracting high-level developer interest and building the backbone of tomorrow’s tech landscape. Unlike speculative tokens such as DOGE or SHIB which promise no real utility, Lightchain AI gives reward tokens to nodes for performing meaningful AI computation such as training or inference, creating a powerful layer of utility that is insulated for tomorrow’s technological demands. Blockchain and artificial intelligence are beginning to integrate, and I can imagine exponential returns for people investing early on such projects that solve computational issues in the real world. Nothing is guaranteed in crypto, of course, but with a $0.007 price tag and technical foundation to build on, Lightchain AI has a good chance of being a rocket ship for investors who want to get involved ahead of mass adoption (and prior to their next two-phase major exchange listings). Why Early Backers Are Comparing This Project to SHIB and DOGE's Early Days What makes Lightchain AI echo the early days of SHIB and DOGE isn't just its low entry point—it’s the strong grassroots buzz and bold vision behind the token. Backers are drawn to how Lightchain AI leverages a community-first approach combined with future-focused technology. Like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming a conversation piece across social platforms and presale groups. However, where meme coins relied heavily on virality, Lightchain AI adds real-world purpose. Its roadmap shows structured phases—from PoI and AIVM development to cross-industry adoption—with every milestone creating new reasons for believers to hold long-term. This combination of emotional excitement and tech-backed potential is exactly what drove SHIB and DOGE to 10,000%+ returns—and Lightchain AI may now be writing the next chapter. Is Now the Right Time to Take a Shot at the Next Big Crypto Upswing With Lightchain AI in stage 15 of its presale and already raising $19.3 million, the timing for early entry could be ideal for those watching for the next big crypto shift. The platform’s low token price and fast-growing attention give it the kind of presale velocity that has historically preceded explosive growth. Additionally, its smart economic design—with dynamic gas fees, deflationary mechanics, and staking incentives—adds fuel to the long-term sustainability of the token. As other coins face market fatigue, Lightchain AI’s momentum is only just starting to accelerate. Investors looking to take calculated risks are now weighing whether this is the window before major institutional eyes take notice. Given the rapid uptake, technical innovation, and untapped growth curve, jumping in now may offer the kind of upswing most traders only dream of.

On May 21, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 21, a bold initiative proposing the establishment of a state-held Bitcoin reserve. This move, backed by a bipartisan majority, is now heading to the state Senate. If passed, Texas would become the first U.S. state to hold digital assets as part of its treasury strategy. With regulatory clarity improving and macroeconomic signals favoring long-term crypto reserves, the broader market is taking notice. The bill’s momentum isn’t isolated either—it reflects a growing sentiment across the financial system where digital assets are becoming part of serious monetary infrastructure. This news has added a spark to the market, further energizing community members exploring early-stage blockchain projects that may benefit from the next adoption cycle. Among those on the radar, Qubetics is standing out—not because of buzz, but because of solid fundamentals and a presale structure that mirrors the strategic clarity policymakers are now bringing into crypto. As regulatory pressure starts shifting toward strategic integration rather than resistance, the space is rewarding projects that prioritize interoperability, decentralization, and utility. Qubetics ($TICS) fits this narrative, addressing real-world gaps through its multi-chain aggregation and utility-driven wallet infrastructure. While it builds momentum with a well-structured crypto presale, other contenders like SUI and Cosmos are also showing significant traction in the news. SUI is witnessing explosive growth in DeFi metrics and DEX trading volumes, while Cosmos is advancing cross-chain utility by enabling wrapped Bitcoin and integrating bridges to enhance blockchain communication. In such a climate, where regulators are giving digital assets a closer look and utility is becoming the leading narrative, the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 may not be about just promises—it’s about delivery. And Qubetics is beginning to look like one of the few that’s checking every box. Qubetics Wallet: Real Utility for Real-World Transactions Qubetics isn’t building abstract concepts—it’s offering a multi-chain non-custodial wallet that simplifies blockchain usability across the board. Its wallet connects multiple chains in one place, eliminating the constant need to jump between different apps or interfaces. For individuals juggling multiple token holdings, this creates a seamless experience. Whether it’s someone earning from freelance contracts in Ethereum and Solana or a digital artist getting paid in stablecoins across chains, the Qubetics wallet allows instant, secure, and self-custodial access to all assets in one secure dashboard. More importantly, the Qubetics wallet supports advanced features tailored for both retail users and enterprise scenarios. Businesses can integrate Qubetics to manage multi-chain token payments, while users can generate virtual cards for digital shopping, supported by integrated debit compatibility with systems like Visa, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. That means a user can use TICS tokens at physical or online retailers, with Qubetics’ instant stablecoin conversion protecting against volatility. This application not only enhances the digital finance experience—it bridges a major utility gap between crypto assets and fiat usability. These features show exactly why Qubetics is gaining recognition as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 . Qubetics Presale: Where Value and Strategy Align in the Best Crypto Presale to Buy for 2025 The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 35, offering $TICS at a price of $0.2785. In just a few weeks, it has surpassed $17.2 million in funds raised, with over 513 million tokens sold to date and more than 26,800 holders onboarded. Each stage lasts exactly seven days, concluding every Sunday at midnight, followed by a guaranteed 10% price increase. This systematic structure is attracting early buyers who are seeking predictability and potential upside. The Qubetics presale not only reflects strong participation metrics but also offers compelling ROI projections. Based on the current pricing, if $TICS reaches just $1 after listing, the return stands at 258.95%. At $5, the return hits 1,694.74%, while a $6 target results in 2,053.68%. Should $TICS climb to $10 after the mainnet launch, ROI jumps to 3,489.47%, and at $15, early buyers could see a remarkable 5,284.21% return. For instance, a $5,000 purchase now would yield 17,950 tokens. At a $10 valuation post-mainnet, that would translate into $179,500. These figures offer a clear value proposition for those looking to engage early in what’s being called one of the best crypto presale offerings currently available. SUI’s Price Targets Look Strong as DEX Metrics Hit $48 Billion The decentralized finance activity on the SUI network has picked up dramatically in recent weeks. Total DEX volume crossed $48.4 billion in the first half of 2025, surpassing major competitors like Avalanche and Polygon. The spike in activity, particularly daily volumes hitting above $400 million, is being attributed to rising engagement across SUI-native platforms like Suilend and NAVI. These protocols are driving liquidity and demonstrating that the SUI ecosystem is rapidly maturing beyond its early testnet narrative. What makes this more significant is the timing. SUI recently unlocked 88 million tokens, a move that would normally trigger price volatility. Yet, the token held its ground, suggesting that current market participants are anticipating higher valuations. Technicals now show a “golden cross” pattern and a bullish MACD crossover, both considered strong buy signals. Analysts are targeting a potential $5 breakout level, based on sustained DeFi traction and minimal unlock-related drawdowns. This signals growing market faith in SUI’s resilience and network strength. Cosmos Price Action Heats Up After 14% Jump and Wrapped Bitcoin Integration Cosmos is showing renewed strength following the integration of wrapped Bitcoin and a new cross-chain bridge. These enhancements are crucial as they elevate Cosmos’ interoperability functions, which have long been a core selling point of the project. With the ability to now transfer Bitcoin into the Cosmos ecosystem and use it within DeFi protocols, the user base and use cases are both expanding quickly. Price-wise, Cosmos (ATOM) is seeing strong momentum, rising by over 14% and currently trading above $5.04. Community sentiment is bullish, with over 38% of users expressing confidence in Cosmos’ direction. The launch of new bridge infrastructure also adds to Cosmos’ ability to act as a unifying hub in the broader blockchain space. With this new architecture, Cosmos is preparing for a next phase where multi-chain integration becomes the norm, not the exception. These changes signal that Cosmos is not just adapting to trends but setting the pace for what comes next in cross-chain utility. Institutional Tailwinds Could Push Qubetics, SUI, and Cosmos to New Highs The growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies—now underscored by institutional policy shifts like Texas’ proposed Bitcoin reserve—is likely to have broad ripple effects across serious crypto projects. For Qubetics, the current presale offers a unique advantage. Unlike listed tokens, its structured model—with fixed price increases every week—insulates it from short-term volatility and creates strategic entry points for participants. This mechanism gives early adopters a degree of predictability not commonly found in active markets. SUI and Cosmos also stand to benefit from these macroeconomic trends. Institutional involvement brings not only capital but also credibility, infrastructure, and clearer regulation, which are all needed to push DeFi and interoperability projects into mainstream application. For SUI, rising DeFi volume may attract more professional liquidity providers. Cosmos, with its new bridge and Bitcoin integration, now appeals to developers and users who prioritize network flexibility. These three projects, each from different angles, are all aligned to capture value from an industry moving toward structured, use-case-driven growth. Conclusion: Strategic Moves in a Changing Crypto Era The signs are clear—crypto is no longer a speculative space alone; it’s becoming infrastructure. Qubetics, SUI, and Cosmos are adapting to that shift in distinct ways. Qubetics is solving the interoperability puzzle with real-world wallet features and an on-ramp for early participation through what many are calling the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. SUI is proving its DeFi potential with record-breaking DEX volumes, while Cosmos is expanding cross-chain utility by linking Bitcoin into its ecosystem. The key takeaway? These aren’t hype-driven tokens—they’re ecosystems evolving with real application. As the market matures and states like Texas move toward crypto integration, the opportunity to join this best crypto presale might just be the smartest strategic move of 2025.

The news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, suggests a potential twist in the ongoing dialogue surrounding US EU tariffs . This development could signal a new phase in transatlantic trade relations, offering a glimpse into potential future economic strategies. What’s Behind the Latest Trump Tariffs Proposal? According to the report, Donald Trump indicated a willingness to consider delaying the imposition of tariffs on goods from the European Union. However, this consideration comes with a significant condition: European companies would need to begin moving their operations, or at least a portion of them, to the United States. This statement aligns with Trump’s previous ‘America First’ economic stance, prioritizing domestic manufacturing and job creation. Understanding Trump tariffs requires looking back at his previous term. Tariffs were frequently employed as a negotiation tool, aiming to pressure trading partners into revised agreements deemed more favorable to the U.S. economy. The potential delay on EU tariffs, therefore, appears to be less about softening his stance on trade balances and more about leveraging market access as an incentive for foreign direct investment and company relocation to American soil. This approach serves multiple potential objectives: Boosting Domestic Industry: Encouraging European manufacturers to set up shop in the U.S. could lead to the creation of new jobs and stimulate economic activity within the country. Strengthening Supply Chains: Bringing production onshore can help reduce reliance on overseas supply chains, a vulnerability highlighted by recent global disruptions. Gaining Leverage in Trade Talks: The offer itself becomes a bargaining chip in broader trade negotiations with the EU. Attracting Capital: Relocating companies bring investment in infrastructure, technology, and human capital. Understanding Company Relocation as a Strategic Tool The concept of company relocation as a response to trade policy is not new, but explicitly linking tariff relief to it is a direct application of economic pressure and incentive. For a European company, moving operations to the U.S. is a monumental decision involving substantial costs and logistical challenges. However, avoiding potentially steep US EU tariffs could provide a significant cost advantage when selling into the American market compared to competitors who continue to export from the EU. Consider the factors a European business would weigh: Benefits of Relocating to the US (Potential): Avoidance of potential future Trump tariffs on goods exported from the EU. Direct access to the large U.S. consumer market. Potential access to U.S. federal or state-level economic incentives (tax breaks, grants, infrastructure support). Closer proximity to U.S. suppliers or customers. Challenges of Relocating to the US: Significant upfront investment in facilities, equipment, and hiring. Navigating a new regulatory and legal environment. Logistical complexities of moving supply chains. Potential resistance from existing workforce in the EU. Risk of policy changes in the future that could negate the benefits. This offer essentially turns tariff policy into a catalyst for investment decisions. It’s a high-stakes proposition for businesses caught between potential export barriers and the significant undertaking of establishing a U.S. presence. The Stakes in US-EU Trade Negotiations Trump’s suggestion comes within the broader context of ongoing, and sometimes tense, trade negotiations between the United States and the European Union. While some tariff disputes were paused or addressed under the Biden administration, underlying disagreements on issues like digital services taxes, agricultural subsidies, and specific industry protections remain. This proposal could significantly alter the dynamics of these talks. The EU is a major trading partner for the U.S., and vice versa. Any widespread application of US EU tariffs would have substantial economic consequences for both sides, potentially disrupting established trade flows and supply chains built over decades. The EU’s reaction to such an explicit condition linking tariff relief to company relocation would be crucial. They might view it as an aggressive tactic aimed at undermining European economies by luring away businesses and jobs. This could lead to countermeasures or complicate other areas of transatlantic cooperation. Key Areas of US-EU Trade Friction: Issue US Position (Often) EU Position (Often) Digital Taxes Against taxes seen as targeting US tech firms. Seeking fair taxation of large digital companies. Agricultural Subsidies Criticizes EU subsidies as protectionist. Defends Common Agricultural Policy. Specific Tariffs (Steel, Aluminum, etc.) Uses national security justification. Views as protectionist, seeks removal or compensation. Regulatory Divergence Seeks alignment or mutual recognition. Maintains sovereign regulatory standards. This potential tariff-for-relocation offer adds a new, potentially contentious, element to this already complex relationship. Weighing the Economic Incentives for European Businesses Beyond simply avoiding Trump tariffs , European companies considering a move would be looking closely at the full package of economic incentives available in the United States. These incentives can vary significantly by state and locality, often including: State and local tax abatements or credits. Grants for job creation or training. Subsidized land or infrastructure development. Energy cost advantages (in some regions). Access to a large and diverse labor market. The attractiveness of these economic incentives must be weighed against the costs of disrupting existing operations, building new facilities, and potentially managing a bicultural workforce. For smaller or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the hurdle of such a significant relocation might be insurmountable, regardless of tariff threats or incentives. However, for large multinational corporations with significant U.S. market exposure, the long-term benefit of avoiding tariffs and establishing a strong U.S. manufacturing or operational base could outweigh the initial costs. This could be particularly true for industries that have historically faced, or are vulnerable to, high tariffs, such as automotive, machinery, or certain consumer goods. Navigating the Future of US EU Tariffs and Global Trade The suggestion of linking US EU tariffs directly to company relocation highlights a potential future direction for U.S. trade policy, focusing heavily on bringing manufacturing and jobs back to the country through a mix of protectionist threats and relocation incentives. This approach could have profound implications for global supply chains, international investment flows, and the future of trade negotiations . For investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space who monitor macroeconomic signals, shifts in major trade relationships like that between the US and EU are important. Increased trade tensions or significant supply chain restructuring can introduce volatility and uncertainty into traditional markets, which can sometimes correlate with or indirectly influence sentiment in digital asset markets. Actionable Insights: Businesses: Evaluate the potential impact of renewed tariff threats on your supply chain and market access. Explore the feasibility and potential benefits/costs of establishing a U.S. presence if your business heavily relies on exporting to the U.S. market. Investors: Pay attention to developments in US-EU trade relations as a potential factor influencing global economic stability and market sentiment. Understand that trade policy can impact corporate earnings, supply chain resilience, and inflation, all of which can have broader market effects. Policy Watchers: Monitor the discourse around trade policy and relocation incentives, as these could become central themes in future international economic relations. While this is currently a suggestion attributed to Donald Trump, it serves as a reminder that trade policy remains a powerful and potentially disruptive tool. The response from European leaders and businesses, as well as future political developments in the U.S., will determine whether this idea gains traction or remains a hypothetical negotiating position. Summary: Donald Trump’s reported suggestion to potentially delay US EU tariffs contingent on European company relocation to the U.S. represents a direct application of economic pressure and incentive within the realm of international trade negotiations . This approach, rooted in the ‘America First’ philosophy, aims to leverage market access to attract foreign investment and create domestic jobs through explicit economic incentives . While offering potential benefits like tariff avoidance and direct market access for relocating companies, the challenges are significant, including high costs and logistical complexities. The proposal underscores the ongoing tensions in US-EU trade relations and highlights how trade policy can be used as a strategic tool with potentially far-reaching impacts on global supply chains and economic geography. Monitoring these developments is crucial for businesses and investors navigating the interconnected global economy.

Dogecoin News: Wall Street Rumors, ETF Hopes, and a $5 Target DOGE is currently trading around $0.24, with crypto analysts seeing many bullish signals that might propel DOGE to a $5 price point. DOGE technical analysis identifies some important factors that support this bullish outlook. The monthly chart analysis indicates that the Dogecoin price may replicate the same technical setting that preceded its historic 2021 spike. The 20-month and 50-month moving averages are providing strong support, as they did during the previous bull run. The monthly Relative Strength Index remains very low, but there is a possibility for an upward climb. In prior cycles, the RSI hovered around 80 before the peak price arrived. In another Dogecoin news regarding the potential DOGE ETF, things have been a little confusing. The SEC has postponed its judgment until June, however, this does not mean that it will not be approved. The SEC filings plainly state that the delay is due to extra analysis. The Polymarket chances for the DOGE ETF clearance by the end of July are merely 15%, down 7% in the previous 24 hours. However, the odds in 2025 are 63%, indicating that investor trust is stronger in the latter months of 2025. Additionally, in the Dogecoin news, Bloomberg experts have made similar predictions. In a recent X post, James Seyffart stated that there is no conspiracy behind the DOGE ETF approval delays and that it is simply the SEC’s usual procedure.

The G20’s roadmap for cross-border payment improvements includes significant progress on cost reduction, speed, transparency, and access. According to research shared by crypto analyst SMQKE, the FPC document includes explicit support for accelerating ISO 20022 adoption and inter-industry collaboration with blockchain-focused companies such as Ripple and Stellar. A confidential 2025 report from the U.S. Faster Payments Council stated that for U.S. domestic payment providers to align with the G20’s cross-border payment objectives, they should accelerate the adoption of ISO 20022 and promote “inter-industry collaboration” with fintech… pic.twitter.com/TjRssXPptA — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 23, 2025 ISO 20022 Adoption and Real-Time Interoperability The document emphasizes that adopting the ISO 20022 messaging standard is central to creating more interoperable and structured global payment systems. The report states that ISO 20022 facilitates richer and more consistent messaging across financial institutions, which is key to supporting seamless cross-border payments. It further recommends that U.S. domestic providers align with SWIFT’s migration timelines to ISO 20022, ensuring compatibility with new infrastructure and legacy systems during the transition phase. In addition to ISO 20022 adoption, the report highlights the importance of interlinking domestic real-time payment systems with international networks. This is seen as essential for enabling the kind of 24/7, instant cross-border functionality envisioned in the G20 roadmap. Partnerships with organizations like The Clearing House (RTP) and the Federal Reserve’s FedNow service are cited as part of this broader objective to improve global payment system compatibility. Role of Blockchain and Digital Assets in Cost Reduction The FPC also identifies improved interoperability as a key enabler of more efficient cross-border transactions. It recommends the development and adoption of standardized APIs and more consistent infrastructure to facilitate better integration between domestic and international payment rails. A section of the report focused on reducing costs and increasing efficiency specifically mentions the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) as a mechanism to minimize intermediary costs. It references the G20 target of reducing the average cost of cross-border transactions to below 1%. These technologies, according to the FPC, are instrumental in eliminating unnecessary layers within the payment chain, thereby reducing delays and fees. Collaboration with Ripple and Stellar Highlighted In a portion of the report labeled “Promote Inter-Industry Collaboration,” the Council urges alignment with global financial technology initiatives. It recommends partnerships with innovative fintechs and startups working on cross-border solutions, specifically Ripple and Stellar. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These firms are widely associated with using XRP and XLM to facilitate digital asset transfers across jurisdictions. The mention of these companies in a confidential policy document indicates a growing institutional openness to incorporating blockchain-based settlement layers into traditional payment infrastructures. The FPC also stresses the need for transparency in pricing and settlement, calling for improvements through real-time tracking of cross-border payment statuses. This includes providing customers with visibility into fees, exchange rates, and delivery timelines. The report encourages using solutions like SWIFT GPI and blockchain analytics to enhance transparency. Regulatory Alignment and Financial Inclusion Another priority area covered in the document is financial inclusion. The FPC recommends expanding services to smaller financial institutions and non-bank providers to ensure that underserved communities can benefit from advancements in the cross-border payment ecosystem. Compliance and risk management are also addressed. The report points to the importance of adhering to global standards such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s AML guidelines and the European Union’s GDPR framework for data protection. Regulatory alignment is necessary to counter fraud, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities in global payments. Finally, the FPC underlines the importance of stakeholder engagement and education to drive adoption. It argues that the successful deployment of modernized cross-border systems will depend on clear communication of the benefits to end users and industry participants. Crypto researcher SMQKE, who publicized the findings, noted the explicit reference to Ripple and Stellar in connection with the G20 targets. This acknowledgment in a strategic document from a recognized U.S. payments authority lends further weight to the potential role of digital assets such as XRP and XLM in future cross-border frameworks.

According to OpenAI , the new CUA model showed stronger performance relative to the industry, achieving SOTA on OSWorld and WebArena. It also showed stronger relative performance to the previous version, both in established benchmarks and human preference evaluations. OpenAI replaces the GPT‑4o-based model with a version based on o3 OpenAI hints at a big upgrade for ChatGPT Operator Agent pic.twitter.com/iGPQp9butD — SabatAge (@sabatage) May 22, 2025 OpenAI replaced the existing GPT‑4o-based model for Operator with a version based on OpenAI o3, although the API version will remain based on 4o. The AI firm also claimed that the o3 Operator uses the same multi-layered safety approach used for the 4o version. However, compared with other models in the o3 family, the o3 Operator was fine-tuned with additional safety data for computer use, including safety datasets designed to teach the model decision boundaries on confirmations and refusals. OpenAI released a technical report showing the o3 Operator’s performance on specific safety evaluations. Compared to the GPT-4o Operator model, the o3 Operator was less likely to refuse to perform “illicit” activities and search for sensitive personal data and less susceptible to a form of AI attack known as “prompt injection.” “o3 Operator uses the same multi-layered approach to safety that we used for the 4o version of Operator…Although the o3 Operator inherits o3’s coding capabilities, it does not have native access to a coding environment or Terminal.” – OpenAI The AI firm also disclosed that the new o3-based model went through standard safety evaluations, and Operator continued to be available as a research preview to ChatGPT Pro users globally. However, this upgraded model was only available in Operator in ChatGPT. Knoop suspects running OpenAI’s o3 model might be costlier than expected Last week, the Arc Prize Foundation, which maintains and administers ARC-AGI, updated its approximate computing costs for o3. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, cost around $3K to solve a single ARC-AGI problem. However, the Foundation now believes that the cost could be 10x higher than previously estimated, possibly around $30K per task. Also, while OpenAI has yet to price o3 or release it fully even, one of the co-founders of the Arc Prize Foundation, Mike Knoop, believes the o1-pro model pricing is a reasonable proxy and a closer comparison of the true cost of o3. He, however, added that o3 would continue to be labeled as a preview on the leaderboard to reflect the uncertainty until official pricing was announced. According to the Arc Prize Foundation, a high price for o3 high would not be out of the question, given the amount of computing resources the model reportedly uses. o3 high used 172x more computing than o3 low, the lowest-computing configuration of o3, to tackle ARC-AGI. Rumors have been flying since early March about the pricey plans OpenAI was considering introducing for enterprise customers. The information reported that the company may charge up to $20K per month for specialized AI “agents,” like software developer agents. However, while some argued that even OpenAI’s priciest models would cost well under what a typical human contractor or staffer would command, AI researcher Toby Ord pointed out that the models may not be as efficient. For instance, o3 high needed 1,024 attempts at each task in ARC-AGI to achieve its best score. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Investors are now asking if the Litecoin price could keep up with the hype of memes and utility-backed tokens like Unilabs . It is an AI-powered DeFi project that offers automated yield and access to early-stage trends. However, what are experts predicting about the Litecoin price this season? Let’s find out. Unilabs: The Next Big Thing in the DeFi Space? While the crypto market chases meme coin madness like Dogwifhat and debates whether the Litecoin price can break resistance, a far more advanced project is quietly gaining traction: Unilabs . This project already has over $30 million in AUM (Assets Under Management), which shows the investors’ strong interest. Another feature is the AI Market Pulse, which uses AI to scan thousands of on-chain and off-chain signals to detect market trends and price movements. This way, users can get into surging projects, like the LTC token, early and maximize their profit. Unilabs also provides a Meme coin Identification Tool, which uses AI to find the next meme projects that could moon like Dogwifhat once did. With it, investors can get into meme coins early without guesswork or relying on fake pumps. If someone is new to crypto, they can use the AI portfolio management tool to optimize their portfolio in real-time without actually looking at the charts all the time. It could potentially become the best way to passively grow a portfolio while protecting against downturns. Moreover, there’s also a Stablecoin Savings Account for investors who want risk free DeFi returns. This AI protocol is currently in stage 2 of presale and has already accumulated over $850,000 in no time. Each UNIL is worth $0.005 only which is the lowest entry point for smart investors. Litecoin Price Prediction: Can LTC Break $200 in 2026? At the time of writing, the Litecoin price is hovering around the $100 mark with a slight increase. On the monthly chart, the LTC token is impressively up by over 20% due to the overall market sentiment. Source: CoinMarketCap As for Litecoin’s price prediction, Changelly predicts it could reach a high of $208 in 2026. However, CoinCodex only predicts the LTC token to reach a maximum of $105 next year which shows varying analysis. The current technical analysis of the LTC token shows a strong buying sentiment based on moving averages. Rumors of a potential LTC ETF approval have also stirred the market but the SEC is delaying the proposal. Another reason that the Litecoin price is surging in the last 30 days is because of the adoption of a Litecoin Treasury Strategy by Luxxfolio. But, based on current market interest and not much positive movement in Litecoin’s price, most of the funds are moving into Unilabs. This is because of the unique AI features that it’s bringing to the DeFi space. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Meme Coin That’s More Than a Joke In a market that is flooded with meme coins, Dogwifhat has managed to carve out a unique space of its own. In the last 30 days, this token has surged by around 150% which shows the increasing interest in meme coins. The trading volume for Dogwifhat has also increased by over 120% to almost $1 billion in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Currently, Dogwifhat is trading between $1.00 and $1.20. In the last few days it has seen strong liquidity support and consistent interest from retail traders. However, in the long run meme coins might end up losing their value due to lack of utility. That’s why Unilabs is taking over the market with tools that could predict market trends using AI. Conclusion As the market debates whether the LTC token can reclaim its past glory or if meme coins like Dogwifhat can sustain their explosive momentum, a quieter contender, Unilabs is making serious waves beneath the surface. With its real-time AI tools, automated DeFi portfolios, Early Access Scoring System, and passive income strategies, Unilabs is building the infrastructure of tomorrow’s crypto investing. However, the public presale is selling out quickly which means it could be the last chance of getting UNIL tokens for the lowest price.

For businesses and investors operating in this space, one need stands out above all others: regulatory clarity. Recent comments from a key figure within the potential future administration signal a potential shift towards addressing this critical need. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly stated that companies dealing with digital assets deserve this much-needed clarity, indicating a focus area for a potential Trump administration. Why is Regulatory Clarity Crucial for Digital Assets? The current landscape for crypto regulation in the United States is often described as fragmented. Multiple agencies, including the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, and state regulators, have overlapping or sometimes conflicting jurisdictions and interpretations regarding various types of digital assets and related activities. This creates uncertainty for businesses, making it difficult to innovate, raise capital, and operate confidently within legal boundaries. Here are some key reasons why regulatory clarity crypto is essential: Fosters Innovation: Clear rules allow companies to build and develop new products and services without constant fear of falling afoul of undefined regulations. Protects Consumers and Investors: Well-defined regulations can establish standards for disclosure, security, and market integrity, reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation. Attracts Institutional Investment: Large financial institutions often require regulatory certainty before committing significant capital to a new asset class. Ensures Market Stability: Clear rules help create a more predictable and stable market environment. Promotes Global Competitiveness: Countries with clear regulatory frameworks can attract digital asset businesses and talent, positioning themselves as leaders in the space. What Has the US Treasury Secretary Said About Digital Assets? According to reports from Watcher Guru via X, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent conveyed a direct message regarding the administration’s perspective on the digital asset industry. His statement highlighted the belief that companies operating with digital assets are entitled to a clear understanding of the rules governing their activities. More significantly, he indicated that providing this clarity is a goal that the potential Trump administration is actively working towards. This statement, coming from the head of the US Treasury , is significant. The Treasury Department plays a crucial role in financial policy, including aspects of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), which are highly relevant to the digital asset space. While other agencies focus on securities or commodities aspects, the Treasury’s perspective on financial stability, illicit finance, and broader economic implications is vital for a comprehensive regulatory approach. Understanding the Challenges in Crypto Regulation Regulating digital assets is complex due to their inherent characteristics: Decentralization: Many digital assets operate on decentralized networks without a central authority, making traditional regulatory enforcement challenging. Novelty and Speed of Innovation: The technology and use cases evolve rapidly, often outpacing regulators’ ability to understand and classify them. Global Nature: Digital asset markets operate across borders, requiring international cooperation for effective regulation. Asset Classification: Determining whether a digital asset is a security, commodity, or something else entirely is a persistent legal and regulatory hurdle. Interconnectedness: The digital asset ecosystem includes various participants, from exchanges and custodians to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and stablecoin issuers, each presenting unique regulatory considerations. Navigating these complexities requires a thoughtful and informed approach, something that proponents of the industry hope the focus on regulatory clarity crypto will address. What Might a Potential Trump Administration’s Crypto Policy US Look Like? While Secretary Bessent’s comments provide a clear signal of intent regarding regulatory clarity, the specifics of a potential Trump administration’s crypto policy US are still developing. However, based on past statements and general approaches, several possibilities emerge: There might be an emphasis on: Streamlining Agency Efforts: Potentially seeking better coordination or clearer delineation of roles among regulatory bodies to reduce overlap and confusion. Focus on Innovation vs. Regulation Balance: Aiming for regulations that protect investors and national security interests without stifling technological advancement. Engagement with the Industry: Acknowledging the importance of dialogue with digital asset businesses to understand the technology and its implications. Addressing Illicit Finance: Continuing to prioritize efforts to prevent the use of digital assets for money laundering and other illegal activities, potentially through enhanced AML/CFT requirements. Potential Legislative Action: While administrative actions can provide some clarity, comprehensive and lasting crypto regulation may ultimately require new legislation from Congress. An administration focused on clarity might work with lawmakers to achieve this. The call for regulatory clarity crypto suggests a recognition that the current uncertainty is detrimental and that a more defined framework is necessary for the industry to mature responsibly. How Can Businesses and Investors Prepare? Even without full clarity, businesses and investors in the digital asset space can take steps to navigate the current environment and prepare for potential future changes in crypto policy US : Stay Informed: Continuously monitor regulatory developments, statements from officials like those at the US Treasury , and proposed legislation. Seek Legal Counsel: Engage with legal experts specializing in digital assets to understand current regulations and potential compliance requirements. Implement Robust Compliance Programs: Build strong internal policies and procedures, especially regarding AML/CFT, cybersecurity, and customer protection. Engage with Policymakers: Participate in industry associations and provide feedback to regulators and legislators to help shape informed policy. Understand the Technology: A deep understanding of the specific digital assets and protocols involved is crucial for assessing regulatory risks. The pursuit of regulatory clarity crypto is a positive sign, but navigating the path to achieving it requires proactive effort from all stakeholders. Conclusion: A Step Towards Stability for Digital Assets? U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments underscore a significant recognition within potential future leadership: the digital asset industry requires and deserves regulatory clarity. The current patchwork of rules creates hurdles for innovation and widespread adoption. By highlighting that the Trump administration is working towards providing this clarity, the statement offers a glimpse into a potential future where the framework for crypto regulation in the U.S. becomes more defined and predictable. Achieving comprehensive regulatory clarity crypto is not a simple task, given the technical complexity and global nature of digital assets . However, a focused effort from key bodies like the US Treasury is a necessary step. Businesses, investors, and policymakers must continue to engage constructively to build a regulatory environment that protects consumers and national interests while allowing the digital asset space to thrive responsibly under a clearer crypto policy US .

With this development expected to spark an overall market rally, the top three DeFi tokens to watch are the Solana coin, the Cardano coin and Unilabs (UNL) . Layer-1s like SOL and ADA are expected to ride the upcoming bullish wave and potentially surpass previous highs. UNIL, a novel AI-backed DeFi asset manager—the world’s first—shouldn’t be overlooked either. Currently in presale and with plenty of room to run as a low-cap coin, it could outperform top altcoins with large market caps. Unilabs (UNIL): A Top DeFi Crypto to Buy Alongside SOL and ADA Unilabs (UNL) isn’t a surprising addition to this list, especially from its fundamentals, growing community and upside potential. Backed by artificial intelligence, it will be the world’s first asset manager for cryptocurrencies. Amid impending adoption, the ongoing presale has surpassed $910,000 in early funding, highlighting its vibrant community. Described by industry experts as the future of finance, the Unilabs AI-powered Launchpad will employ real-time market data and machine learning to uncover emerging projects with standout fundamentals. It has over $30 million in AUM (assets under management) across AI Fund, BTC Fund, Mining Fund and RWA Fund, offering early-stage access to blockchain disruptors. Currently in presale—the second stage—the UNIL token has been listed among the best AI coins to invest in by analysts. As an emerging cryptocurrency, it has a higher upside than large-cap tokens like the Solana coin and Cardano coin, making it more attractive. Moreover, considering the historical outperformance of ICO investors, Unilabs might follow in the footsteps of successful ICOs like ETH and BNB. Solana (SOL): New Peak Soon? The Solana coin hit $180 this week, putting its monthly gain at 20%. With a bigger leap expected given current market conditions—BTC’s new ATHs—it is among the best DeFi tokens to invest in. In addition, moving averages like the 20-VWMA and 9-HMA give a strong buy signal, positioning SOL among the top altcoins to watch. Also contributing to its bullish outlook are the bold Solana price predictions making the rounds within the crypto community. BagsalotBTC, a leading crypto expert on X, expects a continuous uptrend toward $200 and $220. Ynk0x, another popular figure on Crypto Twitter (CT), sees the Solana price hitting $500 before the end of Q2. While ADA’s significant market cap may temper its upside potential, low-caps like Unilabs, an AI token with a small market size, present opportunities for more considerable growth. Cardano (ADA): Bulls Target $1 Next The Cardano coin reclaimed $0.8, hovering above the 10-day EMA and SMA. After flipping this level, next on the bulls’ radars might be a retest of $1—one of the top DeFi coins to buy this cycle. With BTC registering new peaks, the Cardano coin surpassing 2021’s all-time high of $3.10 isn’t out of the question. Down over 70% from the previous high, it is in an attractive buy zone—a good crypto to buy. Moreover, Michael Heckert sees the Cardano coin price soaring past $2 soon. Meanwhile, D_realMrBanana predicts a jump toward $20, which many believe to be an ambitious Cardano price prediction. While it has significant upside, UNIL attracting just a fraction of ADA’s market size will see early investors outperform, making it a better bet for substantial gains. Unilabs (UNIL): A Great Bet Alongside Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) Unilabs is a fundamentally strong emerging cryptocurrency positioned at the intersection of AI, DeFi and TradFi. Not only that. It has plenty of room to run as an emerging crypto—a better bet than large-cap tokens like the Solana coin and the Cardano coin. Aiming to capture a large share of traditional hedge fund capital, it is a new DeFi project to watch.

The latest bizarre showdown involves controversial US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and Grok AI , the chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI. While Grok has faced scrutiny for generating problematic content, Greene has leveled a surprising accusation against the AI chatbot : claiming it is too ‘left-leaning’. This peculiar clash highlights the complex and often contradictory narratives surrounding artificial intelligence in the public sphere, making it a noteworthy piece of AI news . Grok AI’s Recent Controversies Before diving into the political spat, it’s important to understand why Grok AI was already under fire. The AI chatbot , part of Elon Musk AI initiatives, recently experienced what was described as a ‘bug’. This technical glitch allegedly caused Grok to produce outputs that aligned with harmful conspiracy theories, even when the user prompts were unrelated to such topics. One notable instance involved Grok referencing the ‘white genocide’ conspiracy theory when discussing unrelated subjects concerning South Africa. Another concerning output saw Grok express skepticism regarding the historical death toll of the Holocaust, which was later attributed to a ‘programming error’ by the developers. These incidents raised significant questions about the safety, bias, and reliability of the Grok AI model, prompting concerns from users and AI safety advocates alike. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Unexpected Critique Given Grok AI ‘s recent outputs that arguably lean towards problematic or right-wing conspiracy narratives (like ‘white genocide’), one might expect criticism from the opposite end of the political spectrum. However, Marjorie Taylor Greene took a different approach. Despite Grok’s ‘buggy’ behavior that touched upon sensitive and often politicized topics, Greene declared that the AI chatbot was biased in the opposite direction. Writing on X (formerly Twitter), Greene stated, “Grok is left leaning and continues to spread fake news and propaganda.” This assertion came as a surprise to many observing Grok’s recent performance and the general perception of platforms associated with Elon Musk AI efforts. The Screenshot That Sparked the Claim To support her claim, Marjorie Taylor Greene shared a screenshot of a conversation with Grok AI . In this interaction, Grok provided a description of Greene, acknowledging her Christian faith and belief in Jesus. However, it also included nuanced points that seemingly troubled the Congresswoman. The AI chatbot noted that some Christians are reportedly ‘troubled’ by Greene’s support for conspiracy theories, specifically mentioning QAnon. Furthermore, Grok added, “Critics, including religious leaders, argue her actions contradict Christian values of love and unity, citing her defense of January 6 and divisive rhetoric.” It was this specific output, which included critical perspectives on her public actions, that Greene presented as evidence of Grok’s alleged ‘left-leaning’ bias. Analyzing the Disconnect: Grok AI vs. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Perception The core of this bizarre conflict lies in the apparent disconnect between Grok AI ‘s problematic, conspiracy-adjacent outputs and Marjorie Taylor Greene ‘s interpretation of it as ‘left-leaning’. One perspective is that Greene’s definition of ‘left-leaning’ AI simply means any AI that presents information or perspectives that are critical of her or align with mainstream criticisms she faces. The fact that Grok accurately reported on criticisms from religious leaders and others regarding her actions (like supporting QAnon or defending January 6) seems to be what triggered her reaction, rather than a comprehensive analysis of Grok’s overall biases or its recent ‘buggy’ outputs. This situation highlights the challenges in evaluating AI chatbot bias. Is bias defined by generating harmful conspiracy theories, or by presenting critical viewpoints on political figures? The incident underscores how users, especially those with strong political viewpoints, may interpret AI outputs through a highly subjective lens, focusing on how the AI reflects on them personally rather than its objective accuracy or potential for broader harm. Adding to the chaotic backdrop, X was reportedly experiencing significant outages around the same time, potentially linked to data center issues. While unrelated to the AI’s behavior, it contributed to a day of technical difficulties on the platform central to this particular piece of AI news . A Moment of Clarity Amidst the Controversy Despite the ironies and contradictions in her critique of Grok AI , Marjorie Taylor Greene did conclude her remarks with a point that resonated more broadly and serves as a valuable takeaway in the age of advanced AI. She wrote on X, “When people give up their own discernment, stop seeking the truth, and depend on AI to analyze information, they will be lost.” This statement, while perhaps inadvertently made in the context of defending herself against an AI chatbot ‘s critical summary, touches upon a crucial aspect of living with AI. As Elon Musk AI projects and others become more sophisticated, the responsibility of evaluating the information they provide remains with the user. AI models can hallucinate, perpetuate biases (intended or not), or simply misunderstand context. Relying on them blindly without critical thinking or seeking information from multiple sources is indeed risky. The strange fight between a prominent politician and an AI chatbot serves as a memorable, if peculiar, illustration of the ongoing challenges and debates surrounding AI in the public square, reminding us that discernment is more important than ever.

With crypto gaining more attention than ever, one term is popping up more and more: staking. At first glance, it seems like a simple way to get into the crypto world—steady rewards, low effort, and a quick path to make money. But is it really as simple as it seems? You might also like: The missing pieces of DeFi liquid staking | Opinion In fact, behind the promise of passive income lies a real maze of risks that even the most seasoned crypto investors could overlook. Slashing danger, hacking threats, and custody issues—these dangers may quickly turn what seems like a smooth ride into a financial “minefield.” So, let’s find out what staking really stands for, look closer at those dangers, and ultimately answer the question: Is staking a gateway or a trap? Staking 101: A perfect beginner’s shortcut? Staking is often compared to the crypto equivalent of a traditional bank deposit. Just like people might park their money in savings accounts to earn interest, staking lets them lock up their crypto assets in a blockchain network and earn rewards in return. In both cases, the idea is simple: put money to work and collect the rewards over time. But while the concept feels familiar, there are some key differences. As is known, traditional deposits are backed by banks and, in many countries, insured by the government, offering a very high level of security. In crypto, the rewards for staking are not guaranteed—if the network’s performance stumbles or if you are slashed for misbehaving (more on that later), your returns can go belly up, and your assets could end up at risk. Knowing these potential consequences, could staking seem beginner-friendly? Yes. The ease of the entire process is what makes it accessible for newcomers. In many ways, staking follows clear algorithms, similar to traditional finance. Imagine yourself as a newbie investor, just dipping your toes into crypto. You hear about staking from a friend who has already made a little profit. They tell you: “Just lock up crypto, sit back and watch the wallet grow. No need to study tokenomics, track charts, or foresee the next big trend.” An enticing way to park your assets, right? But the rabbit hole goes deeper than it first appears. Beneath the surface, staking carries some risks that could surprise beginners. Price volatility, penalties, and the hacking threat are the staking realities that can not be found in traditional bank accounts. The hidden cost of ‘easy’ rewards Price volatility could be the first curveball when it comes to staking. Since most rewards are paid in the same token you lock up, earnings are directly tied to market swings. You can earn a 10% a year reward, but what if the token’s value crashes by 40%? You are deep in red. Plus, many protocols require a lockup period, so in many cases, you will be stuck, watching your balance drain. Then, there is slashing. It is a penalty that can hit users if the validator they stake misbehaves or simply goes offline. It is not just a technical gimmick — it is a real financial risk. Depending on the network, users could lose anything from 0,1% to the entire stake. Fortunately, there are ways to minimize risks: Choose a blockchain that excludes slashing at all. Use reliable validators or staking providers—look for those with strong uptime and a solid security track record under the belt. If you run your own node, set up alerts, backups, and failover systems to make things run smoothly. Find out about the protocol’s rules: you need to know what counts as slashing before placing the assets. However, even if the validator plays by the rules, staking through third-party services could open the door to another danger: hacking. Remember the situation when the liquid restaking protocol Bedrock went through a serious exploit? It became a victim of a “security exploit” involving uniBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin token used in DeFI—that resulted in the loss of approximately $2 million in assets. So, it is a harsh reminder that flashy interfaces do not guarantee complete safety. Finally, let’s not write off threats coming from regulators. Governments, particularly in the EU, are tightening their grip on crypto, and platforms could be easily geo-blocked or shut down without warning. If you are staking through a provider that suddenly ends up on the wrong side of the law in your country—your funds may be frozen or even gone. Tron staking: Utility meets payback It is well-known that staking setups promise passive income, but staking on the Tron blockchain network is different. It offers something more hands-on: real utility. Instead of just earning yield, users can stake Tron ( TRX ) to process their own transactions, eliminating network fees entirely. Besides, unlike traditional staking models, Tron allows users to stake TRX in exchange for Energy & Bandwidth, which is usually needed to process transactions and smart contracts on the network. These resources renew every 24 hours, which contributes to the elimination of transaction fees. Yes, the passive yield from TRX staking can seem modest, typically being below 10% annually. But here is the twist: using those resources yourself means the possibility of reaching full payback within half a year or slightly more. That is the equivalent of a 171% return in saved fees over a year, far higher than most passive staking options offer. It is a really unique model, a kind of “PoS meets cost-efficiency” approach, one that few other blockchains provide today. Risky, but not impossible to tame Now, when it comes to staking, it is becoming clear: the rewards can be truly lucrative, but the risks are real. Volatility, penalties, hacking threats, and ever-evolving regulations are all part of this world. Still, it is not all doom and gloom. Staking, in its core essence, remains a viable option for crypto investors — it just requires a careful understanding of how the entire process works. All in all, I am sure that the risks can be managed if you are aware of potential pitfalls, take steps to secure assets, and choose reliable platforms only.

The GENIUS Act and growing institutional interest are reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as a mainstream asset. While Bitcoin outlook remains strong, altcoins may face headwinds from high interest rates and macro uncertainty. Bitcoin’s breakout to a new all-time high is just the beginning, according to Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume. In a market update shared Thursday, Jan projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. “Bitcoin’s climb to this all-time high underscores a transformative moment in the evolution of global finance,” Jan said, pointing to three main catalysts behind the rally, including regulatory clarity, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic pressure on the U.S. dollar. GENIUS Act Could Help Unlock Further Adoption Jan also noted the impact of the recently introduced GENIUS Act, which sets clearer rules for stablecoins. “This kind of regulation builds confidence and infrastructure,” he noted, helping to unlock further institutional adoption. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing steady inflows, signaling that institutional investors are viewing BTC as a serious asset class. “These products provide regulated access to Bitcoin, drawing in long-term capital,” he said. On the macro front, the weakening U.S. dollar is amplifying Bitcoin’s appeal as a global hedge. “Bitcoin’s inverse correlation to the dollar strengthens its role as digital gold,” Jan added. https://twitter.com/misterrcrypto/status/1926156439984238933 While optimistic on Bitcoin’s trajectory, Jan was cautious about altcoins. “Ethereum and other majors may follow BTC’s lead, but high interest rates and macro uncertainty could cap gains for smaller tokens,” he warned. With BTC hovering above $110,000, Bybit’s forecast of $125,000 by quarter’s end reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role in the evolving financial landscape. Bitcoin Could Hit $250K by End of 2025 Last week, crypto analyst Scott Melker said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Known for hosting The Wolf of All Streets podcast, Melker pointed to reduced volatility and deeper integration with traditional finance as catalysts for the next major rally. “$250K this year totally possible,” Melker said, noting that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped considerably. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” Likewise, Adam Back, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and CEO of Blockstream, believes that Bitcoin is significantly undervalued and could surge to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin during the current market cycle. In a recent interview, Back expressed surprise at Bitcoin’s current price level given the surge in institutional interest and major developments in the crypto landscape. Back argued the price does not yet reflect the full scope of bullish momentum building behind the asset. Meanwhile, according to Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy, Bitcoin’s recent price stagnation below the $150,000 mark can be attributed to short-term holders exiting the market . He added that Bitcoin is now finding its way into the hands of institutions and investors with a longer time horizon, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury strategies.

Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as top cryptocurrencies. Each offers unique strengths in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), in particular, is gaining traction with its presale, raising $9,200,000 and selling over 505 million tokens to 11,500 holders. Phase 5 is currently underway, with tokens priced at $0.03, a 200% jump from the opening phase’s $0.01. Investors are eyeing these altcoins for short-term and long-term gains. Let’s explore why these crypto coins spark interest and which coin to invest in for maximum returns. Dogecoin’s meme-driven momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) thrives on community zeal. Its price, now at $0.225, reflects a 1.9% daily gain despite a recent dip. Technical crypto charts show volatility at 12.82%, with a 50-day SMA of $0.184857. The 14-day RSI sits at 57.50, signaling neutral sentiment. Bollinger Bands indicate resistance at $0.2621 and support at $0.1576. Predictions suggest DOGE could hit $0.316082 in 2025, potentially reaching $1.37 by 2031. Its fanbase, active on social media, pushes for supply limits, fueling optimism. Yet, DOGE’s unlimited supply raises concerns about long-term stability. Investors seeking the next big crypto must weigh its hype against market unpredictability. This volatility paves the way for exploring more structured options like Ethereum. Ethereum’s bullish resilience Ethereum (ETH) remains a cornerstone in the crypto market. Despite a recent correction, its price hovers around $2,400, with analysts eyeing a $4,000 target in 2025. Crypto prices today show ETH’s 57.2% monthly return, backed by whale accumulation. On-chain data reveals large holders (10K–100K ETH) buying heavily, though some sold at a loss. Technical analysis, like the Ichimoku perspective, confirms ETH’s uptrend remains intact. Key support lies at $2,400, offering a buying zone. Ethereum’s strength lies in its ecosystem, supporting DeFi and smart contracts. However, its high price and volatility make it less accessible for some. This contrast highlights Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a fresh, affordable altcoin with unique utility. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in decentralized finance. Its presale, now in phase 5 at $0.03, guarantees a 100% ROI at launch, with a listing price of $0.06. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. Analysts predict a post-launch value of $2.50, offering a potential 8,233% ROI from the current price. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with updates to follow on social platforms. MUTM’s lending model allows users to borrow or lend assets like ETH, earning passive income via mtTokens. These tokens, like mtETH, accrue interest and are transferable across DeFi platforms. This utility drives demand, positioning MUTM as a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance’s buy pressure system Mutuum Finance (MUTM) incentivizes long-term holding through a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Platform revenue buys back MUTM tokens, redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This creates constant demand, stabilizing prices. Liquidity providers earn interest from dedicated pools, while borrowers use overcollateralized assets, ensuring low-risk transactions. For example, borrowing $5,000 in USDT requires $7,000 in ETH collateral. MUTM also launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. This feature boosts engagement and loyalty. Unlike DOGE’s volatility or ETH’s high entry cost, MUTM offers affordability and stability. Its structured tokenomics make it a standout in crypto investing. Mutuum Finance’s peer-to-peer edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces peer-to-peer lending, letting users negotiate terms directly. This feature supports assets like DOGE, absent from standard pools. The platform’s overcollateralized stablecoin, set to launch in 2025, enhances transparency. Unlike Ethereum’s complex ecosystem, MUTM simplifies DeFi access for newcomers. Its presale success, with 11,500 holders, reflects strong investor confidence. The $9,200,000 raised underscores its appeal as a new crypto coin. Compared to DOGE’s speculative swings, MUTM offers tangible utility. Its low entry price and predicted $2.50 post-launch value make it a compelling choice for those asking what crypto to buy now. Path to Profitable Picks Investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in find DOGE, ETH, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) compelling. DOGE rides community hype but faces supply risks. Ethereum offers robust fundamentals yet demands a higher budget. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends affordability, utility, and high ROI potential. Its phase 5 presale at $0.03, with a guaranteed 100% return at launch, draws savvy investors. Crypto predictions favor MUTM’s $2.50 target, dwarfing DOGE and ETH’s growth prospects. For those eyeing the next crypto to explode, MUTM’s DeFi innovation and structured growth make it a top pick. Explore these options and invest wisely in the crypto market today.

The market expert points out that the token is acting a lot like it did before, and that has some traders watching closely. The setup is simple: repeat history, hit big targets, cash out along the way. Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K XRP Fractal Moves Mirror 2017 Based on reports, XRP first climbed from $0.0055 in March 2017 to $0.3988 by May of that year. Then it cooled off for roughly six months. In its current run, XRP lagged around $0.50 through most of 2023 and into early 2024. After the US elections in November 2024, it shot up nearly 600%—from $0.50 to $3.40 by January 2025. Now it’s pulled back and is sitting still. That pattern looks a lot like what happened eight years ago. #XRP – Fib Circle & The Surge (1700% in just 60 Days!): If #XRP is repeating the last section or pattern from October 2017, we might be on the brink of a major breakout soon! 🔥 Back in October 2017, XRP took roughly 63 days to explode and set a new all-time high, skyrocketing… pic.twitter.com/hXJLv6M5Tr — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 23, 2025 Fibonacci Levels And Profit Marks Analyst Egrag Crypto pinpoints three clear price zones before the big $27 goal. First is $8.49 (the 1.272 Fib extension). Next sits at $13.79 (1.414 Fib). Finally, if the token truly repeats 2017’s second wave—a 1,772% surge—it would top out near $27. To get there in 60 days is a stretch. But the math lines up if history really does rhyme. Traders are being told to book gains along the way instead of waiting for that final number. Support Lines Hold The Key He also notes that XRP needs to stay above the 21-week exponential moving average. That line is around $2.30 right now. XRP trades at about $2.33, so it’s only just ahead. If price dips under that moving average, the bullish case starts to wobble. A drop below $2.30 could see sellers step in and push it back toward tougher floors, like the $2.00 zone or other support bands from on-chain data. 🚀 #XRP is about to enter one of the most important moments in its history.

For enthusiasts tracking the intersection of AI and technology, particularly within communities familiar with complex digital systems like those in cryptocurrency, the development of more sophisticated autonomous tools is key. OpenAI has just announced a major enhancement to one of its promising tools, the OpenAI Operator agent. The Core Upgrade: Moving to the OpenAI o3 Model OpenAI is making a notable change under the hood of its Operator agent. This agent is designed to function within a cloud-hosted virtual machine, capable of browsing the web and using software autonomously. Previously, Operator ran on a custom version of the GPT-4o model. The significant news is the transition to a model based on the o3 series, specifically designed for reasoning tasks. Why the switch? According to OpenAI, the o3 series models demonstrate superior performance on various benchmarks, particularly those involving complex math and intricate reasoning. This suggests the upgraded Operator should be more adept at understanding instructions and navigating digital environments effectively. OpenAI confirmed this in a blog post, stating, “We are replacing the existing GPT‑4o-based model for Operator with a version based on OpenAI o3.” It’s worth noting that the API version of Operator will continue to utilize the GPT-4o base for now. The Rise of the AI Agent Landscape This upgrade comes amidst a clear trend in the AI industry: the race to develop highly capable AI agents that can perform complex chores with minimal supervision. The goal is to create tools that can reliably execute multi-step tasks across digital platforms. OpenAI’s Operator is not alone in this space. Other major players are also fielding their own versions of autonomous agents: Google: Offers a “computer use” agent via its Gemini API, capable of web browsing and actions on behalf of users. They also have a consumer-focused tool called Mariner. Anthropic: Their models are also gaining the ability to perform computer tasks, such as opening files and navigating webpages. This competitive landscape is pushing innovation, with each company striving to build the most reliable and versatile AI Agent capable of complex AI Reasoning . Enhanced Safety Measures and Capabilities of o3 Operator The new model, dubbed o3 Operator, has undergone specific fine-tuning. OpenAI reports that it was “fine-tuned with additional safety data for computer use.” This included datasets specifically designed to teach the model OpenAI’s boundaries regarding confirmations and refusals for certain actions. OpenAI released a technical report detailing o3 Operator’s performance on safety evaluations. The report provides insights into how the new model handles sensitive situations: It uses the same multi-layered approach to safety as the previous version. The report indicates it is less likely to refuse performing “illicit” activities compared to the GPT-4o version. It is also less likely to refuse searching for sensitive personal data. However, the report also notes it is less susceptible to prompt injection attacks, a common method used to manipulate AI behavior. These findings highlight the ongoing challenge of balancing capability with safety in advanced Autonomous AI systems. While the model might be more robust against certain attacks, its reduced refusal rate for questionable tasks presents a new area for scrutiny and continued development. Despite inheriting the strong coding capabilities of the base o3 model, OpenAI clarifies that o3 Operator does not have native access to a coding environment or terminal, limiting its direct code execution abilities within its operational context. What This Means for Autonomous AI The upgrade to the OpenAI o3 Model for Operator signifies a step forward in building more capable and potentially more reliable Autonomous AI systems. Improved AI Reasoning is crucial for agents expected to perform tasks independently across dynamic digital environments. As these agents become more sophisticated, their potential applications grow, but so do the complexities surrounding their deployment, safety, and ethical use. The technical report’s findings underscore that developing agents capable of advanced AI Reasoning while remaining consistently safe and aligned with human intent is a continuous process with evolving challenges. Looking Ahead: The Future of AI Agents The competition among AI companies to build the best AI Agent is heating up. As models like OpenAI’s o3 become the foundation for these tools, we can expect to see agents capable of handling increasingly complex tasks. The focus on safety fine-tuning, as seen with o3 Operator, indicates that developers are actively trying to address the risks associated with giving AI more autonomy, though challenges remain. The development of powerful autonomous tools is a key area to watch, impacting everything from personal productivity to enterprise automation. Keeping informed about these core model upgrades is essential for understanding the trajectory of AI capabilities.

As major coins enter consolidation zones, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing accelerated demand, and many analysts are calling this the last major entry window before listings take price discovery public. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Accumulated by Institutions MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the few remaining presale tokens with both clear structure and strategic upside. With a fixed listing target of $0.007 and Stage 8 nearly complete, traders and institutions alike are viewing this as the last clean shot at early-cycle positioning. Key factors driving MAGA’s momentum: Projected 25x–35x growth from current levels, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside Distinct political narrative and identity-based branding Transparent tokenomics with a capped supply and imminent exchange visibility Record-breaking whale buys—including a single 72.95 ETH purchase worth over $133,000—confirming institutional-level interest For Bitcoin, XRP, and ETH holders looking for higher risk/reward ratios, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exactly what’s missing from the large caps right now: entry-level positioning with real upside potential. Bitcoin Holds Steady as Investors Hunt for Altcoin Multipliers Bitcoin (BTC) continues to maintain its dominance in the market, consolidating above $110,000 with strong support and institutional inflows. While ETF flows remain consistent and long-term targets still range between $115,000 and $150,000, BTC’s short-term movement has flattened. For this reason, many BTC holders are reallocating portions of their portfolios into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE to balance stability with speculative opportunity. Bitcoin builds confidence—MAGA builds exponential potential. XRP: Institutional Validation and Price Projections XRP is trading between $2.35 and $2.65, buoyed by regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and significant whale accumulation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. As XRP holders seek the next wave of upside, many are reallocating to pre-listing opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve hasn’t even begun. Ethereum: Bullish Structure and Rotating Capital Ethereum (ETH) is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside and higher multiples. Chainlink: Steady but MAGA Steals the Spotlight Chainlink (LINK) is holding steady, with analysts projecting a range of $10.32–$16.47 in 2025. While LINK remains a dependable hold for oracle network exposure, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 10x–50x winner. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a secret—and with Stage 8 approaching completion, institutional investors and traders from all sides of the market are taking positions. Bitcoin holders are rotating small stacks. XRP and ETH communities are diversifying. LINK investors are looking for speed. Among all of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the final early-stage plays with structured ROI, clear timing, and high-conviction sentiment. This may be the last low-level entry before listings go live—and those watching closely are already making their move.

Just as a major crypto platform admitted contractors leaked user info, the United Kingdom unveiled strict new rules requiring firms to collect and report detailed personal data on every crypto transaction. Starting Jan. 1, 2026, crypto firms operating in the U.K. will be expected to keep tabs on just about everything — every customer, every transaction, every movement of crypto. It’s part of the U.K.’s effort to bring transparency — and accountability — to a space long accused of being a bit too shadowy for its own good. HM Revenue and Customs dropped the news in a May 14 statement , saying crypto firms will need to collect the full name, home address, date of birth, and tax identification numbers of all individual users. Entities like companies, partnerships, and charities are also in the spotlight, with requirements for legal business names, addresses, and company registration numbers. That includes every transaction, even those just moving crypto between wallets. The rules follow international standards but go further by applying them within the U.K., not just across borders. Firms will be expected to submit reports annually, and those that fall short could face fines of up to £300 (around $398) per user. Protecting consumers Authorities say the move is about protecting consumers and creating a more robust regulatory environment. But it’s also clearly aimed at closing tax loopholes and keeping pace with broader global standards, including the European MiCA regulation. As HMRC put it, firms should start preparing now — not in 2026 — to avoid a last-minute scramble. Mark Aruliah, head of EMEA policy at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, said in a commentary for crypto.news that the move is an “expected next step” for an industry maturing toward parity with traditional finance. “Reporting of personal transaction data has historically been a challenge for the industry and for consumers. This clarity on legal obligations to reporting will help and also the growth of new reporting services.” Mark Aruliah While Aruliah acknowledged the potential burden on smaller startups, he said the push toward transparency was not only necessary but overdue. “Any regulation is generally regarded as an additional cost burden to the industry but that has to be balanced against the benefits that it provides. Therefore, it may be that smaller firms are impacted disproportionately based purely on costs (i.e. due to their size and profits), but nevertheless, these obligations are an expected next step and simply look to match the general reporting obligations in the tradfi space.” Mark Aruliah But for many critics, the bigger question is not about collecting data. It’s about keeping it safe. Great responsibility That concern came into sharp focus as cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase recently confirmed a breach involving customer data. According to the U.S.-based crypto exchange, contractors working for Coinbase overseas were bribed by attackers who gained access to sensitive customer information. That included names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and in some cases, partial Social Security numbers. Some users have even reported that ID documents like passports and driver’s licenses were exposed. Coinbase said the breach affected less than 1% of its user base, though with nearly 9 million monthly active users, even that sliver represents a significant population. Worse still, it’s exactly the kind of personal data the U.K. now wants firms to collect and verify — and the breach raises urgent questions about whether crypto companies are equipped to handle such responsibility.

The sharp sell-off wiped out around $638 million in leveraged positions, as per data from Coinglass. Trump said that he is not going to make a deal with the EU but hinted that he might delay the tariffs if the EU builds factories in the US. Trump recommended a 50% tariff on EU goods starting June 1, 2025, unless the products are made in the U.S. The sharp move came after a period of low volatility, and Trump’s comments triggered panic across global markets. Top altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano were also hit hard as they dropped 3-6%. According to CoinGlass , nearly $350 million in crypto positions were liquidated in just 4 hours, with over $500 million wiped out in 24 hours. Crypto stocks also slid today as BTC Treasury companies like Microstrategy and Semler Scientific dropped around 6%. Japan’s Metaplanet fell even harder, down 24%. Despite Bitcoin hitting a fresh all-time high this week, crypto stocks did not keep up with the gains. Is Trump In a Tough Spot? Commenting on the big-picture market situation, The Kobeissi Letter said Trump is in a tough spot. If he pushes tariffs too hard, it could cause market trades to fall apart. But if he backs off too much, then the inflation expectations could rise again. Trump has to find a way to keep tariffs high enough to show strength but should also avoid pushing up treasury yields. And he has to do this without help from the Fed, which isn’t lowering interest rates yet. This Cycle Is Different, Say Analysts Analyst Benjamin Cowen says Bitcoin’s recent drop looks like the typical dip that follows a golden cross. He expects the pullback to last a few days with a possible bounce coming next week. Experts note that this crypto cycle is way more complex and different from the past ones. So, there’s no reason to expect the rest of it to follow the same old 4-year pattern. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe says that investors should stay open-minded over the next 1-2 years as the market could bring surprises. He believes that now, the chances are much higher of a longer cycle with Bitcoin possibly hitting $400K–$600K by 2026/2027 and altcoins climbing even higher.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 09:09:12

With fears of a U.S. recession rising by 43% and government debt ballooning, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is choosing to bet on expansion, not reductions. This approach may sound risky, but here’s the twist, it’s already showing some results. Let’s find out. Elon Musk’s Fix: Grow the Economy, Don’t Shrink It For decades, the go-to solution during economic trouble has been to cut government spending. But now, with the U.S. debt mounting and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jumping to 4.5% and recession odds climbing to 43%, Musk argues that this strategy is no longer enough Musk says improving productivity and expanding GDP are the only real ways to avoid national bankruptcy . He admits that government waste is a serious problem, but believes that strong reforms can still make a difference. And he’s not alone. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, once a firm supporter of spending cuts, now says the U.S. must “grow its way out” of the debt crisis. According to him, if the economy grows faster than the debt, it becomes possible to manage both. This change in thinking marks a huge turning point for U.S. economic policy. DOGE’s Progress So Far While Musk in the 2024 U.S. election campaign promised DOGE would save $2 trillion from government spending, which is one-third of the entire federal budget. As of May, it has already saved $170 billion, which is 17% of its $1 trillion goal and 8.5% of the “dream target.” The public can track DOGE’s progress through an official site, which also highlights which sectors are becoming more efficient. Bitcoin Drops After Trade War Warning After Donald Trump warned about new trade tariffs on Europe, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies quickly dropped. Eventually, Bitcoin has become very sensitive to what’s happening in politics. As these tensions rise, crypto prices are moving fast. Just recently, Bitcoin hit a record high above $112,000. But after the news, it dropped 2.7% and is now trading around $107,937 .",News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 09:09:46

According to the DOJ, the recovery was from schemes and ventures that exploited the growing interest of users in the industry. According to the DOJ, the move also underscores an aggressive push to restore trust and integrity across markets in the crypto industry. The order of forfeiture was made by United States District Court Judge Amir H. Ali, and announced by US Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, Chief John Lynch of the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice, and FBI Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy of the San Diego Field Office. United States DOJ wins order of forfeiture With the order , the United States government is expected to take charge of the assets, marking another effort by federal authorities to ensure the financial market remains with its integrity while protecting its participants from deception. The latest development also underscores the DOJ’s commitment to safeguarding legitimate investment activities in the digital asset industry. These schemes, often appearing to have an air of legitimacy, use different techniques and methods to lure crypto investors. While some of them use the promise of high returns, others use the promise of something bigger. For example, some platforms promise investors very high profits, using their inexperience to impress upon them to make the investments. These traders often part with huge funds as they seek to make profits from what they feel is a market that everybody is involved in. In some other cases , there are the issues of Ponzi schemes, where users are mandated to recruit other traders onto a platform for profits. What the platform does is that it uses funds from newer investors to pay older investors, carrying out the act until the team behind the platform is apprehended, or investors realize their activities. These activities and more have caused a dent in the trust that the general populace has in the crypto industry, and the DOJ and other agents involved in this forfeiture are trying to restore it. United States authorities promise to apprehend the criminals According to a statement by United States Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, the United States will continue to hold fraudsters responsible, regardless of where they are located. “Whether they are in our district’s streets or hiding behind a computer screen abroad, the United States will continue to hold fraudsters and grifters responsible, seize money they scam from hard-working Americans, and use our authority to compensate victims,” Pirro said. Stacey Moy of the San Diego Field Office also mentioned the harm that schemes like these have caused in the United States, noting that victims in every case have lost a devastating amount of money to these scammers under the pretext of changing their lives. “We hope today’s announcement brings a measure of justice to the victims and serves as a reminder, that the FBI will hold fraudsters accountable, no matter where they are located,” Moy added. In this case and others related to it, the United States uses asset forfeiture to punish and halt criminal activities. By doing this, they deprived criminals from acquiring proceeds of crime or assets obtained using the proceeds. It is also used to promote and enhance cooperation among federal and foreign law enforcement agencies, with the end goal of their cooperation being the recovery of stolen assets and the compensation of victims. Meanwhile, the DOJ has called out to members of the public who believe they are victims of cybercrime to contact the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center to report such crimes.

Amidst this excitement, a significant technical indicator, the ‘Golden Cross,’ has emerged, capturing the attention of major players like Fidelity Digital Assets. But what exactly does this mean for the future of Bitcoin’s price, and why is a specific price level so crucial? Understanding the Bitcoin Golden Cross and Its Significance In technical analysis, a Golden Cross is widely regarded as a strong bullish signal. It occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average. For Bitcoin, this pattern activated on April 7th, suggesting potential upward momentum. Why is this particular Bitcoin Golden Cross drawing so much focus? Because it often indicates a potential shift in market sentiment and can precede significant price rallies. However, the strength and validation of this signal often depend on subsequent price action. According to Chris Kuiper from Fidelity Digital Assets, the current Golden Cross could gain further strength and confirm its bullish implications if the Bitcoin price manages to hold above the $93,000 level. This $93,000 level likely represents a critical support zone, potentially aligning with key moving averages or previous resistance-turned-support levels. Maintaining the price above this threshold would reinforce the technical validity of the Golden Cross and suggest that the bullish trend has solid footing. Fidelity Digital Assets ‘ Perspective on the Market As a major player in the institutional crypto space, the insights from Fidelity Digital Assets carry significant weight. Chris Kuiper’s commentary highlights their analytical approach, combining technical indicators like the Golden Cross with fundamental drivers. Fidelity’s view isn’t just about the technical pattern; it’s also tied to key price levels. While the $93,000 mark is seen as crucial for validating the Golden Cross, Fidelity also views the $110,000 level as a potential ‘launchpad’ for further gains. This suggests that breaking and holding above $110,000 could trigger the next leg up in Bitcoin’s price discovery, potentially accelerating the upward trend indicated by the Golden Cross. The fact that an entity like Fidelity Digital Assets is publicly discussing these technical and price levels underscores the increasing institutional acceptance and analysis of the cryptocurrency market using traditional financial tools and metrics. Driving Forces: Crypto ETF Inflows and Institutional Appetite What’s fueling this optimistic outlook from institutions like Fidelity? A primary driver is the consistent and significant flow of capital into Bitcoin investment products, particularly Crypto ETF inflows . The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various markets has provided traditional investors with a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. These ETFs have seen steady and substantial inflows since their launch, absorbing a significant portion of the newly mined Bitcoin supply and even drawing from existing holdings. Key drivers behind these robust Crypto ETF inflows and the broader institutional appetite include: Inflation Hedge Narrative: Institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Digital Gold Status: The comparison to digital gold resonates with asset managers looking for alternative store-of-value assets. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets offers diversification benefits. Accessibility: ETFs and other regulated products simplify investment for large funds. Growing Ecosystem Maturity: Improved infrastructure, custody solutions, and regulatory clarity make institutional participation more feasible. While institutional interest and investment via avenues like ETFs are surging, it’s noteworthy, as U.Today reported, that retail participation has remained relatively limited compared to previous bull cycles. This dynamic suggests that the current rally is heavily institutionally driven, which can impact market structure and volatility differently than a retail-fueled surge. Analyzing Current Bitcoin Price Trends and Challenges Since the activation of the Golden Cross on April 7th, the Bitcoin price has seen a remarkable increase of approximately 33%. This powerful upward move propelled Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $111,814. However, like any volatile asset, Bitcoin experienced a pullback, dropping to around $108,622 at the time of the report. This recent dip was partially attributed to rising U.S.-EU trade tensions, illustrating how broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors can still influence the crypto market, even amidst strong underlying bullish trends. This highlights an inherent challenge for investors: navigating Bitcoin’s price movements requires not only understanding crypto-specific factors but also keeping an eye on the global economic landscape. Key price levels to watch based on the analysis include: $93,000: The crucial support level for validating the strength of the Golden Cross, according to Fidelity. $110,000: Identified by Fidelity as a potential launchpad for further upward movement. $111,814: The recent all-time high, which now serves as a resistance level to break through. The ability of the Bitcoin price to sustain itself above key technical and psychological levels will be critical in determining the short-to-medium term trajectory. The Road Ahead: Opportunities in Institutional Bitcoin Investment The increasing focus on Institutional Bitcoin investment is not just a current trend; it’s a fundamental shift that could shape the market for years to come. As more large funds and corporations allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, the market gains deeper liquidity and potentially reduced volatility over the long term (though short-term swings remain likely). For readers interested in this space, understanding the drivers and impact of Institutional Bitcoin investment is key. These large players often have longer investment horizons and perform extensive due diligence, which can lend credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. Their continued entry, facilitated by products like ETFs and the insights provided by firms like Fidelity Digital Assets, could provide sustained buying pressure independent of retail sentiment. While the path won’t be without its pullbacks and challenges, the structural change brought about by significant institutional adoption suggests a maturing market with potentially larger upside potential over time, supported by strong technical signals like a validated Golden Cross. Conclusion Fidelity Digital Assets’ focus on the Bitcoin Golden Cross and the critical $93,000 level underscores the growing intersection of traditional financial analysis and the cryptocurrency market. Coupled with robust ETF inflows and increasing institutional interest, the outlook appears bullish, contingent on Bitcoin holding key support levels. While recent price action has seen Bitcoin pull back slightly from its all-time high, the underlying drivers, particularly from the institutional side, remain strong. The $110,000 level is eyed as a potential catalyst for the next phase of growth. As the market evolves, monitoring both technical indicators and the flow of institutional capital will be essential for understanding Bitcoin’s future trajectory.

The authorities seized over $24 million in crypto tied to the operation, which is planned to be returned to the victims. The indictment on May 22, 2025, is a significant step by the U.S. authorities in their fight against ransomware attacks. This is part of a broader law enforcement campaign (like Operation Endgame) to target cybercriminals who have been using malware like Qakbot to infect systems worldwide, demand ransoms, and steal data and funds. The victims included a wide range of businesses, from small dental clinics in Los Angeles to tech companies in Nebraska, manufacturers in Wisconsin, and even real estate firms in Canada. U.S. and Allies Unite Against Cybercrime “The charges announced today exemplify the FBI’s commitment to relentlessly hold accountable individuals who target Americans and demand ransom, even when they live halfway across the world,” said Akil Davis, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. These moves are part of a global crackdown on cybercrime, with the U.S., France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, the U.K., and Canada working together to fight cybercrime, the statement read. Gallyamov’s Qakbot Malware Infected 700,000+ Computers Since 2008 Gallymov is accused of running the Qakbot malware operation since 2008, infecting over 700,000 computers worldwide and enabling major ransomware attacks like Conti, Black Basta, and REvil. Gallyamov was paid a portion of the ransoms that were received from victims. In August 2023, a U.S.-led international operation took down the Qakbot botnet, where the authorities seized over 170 Bitcoins and more than $4 million in USDT and USDC from Gallyamov. Even after this, he kept his cybercrime activity going by switching to new tactics like “spam bomb” attacks. He kept attacking systems as recently as January 2025 by flooding victims with emails, tricking employees into giving hackers access. As a result, under the “Operation Endgame”, the FBI seized another 30 Bitcoins and $700,000 in USDT from Gallyamov. The DOJ also filed a civil forfeiture case to permanently claim the $24+ million in total seized crypto, with plans to return the funds to the victims. If convicted, he would face a statutory maximum sentence of 25 years in federal prison. Tornado Cash Creator Also Under Federal Investigation This is just the latest move in the US’ big crackdown on Cybercrime. In December 2024, they charged Rostislav Panev, a Russian-Israeli hacker linked to LockBit ransomware, for creating malware that helped criminals hack networks and demand ransoms, with over $230,000 in crypto tied to him. In May 2025, 12 mostly young people were charged with running a $263 million crypto racketeering scheme. They used the stolen money to buy luxury jets and cars.

In a new video, Pal tells his 236,000 YouTube subscribers that the global money supply (Global M2) metric is “tightly correlated” to the price of Bitcoin. According to the macro guru, the global money supply metric is now suggesting that Bitcoin could go up by around 28% from the current level. “But at this point, it’s [the price of Bitcoin] really driven by liquidity. It gave us a three-month heads up to exactly the correction [of around $75,000 in April]. And yet Twitter said it’s about tariffs, it’s about the end of the world. It told you, it is telling you, and told you it would be at all-time highs. I told you it would be at all-time highs by May. It tells you we should be over $140,000 by July.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube Pal further says that the price of Bitcoin will at some point start rising faster than the increase in global money supply before trending in the opposite direction. “I also know it will decouple later in the cycle, and it will decouple to the upside with Bitcoin outperforming Global M2. That’s how it works when the crowd comes in, the herd gets FOMO (fear of missing out), they get greedy, and it actually starts outperforming. The,n when the market flips, it eventually starts to underperform as fear kicks in.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,350 at time of writing.

These investments are expected to lead to a total accumulation of 4.2 million BTC. While more than $120 billion in institutional inflows into Bitcoin are expected in 2025, this figure is expected to reach $300 billion in 2026. This rapid growth will be driven not only by the private sector but also by state-supported strategies. Following US President Donald Trump’s announcement in March that he would establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, bills aimed at converting confiscated Bitcoins into treasury assets have emerged in more than 20 states. If these initiatives, led by states such as New Hampshire and Arizona, become law, an additional $19 billion in capital flow into Bitcoin is expected. Related News: A Person Who Attended US President Donald Trump's Crypto Dinner Shared Inside Details: He Also Revealed How Much He Paid to Attend According to the report, at least five states in the US and four other countries, such as Bhutan, are expected to establish their own strategic Bitcoin reserves by 2026. This process is also expected to increase the number of publicly traded Bitcoin treasuries. Firms such as MicroStrategy are expected to add more than 1 million BTC to their portfolios in total. These companies are also expected to focus on Bitcoin-based yield strategies, such as lending and staking, by 2026, further increasing the interest of institutional investors. “We are entering a new era of Bitcoin adoption that is no longer driven by hype cycles, but by balance sheet fundamentals, sovereign strategies and long-term liabilities,” said Guillaume Girard, research director at UTXO Management. “Over the next 18 months, Bitcoin will solidify its place as a global store of value,” said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise. *This is not investment advice.

While much attention focuses on generative AI and large language models, advancements in specialized AI are also making significant waves. One such development comes from Microsoft, which has unveiled an AI model with impressive capabilities in forecasting atmospheric events. This development in Microsoft AI highlights the diverse applications of machine learning beyond traditional computing tasks. What is Microsoft’s Aurora AI? Microsoft’s latest contribution to the field of AI is a model named Aurora. According to a paper published in Nature and a company blog post, Aurora is designed for environmental forecasting. The tech giant claims this model can predict atmospheric events with greater precision and speed compared to traditional methods used in meteorology. Key aspects of the Aurora model: Extensive Training: Aurora was trained on over a million hours of diverse environmental data. This includes information from satellites, radar, weather stations, and various weather simulations and forecasts. Versatile Prediction: The model is capable of predicting a range of phenomena, including air quality, hurricanes, typhoons, and other weather-related events. Fine-Tuning Capability: Aurora can be fine-tuned with additional data to improve predictions for specific types of weather events or particular regions. How Does Aurora AI Weather Prediction Compare? The field of AI weather prediction is not new, with various research labs developing models over the years. Google DeepMind, for instance, has released models like WeatherNext, which they claim rival leading forecasting systems. Microsoft positions Aurora as a top performer in this competitive space. Aurora demonstrates its capabilities through specific examples: It reportedly predicted Typhoon Doksuri’s landfall in the Philippines four days in advance, surpassing some expert forecasts. The model outperformed the National Hurricane Center in forecasting five-day tropical cyclone tracks during the 2022-2023 season. Aurora successfully predicted the 2022 Iraq sandstorm, an event with significant environmental and health impacts. These examples suggest that Aurora AI represents a significant step forward in the accuracy and timeliness of weather forecasting. The Efficiency of Weather Forecasting AI One of the major advantages Microsoft highlights is the efficiency of running the Aurora model.

While seasoned investors continue to ask what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in for the next cycle, MUTM stands out for its ultra-low entry point, a strong DeFi narrative, and explosive growth potential. Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale offers tokens at a price of $0.03 per token. Acquisition by more than 11,000 presale buyers has produced a robust investor backing that has raised $9.1 million. Buyers of Mutuum Finance Phase tokens during this phase get 100% profit at the projected $0.06 launch price. As interest shifts from overbought giants to new crypto coins with room to run, analysts are eyeing a possible 50x rally for MUTM in 2025. Whether you’re building a long-term portfolio or looking for the next big crypto, Mutuum Finance could be the low-cap breakout that turns a modest investment into a fortune. Mutuum Finance Presale The project has surpassed a significant milestone as its presale accumulates more than $9.1 million from participants who have exceeded 11,000 in number. Since presale initiation the MUTM token value has increased to $0.03 and will steadily grow up to launch at $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Lending System Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish direct loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P model because this system represents a superior way of managing assets. Users benefit from increased security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings on exchanges will improve user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts by certik, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. More than $9.1 million raised and over 11,000 presale participants highlight the strong momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 5 buyers are set to double their investment as the token price targets $0.06, while experts predict a possible 50x surge in 2025. This opportunity represents a rare chance to get in early on a project combining cutting-edge DeFi innovation, transparency, and sustainable growth strategies. Presale spots are rapidly filling up, and once the launch occurs, the chance to capitalize on these gains will vanish. Act now, secure your MUTM tokens before this explosive growth opportunity slips away.

As ETH consolidates in the $2,400–$2,900 range and approaches $2,577, investors are closely watching for the next breakout. Yet, while Ethereum’s resilience is impressive, the spotlight is shifting to projects with even greater upside—most notably MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With Bitcoin and Stellar Lumens providing stability, these high-growth contenders are capturing the imagination of analysts and traders heading into summer 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Contender Redefining Early-Stage ROI While Ethereum and Bitcoin anchor the market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001, MAGA’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts are calling MAGA the standout contender of the year, with forecasts suggesting a conservative 35x gain and some models projecting up to 50x or even 18,500% upside if current momentum continues. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $130,000—highlights the conviction behind this early-stage gem, and with Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target on the horizon, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle winner. XRP: Breaking Barriers and Building Momentum XRP is holding steady around $2.37, consolidating after a strong rally and benefiting from regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and technical strength. Analysts are eyeing a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the short term, with some optimistic models even targeting $3.40 if bullish sentiment holds. Standard Chartered projects $5.50 by year-end, driven by ETF approvals and increased adoption, and some long-term forecasts suggest $10–$20 is possible by 2030 if Ripple’s global settlement infrastructure gains traction. While XRP’s upside is seen as steady rather than explosive, many investors are rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, asymmetric returns. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Unshakable Confidence Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $150,000 or more by year-end if momentum persists. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. For those seeking exponential returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are the new frontier. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Strength, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar Lumens (XLM) continues to serve as a reliable cross-border payments asset, maintaining steady adoption among fintech partners and remittance platforms. Trading near $0.11, XLM’s growth has lagged behind the more explosive moves seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is drawing capital from investors seeking the next 50x opportunity. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Ethereum’s climb to $2,577 is a testament to its resilience, but the most dramatic growth potential is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion, a $0.007 listing target, and analyst forecasts up to 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast. For those seeking the next breakout winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025.

The former Binance CEO took to blogging platform X to call out a recent article linking him to Trump-linked entities, particularly WLFI, regarding a stake in Binance US. In the post on X, Zhao mentioned that the WSJ article was filled with inaccuracies, calling it a “hit piece” filled with negative assumptions. The WSJ article portrayed his involvement in the decentralized finance project, one which he has criticized. The platform is backed by a business entity that has affiliations with United States President Donald Trump. Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Jr. are actively involved in managing the company. According to Zhao, the article emphasized his role as a “fixer” for the WLFI team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article also suggested that Zhao carried out introductions and meetings for WLFI leaders during foreign trips, including a recent visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official. Changpeng Zhao slams WSJ’s “hit piece” In his post on X, Zhao mentioned that he was not a fixer for anyone, denying the claims that he connected Pakistani officials Mr. Saqib with anyone from WLFI or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan,” he added. He also added that the WSJ submitted a list of questions that he described as wrong and negative assumptions. Another hit piece from Wall Street Journal. WSJ instead of doing journalism, has pretty much resorted to Cunningham’s Law, with negative intentions. ""Cunningham's Law: The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.""… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) May 23, 2025 Zhao and his public relations team have since pointed out several factual inaccuracies, concluding that the article was created with malicious intent. He also slammed WSJ, noting that it is acting as the mouthpiece for anti-crypto forces in the United States. He added that forces behind the publication want to hinder the push for the country to be the crypto capital of the world. “They want to attack crypto, global crypto leaders, and the pro-crypto administration,” CZ claimed, saying the article is part of a broader effort to stifle the industry’s growth in the US. This is not the first time that Zhao has slammed WSJ for what he describes as inaccurate reporting, with the former Binance CEO slamming its April 11 report where it said Zhao had agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun. The report added that the measure was a means to settle with US prosecutors, but Zhao slammed it, noting that government witnesses are always protected and don’t go to jail. He also added that someone within WSJ had received money to smear his name. WSJ report calls out CZ’s role in WLFI CZ’s response comes after a WSJ investigation, where the news outlet highlighted a string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLFI. The WSJ report had raised concerning questions about the blurred lines between public and private interests, focusing on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLFI co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son Zach Witkoff. Steve Witkoff currently serves as the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East under the Trump administration, while Zach Witkoff has been involved in some capacity at the company, including securing a $2 billion crypto deal. The report raised questions about whether diplomatic efforts are clashing with private crypto ventures, implying that Zhao may have been trying to gain favors in the sight of the Trump administration. The Binance man confirmed on May 6 that he was seeking pardon from the Trump administration concerning his earlier money laundering conviction. The report also mentioned that WLFI, which had raised over $600 million in token sales, has refused to disclose the names of all its investors aside from some publicly known entities like Tron founder Justin Sun, who was in attendance at the Trump meme coin dinner on May 22. The president hosted the dinner for the largest investors in his Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin. The event was graced by Sun, Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu, and BitMart CEO Sheldon Xia, among others.

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project. According to US law , the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison. Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance. When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.” Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinner Trump features presidential seal at private properties This isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties. Forbes has previously reported its use as golf markers at several Trump-owned clubs. In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Source: Molly Ploofkins Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump's dinner Trump embraces crypto despite previous skepticism Trump’s embrace of crypto marks a sharp turn from his skepticism during his first term. The $TRUMP memecoin, launched earlier this year, peaked at $74.34 before falling to $14.44 by May 22. High-profile guests at the dinner included Tron founder Justin Sun , ex-NBA player Lamar Odom, and Asian crypto executives Sangrok Oh and Vincent Liu. Sun, who reportedly invested over $40 million in $TRUMP tokens and spoke at the dinner, also has deep ties to Trump’s crypto ventures. He’s the top backer of World Liberty Financial, a Trump-affiliated firm currently under regulatory scrutiny.

This week has been a wild ride for investors and enthusiasts. Big headlines. Big consequences. We’ve seen it all – from political power plays to million-dollar scandals. All of these are powerful signals hinting at where the industry is really heading. So, if you blinked, you’ve missed a lot. We’ll dive into what happened these past few days and why it matters for you. Let’s go! #1 Trump’s $TRUMP Crypto Dinner Drama Justin Sun, the crypto billionaire who once dodged the US spotlight fearing arrest, stepped back into the limelight – this time as a VIP at Donald Trump’s exclusive gala dinner. Sun, proudly holding the biggest stash of Trump’s $TRUMP memecoin, showed up amid protests shouting “shame.” Trump himself took the stage, blaming the previous administration for making life miserable for crypto insiders, calling it a “disgrace.” Sun flashed over $1.3 million in $TRUMP holdings and a flashy “Trump Golden Tourbillion” watch. Predictably, Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren called it “an orgy of corruption”. Phew. #2 Sui’s $260M Crypto Heist: What Went Down? Sui’s largest decentralized exchange, Cetus Protocol, was hit with a $260 million hack that sent shockwaves through the SUI ecosystem. The attacker exploited fake tokens like BULLA to mess with liquidity pools and drain assets, including 12.9 million SUI and $60 million in USDC. They then tried laundering the loot by swapping a big chunk of USDC for 21,938 ETH. Cetus jumped on damage control, pausing smart contracts and launching a full probe. Meanwhile, SUI’s price took a hit, dropping about 15% to $3.90. The scramble is on to recover funds and shore up security. #3 GENIUS Act (Finally) Breaks Ground in Stablecoin Law The U.S. Senate just cleared a major hurdle by advancing the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 vote – the first stablecoin bill to make it this far. This bipartisan win came after last-minute tweaks and pressure from crypto advocates like Stand With Crypto. The bill lets private firms issue stablecoins and demands full backing with dollars or Treasury bills. While it bars foreign stablecoins on U.S. centralized exchanges, decentralized platforms remain untouched. Critics say the revisions are mostly cosmetic, leaving loopholes like weak data safeguards and possible regulatory capture. Big moves, but is it enough? #4 Pi Network’s $8M Scam: Pump, Dump, and Investor Fury! Pi Network is under fire with explosive $8 billion scam allegations after insiders reportedly dumped 12 million PI tokens. Blockchain sleuth Atlas points to a classic pump-and-dump move – sharp price surges followed by a brutal 50% crash post-May 14. Despite a bullish spike fueled by an 86 million token withdrawal from OKX (hinting at strong holder confidence), the price has since slumped to $0.79. The project also battles criticism over exchange listings, token distribution, and node centralization, raising serious questions about its future. Is it the end of the road for Pi? I hope not. #5 Blum Co-Founder Detained in Russia Big news out of Russia – Vladimir Smerkis, co-founder of the Telegram-based crypto project Blum and former head of Binance Russia, has been arrested in Moscow on large-scale fraud suspicions. The heat comes from his previous ventures, The Token Fund and Tokenbox, where investors reportedly lost around $15 million. While the investigation is ongoing and no formal charges are out yet, Russian courts have approved his detention. Blum quickly clarified that Smerkis resigned and is no longer connected to the project, distancing themselves from the scandal. #6 Cardano CEO Fires Back at $600M Allegations Charles Hoskinson is pushing back hard against claims he misused $600 million worth of ADA tokens. The drama centers on accusations that during Cardano’s 2021 Allegra hard fork, Hoskinson used a “genesis key” to control 619 million ADA. But he says most of the 350 million ADA involved were already redeemed over seven years, with the leftovers donated to Intersect, a Cardano-affiliated org. Feeling “deeply hurt” by the distrust, Hoskinson plans to release an audit report and might hand over his social channels to a media team to clear the air. #7 Nasdaq Welcomes First Ever XRP Futures ETF The wait is over – XRP stepped into the ETF spotlight with the launch of Volatility Shares’ XRPI ETF, trading on Nasdaq. This 1x XRP futures ETF offers a safer, measured way to access Ripple’s price action without holding the token directly. Analyst Eric Balchunas called it a “good signal” of growing demand for crypto investment vehicles. With leveraged XRP ETFs already firing up interest and CME’s recent XRP futures rollout, XRPI marks a new phase in XRP’s journey. I’m loving this one! #8 MSTR Holdings Surge as States Seek Bitcoin Proxy 14 US states revealed a collective $632 million stake in MicroStrategy (MSTR) during Q1 2025, marking a 42% jump from the previous quarter. California leads with $276 million, followed by Florida and North Carolina. Utah’s holdings skyrocketed 184%, while Wisconsin sold its $300 million Bitcoin ETF stake, increasing MSTR instead. This shows states prefer indirect Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy’s massive 576,230 BTC stash, avoiding direct crypto ownership complexities. #9 Who’s Buying USDC? Circle’s Next Move Circle, the powerhouse behind USDC, is stirring the pot with a $5 billion valuation price tag as it entertains acquisition talks. Ripple and Coinbase have both stepped into the ring, but Circle shot down Ripple’s XRP-heavy bid, citing concerns over liquidity and valuation mechanics. Meanwhile, talks with Coinbase are reportedly friendlier – “If Coinbase wanted to buy them, Circle would sell in a second,” insiders say. Despite these moves, Circle’s IPO ambitions remain alive but shaky, as broader market volatility and trade policies push the company to rethink timing. Big questions loom over USDC’s future path. #10 Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Passed Texas just got one step closer to becoming America’s Bitcoin bull state. Senate Bill 21 – which would establish a state-run Bitcoin Reserve – passed its final House vote, clearing 101-42. All that’s left is Governor Abbott’s signature, and the signs are strong. He even shared the proposal on X, and crypto voices like Kyle Chassé are already calling it: “It’s happening.” If Abbott signs before the June 2 deadline, Texas will follow New Hampshire as the second U.S. state with its own BTC stash. Trump’s vision is shaping up quite well. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! HSBC Goes Live with Tokenized Deposits: HSBC has officially launched its Tokenised Deposit Service in Hong Kong, enabling 24/7 fund transfers using blockchain tech. Ant International led the charge as the first client to go live. A Wall Street Stablecoin? Yep, It’s Being Discussed: Some of the biggest U.S. banks – including JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo – are reportedly discussing a joint stablecoin venture, according to WSJ. Early talks, but major implications if it lands. Crypto Meets Stocks, Powered by USDT: Bybit just launched stock trading with USDT via Metatrader 5, giving users access to Apple, Tesla, gold, forex, and crypto from one account. Multi-market action at its best. CZ Slams Trump Crypto Allegations: CZ has slammed the Wall Street Journal for linking him to Trump-backed crypto dealings, calling the report a “hit piece.” He flatly denied acting as a “fixer” or brokering any WLF meetings. Semler Bets the House on Bitcoin: Semler Scientific just dropped $50M on Bitcoin, boosting its stash to over 4,264 BTC. With losses mounting and a crypto-first strategy now official, this healthcare firm is betting big again. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead With Texas and other U.S. states doubling down on MicroStrategy and BTC reserves, expect a growing wave of state-led crypto strategies. A formal Bitcoin reserve could become a blueprint for other red states, especially under pro-crypto leadership. The launch of the XRPI ETF on Nasdaq signals that altcoin futures ETFs are gaining traction. With CME backing XRP and Ethereum products next in line, this could bring mainstream capital to major alts fast. The GENIUS Act may have passed its Senate hurdle, but its foreign token ban and loose guardrails could trigger lawsuits, revisions, or even state-level pushback.

The broader price structure remains trapped within a mid-range channel, and bulls are now looking for technical confirmation of a local bottom near the $0.36–$0.37 demand zone. However, momentum indicators show signs of fatigue, suggesting any bounce may face immediate overhead friction from recent breakdown levels. What’s Happening With Ethena (ENA)’s Price? Ethena (ENA) price analysis (Source: TradingView) The Ethena (ENA) price action this week has been marked by high volatility. After a failed breakout above the $0.42 resistance, ENA reversed sharply, plunging over 12% within 24 hours. This decline not only breached its short-term ascending trendline but also sliced below the 20 and 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart, dragging the asset into a bearish short-term setup. Currently, the price is consolidating between $0.36 and $0.38, a zone that aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level and also sits near the lower Bollinger Band.

Gold is often used as a signal in crypto circles, where a rise in gold prices often leads to a rise in crypto prices. Thus far, the trend has held. However, the percentage gains in the price of gold now, and in the coming weeks, pale in comparison to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is projected to offer a return of three times or higher in just the next few weeks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is A Better Buy Than Gold Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a new class of assets that promise to offer long-term and sustainable returns within the crypto sector. Unlike meme coins, which often lose value quite fast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating the future of finance through an ecosystem that offers mutual benefits to all participants. The main driver of this growth will be the genius Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending protocol that offers two different modes of lending. In one mode, called peer to peer (P2P), lenders can enter direct negotiations with borrowers. In the second mode called peer to contract (P2C), lenders deposit their assets in a pool, secured by an audited smart contract. These pooled assets can be accessed by borrowers using overcollateralized collateral. The yield that lenders receive from their assets is dynamically determined by market forces. For instance, when pool utilization rises, the yields increase, which prompts more people to deposit their assets. However, this also discourages borrowers from putting up their collateral to acquire loans. This push and pull in the dynamic yield rate ensures a middle ground is achieved for market efficiency. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stablecoin Is The Future Decentralized stablecoins have had mixed results in the past, despite their great promise to revolutionize the world of stablecoins. The solution provided by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could perfectly deal with the limitations of all other existing solutions. One of the notable aspects of the Mutuum Finance stablecoin is that borrowers provide liquidity. When they borrow the stablecoin via overcollateralized loans, the interest they pay flows into the revenue mechanism, helping to stabilize the entire system. The price of the stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar. Consequently, it offers borrowers a great opportunity to tap into the full potential of their assets, without having to liquidate them. As a result, during a bull run like the current one, they can still get the benefits of their value appreciation. A noteworthy aspect of the stablecoin is that it will feature multi-asset collateralization. In short, borrowers will be able to deposit a series of approved asset types and receive stablecoins in return. This is a more efficient model than the one currently used on most DeFi stablecoins. The existing solutions rely on single assets vaults, where each collateral type supports a separate position. With the ability to back a single position with a basket of assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has diversified the asset backing of its stablecoin, which is great for the long health of the ecosystem. Stability for the stablecoin’s pegged price is maintained through arbitrage. In this system, borrowers can buy or sell their positions to benefit from changes in price to the stablecoin. Over the long-term it ensures a smooth curve in the price fluctuation, which will closely mirror the price of the dollar. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Signals Strength The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in the fifth stage. Thus far, the token has managed to raise over $9,1 million, which provides plenty of room for development of a robust ecosystem. It will be the shining jewel of Decentralized finance (DeFi) once it launches. The project aims to reshape DeFi and open up capital access that has remained inaccessible to many in the crypto space. This vision is already resonating with the community, as shown by the strong support from over 11,000 holders to date. At the going price of $0.03 per token, this is truly a bargain, especially against the backdrop of the ongoing crypto market rally. In just a few days, the phase 5 presale will be complete, and the price will rise over 16% to $0.035 per token. As such, getting into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now could help you outperform the gold market in the coming weeks on listing day.

The spotlight is shifting toward altcoins with asymmetric upside—and smart money is zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano as the breakout contenders for 2025, while Ethereum and XRP remain core holdings for stability and long-term growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Standout With Explosive Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly ascending from under-the-radar presale to headline contender. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion, MAGA’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—has become a magnet for both retail and institutional capital. Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum holds. A recent $132,000+ whale buy highlights the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential, and with a $0.007 listing target and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Cardano: Technological Progress and Institutional Momentum Cardano (ADA) is making headlines with its breakout above $0.80, driven by technological innovation and expanding DeFi adoption. Analysts see potential for ADA to reach as high as $5.66 in 2025, citing upgrades like Hydra and growing institutional interest as key drivers. Cardano’s scientific approach and robust ecosystem are earning it a spot in the portfolios of forward-looking investors. As capital rotates into high-upside plays, many ADA holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to maximize portfolio growth. This strategic shift underscores the appetite for early-stage opportunities with exponential potential. Bitcoin: Institutional Adoption Fuels the Next Rotation Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000 is powered by unprecedented institutional inflows and spot ETF demand, with projections of $118,000–$131,000 in the near term and $200,000 as a plausible target for 2025. While BTC remains the benchmark for digital assets, its ROI potential is now more modest compared to emerging altcoins. As Bitcoin’s rally stabilizes, a growing share of capital is rotating toward high-multiple opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for growth-focused investors. Ethereum and XRP: Steady Anchors, But MAGA Steals the Show Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade between $2,500 and $2,600, anchoring DeFi and Web3 innovation. While ETH’s momentum has moderated, its upgrade cycle and institutional adoption keep it a portfolio mainstay. XRP is holding near $2.40–$2.65, buoyed by whale accumulation, ETF speculation, and regulatory clarity. Although both assets offer stability, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where analysts see a 13,000%–18,500% window for exponential returns. NEAR: Quiet Growth Amid the Rotation NEAR Protocol is quietly gaining traction, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 10x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion The 2025 crypto cycle is defined by a decisive shift in capital allocation. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP provide a stable foundation, the real excitement is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—where early-stage momentum and technological progress are driving the next wave of portfolio rotations. With Stage 8 of MAGA’s presale nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers, smart money is already positioning for what could be the most transformative altcoin run of the year.

45040714,https://invezz.com/?p=2731783,1748085000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Could this new DeFi token revolutionize the financial world,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/24/could-this-new-defi-token-revolutionize-the-financial-world/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most revolutionary DeFi projects of 2025. Still in the presale phase, it has grown into a juggernaut that is pulling in investors from all other major projects, such as XRP and Solana. So far, the project has attracted nearly 11,000 investors and over $9 million in funding, which will act as the fuel that takes it to the next level. The presale is currently in phase 5, with each token going for $0.03. This marks a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. However, even those who invest $1000 in the project right now are guaranteed a 100% return, with the listing price set at $0.06. Driven by the crypto market’s demand for utility, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hitting milestones way ahead of schedule, and after the final pre-sale phase, the token is expected to go live on some big crypto exchanges. Will Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 10X in value? The short answer is yes; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most valuable DeFi projects in recent memory. A major driver of this growth is the project’s utility, which promises to create numerous opportunities for investors to earn passive income from their assets. For instance, a user can deposit $8,000 worth of ETH and then sit back as their investment earns an annual percentage yield. The yield from each pool will be determined automatically by the utilization rate, which will ensure that investors get the most out of their earnings. Best of all, once they are ready to withdraw, they will get back the interest accrued plus all their initial capital. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from other existing DeFi projects is that lenders also get a share of the platform’s revenue. This is done through a simple process of buy back and return, where revenue is used to buy MUTM tokens from the market, and send them to lenders. The effect is that it increases the value of MUTM tokens on the open market, while also incentivizing new participants to join the ecosystem. Based on this massive utility, it is quite easy to see how MUTM tokens could see a 10X increase in value just a few days after launch. That means that a $1000 investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could turn into $10,000 in just a few weeks, or even days. Currently, even Bitcoin (BTC) cannot offer such returns. The reason for this is that Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at the top of the market, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) buyers will be getting in on the ground floor. Like the original Bitcoin (BTC) buyers who bought the tokens back in 2010 when they were worth just a few dollars, Mutuum Finance (MTM) has the potential to increase in value by 1000% in just a few weeks after launch. Join the $100K giveaway During the ongoing presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a giveaway during which they plan to reward their community with $100K worth of MUTM tokens. These tokens will be split amongst 10 winners, with each getting $10K. To get these rewards, you submit your wallet address, complete the simple quiz, and follow all steps to win the tokens. To be part of this giveaway, you will need to participate in the presale with at least $50 in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. For most investors in the presale, this is a shoo-in, as most have invested $1000 or more to maximize the possible returns when the project goes live. While there are many crypto projects to choose from, few offer the same level of utility and guaranteed returns as those available via Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with the added benefit of a potential $10K win, there is no reason to be left out of this opportunity.

Transactions worth tens of millions of dollars were concentrated especially on UNI, FARTCOIN, PEPE and TRUMP tokens. A whale has withdrawn 1.21 million UNI tokens (approximately $7.37 million) from the Binance exchange. This whale has attracted attention by withdrawing a total of 2.16 million UNI ($12.98 million) in the last 5 days. Around the same time, another whale sold 1.328 million FARTCOINs for $1.50, earning 1.99 million USDC. As a result of these transactions, it is estimated that he made a net profit of $1.07 million.

The whale, who deposited a total of 30.5 million USDC into Hyperliquid in the last 23 days, currently has only $6.98 million left on the platform. The whale with the short address “2WfeaM” bought TRUMP with 2 million USDC and FARTCOIN with 2 million USDC two days ago. Just 10 minutes ago, he sold both positions completely, making a net profit of $200,000.

Potential High: $250 Average Price Range: $200 Potential Low: $180 Solana Price Prediction 2025 According to Defillama , Solana’s dapp revenue has shot up over $50 million with a market share of 51.6%. On the other hand, the open interest against the price is at $6.9 billion. These strong on-chain metrics could play a pivotal role in pushing the SOL price to greater highs. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

The high-stakes meeting is part of the country’s move to establish itself as a regional hub for blockchain and AI. In addition, it is also part of a bigger strategy to harness the youthful demographic and surplus energy in the country as a tool for digital finance and, by extension, economic transformation. In attendance at the high-level meeting at the General Headquarters were Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and Bilal Bin Saqib, Chief Executive of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC). The pair discussed the potential of emerging technologies, with a focus on leveraging blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI to empower its youth and build economic reliance. Pakistan holds meeting to discuss blockchain and AI In the meeting , Bin Saqib, the chief executive of the PCC, mentioned that digital finance and decentralization offer the country countless opportunities and not threats. “The [PCC] exists because our youth demand a seat at the global tech table,” Saqib said at the meeting. The meeting is coming off the back of efforts to accelerate the regulatory framework of these emerging technologies in the country. The Ministry of Finance, on Wednesday, announced the formation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), a body that has been dedicated and tasked with overseeing blockchain infrastructure and the regulation of digital assets in the country. The move marks a major step towards formalizing a market that has been estimated to witness more than $300 billion in annual crypto trading volume. According to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the PDAA would be in charge of creating a secure, innovative, and inclusive ecosystem that will house digital assets. He also added that it will ensure that Pakistan is ranked high alongside other regional leaders in digital finance and blockchain regulation. He also added that the initiative will birth the facilitation of tokenization of public assets and government debt, regulate Bitcoin mining using surplus electricity, and provide legal clarity for global investors. A renewed shift towards a tech-led growth model The announcement signals a boost in the country’s shift towards a tech-led growth model. With about 70% of its 240 million population under the age of 30, Pakistan has one of the most favored demographics for digital adoption. It ranks among the top five countries globally in terms of crypto usage. In addition, the country ranks as the world’s third-largest freelancer market, with more than 50,000 IT graduates entering the workforce every year. During the meeting, Saqib discussed the recent PCC initiatives with the military leadership, including a global outreach with Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. It also discussed its exploits with World Liberty Financial, a decentralized platform that has links with United States President Donald Trump. He also mentioned the youth-first policy that the group has been looking into, emphasizing the need to channel the country’s tech-savvy workforce into scalable blockchain solutions and AI infrastructure. Some of the national strategies being looked into include allocating surplus electricity to power Bitcoin mining rigs and data centers. The meeting came before Saqib’s participation at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, where he is set to speak alongside other influential figures such as United States Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr. The event is expected to shape the future narratives on global crypto governance.

The sudden dip prompted huge liquidations in crypto futures markets totaling over $560 million. According to Coinglass figures, the decline resulted in the liquidation of 160,905 traders on major exchanges, with longs taking most of the loss. Breakdown of Liquidated Positions All $563.20 million worth of liquidated positions were dominated by longs, which took up $418.63 million. Shorts made up the remaining $144.35 million. The biggest single liquidation order was a BTC-USDT on OKX for $9.53 million. Bitcoin traders were hit the hardest, with liquidations of $153.04 million, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $144.19 million. Most of the liquidations in both assets took place on long positions. Trump’s Trade War Threat Spooks Market Further The price decline was followed by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he threatened to impose more tariffs on the European Union and Apple. The action spooked markets, especially risk-on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ETH fell from $2,731 highs to $2,508 lows, before rebounding to $2,574. The broader market reacted similarly, which highlights crypto’s sensitivity to geopolitical and macroeconomic signals. Relative Strength of Bitcoin Still Intact Followed by the volatility, Bitcoin’s breakout above $109K is still an indicator of strength. Having broken its prior ATH in November, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration, BTC has been resilient despite market volatility. This resiliency is likely driven by the growing perception of Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Institutional and retail investors both increasingly view BTC as an inflation hedge and acceptable replacement in the case of macro instability. Conclusion The recent wave of liquidations confirms the risk-on nature of crypto markets. Yet, the relative resilience of Bitcoin indicates its evolving role as a safe-haven asset amid escalating global tensions.",Bitcoin|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-24 11:27:21

Mutuum Finance is capturing attention with its ambitious roadmap and predictions of a 40–50x surge, positioning it as a top crypto to invest in over SHIB. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues as this high-growth altcoin sells at $0.03 and has collected $9.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.035 while attracting more than 11,000 investors. This phase’s investors will receive a 100% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. For investors looking beyond Bitcoin, these two could be pivotal plays in the 2025 crypto boom. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction: Can the Meme Coin Hit $0.0002 in 2025? Shiba Inu (SHIB), currently trading around $0.000015, remains a darling of meme coin investors and speculative traders. With its viral community-driven momentum and history of explosive price movement, SHIB is once again in the spotlight as analysts predict a potential run-up to $0.0002 in the next bull run. Recent updates in the Shibarium ecosystem, coupled with accelerating token burns and DeFi integrations, are fueling the bullish sentiment. As one of the best cheap cryptos to invest in now, SHIB has strong near-term upside potential, even for investors wondering what’s the best crypto to buy during periods of high volatility. As SHIB eyes its next leg higher, new tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also being watched by investors who are looking for high-growth altcoins. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 11,000 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $9.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price has currently reached $0.03 in Phase 5 even though investors anticipate a 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 which will generate considerable profit potential. Analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. More than $9.1 million raised and over 11,000 presale participants highlight the strong momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 5 buyers are set to double their investment as the token price targets $0.06 while experts predict a possible 50x surge in 2025. This opportunity represents a rare chance to get in early on a project combining cutting-edge DeFi innovation, transparency, and sustainable growth strategies. Presale spots are rapidly filling up, and once the launch occurs, the chance to capitalize on these gains will vanish. Act now—secure your MUTM tokens before this explosive growth opportunity slips away.

FLOKI could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong community and meme buzz, which can drive short-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 80x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Here’s What SOL Price Will Be Worth in 2025!,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/can-solana-break-the-180-resistance-heres-what-sol-price-will-be-worth-in-2025/,"The post Can Solana Break the $180 Resistance? Here’s What SOL Price Will Be Worth in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana was on its way to rise above the $185 resistance zone after the recent rebound from the local support below $170. Moreover, the star token, Bitcoin, making new highs above $111.8K, was believed to trigger the rest of the altcoins as well. While Ethereum made an entry above $2700 and Cardano surged above $0.82, it appeared that the bearish influence over the token could have faded to a large extent. Meanwhile, the increase in bearish activity, which dragged the BTC price below $107K , seems to have hindered the SOL price rally as well, which is now struggling to reach $180. Currently, the SOL price is down by more than 6% after touching the price zone between $180 and $190. Meanwhile, the token triggered a strong rebound from the local support close to $170 and is trying hard to push higher with renewed momentum. The recent rebound signals an increase in the buy-side interest that has triggered a recovery swing. Meanwhile, despite the pullback, the price remained within the pattern, which keeps the upside potential higher. In the long term, the SOL price remains within the rising wedge, while in the short term, the token is heading towards the end of the apex of the ascending triangle. However, the bulls have been prevented from reaching the lower support of the consolidation. The stochRSI has reached the lower support and is about to trigger a bullish reversal, while the MACD, which remains within a positive range, shows a drop in the selling pressure. Therefore, the Solana price is expected to maintain a healthy consolidation within the triangle for some more time, but along the upper resistance. The token is further believed to trigger a breakout before the end of the month and secure the range around $190. Although rising above $200 appears to be a tedious job for the SOL price, it may surely clear the barriers to reaching the range. With this, the Solana price prediction for 2025 remains bullish, with a possibility to rise and reach new highs above $500.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 11:31:59

According to her technical analysis, the digital asset is on the verge of testing a significant structural support zone between $2.25 and $2.26. This level aligns with the macro 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, marking it as a key area to watch in the short term. The current chart action follows a broader reaction across the crypto market, reportedly triggered by renewed macroeconomic pressure. CasiTrades noted that headlines surrounding tariffs contributed to the sudden rejection XRP faced near the 1:1 extension of the C wave. XRP On The Edge Of New Low- Critical Support Test Incoming! It’s been an eventful couple hours for the entire market, including $XRP – we’re heading straight into the crucial technical moment I was calling out… The reaction was triggered by a combination of macro… pic.twitter.com/vHRSOup0uY — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) May 23, 2025 Bearish Structure Confirmed on the Chart The hourly chart CasiTrades shared shows a symmetrical triangle pattern that resolved bearishly, as the price broke down from the consolidation zone and headed toward lower support levels. Momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), reveal a bearish divergence, reinforcing the downside pressure. While other analysts have shared bullish short-term targets , the RSI on CasiTrades’ chart shows lower highs while the price made equal or slightly higher highs, signaling weakening buying interest even before the breakdown. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Crucial Support Zone CasiTrades highlighted the $2.25–$2.26 zone as immediate and crucial support. This level has acted as structural support over the last six months, and its confluence with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level adds to its importance. The analyst emphasizes that whether the asset can hold this area will likely determine the short-term trajectory of the asset. A successful defense of this support could send it toward the $2.70 area, which sits just above the 0.236 Fibonacci extension that acts as a major overhead resistance level. Deeper Levels in Focus if Support Fails However, if the support breaks decisively, analysts may start focusing on deeper retracement levels. The next major support appears near $1.90, corresponding with the 0.5 macro retracement level, and then at $1.55, which marks the bottom range of prior consolidations. Both these levels were pivotal during past market phases, and CasiTrades noted that they could come back into focus in the event of a continued decline. XRP is currently trading at $2.31 after a minor dip from yesterday. Analysts have set lofty targets for the asset in this cycle, and traders will closely monitor the $2.25–$2.26 level to gauge whether bulls can reassert control or the consolidation will continue.

CZ is accusing the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of publishing another “hit piece” based on false information and negative intent. Negative Intentions and Inaccuracies In a May 23 X post , he claimed the media outlet’s reporting had changed into a textbook case of “Cunningham’s Law.” Zhao explained that a few days before the article was published, the company’s PR team had sent him several questions based on false assumptions. “We told them there were numerous inaccuracies and unfounded inferences,” he wrote. The publication asked his team to identify the errors, but he explained that a story can’t be corrected when built on negative intentions from the start. Among the claims made in WSJ’s inquiry was that CZ had helped WLF arrange meetings with government officials in Pakistan, Malaysia, and Kyrgyzstan. The article suggested that he introduced a Pakistani official, Mr. Saqib, to the WLF team. A week after his visit to the region, the crypto project named the man an adviser. Further, the Journal emphasized that on April 26, the WLF team traveled to Pakistan to sign an MOU with the government. However, the former exchange executive has denied these claims. “I am not a fixer for anyone,” he stated. He also clarified that he did not connect Mr. Saqib with the WLF team, pointing out that they already knew each other. Zhao added that he had met the Pakistani official for the first time during his stay in the country. The Binance co-founder also suggested that the WSJ article was part of a broader agenda to stop progress in the crypto industry. “There are forces in the U.S. that want to hinder efforts in making the U.S. the capital of crypto. They want to attack crypto, global crypto leaders, and the pro-crypto administration,” he claimed. A History of False Claims This isn’t the first time Zhao has accused WSJ of publishing false stories. In March, the newspaper shared that Trump’s family was in talks to invest in Binance.US and that the 48-year-old was seeking a presidential pardon. At the time, he described the article as politically motivated, suggesting it was an attempt to undermine the president and the crypto industry. However, he later acknowledged that he had formally applied for clemency from Trump. More recently, the former CEO dismissed allegations from a separate news piece that said he had agreed to provide evidence against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). CZ suggested the report might be tied to lobbying efforts aimed at damaging his and Binance’s reputation. Sun also rejected the claims, saying he was unaware of such rumors and referred to Zhao as his “mentor and close friend.” The post CZ Denies ‘Fixer’ Role in World Liberty Financial Deals appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Binance|Changpeng Zhao (CZ Binance)|Justin Sun|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-24 11:36:51

The SkyBridge Capital founder, who’s now penning a book titled Solana Rising , believes traditional finance is on the brink of a major upgrade, with Solana at the core. Bold claims but he’s backing it up with research, interviews with Wall Street CTOs, and conversations with Solana’s own Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. Here’s what you should know. A $7 Trillion Problem, and Solana’s Fix Scaramucci pointed to a staggering figure: nearly $7 trillion is spent globally on transaction verification . That inefficiency, he argues, is ripe for disruption. Solana’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure could cut those costs dramatically – something no traditional system has managed to do. “Think of Solana as the operating layer for real-world assets, in the same way Bitcoin is for money,” he said. Scaramucci sees Solana becoming one of the major financial rails for real-world asset tokenization. We’re talking from stocks to bonds and everything in between. On-Chain IPOs Could Break the Banking Barrier Here’s one of the boldest promises. IPOs that don’t require a bank account. “You don’t need a bank account to buy an IPO on-chain, just a wallet,” Scaramucci said. He compared blockchain-powered IPOs to traditional offerings that can rack up 7% in fees, arguing Solana’s system could offer the same functionality at a fraction of the cost, with much broader access. Institutional Adoption Is “Inevitable” Despite ongoing regulatory friction, Scaramucci insists big players are circling. He called out JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon as a cautious example, predicting major institutions will eventually custody and offer yield-bearing strategies using Solana and other Layer-1 assets. “Solana will be part of a financial system where you not only stake, but also lend your assets – earning yield like you would in traditional finance,” he added. SkyBridge is already working on such strategies. “Make Everyone an Investor” Scaramucci isn’t the only one highly bullish on Solana and its potential. Earlier this week, Solana Foundation’s Akshay BD laid out a broader vision: universal micro-ownership through tokenization . The current financial model, he argued, locks out most retail investors. “Solana could make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time,” he said – especially in a world where low bond yields and overvalued markets leave few appealing options. Here’s the bottom line: Solana is not a niche project anymore. It’s gunning for Wall Street. And if the industry signals are anything to go by, the shift might be here soon.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 11:43:03

According to an analysis by TradingShot , historical trends and technical setups suggest that Bitcoin might reach the $200,000 mark toward the end of this year, as per a May 23 TradingView post . Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In the outlook, TradingShot emphasized that Bitcoin is currently experiencing its weakest bull cycle to date, a natural consequence of the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TDM). This theory posits that as markets mature, the magnitude of returns tends to slow. While Bitcoin’s earlier cycles witnessed explosive growth, more recent ones have been comparatively moderate yet notable. To illustrate this, TradingShot overlaid Bitcoin’s previous bull cycles (2009–2011, 2012–2013, 2015–2017, 2019–2021). The comparison revealed a transition from aggressive early growth to a more consistent pattern, resembling movements in traditional financial markets. Interestingly, the 2015 to 2017 and 2019 to 2021 cycles showed similar upward paths, with temporary divergences eventually returning to the broader trend. Bitcoin tracking past cycles Looking ahead, the ongoing cycle appears to be tracking within an upward channel. After a projected divergence in February 2025, Bitcoin is expected to realign with its historical trend. The recent six-week rebound further supports this outlook. Based on these patterns, TradingShot forecasts that Bitcoin’s cycle peak will likely occur between October and December 2025, with a potential price range of $150,000 to $200,000. “Based on past cycles, it should be within October – December 2025. Timing your exit strategy can perhaps be more effective than assigning a certain Target, even though the peak is expected to be anywhere within the $150k – $200k range,” the expert said. It’s worth noting that, after surpassing a new record high above $111,000, analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin could maintain this momentum in the coming weeks. For instance, as reported by Finbold, veteran trader Peter Brandt stated that following this breakout, Bitcoin’s technical formation indicates the possibility of reaching $150,000 by August 2025. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Gert van Lagen made another bullish projection. In a May 24 post on X, he explained that Bitcoin has historically followed a clear exponential path, rising from $1 to over $100,000 through recurring bullish patterns such as cup-and-handle formations.

Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $108,811, down over 2% in the last 24 hours. However, on a weekly basis, the asset has climbed more than 5%.

The decision comes as the blockchain network prepares for an on-chain governance vote to decide whether to implement a protocol upgrade for fund recovery. Following Wednesday’s action by Sui ( SUI ) validators to freeze stolen assets, Cetus has formally requested community approval for a protocol upgrade that would return the locked funds without reversing transaction history or rolling back the blockchain. You might also like: Cetus Protocol hack and Sui exploit: The full story behind the $260 million breach Sui validators coordinated emergency freeze The Sui validator network responded quickly to the security breach by implementing emergency measures to prevent further asset drainage. Over one-third of validators by stake weight ignored transactions from two addresses believed connected to the attack. This effectively immobilized approximately $162 million worth of digital assets. On Wednesday, the Sui validator community acted quickly to freeze $162M of the stolen funds. Here’s how that happened: – Each validator has a configuration file that allows it to ignore transactions from a specific address. – Adding addresses to this file is at the discretion… https://t.co/pVLTItN0MH — Sui (@SuiNetwork) May 23, 2025 The freezing mechanism operates through individual validator configuration files that allow nodes to exclude specific addresses from transaction processing. Each validator maintains discretionary control over this function, which can be activated or reversed independently based on individual risk assessments or compliance requirements. While validators successfully prevented the attacker from bridging a substantial portion of the stolen funds off the Sui network, approximately $60 million in assets had already been moved before the freeze took effect. Cetus has mentioned it is collaborating with Inca Digital, security firms, and international law enforcement agencies to recover the remaining compromised funds. The Sui Foundation shared two conditions for supporting the community vote process. First, the foundation will maintain complete neutrality regarding the outcome. They stressed its role as a facilitator rather than a decision-maker for community governance. Second, Cetus must publicly commit to deploying all available financial resources toward full customer restitution. “This is an extraordinary request in response to extraordinary need – Cetus’s customer funds are at stake,” the Sui Foundation stated. Cetus has expressed willingness to respect whatever decision emerges from the community vote. They noted that “no one can make this decision unilaterally.” The protocol upgrade vote will involve major network participants, including validators and SUI token stakers. Cetus had also offered a $6 million bounty to the hacker to retrieve the funds.

Prices jumped past $109,000, a high not seen since January. Bitcoin even touched $111,980 on May 22. Investors piled in as the rally took hold. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge According to Farside data, spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $2.75 billion this week, up sharply from $608 million the week before. That big jump came as Bitcoin pushed past its January all-time high of $109,000. On May 21, investors added $607 million, the same day Bitcoin hit a new peak. Then, on May 22, the coin soared to $111,980. Those moves show money chasing fresh highs. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Flows Based on reports, ETF flows on May 23 totaled just $212 million, but BlackRock’s IBIT was the only one in the green. It brought in $431 million all by itself, and that stretched its inflow streak to eight days straight. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC saw $89 million leave, and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB lost $74 million. Investors seem to favor the low fees and wide reach of the biggest funds. Market Sentiment Pulls Back Bitcoin’s climb paused a bit after that. At publication, it traded near $108,150. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid from an “Extreme Greed” reading of 78 down to 66, or “Greed.” That dip hints at some profit-taking. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan said on May 22 that “overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” His view is that this rally hasn’t been driven by risky bets.

That steady demand underlines how ETFs have become the go-to way for many to own Bitcoin without wrestling with wallets and private keys. Demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has grown fast. Investors like simple, regulated products. The big issuers, led by BlackRock, have the best chance to stay on top. As for Bitcoin itself, if sentiment cools, prices might pull back some.

However, while many attendees at the event remained unknown to the public, a few high-profile guests appeared for the cameras. Guests included former basketball star Lamar Odom, crypto entrepreneur, and Tron founder Justin Sun. Trump Memecoin Gala Sees High-Profile Attendees Attendees posted details about the dinner on X, revealing some details and disappointment. The gala was held at Trump’s golf course outside Washington DC, with over 220 top TRUMP memecoin holders, including Justin Sun and Lamar Odom in attendance. Odom took to X to hype up the TRUMP memecoin, stating, “I’m just about to pass through security and officially walk into the Trump Gala. Honestly, I’m fired up. Think about it—what meme coin has ever done this?” Other VIP guests included Tron founder Justin Sun . Chinese-born Sun, a crypto billionaire who feared arrest in the US, also attended the event. Sun revealed he is the largest holder of the TRUMP memecoin and thanked Trump for his support to the industry. “As the top holder of $TRUMP and proud supporter of President Trump, it was an honor to attend the Trump Gala Dinner by @GetTrumpMemes. Thank you, @POTUS, for your unwavering support of our industry!” The President also gave a speech blaming the previous administration for going after crypto. Trump stated, “The past administration made your lives miserable. They were going after everybody. It was a disgrace frankly.” A Barrage Of Criticism Trump’s memecoin gala drew sharp criticism from lawmakers who accused the President of selling access to foreign governments and putting the US national security at risk. Senator Elizabeth Warren was vocal in her criticism, stating, “Donald Trump’s dinner is an orgy of corruption. That’s what this is all about. We are here today to talk about exactly one topic: corruption, corruption in its ugliest form. Donald Trump is using the presidency of the United States to make himself richer through crypto, and he’s doing it right out there in plain sight. He is signaling to anyone who wants to ask for a special favor and is willing to pay for it exactly how to do that.” Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and Rep. Sam Liccardo of California, and advocacy organizations criticized the event, with Blumenthal stating, “Donald Trump is selling access. He is selling out America. He is selling it to foreign powers. He is putting our national security at risk.” Trump’s Crypto Involvement Complicating Regulatory Efforts President Trump’s involvement in crypto has complicated efforts to advance bills and regulate the crypto industry. When asked if the list of attendees would be made public, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the White House did not host the event. “This question has been raised with the President. I have also addressed the dinner tonight. The President is attending it in his personal time. It is not a White House dinner. It's not taking place here at the White House.” Meanwhile, House Financial Committee Republican French Hill said Trump’s crypto involvement has complicated regulatory efforts as he attempts to pass a crucial stablecoin bill in the House. Hill stated he viewed the dinner as a distraction, “I view the dinner last night as, you know, whatever, that to me, is a distraction from the work I think we need to do for the major big picture macro policy.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The flagship cryptocurrency dropped nearly 4% on Friday, plunging to a low of $106,816 before rebounding to current levels. BTC is down over 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $108,200. Bitcoin (BTC) And Altcoins Register Sharp Decline Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $106,816 on Friday, erasing substantial gains made earlier this week. The crash coincided with the sell-off in the stock market as futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 fell over 1%, continuing a sell-off that began on Monday. The crypto market retreated as trade war concerns emerged after a Truth Social post in which President Trump said trade talks with the EU were going nowhere and warned of a 50% tariff on all goods from the region. The statement escalated trade tensions at a time when markets were hoping for a deal between the trade partners. The EU has hinted it will respond by hiking tariffs on US goods, including Boeing jets. Ryanair’s CEO has already warned the company is considering canceling a $33 billion order from Boeing and switching to Airbus if Boeing planes are hit by tariffs. The trade war concerns return a week after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating and as the House of Representatives voted on the “Big Beautiful Bill” which will increase US debt by over $3.8 trillion in a decade. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Strong Inflows US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a total of $2.75 billion in inflows this week as Bitcoin surged past $110,000 and set a new all-time high. The inflows were almost 4.5 times larger than the previous week’s inflows of $608 million, according to data from Farside. Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $211 million on May 23. However, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only fund that posted gains during the trading day, adding $430 million and extending its inflow streak to eight consecutive days. Meanwhile, Grayscale saw outflows of $89 million, while ARK21 Shares saw outflows worth $73.9 million. Only two days prior, Bitcoin ETFs registered $607 million in inflows, the same day the flagship cryptocurrency surged past its previous all-time high. However, BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday as market sentiment declined. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out that Bitcoin is not showing any signs of overheating despite surging to a new all-time high, indicating the price could rise higher. An analyst from CryptoQuant stated, “Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 as it finally crossed the $110,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency consolidated around higher levels as it entered a price discovery phase after crossing into uncharted territory. Analysts expected BTC to continue its uptrend and push towards $115,000 and possibly $120,000. However, markets turned bearish on Friday after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on all goods imported from the European Union after posting on Truth Social that trade talks with Europe were not going anywhere. The EU also threatened retaliatory tariffs as trade war tensions resurfaced, panicking markets. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency plunged nearly 4% on Friday, falling to an intraday low of $106,816. BTC traded in a narrow range between $100,000 and $105,000 as buyers struggled to build momentum. The price declined 1.04% on Monday (May 12), before rebounding on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123. The price fell back into the red on Wednesday after a marginal decline and settled at $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, facing considerable selling pressure. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 before recovering to settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the negative start to the week, the price rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. BTC continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,582. However, price action turned bearish on Friday as markets plunged. As a result, BTC fell nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. The current session sees BTC up almost 1% as it looks to build momentum and reclaim $110,000.

Schiff Says Central Banks Have Made Their Choice,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-or-gold-schiff-says-central-banks-have-made-their-choice/,"The post Bitcoin or Gold? Schiff Says Central Banks Have Made Their Choice appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The age-old debate between Bitcoin and gold is heating up again and economist Peter Schiff wants to weigh in. In a recent X post , Schiff, a staunch Bitcoin critic, spotlighted the growing trend of central banks worldwide stocking gold reserves, strengthening their timeless value amid global economic uncertainty. With geopolitical uncertainties , crypto scams, and shifting economic policies moving demand, Schiff claims gold’s stability, Trump’s pro-crypto policies , and Bitcoin’s volatility, sparking fresh discussion among investors. Why Central Banks Are Choosing Gold Over Bitcoin In Schiff’s latest commentary, he took a direct jab at Bitcoin advocates by asking: If Bitcoin is the future, why are central banks betting on gold to replace the dollar? That question cuts to the heart of an ongoing shift in the global financial system. With fears of U.S. dollar devaluation and escalating geopolitical risks, foreign central banks are turning to gold – not crypto – as their hedge. According to a Reuters report, central banks are now buying more than 1,000 metric tons of gold annually – double the average of the previous decade. And the momentum isn’t slowing down. Michael Widmer, a strategist at Bank of America, says emerging market central banks currently hold just 10% of their reserves in gold but should be targeting 30% for greater financial protection. Trump, Tariffs, and the Rise of Gold Demand Peter Schiff also ties this growing demand for gold to the current U.S. administration. With President Donald Trump back in office and pushing aggressive tariff policies, countries are looking to shield their economies from potential fallout. As the dollar weakens, the appeal of gold rises. And in times of uncertainty – from trade wars to banking collapses – central banks want assets that stand the test of time. Russia Leads the Gold Playbook Russia has been ahead of the curve. Between 2014 and 2020 , the Russian central bank hoarded gold to buffer itself from Western sanctions. Today, its Ministry of Finance is reportedly continuing that accumulation – buying from domestic producers and quietly strengthening reserves. This playbook is being adopted by other emerging economies as well, reinforcing Schiff’s argument that gold’s legacy value is far from obsolete. So, if Bitcoin truly is the future, why aren’t central banks buying it? .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Ripple and XRP Could Be the Backbone of The G20’s Financial Plan? , Bitcoin’s Volatility vs. Gold’s Stability Schiff didn’t stop at praising gold. He also took a swing at Bitcoin’s unpredictability. He warned that American investors – who collectively hold nearly half of all Bitcoin – may be in for a rude awakening as the price swings continue and global institutions remain cautious. At the time of writing, gold trades at $3,357.4 per ounce, up 1.82% for the day but slightly down over the month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is priced at $108,148 – down 2.31% in the last 24 hours, though it’s seen a 17% jump over the month. Despite the short-term surge, Schiff argues that Bitcoin lacks the long-term security central banks crave. Ran Neuner Weighs In: Could Bitcoin Still Outshine Gold? Not everyone agrees with Schiff’s stance. CNBC’s Ran Neuner recently suggested that Bitcoin could outperform gold in the long run as a safe-haven asset – especially amid advancements in blockchain tech and increasing institutional adoption. But Schiff remains skeptical. He also criticized the growing use of stablecoins in the U.S., pointing to the regulatory fog. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Is Bitcoin going to replace gold? Unlikely in the short term—Bitcoin lacks the institutional trust and stability gold has built over centuries as a global safe-haven asset.

Judge overturns fraud convictions in Mango Markets exploit case A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets. The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case. Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform. US judge siding with Eisenberg on nature of the exploit. Source: Bwbx.io Bitcoin ETFs post $2.75B in weekly inflows as price sits above $108K US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) have recorded a total of $2.75 billion in inflows this week amid Bitcoin surpassing its January all-time high of $109,000. The $2.75 billion inflow total was nearly 4.5 times larger than the spot Bitcoin ETF’s previous week’s $608 million in inflows, according to Farside data. On May 23, the final day of the trading week, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $211.7 million in inflows. However, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only fund to post gains in the trading day, adding $430.8 million and extending its inflow streak to eight consecutive days. Grayscale’s GBTC led outflows with $89.2 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $73.9 million. US House members call for investigation into Trump's memecoin dinner Members of the US House of Representatives called for the Justice Department to investigate Donald Trump’s May 22 dinner for his top memecoin investors, citing concerns about “foreign influence over US policy decisions” and “potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” The call for an investigation and a press conference asking Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner both occurred hours before the event, which was held at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. A group of protesters, joined by Senator Jeff Merkley, gathered outside the venue with signs stating “illegal crypto party” and “democracy is not for sale.”",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-24 12:24:23

Solaxy (SOLX), a Solana-based Layer 2 solution, has raised nearly $40 million as it positions itself as the first to bring off-chain processing efficiency to the Solana network. Meanwhile, PEPETO, a frog-themed memecoin with a utility-packed roadmap, is crossing major presale milestones at a price point still accessible to early investors. Solaxy’s Tech-Driven Mission Solaxy’s promise lies in its novel approach to boosting Solana’s network performance. Using “royal technology,” the platform processes transactions off-chain, then sends bundled results back to the chain for final confirmation. This minimizes gas fees, accelerates transaction speed, and reduces strain on the base layer. Recent technical milestones—like its Testnet Bridge launch and partnership with Hyperlane—have added credibility to Solaxy’s goal of connecting Solana with Ethereum and enabling cross-chain token movement. However, despite Solaxy’s impressive vision, it faces a competitive layer-2 landscape with high technical demands, slower retail adoption, and long-term development timelines. Why PEPETO Might Outrun Solaxy PEPETO, however, races in a whole race: a race relying on meme culture, staking rewards, and going viral in the community. At present, the PEPETO price is 0.000000107, having raised more than $4.1 million dollars. But it is not just famous for being a meme coin. The PepetoSwap exchange, zero-fee trading, and a cross-chain bridge already make it different from other meme coins. Investors are considering it the next 100x project thanks to the staking APY of a whopping 350%. PEPETO is not like many other tokens that are only about hype, this is useful and fun. With Elon Musk’s X profile of a frog and the series of frog coins like Pepe Unchained and Wall Street Pepe, PEPETO couldn't have launched at a better time. Because it’s a funny, useful, and scarce coin, Zuck will make a great speculative bet for both meme coin veterans and noobs. A Race of Tech vs. Hype? Or Something Bigger? While Solaxy represents the kind of innovation that can reshape blockchain ecosystems, its path to adoption will likely be gradual. PEPETO, however, is perfectly positioned to capture the fast-paced, sentiment-driven gains typical of meme coin seasons. The key difference? Time. Solaxy may win in the long run with institutional backing and dev-focused traction. But PEPETO is built for the now—with retail enthusiasm, viral branding, and a presale that’s heating up fast. To participate in the ongoing presale or to start staking PEPETO, visit PEPETO’s official website . ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

A new report highlights that Ripple’s XRP and blockchain payment tech could play a key role in helping the G20 meet its cross-border payment goals by 2030. Source: U.S. Faster Payments Council A 2025 report from the U.S. Faster Payments Council (FPC) highlights how U.S. payment companies could play a big role in making global payments faster, cheaper, and more reliably. Global demand is rising for faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments, and it’s already a $34 trillion market. The G20 is pushing hard to improve this space, seeing it as key to boosting trade, economic growth, and development. They plan to make payments quicker, more affordable, and easier to access. Goals For 2017 and 2030- They have set clear targets for retail, wholesale, and remittance payments, and aim for major progress by 2027 and 2030. The 2027 and 2030 goals include cutting the cross-border payment costs to 1% or less and ensuring 75% of payments are completed within an hour.

It also stressed points like focusing on financial inclusion and promoting inter-industry collaborations. It specifically noted Ripple and Stellar as key players that could improve the global cross-border payment landscape. Ripple is reshaping global payments with its RippleNet and XRP-powered tech. As it follows global rules (like ISO 20022) and uses smart blockchain tools, it’s a top pick to help the G20 hit its payment goals. As more firms adopt Ripple’s solutions, XRP could see big gains from the rising demand. With growing adoption, experts predict $XRP will hit $10-$20 easily in 2025 . Reaching $100 could happen, but it is more likely in early 2026. And eventually, as the technology and network expand further, $XRP could reach $1,000. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While Solaxy boasts impressive capital inflow, Wall Street Ponke’s innovation and investor-centric model signal far greater upside. The two projects show contrasting strengths, but WPONKE's multi-layered strategy makes its 100x growth potential more realistic. Wall Street Ponke: More Than Just a Meme Coin Wall Street Ponke raised over $300,000 in its first presale week, showing clear investor interest. Unlike other meme coins, it offers investors protection, education, and staking rewards in one place. Thanks to these features, investors believe more in the token's true usefulness, rather than only being drawn by the buzz already created. The system quickly checks all new token launches by analyzing the code in their smart contracts. The tool helps inform WPONKE holders about scams and rug pulls, adding more value and security. Consequently, it gives the project an advanced safety level usually lacking in meme coins. Users can learn DeFi and blockchain basics by using various interactive and game-like lessons. The initiative serves new traders and also creates loyal relationships with investors. Getting education and strong staking incentives helps people hold onto their tokens longer. You can get up to a 1232% APY rate when you stake on WPONKE. Being active and learning in the ecosystem gives users incentives which is built into the system. As a result, people get deeply involved in the community, not just buy something and forget it. Solaxy: High Momentum, But Questions Remain Solaxy’s presale is nearing $40 million with strong daily contributions, driven partly by Solana’s rising price. The token price goes up every two days, making early buyers feel they need to take action quickly. Even so, the potential value of the token down the road has yet to be established. Staking on Solaxy offers 101% APY, but the smart contract's rate adjusts based on deposit activity. Early contributors get some benefits, but it doesn’t guarantee that the community will continue to develop. Unlike WPONKE, token utility and special value offerings are only in their early stages. The promise of exchange listings and the hype around Solana fuel Solaxy’s rapid presale pace. Nevertheless, overpricing is caused more by external forces than by the actual strength of the investment. However, WPONKE is constructing its site from within, with clear structure and a focus on users. While Solaxy’s numbers impress, WPONKE offers deeper utility and stronger fundamentals. Because it has a detailed strategy, it can be more than just a meme project.

Its novel innovations in decentralized finance offer investors access to opportunities where they can earn an interest on their existing assets, without having to engage in complex spot trading. Essentially, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating an entire lending market that offers the same level of capital efficiency as mainstream financial platforms. It will ensure that lenders get the best rates out of their assets, without having to rely on third parties to generate yields from their assets. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending protocol Seeking to meet the needs of the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch with two modes for its lending protocol. In the first mode, called peer-to-contract (P2C), lenders will have access to lending pools where they can deposit $10,000 worth of ETH, for instance, and earn passive income from it. The percentage yield they can earn from their deposit will be determined by the pool’s utilization rate. Consequently, it will ensure that they get higher benefits when demand for their asset rises. The other mode is the peer-to-peer (P2P) mode. In this mode, investors can hold direct negotiations with borrowers to lend out assets that have less liquidity, like the PEPE meme coin. The project will thus help to unlock passive income opportunities for assets that have traditionally had no such opportunities due to their low liquidity. Over the long term, this will help to unlock billions of dollars’ worth of value that is currently lying dormant in wallets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is booming For most projects launched in 2025, interest in them only develops after the project goes live, and the investors already have their tokens secured. However, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) value proposition is so unique that the project is already generating massive amounts of buzz even before it goes live. For instance, checking its Twitter (X) handle, one will find that the project already has over 10k followers. Some of the projects that have been around for years have not managed to raise such huge followings yet. It points to the massive support this project has garnered. So far, nearly 10K followers have bought into the presale, raising over $9 million in just a few weeks. At the rate the presale is going, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team expects to wrap it up much faster than previously predicted. The presale is in phase 5, with each token currently going for $0.03. With a planned listing price of $0.06, that is a guaranteed 100% increase for those who buy in now. However, none of the current buyers plan to sell their tokens on listing day. A major reason for this is that the team, seeing the massive support for the presale, has decided to launch the beta version of the platform on the same day the token goes live. This will serve as a major technology demonstrator and convince those who are still on the sidelines that now is the time to jump in. That buy pressure on listing day is expected to push up the price at least 10x to $0.6 per token, with $1 expected over the coming days. As such, most of the early investors are eyeing returns of at least 2000%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has financial independence By using the presale route, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also been able to avoid the pitfall of other Defi projects. These projects often have to contend with the special interest of venture capitalists, which greatly limits the capabilities they can launch. It also often means they charge unreasonably high fees, limiting the benefits that stakers and other platform users can derive. On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), there is no such limitation, the developer team is fully committed to meeting the needs of their community and no one else. Their vision of an independent lending protocol with low fees, and fast capital efficiency will ensure that the only true beneficiaries are the MUTM token holders, and the platform’s stakers.

Krüger tells his 210,500 followers on the social media platform X that he is expecting Bitcoin to hit $120,000 in June. According to the widely followed economist and trader, the proposed distribution of approximately $5 billion to creditors of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX at the end of May will serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. Krüger thinks that the funds will re-enter the crypto market as the creditors will mostly be the large claim holders. But the economist warns that Bitcoin could turn bearish in early July amid the uncertainty caused by the dispute over tariffs. “The 90-day tariffs pause *could* be a significant bearish catalyst. That’s on July 9th. Depending on White House news flow, it makes sense for markets to start getting anxious about tariffs again two to three weeks before then.” In contrast with Krüger’s largely bullish view of Bitcoin over the short term, crypto analyst Justin Bennett says the flagship digital asset could drop below $100,000 after failing to convincingly take out its last resistance at around $110,000. “No change to this BTC analysis other than starting to break down. I shorted at $111,269. I’ll add below $106,000 if we get it. Looking for $96,000/$97,000.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading at $107,435 at time of writing, down from the all-time high of just under $112,000 reached earlier this week.

Many of the top crypto coins are already rallying, which creates the perfect conditions to identify the next major winner before it takes off. Thus far, crypto enthusiasts have settled on two promising projects, which are Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano’s (ADA) rise Cardano (ADA) has been around for a few years now, which speaks to its quality as a DeFi project. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will incorporate all the legacy features developed by the project with the latest breakthroughs in DeFi for a truly unique ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is raising the stakes in the crypto world, and the crypto sector is eagerly awaiting its launch. Additionally, this new project offers prospective buyers the rare opportunity to be part of a truly innovative platform at just a few cents per token. The rise of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance (MUTRM) has been quietly innovating in the background, and is now ready to emerge as top contender for the DeFi throne. This project offers both massive growth potential, and great utility for its users. The project is currently in phase 5 of its presale, and has managed to raise over $9,2 million, from over 11,000 buyers. This phase of the presale is less than 24 hours old, and over 2% of the tokens designated for it have already been snapped up by eager investors. In the next phase, the token price will rise to $0.035, and gradually keep rising until the listing price of $0.06. With such a high demand for the token, there is no doubt that keeping a close eye on it is in your best interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) marks a major turning point for DeFi lending In every technology devised through all of time, the one aspect that leads to mass adoption is innovation. Here, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project excels. What sets it apart is the implementation of a dual lending mechanism in a hybrid ecosystem where lenders and investors can participate without interference from third parties. All transactions are governed by smart contracts, which ensure safe and automated passive income opportunities. The first of these two mechanisms is peer-to-peer (P2P). Under this mechanism, lenders interact directly with a borrower, with a focus on more volatile assets like the PEPE meme coin. The lender can set their own yield terms, and other parameters like the due date. In the second mechanism, called peer-to-contract (P2C), lenders deposit assets in a smart contract, where they collectively supply liquidity to borrowers. These borrowers can access overcollateralized loans at a rate set by market forces. For instance, as pool utilization rises, so does the interest rate. The rise motivates more lenders to deposit assets, while at the same time keeping borrowers from taking up more loans. The positive feedback loop ensures long-term stability in yields for stakers. Lenders who place their assets in pools via P2C are awarded mtTokens. For instance, if they deposit $1,500 worth of DAI, they would receive mtDAI tokens of a corresponding value. Additionally these mtTokens value will dynamically rise based on the interest accrued within the liquidity pool. Users can also use these mtTokens as collateral to borrow other assets, and they can withdraw the principal plus interest by depositing these tokens in the corresponding pool. Built-In scalability and cost control To overcome the common challenge of runaway costs on layer 2 (L2), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to deal with the main cause of the issue, which is calldata. Their solution is both simple and elegant; they simply compress all the needed information into one byte-encoding string to reduce on-chain storage, thus cutting transaction costs. They may also implement specialized contract logic that ensures transactions are efficient and affordable. Through these innovations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to offer a fast, cost effective user experience on L2 chains, which is in line with its goal of mass scalability, and accessibility for all ecosystem participants. Using dividends to fuel growth Another unique aspect of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer rewards to its stakers, which is akin to dividends. These rewards will be in the form of fees from various functions within the ecosystem, which are used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to stakers. This is double edged innovation, which serves to incentivize more stakers to join the ecosystem, while pushing up the price of MUTM tokens. Join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) future The best part about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is that prices are still at the ground floor. In the current phase 5, tokens are on sale for just $0.03, with the price set to rise to $0.035 in the upcoming phase 6. Joining now could be a great opportunity to be a participant, and not simply a spectator, in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Gains Traction The Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill got a major boost when Governor Greg Abbott endorsed SB 21 on May 22. SB 21 passed the Texas House recently and proposes creating a state Bitcoin reserve. Abbott’s support, in line with his goal to make Texas a crypto hub by 2024, puts the state alongside Arizona and New Hampshire in pro-crypto legislation. Texas is positioning #Bitcoin as a state-level strategic asset. Governor Greg Abbott signals support for a bill to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/C7pvktZ66K — TFTC (@TFTC21) May 23, 2025 Meanwhile, Congress has yet to pass national Bitcoin reserve measures, despite a prior executive order under former President Trump. A state-driven Bitcoin reserve would give investors a lot of confidence, and this could be the catalyst for BTC to break past $110K. Crackdown on Crypto Scams Boosts Market Confidence On May 23, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that $2.5 million in stolen cryptocurrencies has been recovered from scams targeting FOMO investors. The FBI’s San Diego branch coordinated the recovery, which was ordered by a federal judge. ""A large number of validators identified the addresses with the stolen funds and are ignoring transactions on those addresses until further notice."" HUH? pic.twitter.com/pTbywpBT5k — JSHy | Josh Marchand (@JSHyCS) May 22, 2025 These scams preyed on inexperienced investors with promises of high returns. The recovery highlights the government’s growing efforts to clean up the crypto market. These regulatory crackdowns, with the help of firms like Tether, will increase public trust in digital assets. As transparency and enforcement rise, the crypto market becomes more attractive and could fuel Bitcoin’s rise. Institutional Adoption Soars with Semler’s $50M Bitcoin Buy And to top it all off, Semler Scientific bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing their total holdings to 455 BTC, now worth $474.4 million. BULLISH: Semler Scientific acquired 174 #Bitcoin worth $17.8M, yielding 22.2% $BTC returns YTD, now holding a total of 3,808 $BTC . pic.twitter.com/AHOlUk7INK — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 14, 2025 The company’s stock dropped 1.36% after the announcement, but has gained 53% since they started buying Bitcoin in May 2024, despite quarterly revenue declines of 44%. Semler’s aggressive Bitcoin buying is part of a bigger trend of companies treating BTC as a treasury asset. This increases market stability by bringing in more institutions and reducing supply—something that could push prices up. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish as on the 2-hour chart, BTC has a higher-low pattern supported by the 50-period EMA ($108,470) and the trendline from $105,905–$107,048. Resistance is at $109,613 (23.6% Fibonacci) and a breakout could go to $111,935 or $113,478. Look for bullish candlestick patterns like three white soldiers or RSI divergence to confirm the uptrend. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the BTC/USD pair hovers near $108K, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

45042650,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68302,1748091080,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bloomberg Says XRP is Taking Center Stage. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/bloomberg-says-xrp-is-taking-center-stage-heres-why/,"Riz XRP (@RizXRP), a well-known advocate for XRP, recently shared a Bloomberg video, stating that the asset is taking center stage. The video highlighted the sharp rise in the asset’s value and the renewed attention it has received from investors and institutions. It also drew attention to XRP’s dramatic surge in November 2024, gaining over 400% within three weeks. According to Bloomberg, the rally was primarily driven by growing optimism that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would soon reach a favorable conclusion in the Ripple lawsuit. The surge began shortly after the former SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, announced his resignation date , coupled with the excitement for a new pro-crypto SEC Chair. Is #XRP about to take center stage? Bloomberg. pic.twitter.com/Y3OTiB9pPY — RIZ.. (@RizXRP) May 23, 2025 The regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP has been a central issue for years, but it is near its end. Ripple and the SEC have reached a settlement agreement and are working to make it official with the court. Bloomberg noted that XRP has “remained consistent” in its strength following the November breakout, which has helped push the coin into broader focus among cryptocurrency participants. Institutional Momentum and Market Expansion The video also shows several structural factors behind the increasing demand for XRP. One key advantage is its rapid settlement capability, offering average transaction times between three and five seconds, while some other networks might take hours . This speed is particularly appealing in the realm of cross-border payments, where efficiency and scalability are valued by financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another factor driving attention is speculation about imminent spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If approved, such a fund would expand access to XRP for institutional and retail investors, potentially enhancing its adoption rate. Multiple spot ETF applications are awaiting approval from the SEC, and the increased visibility and legitimacy that an ETF would provide are seen as important milestones for any digital asset. More Positive XRP-Related Developments The video also highlighted the launch of XRP futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which adds further credibility to the asset. Futures products are generally associated with more mature markets. They give investors a means of hedging against volatility. Finally, Bloomberg highlighted on-chain metrics that show growing interest in the asset. The number of active addresses holding the coin has expanded significantly. Currently, over 300,000 addresses each hold at least 10,000 XRP. This trend suggests increasing long-term conviction among participants, including whales who typically play a larger role in shaping market behavior. Combining regulatory clarity, infrastructure growth, and rising on-chain activity has positioned XRP for greater attention from crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors.

45042904,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734014,1748091226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45042904.jpeg,"Duolingo CEO joins Klarna, Shopify in taking back ‘AI-first’ remarks as automation underwhelms",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/duolingo-ceo-takes-back-ai-first-remarks/,"Duolingo’s chief executive has retracted his claim that artificial intelligence will replace the company’s human workforce, saying instead that AI should be treated as a tool to help employees rather than supplant them. On Thursday, Luis von Ahn, Duolingo’s co-founder and CEO, posted on LinkedIn that “To be clear: I do not see AI as replacing what our employees do (we are in fact continuing to hire at the same speed as before)”. He added, “I see it as a tool to accelerate what we do, at the same or better level of quality. And the sooner we learn how to use it, and use it responsibly, the better off we will be in the long run.” von Ahn went on to outline plans for internal support as Duolingo increases its use of AI. “No one is expected to navigate this shift alone,” he said. “We’re developing workshops and advisory councils, and carving out dedicated experimentation time to help all our teams learn and adapt.” Just days earlier, Duolingo had said it would “gradually stop using contractors to do work AI can handle,” factor AI skills into annual performance reviews, and hire only when teams could not further automate their tasks. In a podcast appearance on No Priors with Sarah Guo, von Ahn predicted that AI would eventually be able to teach any subject, at scale, and deliver “better learning outcomes” than human instructors. He added that schools would still be needed for childcare. Duolingo defends AI-driven lessons amid backlash On Duolingo’s TikTok and Instagram pages, critics flooded the comments. One user responded to a video featuring a baby owl plushie by writing, “mama may I have real people running the company.” In another TikTok video , von Ahn appeared opposite a masked, hoodie-clad figure to defend the move, saying “AI will allow us to reach more people.” A spokesperson for Duolingo told Fortune that the company remains in hiring mode and is investing in employee training to make AI a benefit rather than a threat. “We’re still growing our team, and we’re training and developing our talent so they benefit from using AI,” the spokesperson said. “All AI content is created under the direction and guidance of our learning experts. We have rigorous quality standards in place to ensure that any content we publish is safe, accurate, and aligned with the CEFR,” referring to an international framework for language proficiency. Last month, payments app Klarna also backtracked on claims that its AI chatbot outperformed human staff, admitting that the bot’s “lower quality” responses meant it would resume hiring people. E-commerce platform Shopify faced the criticism as well after suggesting in an internal memo that AI-driven gains would reduce the need for new hires. AI’s promise falls short in most jobs Observers say these reversals highlight a gap between the enthusiasm for an “AI-first” approach among investors and executives and its reception by regular users and employees. Generative AI often uses huge amounts of data without reliable information, produces errors or strange outputs, and operates in a regulatory gray zone. Moreover, the expected productivity gains have only shown up in a few limited cases. An IBM survey of 2,000 business leaders found that 75% of AI projects fail to meet their return-on-investment targets. A National Bureau of Economic Research study of 25,000 workers in industries exposed to AI saw no significant increases in productivity, wages, or hours worked. “This tool that’s been adopted so fast, where the expectations are so high, [was] not making a difference in earnings was a surprise to me,” said Anders Humlum, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and one of the NBER study’s authors. He noted that the shift toward AI assistance is “much smaller and much slower” than its backers often claim.

On the same day, another shock came from Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, who confirmed that, according to a May 22 filing, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again postponed its final decisions on two Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) filings. Keep reading to know more, wether XRP price will be affected here onwards or not. Regulatory Delays and Market Impact The affected ETFs from recent action of SEC were CoinShares XRP and Litecoin ETFs. However, the SEC has continuously delayed its decisions on the proposals. Now, the dates extend from May 26 to August 24, 2025. These decisions follow a pattern of the SEC applying longer timelines to examine crypto-based financial products’ risks and legal compliance. While these are not rejections, they represent a regulatory bottleneck that continues to slow the launch of spot digital asset ETFs in the US. Also, with Canary and WisdomTree’s XRP applications due later this month, the expectation is clear that more delays might be coming in. Crypto ETFs may have started slow, but they’re now dashing their way forward. Ripple’s XRP is already surrounded by hype after the blockchain firm bagged a partial win against the commission. The recent blows don’t change its long-term price prediction, though, with XRP remaining arguably one of the fundamentally strongest tokens in the market. XRP price has surged by a massive 360% in the last year, going from trading at $0.51 in November 2024 to around $2.43 on May 23, 2025. In the meantime, it also knocked out the $3 mark back in January 2025. Now, when writing, the XRP price trades at $2.35, slightly recovering from yesterday’s dip of $2.29, which means bulls will not lose to bears that easily. Whale Activity and Future Projections For XRP Price Moreover, the on-chain data highlights that the “percent of stablecoin total supply held by whales with over $5 million USD” has risen from 46% to 53% for XRP. This data means that these “whales” are effectively parking a significant amount of capital in stable assets. This shift is considered bullish for XRP because it implies these major players are building up substantial reserves of deployable capital. They typically use stablecoins as a staging ground, preparing to execute large-volume purchases of assets like XRP crypto when they identify favorable entry points or anticipate upward price momentum. Their increased stablecoin holdings suggest an intent to inject significant buying pressure into the XRPcrypto market, signaling strong underlying confidence in its future performance and potential for appreciation. Demand for XRP is, therefore, strong, and with the market still waiting on ten applications for spot-based XRP ETFs in the US, we could see massive moves for the coin later in the year. Based on this, we could see the XRP reach $3 easily by the end of Q2 and $4 by the end of the year. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Crypto ETFs offer Wall Street institutions direct access to crypto, simplifying trading. XRP’s future ETFs and Bitcoin ETF success show increasing institutional crypto adoption.

45042986,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come,1748091600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Coinbase in S&P 500: More crypto firms to come?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding: It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem. It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi. Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million. The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach. Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investors Meanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows? How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500. If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure. S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P Global Institutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added: The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies. It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.” A convergence of economies? Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.” “We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard. More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption Still, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD ( PYUSD ) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech. “These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained. Who is next? Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.” Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim. “I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.” Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.

Institutional players, led by BlackRock’s IBIT and firms like Strategy, are driving the rally while retail participation remains muted. Despite record inflows and price gains, on-chain metrics suggest Bitcoin’s current run is not yet overheated. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded a surge in demand, pulling in $2.75 billion in inflows this week as Bitcoin broke past its January all-time high of $109,000 and touched a new peak of $111,970. The figure represents a nearly 4.5x increase over the previous week’s $608 million inflow, according to data from Farside. On May 23 alone, ETFs attracted $211.7 million in net inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leading the pack by adding $430.8 million—marking its eighth straight day of net gains. BlackRock Continues to Dominate ETF Inflows While BlackRock continues to dominate ETF inflows, Grayscale’s GBTC shed $89.2 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $73.9 million in outflows. This spike in inflows comes amid heightened Bitcoin activity. On May 21, the same day Bitcoin crossed $109,000, ETFs saw $607.1 million in inflows. The upward momentum pushed Bitcoin to a new all-time high the next day, though the price has since experienced a mild pullback. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall sentiment, dropped from an “Extreme Greed” reading of 78 to 66 in the past 24 hours, reflecting more cautious market behavior despite record prices. Notably, May could break the monthly ETF inflow record of $6.49 billion set in November 2024. With five trading days left, spot Bitcoin ETFs have already drawn $5.39 billion. Analysts remain optimistic. On-chain data suggests the rally is not yet overheated. CryptoQuant’s Crypto Dan noted that funding rates and short-term capital inflows remain low, and profit-taking from short-term investors is minimal — signs that BTC’s upward trajectory may have more room to run. Bitcoin Hits All-Time High – Still Not Overheated “Overheating indicators such as the funding rate & short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, & profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” – By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/kqyzFSwzfd — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 22, 2025 Institutions Take the Wheel in Bitcoin Rally The current bull market is being driven primarily by institutional capital rather than the wave of individual buyers seen in past cycles, according to a recent report from Matrixport. “This rally is unfolding largely without retail participation,” analysts wrote. “Instead of the usual buzz and euphoria, there’s a noticeable absence of retail momentum.” Matrixport said there has been a clear shift in Bitcoin’s market dynamics. In previous bull runs, individual investors often led the charge, with social media hype and FOMO fueling rapid price gains. But this time, large institutions, motivated by Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation, are steering the market. “We’re witnessing a steady and quiet transfer of Bitcoin from early adopters, miners, and exchanges to a new class of investors, primarily corporations,” the report noted. Among those leading the institutional push is Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, 204 institutions currently hold BTC, with more than half being public companies. In just the last month, 11 new firms added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Strategy recently announced a plan to raise $2.1 billion through Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, with proceeds potentially going toward further BTC acquisitions.

Her statement marks a shift from past SEC actions, such as the 2023 Kraken case that limited centralized staking services. It’s seen as an opening for U.S. institutions to increase participation in staking protocols. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has welcomed this clarification, highlighting increased confidence in the regulatory environment. For Ethereum, the largest PoS network, this signals potential growth in staking, liquidity, and network resilience. With a $308.6 billion market cap and 9.02% market share, Ethereum stands to benefit from rising institutional engagement. Ethereum Technical Analysis Point to Breakout Ethereum price prediction seems bullish as 2 hour chart is showing a higher lows pattern from the $2,272 pivot, so the bullish momentum is sustained. Price is hovering around the 50 period EMA at $2,571—a key technical level. A close above this level, especially with a bullish MACD crossover could trigger a move to $2,737 and $2,849 resistance zones. Trendline Support : The ascending trendline is acting as dynamic support in pullbacks. Candlestick Patterns : Spinning tops at $2,523 mean market is indecisive, while bullish engulfing candles mean upward momentum. Key Levels to Watch : Break above $2,626 could push ETH higher, while downside pivots are at $2,523 and $2,500 for risk management. MACD : MACD is neutral with slight bearish bias. A green crossover would be bullish. Look for classic bullish patterns like three white soldiers or RSI divergence on lower timeframes to confirm the breakout. Conclusion: Next Leg Up for Ethereum? Ethereum is following Bitcoin’s price action so correlation is tightening due to broader market and regulatory clarity. With institutional confidence rising and technicals pointing to a breakout, ETH could go to $2,737 and $2,849 soon. But traders should watch support levels and confirm momentum before going long. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the ETH/USD pair hovers near $2,550, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

Garlinghouse emphasized that XRP, the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger, offers a breakthrough solution for the long-standing inefficiencies plaguing international payments, especially compared to the entrenched SWIFT system . His remarks underline XRP’s growing prominence and suggest a future where XRP could surpass SWIFT as the dominant cross-border settlement mechanism. CEO of Ripple Discusses the Game-Changing Potential of $XRP to Take Over SWIFT in Worldwide Transactions 1/4 Check Thread pic.twitter.com/rhpsngRzgG — Ripple Pundit (@RipplePundit) May 23, 2025 Breaking Free from Pre-Funded Accounts Traditionally, global banks relying on SWIFT must maintain pre-funded accounts — known as nostro and vostro accounts — in multiple countries to ensure liquidity for cross-border transactions. This practice locks up billions of dollars in dormant funds worldwide, creating complexity, inefficiency, and increased costs. Garlinghouse noted that Ripple’s solution, utilizing XRP, provides instant liquidity, removing the need for pre-funded reserves. This innovation means institutions can instantly access the funds they need for international transfers without cumbersome pre-arrangements. Compared to SWIFT transactions that can take days to settle and clear, XRP transactions finalize in mere seconds , fundamentally reshaping the speed at which money moves globally. According to Garlinghouse, this efficiency leap places XRP far ahead of SWIFT and Bitcoin, which, despite its fame, struggles with slower transaction speeds and high energy consumption. Real-World Adoption and Institutional Trust Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple’s vision is no longer just theoretical ; XRP is already used in live environments by financial institutions worldwide. Banks and payment providers are leveraging Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, powered by XRP, to bridge cross-border payments without intermediaries. This real-world traction has fueled growing confidence among XRP holders, institutional partners, and market analysts who believe that Ripple’s approach is uniquely positioned to challenge SWIFT’s long-standing monopoly over international finance. Significantly, Garlinghouse revealed in the accompanying video clip that Ripple is collaborating with several central banks globally. While only some of these partnerships have been publicly disclosed, Ripple is actively involved in testing and experimentation phases, enabling central banks to issue their Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on the XRP Ledger. This development places Ripple at the heart of the emerging CBDC movement, further strengthening its potential to become the backbone of future global payments infrastructure. Sustainability and User Simplicity One of the most compelling aspects of XRP, especially for institutional adoption, is its superior energy efficiency compared to other digital assets like Bitcoin. As global regulators and financial institutions increasingly prioritize sustainability, XRP’s low-energy consensus mechanism offers a decisive edge. Moreover, Ripple’s infrastructure is designed so that users, including banks and payment platforms, do not need to hold or manage cryptocurrency directly. Instead, the technology operates seamlessly in the background, automatically conducting XRP transactions to facilitate liquidity and settlement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This simplicity removes a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. This aligns well with the operational needs of large financial institutions, which often hesitate to deal directly with crypto assets due to regulatory and custodial concerns. By handling the complexity under the hood, Ripple makes it easier for institutions to tap into the benefits of blockchain without overhauling their existing systems or assuming unnecessary risks. A Strong Case to Challenge SWIFT’s Dominance While SWIFT has been the backbone of international banking for decades, the emergence of blockchain technology and digital assets like XRP has exposed its limitations. Garlinghouse’s vision for Ripple is not merely to coexist alongside SWIFT but to provide a fundamentally superior alternative , a faster, cheaper, greener, and more flexible option. With banks increasingly leveraging XRP for liquidity and integrating CBDCs on the XRP Ledger, Ripple is poised to revolutionize the global payments landscape. Ripple Pundit’s report underscores the growing momentum behind Ripple’s ambitions, reflecting the broader confidence within the XRP community and beyond. As the financial sector and regulators pursue digital innovation, Ripple’s technology is well-positioned to transform cross-border payments and challenge SWIFT’s long-standing dominance. With real-world utility, institutional trust, energy efficiency, and seamless integration, XRP may hold the keys to the future of global finance — a future where cross-border payments are instant, cost-effective, and universally accessible. If Ripple’s vision materializes as Garlinghouse envisions, XRP could become the core engine driving the next generation of international money movement.

The official himself admitted it will take some time and effort to convince French citizens to abandon their tangible money, as there is currently no political consensus on the matter. French minister claims banning cash will help fight drug crime Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin has sparked discussions in France by suggesting that ending cash will improve results in combating narcotics distribution. Use of bank cards and payment apps has been growing in the country, but as the politician recognized, cash is still important for his compatriots. Darmanin pitched the idea during an appearance at the Senate, the upper house of parliament, on Thursday. His move rekindled debate on the fate of cash in the French Republic, a member of the European Union and its single currency area, the eurozone. Quoted by La Tribune, he stated: “How do we stop drugs from spreading in our neighborhoods? There’s a fairly simple measure: banning cash will prevent the establishment of drug dealing points.” The topic has been a subject of frequent rumors and disinformation campaigns on social media, the French weekly noted in an article, which also emphasized that “access to cash is a sensitive social issue” and “eliminating it would require political consensus and societal support.” A number of European governments have been trying to reduce its use, including the current one in Spain, where demand for cash spiked amid last month’s catastrophic power outage that disrupted electronic payments and took ATMs out of service. Gérald Darmanin: ""Je l'ai dit (…) à ceux qui m'interrogent pour savoir comment on arrête la drogue dans nos quartiers. Une mesure assez simple : la fin de l'argent liquide empêchera les points de deal"" #BFM2 pic.twitter.com/jBjvGMi4KZ — BFMTV (@BFMTV) May 22, 2025 Cash is still quite popular in France, where people are often using paper money for everyday purchases, prompting the Bank of France to acknowledge in February that “a very large majority of French people continue to value cash and recognize its many benefits.” Despite card payments overtaking cash transactions in France for the first time last year, the European Central Bank’s survey on consumer payment habits, published in December 2024, also showed that cash still accounts for 43% of all French payments. No consensus on ending paper money yet Speaking in the studio of the French broadcaster RTL on Friday, Gérald Darmanin took a step back for the sake of being “realistic.” Asked to comment on his proposal to fight drug crime by prohibiting physical money, he conceded that authorities “don’t have the political means” to do that right now. That would “obviously require a long discussion with the French people,” said Darmanin, a former minister of the interior. “It is a public debate that should undoubtedly be raised in a presidential campaign, for example,” he elaborated. The withdrawal of all cash from circulation in France, leading producer of banknotes and coins in the eurozone, would represent a massive logistical challenge comparable to the introduction of the euro a quarter century ago, La Tribune pointed out. It will also threaten jobs at Banque de France’s paper mill, printing works and minting facility. Europeans still searching for alternatives to cash Besides card payments, mobile transactions in France have been growing as well, with their share increasing from 1% in 2019 to 6% of payments last year. However, both of these alternatives raise questions about French and European sovereignty as payment providers, like Visa or Apple Pay, are all American. The ECB has been promoting its upcoming digital euro currency as an answer to such questions – a sovereign European coin that should allegedly complement, not substitute cash. But the project has caused other concerns , including fears about privacy, which the monetary authority has tried to address . Despite growing distrust in digital technology, the “elimination of cash” is “definitely on people’s minds,” the French crypto news outlet Journal du Coin insisted in a post, while suggesting that blockchain may be the answer and poking the government official: “Mr. Darmanin, what’s your opinion on Bitcoin?” Cryptocurrencies “will become increasingly important,” the minister of justice said in his remarks for French media, as if he had anticipated that question. But they are more “traceable,” he also noted, adding fuel to the ongoing debate in France.

As of May 24, 2025, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.76, marking a decline of over 7% in the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term volatility, the community is eager to see how high it can climb by the beginning of June. For insight into ADA’s potential trajectory, we consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT for a prediction of ADA’s price by June 1, 2025, setting a target range of $0.72 to $0.82. Current Price Trend and Outlook Cardano (ADA) has recently traded in a relatively narrow band between $0.7 and $0.83 over the past month. According to ChatGPT, the coin is “in a sideways-to-slightly-bullish pattern with no major breakout yet.” This reflects a market lacking strong momentum but showing resilience above its lower support levels. In the absence of a decisive trend, ADA appears to be consolidating. This price behavior suggests that investors are waiting for clearer signals, potentially from Bitcoin’s price movements or broader economic developments. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios While the baseline projection remains at $0.72 to $0.82, ChatGPT outlines potential deviations under different conditions. Bullish Case: ChatGPT stated that if altcoins rally in response to Bitcoin’s growth with strong trading volume, ADA could reach between $0.85 and $0.90. Bearish Case: If negative sentiment intensifies due to macroeconomic factors such as regulatory developments or interest rate changes, ADA could fall to a range of $0.65 and $0.68. Market Sentiment and Broader Conditions ChatGPT noted that the general sentiment across the cryptocurrency market is “cautiously optimistic heading into the summer.” With Bitcoin dominance remaining high, altcoins like Cardano tend to move more slowly in response to bullish momentum. As a result, ADA is expected to “continue slowly climbing unless there’s a sharp macro shift.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 ChatGPT also noted that no significant upgrades or releases are expected within the Cardano ecosystem before June 1 that could cause rapid growth. Potential Bullish Catalysts Historically, years following Bitcoin halvings have been favorable for altcoins. The last halving occurred in April 2024, setting the stage for potential growth in 2025. However, the AI-powered chatbot emphasizes that June may still be preparatory. Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson is also working to expand the network by collaborating with Bitcoin and XRP . If these partnerships pay off, the asset could experience significant growth. Cardano has also made significant strides in 2025, and despite its lack of momentum over the past few months, these upgrades and changes could soon start contributing to its growth.

Investors added $2.7 billion to Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs, the biggest weekly increase since April when they added $3.06 billion. These funds have now had inflows for six consecutive weeks, bringing the cumulative inflows since inception to $44.53 billion. They all hold $131 billion in assets, equivalent to 6.24% of Bitcoin’s valuation. Bitcoin ETF inflows | Source: SoSoValue The iShares Bitcoin ETF, whose ticker symbol is IBIT, has had cumulative inflows of $48 billion and now hold over $71 billion in assets. It is followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which has $21 billion, and Grayscale’s $21.7 billion. The other big funds are from Ark Invest, BitWise, and VanEck. You might also like: Will Tron price rise as crypto billionaire Justin Sun meets Trump? Interestingly, IBIT, 16 months old, is catching up to the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which has been around since 2004. The GLD ETF has had $4.9 billion in inflows this year, bringing its total assets to $100 billion. As such, if the trend continues, it means that the IBIT ETF will flip GLD in the next few months or years. Bitcoin ETFs may also pass their gold counterparts in the coming years. According to the World Gold Council, the global assets under management of gold ETFs have jumped to over $345 billion as the price rallies. Bitcoin has been in a strong uptrend this year. On Wednesday, it jumped to a record high of nearly $112,000. On Friday, it retreated to $107,500 after President Donald Trump threatened a 50% tariff on European goods and a 25% levy on Apple’s products. Analysts remain optimistic that the Bitcoin price has more room to go, as the supply and demand dynamics help it. Demand from ETFs and corporates continues rising, while supply on exchanges keeps falling. Mining difficulty also increases, lowering the number of coins coming to the market. Ark Invest analysts predict that BTC’s price will jump to $2.4 million by the end of the decade, while Standard Chartered sees it hitting $200,000 this year.

The latest upward movement suggests the return of interest and confidence in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. After surpassing its previous all-time high price this week, the Bitcoin price has printed a new high of $111,814 — reached on Thursday, May 22. A fresh all-time-high price is often followed by a major correction, as investors are typically inclined to take profits. However, recent on-chain revelation suggests this Bitcoin bull run might be here to stay — and maybe for a longer period than expected. Analyst Says Realized Profits Yet To Signal Market Top In a May 23 post on social media platform X, on-chain crypto analyst Darkfost revealed that the net realized profits by Bitcoin investors remain normal for a bull phase. The relevant indicator backing this assertion is the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which measures the net profit or loss (in USD) of all coins spent on the network over a specific timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Smashes Past $111K, But Are Traders About to Dump? This on-chain metric is calculated by finding the difference between the realized profit and realized loss of crypto investors. Positive values from the metric indicate that coins are being spent at a higher price than they were acquired, resulting in a net profit. On the other hand, negative values indicate that coins are being spent at prices lower than they were bought, resulting in a net loss. Neutral values simply suggest that coins are being spent close to their acquisition price. According to on-chain data shared by Darkfost, realized profits are currently at a high level of about 104,000 BTC (a rough equivalent of $11 billion). The analyst, however, pointed out that while this figure is substantial, it still falls short of the 350,000 BTC threshold level (a level which has historically signaled potential tops and preceded major correctional movements of Bitcoin). Darkfost inferred from the highlighted data that the net realized profit for a Bitcoin bull phase is currently at a normal level. The analyst noted the necessity of profit-taking in a bull market, implicitly preaching against fear amongst investors. Darkfost said about profit-taking: It’s what keeps investors engaged in the market and helps sustain the bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $108,360, reflecting a more than 2% decline in the past 24 hours.

While Solaxy is building hype as a Layer 2 project on Solana, it’s PEPETO that is capturing serious investor attention with its surprisingly deep use cases, strong community backing, and massive upside potential. Bitcoin is currently hovering at its all time high. As a result of this, the altcoin market is also expecting momentum and interest. In this atmosphere, meme coins are once again proving that they’re not just jokes—they can be powerful investment vehicles. In this race, PEPETO is positioning itself to become a real winner. PEPETO: Real Utility Meets Meme Hype Most memecoins are very short-lived. However, unlike those, PEPETO actually manages to combine utility with the meme culture. It revolves around PepetoSwap, which is a DEX that charges zero fees. Only verified and scam-free tokens can be listed on this DEX. The crypto market is already full of rug pulls. Hence, PEPETO’s security-first approach is refreshing. PEPETO also features cross-chain bridge technology, enabling seamless asset movement across blockchains. This isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a solution to one of crypto’s biggest pain points: fragmented liquidity. Add in its staking rewards of 350%, and the token becomes even more attractive for passive income seekers. Currently, the PEPETO presale is ongoing. The coin is priced at $0.000000107 per token for now. The project has raised more than $4.1 million already. This shows that there is significant interest from investors. The supply, at the same time, is quite limited. It has strong engagement and a real-world use case as well. This positions itself as a great option for those investors who are looking for high returns. Solaxy’s Technological Appeal Solaxy is a Solana-based Layer 2 blockchain aiming to solve scalability challenges while offering tools like the Igniter Protocol, which enables token creation and project launches. It’s an ambitious project with some real engineering under the hood. The Solaxy Testnet Bridge already supports native SOL transfers and its upcoming Ethereum compatibility promises cross-chain appeal. These developments have attracted the attention of tech-savvy investors and Solana loyalists. Solaxy is building a name as a high-potential infrastructure play within the Solana ecosystem. However, for retail investors seeking rapid and substantial ROI, utility isn’t the only thing that matters. Narrative, community strength, and early-stage positioning are just as important—and that’s where PEPETO dominates. Investor Sentiment Tilts Toward PEPETO Despite Solaxy’s promise as a foundational infrastructure play, it is PEPETO that’s trending across X, Telegram, and YouTube. Influencers and community leaders are spotlighting the project’s unique angle: blending meme appeal with trust-first technology. Elon Musk’s recent frog-themed profile update only intensified the hype around frog-based meme coins, and PEPETO is riding that wave with precision. Moreover, while Solaxy is focused on technical scalability, PEPETO is cultivating a community that feels aligned with the culture of crypto: bold, humorous, and opportunity-driven. It’s not just building tech—it’s building a movement. Final Verdict Both Solaxy and PEPETO offer distinct advantages. Solaxy appeals to developers and long-term Layer 2 believers. But if you’re looking for a high-upside, early-entry investment backed by actual use cases, a vibrant meme narrative, and staking rewards that beat most DeFi protocols—PEPETO may be the smarter choice. To participate in the ongoing presale or to start staking PEPETO, visit PEPETO’s official website . ABOUT PEPETO PEPETO is a new memecoin that brings together the culture with utility. A zero-free DEX is central to the PEPETO ecosystem. It features swaps with zero fees, cross-chain bridge, and staking rewards. It would support the next-gen coins that are scam-free and secure.

They believe that this bull cycle could push the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to $250k, and achieve a new market cap for the overall crypto industry. The question on most investors’ minds right now is how they can maximize possible returns in this cycle. One of the best strategies has always been to invest in tokens with a low entry point and that show potential for great utility. Thus far, that category falls squarely on one DeFi altcoin that you may not have heard of until now – Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly rising One reason why you may not have heard of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) yet is that this innovative project is still in the presale phase. However, those with a keen eye in the crypto world have already identified it as a potential candidate for massive gains in this bull cycle. A major reason for the hype surrounding the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is the unique lending structure that it utilizes. The project uses a unique approach to decentralized lending, where lenders can earn an annual percentage yield while maintaining full utility of their assets. Until now, most DeFi lending platforms only allow users to lock up their assets for a defined period, while losing all potential utility of those assets. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM). That model is erased, thanks to the use of an innovative technology called mtTokens. A deep dive into mtTokens The mtTokens are designed to the on-chain representation of a lender’s deposit into the liquidity pools. When a user deposits $5000 worth of ETH for instance, they will receive mtETH tokens, which correspond to the share of their deposit in the pool. Additionally, these mtTokens accumulate value in real time that corresponds to the principal amount they deposited, as well as the interest they accrue. Since these tokens are built on the ERC-20 token standard, they can be moved to third party protocols, and even sold on secondary markets. A holding of mtTokens is essentially a representation of your fractional ownership in the lending pool. Over time, the value that can be redeemed from this pool increases based on the pool’s utilization. The entire process is controlled by smart contracts, which ensures it is verifiable, boosting transparency and confidence in the ecosystem. This process ensures that users do not need to actively compound their gains. It ensures that every incremental increase in your asset, and interests is recorded on-chain. The result is that holders can easily monitor their portfolio, or transfer their deposit positions across more beneficial lending scenarios within the ecosystem. Boosting liquidity through a stablecoin A chronic challenge that many DeFi protocols run into is that they often run into liquidity crunches. To deal with this challenge, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will create a stablecoin, which is designed to boost liquidity without the need for a dedicated asset pool. Borrowers can lock in eligible collateral in excess of the nominal value of the stablecoin to mint new tokens on demand. The overcollateralization helps to deal with another common challenge called de-pegging. It comes with numerous mechanisms that ensure the price is always stabilized at $1, mainly through their use of arbitrage. The stablecoin offers a huge advantage for borrowers, in that it allows them to unlock the full potential of their assets, without having to sell the underlying asset. Due to the volatile nature of crypto, these underlying assets could potentially appreciate over time. Dividend payments on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Dividend payments is a concept reserved mainly for the legacy financial system until now. On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a buyback and distribute mechanism, similar to dividend payments has been implemented. Once the protocol goes live, stakers will receive part of the fees collected from various activities on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project will have a leaderboard, with the biggest stakers getting huge bonus rewards for their effort to support the system’s health. Join the future with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating the future of finance, and you have a rare opportunity to join this revolution while it is still on the ground floor. With a current presale price of $0.03, it offers a lucrative entry point. In the next phase, the price is set to rise by 16.67%, which would have a slight impact on your potential profitability. With investors already eyeing 100% from the current price of $0.03 to the listing price of $0.06, getting in now guarantees you can double your investment in just a few weeks.

According to the company, Alibaba Cloud will focus on expanding into international regions like Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. The goal, according to the company, is to provide consistent AI infrastructure services for Chinese enterprises both domestically and internationally. Presently, the Alibaba Cloud service operates across 87 zones, with the service cutting across 29 regions. It offers 394 cloud computing and AI products along with 59 technical services, making it one of the largest cloud service providers in the Asia Pacific region. Alibaba plans global cloud expansion amid fierce competition The recent 380 billion yuan ($52 billion) investment to push its global expansion is coming at a critical time in the global cloud computing landscape. Presently, the company holds just 4% of the market share, compared to Microsoft Azure’s 20%, Google Cloud’s 12%, and AWS’ 31%. The global cloud market has been predicted to surpass $912 billion by 2025, with the market presently growing at 18.3% annually. According to analysts, the global market is also expected to open up opportunities and intense market share competition. This expansion is also moving as the industry forecasts show 95% of the new digital worlds will be deployed on cloud-native platforms by 2025, signalling a shift in how businesses will operate globally. Presently, Alibaba has an existing network of 87 availability zones across 29 regions, securing its position as the leader in the Asia-Pacific region. However, this new investment signals the firm’s ambition to challenge Western firms for dominance in the international markets. The global expansion is also in line with the wider trends in the industry, as 76% of businesses are now choosing hybrid or multi-cloud approaches to optimize workloads and avoid vendor lock-in. Supporting the global expansion of Chinese enterprises According to Wu’s statement, the push for global expansion will provide an inevitable pathway for Chinese enterprises. This shows that the Alibaba CEO feels there is a growing need for Chinese firms to gain access to reliable, familiar technical infrastructure as they continue to expand internationally. Alibaba is set to address this need using its Cloud services, providing consistent AI infrastructure services for Chinese firms operating across borders. This way, they can eliminate technical challenges. The investment will also create a technological foundation for Chinese companies to compete globally while adhering to different regional regulations, addressing a challenge that has always hindered international expansion. Using this infrastructure as its backbone, Alibaba wants to position itself as the go-to cloud provider for Chinese firms attempting to take their services global, potentially capturing more market share as they expand their international operations. The move is also in line with China’s goal of being the global AI leader by 2030, providing the infrastructure needed for AI development. China’s core AI industry was valued at $75 billion in 2022, with over 4,300 AI firms forming a strong ecosystem that relies on cloud computing resources. By doing so, this investment will fill an important gap as Chinese AI models currently lag behind their United States counterparts, according to competitive analysis. The infrastructure buildout is also important, considering that Chinese companies develop large language models to rival Western offerings, requiring a large amount of computing resources that only advanced cloud networks can provide. By strengthening its global cloud presence, Alibaba is also creating a foundation for Chinese AI firms to deploy their solutions internationally while maintaining technical consistency across different regions.

The company acquired an additional 455 BTC — its third-largest purchase since adopting a Bitcoin standard roughly one year ago. Semler Buys Millions More In Bitcoin According to the May 23 8-K filing, Semler Scientific spent $50 million on 455 BTC between May 13 and May 22, 2025, at an average purchase price of $109,801 per coin. The company bought the Bitcoin using proceeds from its $500 million at-the-market offering program. The company has issued 3,003,488 shares under its April 15 $500 million ATM program, raking in $114.8 million. Semler now holds a total of 4,264 BTC, valued at roughly $474.4 million. It bought the BTC for an aggregate of $390 million at an average cost basis of $91,471. The medical device company has been aggressively purchasing Bitcoin since last year, mirroring the playbook pioneered by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and its Chairman and renowned Bitcoin supporter, Michael Saylor. Semler’s BTC Yield has jumped to 25.8% in 2025. BTC yield, a performance indicator popularized by Saylor and Strategy, refers to the ratio of a company’s Bitcoin holdings and its assumed diluted shares outstanding. At 4,264 BTC, the company’s Bitcoin treasury ranks 13th in size among publicly traded companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. Corporate Treasury Boom Software intelligence company Strategy started buying BTC in 2020 at the behest of former CEO Michael Saylor. Since then, the company has amassed a 576,230 BTC stash, worth approximately $62 million at current prices. There are now over 70 firms that have incorporated a Bitcoin treasury, with Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Bitfinex, and Tether recently announcing the forthcoming launch of a $3.6 billion Bitcoin venture, Twenty One.

Just a week earlier, the OG crypto crossed its previous high of $109K and made a new all-time high. However, over the past week, the prices have corrected by around 3%, meaning $BTC is now trading at around $108K . The battle between the bulls and the bears has gotten intense, and we expect a great tussle between the two to keep $BTC prices above $109K. In this article, we’ll provide a complete breakdown of the current Bitcoin option expiry scenario. We’ll also suggest the best crypto to buy now to benefit from $BTC’s potential rally. $109K Is a Crucial Level for $BTC Option data shows that the $109K level is the most crucial level for Bitcoin option traders. Out of the total options, $6.5B are put options. However, 95% of put options are below $109K. So, if $BTC stays above this level, 95% of these options will expire worthless, meaning they’ll lead to a loss for bears. Short sellers were already caught off guard by Bitcoin’s 25% rally in the last 30 days. Conversely, there are around $3.8B worth of call options up to $109K. This means that bulls will earn massive profit if $BTC holds above this level. Institutional data shows that there was a net flow of $1.9B Bitcoin ETFs between May 20 and May 22. This proves that corporations are still buying BTC above $105K. The only hope for bears at this point is a macroeconomic shock or news that could see Bitcoin tumble to a certain extent. It’s worth noting that there’s also an open interest of $79B in the Bitcoin futures market with a lot of short positions. This indicates that bears are trying their best to ensure Bitcoin doesn’t sustain the $109K mark come May 30. That said, the bulls seem to be more in control of the markets as of now. Here’s a table to help you understand. BTC Expiry Price Calls Puts Net Between $102K and $105K $2.75B $0.9B $1.85B – Call Side Between $105K and $107K $3.3B $0.65B $2.65B – Call Side Between $107K and $110K $3.7B $0.35B $3.35B – Call Side Between $110K and $114K $4.8B $0.12B $4.70B – Call Side As you can see, under all four scenarios, it is the bulls that ultimately benefit. The higher Bitcoin goes from here, the more profit bulls take home. With just seven days left in the month, one can expect a bit of volatility in the Bitcoin market. However, the bias is largely green, with experts having already predicted that $BTC might cross $200K by the end of the year. If you want to ride this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, here are some top altcoins you can invest in right now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy Right Now BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out from other Bitcoin-inspired altcoins because it’s the only one offering free $BTC airdrops to its token holders. It’s the best crypto to invest in if you want to make the most of Bitcoin’s upcoming rally without having to shell out an eye-watering sum to invest in Bitcoin itself, which is currently priced at over $108K. Every time Bitcoin pushes through a new landmark, such as $150K, $200K, or $250K, for the first time, $BTCBULL holders will automatically receive their share of free $BTC. It’s worth noting, though, that you must store your purchased $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . Additionally, the project will also follow a deflationary approach, meaning a part of the total token supply will be shaved off at regular intervals – every time Bitcoin’s price rises by $25K, to be precise. A continuously decreasing token supply will ensure the demand continues to increase, which will ultimately boost the token’s trading volume and price. To join the ‘Bull Army,’ buy $BTCBULL today . Luckily for you, the project is still in presale ($6.2M+ raised), meaning you can grab it for a low price of $0.002525. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever L2 on Solana with $40M in Presale Funding Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the best crypto presales on the market today, and for good reason. After all, it’s set out to resolve Solana’s congestion and scalability issues. After the successful launches of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Solana saw an unprecedented increase in investor activity. This overwhelmed the otherwise meme coin-friendly blockchain, resulting in failed transactions. Solaxy, however, will solve this by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. It will offload a huge chunk of the transactions from Solana’s mainnet onto a sidechain, thereby reducing the burden on Solana and cranking up its efficiency. Moreover, the L2 will also execute transactions in batches – rather than one by one – which will improve Solana’s affordability, as the fees required per transaction will go down. With Solana set to take center stage in the rapidly growing DeFi landscape, Solaxy is going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this movement. Don’t miss out on possibly the next crypto to explode and buy Solaxy now for just $0.001734. Hurry up, though, because the presale ends in around three weeks, following which $SOLX will be live on all major exchanges. Our Solaxy price prediction suggests that the token could explode 11,500% and reach $0.20 by 2030. 3. Trump Dinner ($DINNER) – Donald Trump’s Historic ‘Crypto Dinner’ Has a Meme Coin $DINNER is the newest addition to the list of Trump-inspired meme coins that have taken the market by storm. As the name suggests, Trump Dinner is based on Donald Trump’s unprecedented move to invite the top holders of the $TRUMP meme coin for an exclusive dinner gala . As per the announcement on the OFFICIAL TRUMP website, the top 220 holders of $TRUMP will be invited to Donald Trump’s private Virginia golf club. The ‘crypto dinner,’ which has raised both appreciation and scrutiny from the crowd, is scheduled for tonight, i.e., May 24. So, in the lead-up to it, $DINNER, a new meme coin based on the event, has painted the town red (green). $DINNER launched just a couple of days ago and has already gained over 180,000%. It’s up close to 1,000% in the past 24 hours and shows no signs of stopping until, at least, a few days after the dinner. That’s because, according to the aforementioned announcement, the top 25 $TRUMP holders will be invited to a ‘special tour’ and ‘private VIP reception with the President.’ DYOR Before Investing in the Best Crypto to Buy Despite $BTC’s confidence-inspiring form, it’s worth remembering that the crypto market is rife with volatile news events and, therefore, uncertainty. Invest carefully and ideally only an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, kindly do your own research.

But the President’s threat of new tariffs against the EU and Apple sparked a retreat to near $108,000 today. Renewed Trade War Fears Rattle Crypto Prices Bitcoin quickly reversed after Trump proposed a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting next month. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin nosedived 2.2% to hit $108,319 lows before rebounding slightly to $108,438 at press time, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.” Trump also threatened Apple, the $3 trillion iPhone maker, stating that iPhones sold in America must be built domestically or face a 25% tariff. The ultimatum to Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared aimed at the tech giant’s extensive overseas manufacturing footprint. Bitcoin’s pullback came less than 24 hours after it smashed a new all-time high of $111,980, exceeding the previous record of nearly $109K set in January. The Bitcoin price had been on a tear following its increasing correlation with gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, and growing concerns about Japan’s and the US’s fiscal health. Moreover, increased corporate and institutional allocation, including frequent BTC buys by publicly traded companies like Strategy and MARA Holdings, alongside positive inflows into US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, further strengthens Bitcoin’s market position. Bitcoin’s recent correction reflects cautious sentiment among traders. The crypto market’s knee-jerk reaction implies that cryptocurrencies remain sensitive to macroeconomic and political developments. “$BTC There’s the break from the compression with a push from Trump. Markets worldwide obviously not liking the news,” widely-followed crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades opined in a post on X. “Will have to see where this settles today and how BTC ends up performing relative to equities now the trade uncertainty is back.” Ether (ETH) and other major altcoins were sliding, too. ETH has lost 2.9% of its value since yesterday and is currently trading for just above $2,562. XRP has fallen 2.5% over the last 24 hours and is currently trading for $2.37.

These tools can analyze vast amounts of data and spot trends that humans may not notice. We recently asked Google’s Gemini AI to perform this analysis and provide a target for Shiba Inu (SHIB) by June 1, 2025. According to Gemini’s analysis, SHIB is expected to trade between $0.000025 and $0.00003, with the most likely price set at $0.00003. This forecast represents a potential increase of over 105.9% from SHIB’s current price of $0.00001457, up 0.46% from the previous day. Key Factors Behind the Forecast Technical analysts have shared bullish projections for Shiba Inu, and Gemini’s price prediction is based on a combination of factors, including current market trends, sentiment, and historical behavior. The AI emphasizes that SHIB’s role as a meme coin remains relevant in determining its performance. As a result, it expects SHIB to benefit from ongoing trends and online sentiment if the broader crypto market holds steady. Another factor noted by Gemini is the impact of burn mechanisms. Token burns aim to reduce the total supply of SHIB tokens over time. Gemini acknowledges this as a potentially positive influence on price, and the Shiba Inu dev team recently introduced a new mode to the Shiba Eternity game that could accelerate token burns . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Utility Development Remains Limited Utility development also plays a role in the AI’s projection. While SHIB has introduced platforms such as Shibarium and SHIB: The Metaverse, Gemini notes that real-world use cases remain limited. As the AI stated, “its real-world utility still lags behind major altcoins,” which may constrain upward price movement unless driven by hype cycles or speculative interest. Broader Market Conditions Still Crucial The forecast is also contingent on broader market conditions. Gemini suggests that if Bitcoin remains stable or grows, altcoins such as SHIB could follow suit. However, it warns that any market correction or adverse developments could pose risks. Overall, Gemini’s prediction reflects an optimistic stance for SHIB heading into June. The range of $0.000025 to $0.00003 implies a strong performance under favorable conditions. With the positive market sentiment, accelerating burn, and positive technical indicators , SHIB has a good chance of hitting and surpassing this range.

45044639,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-next-crypto-power-shift,1748095200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-next-crypto-power-shift?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects. Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it. Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger. The downside of transparency As blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance , profiling, and preemptive censorship. OM's collapse exposed the dangers The April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust. The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligence We saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX . While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury. The growing threat of surveillance capitalism This is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto. What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them? Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policies The centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer. What the crypto community must do now The implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny. Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it. Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized. Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors. Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms. Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability. In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you. Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

NKN, a new kind of project – an acronym for New Kind of Network – can be compared to Substratum and Ontology, two projects that are building decentralized applications and a decentralized internet solution. But a better perspective would be a triumvirate where NKN provides decentralized networking , Ethereum takes care of the decentralized computing, and Filecoin/IPFS does the hosting via decentralized storage. If you are aware that one of the first applications built on NKN is a Smart home IoT, a Proof-of-Concept for what the team calls the “Airbnb of the Future,” a decentralized sharing economy, you’ll be interested to get into position for the next bull run.

NKN price analysis 1-day Chart: Crucial Resistance Test Ahead for NKN as Mixed Signals Emerge NKN currently trades between its 50-day and 100-day Moving Averages, generally a bearish indicator. Moreover, the price consolidation does not inject confidence to buyers as most traders wait for a clear turn of trends before deciding.

NKN 4-hour chart by Tradingview The 4-hour price chart shows low volatility for NKN price over 30 day period, with the price oscillating between the $0.0320 and the $0.0440 levels. However, the asset is yet to make a clear breakthrough and the net movement remains low over the period. The current consolidation might be the platform to enable a breakthrough. However, traders could expect a breakdown below the $0.0300 mark if market sentiment turns more bearish. If the bulls can make a breakout past $0.03860, then the price may be expected to cross past the $0.0440 mark, a level it has tested but failed to breach for quite a while now. Is NKN a good investment? NKN distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency space by focusing on decentralized networking and communication infrastructure. It aims to revolutionize how data is transmitted over the internet by creating a more secure, efficient, and open network powered by blockchain technology. With its innovative approach to peer-to-peer networking and growing demand for decentralized services, NKN has strong potential for long-term growth, which is reflected in various long term forecasts . Its real-world applications in IoT, edge computing, and decentralized web services make it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify into promising blockchain projects. Why is NKN down? The drop from its recent high near $0.04 to around $0.035 can be attributed to trader exhaustion due to high volatility and decreasing trade volume. Will NKN recover? Despite a recent downturn that saw NKN fall from near $0.12 to around $0.075, analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Market corrections are common in the crypto space, especially during bearish cycles. Given NKN’s solid fundamentals and active development team, many believe the project is well-positioned to rebound, leading some to consider whether to buy nkn. Most forecasts suggest that with improved market sentiment and continued adoption, NKN could potentially end the year between $0.10 and $0.15. Will NKN reach $0.10? Yes, analysts discuss the nkn prediction, projecting that NKN could reach the $0.10 price target as early as 2026, assuming consistent development progress, increased adoption of its decentralized networking solutions, and favorable future results. Will NKN reach $0.20? Many long-term projections indicate that NKN could surpass the $0.20 mark by the end of 2030, especially if global demand for decentralized networks continues to grow and the project maintains its current development trajectory. Does NKN have a good long-term future? NKN has a promising long-term outlook, presenting a bullish scenario due to its unique use cases in decentralized networking, strong developer community, and increasing relevance in a world moving toward decentralized infrastructure. As concerns around data privacy and centralized control of the internet rise, NKN’s vision of a democratized network becomes even more relevant—making it a compelling candidate for long-term investment.

NKN Price History Source: CoinMarketCap In early 2024, NKN traded steadily around the $0.11–$0.12 range. Through January and February, price movement was largely sideways, with NKN showing stability around $0.12. The market lacked strong momentum, and the asset remained range-bound throughout March as well. However, April 2024 marked the beginning of bearish pressure. NKN began declining from the $0.12 level, slipping below $0.10 by mid-April. This bearish trend deepened in May, with prices continuing their descent and briefly touching $0.09. The overall sentiment remained weak, and no major recovery was observed through the summer. By June and July 2024, NKN showed mild signs of recovery. The asset ranged between $0.07 and $0.08, but bulls failed to regain strong control. August brought further volatility, with the price swinging between $0.06 and $0.08 as speculative trading dominated the trend. September 2024 began on a slightly bullish note, but the rally quickly faded. By the end of the month, NKN had declined to nearly $0.068, erasing earlier gains. October and November were largely indecisive, with NKN trading in a tight channel between $0.06 and $0.07. The lack of volume and broader market consolidation contributed to this stagnation, making it challenging for investors to determine exit points . December 2024 sparked renewed optimism. A sudden surge pushed NKN to highs of $0.14 in early December. The price spiked briefly but failed to sustain above $0.13. A correction soon followed, and the asset closed the year around the $0.11 mark. January 2025 opened strong, with NKN hitting $0.10. The rally carried into February, peaking at $0.0823 early in the month. However, as in previous rallies, the momentum faded. March 2025 observed a gradual descent, with prices falling back to the $0.05 range by the end of the month. April 2025 was highly volatile. NKN initially dipped to as low as $0.0211 but then experienced a sharp recovery, closing the month near $0.0429. This recovery carried into May, although the price faced resistance around the $0.043 level. As of mid-May, NKN trades near $0.0397 — a slight dip from earlier in the month, as the asset continues to struggle with reclaiming bullish strength.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-24 14:00:00

It recently crossed the $111K level, and experts are issuing bullish predictions, expecting it to climb even higher. What’s really driving the surge? Let’s find out. Bitcoin To Reach $125K By Q2 Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high is just the beginning, says Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit . If the current trend continues, he predicts Bitcoin could reach $125K by the end of Q2. He pointed to three key drivers behind the rally- “We’re seeing a unique convergence of factors—regulatory clarity, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic shifts—that are accelerating mainstream adoption”. The consistent capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs show that institutional investors are embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. And Bitcoin’s inverse correlation to the dollar is further boosting its role as digital gold, Jan said. With Bitcoin holding strong above $110K, Bybit’s $125K target by quarter’s end shows rising confidence in BTC as a key player in the future of global finance. Jan also highlighted the recently introduced GENIUS Act and said that having clear rules like this helps build trust and create the infrastructure needed for broader adoption. Cautious Outlook for Altcoins While he was bullish on Bitcoin, he was a bit cautious on altcoins. He noted that while Ethereum and other top coins may follow Bitcoin, high interest rates and global uncertainty might stop smaller tokens from rising as much. Analyst Scott Melker also predicts Bitcoin to hit $250,000 by the end of 2025, driven by strong institutional demand and a stable market. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped considerably and its ties with trad-fi could drive the next big rally. Bitcoin Is Undervalued, Says Adam Back Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, believes that Bitcoin is highly undervalued and could soar to $500,000–$1 million per coin in this market cycle. He was surprised at Bitcoin’s current price level despite the rise in institutional interest and breakthroughs. He thinks that the price still does not reflect the bullish momentum building behind Bitcoin. Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick predicts Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by 2025 and soar to $500,000 by 2029, driven by a shift away from U.S. assets. Meanwhile, Bernstein forecasts Bitcoin reaching $200,000 in the current bull run. Bitcoin has slipped 4% today to $107,200 while the broader market and stocks also pulled back as President Trump threatened a 50% tariff on all EU goods.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 14:03:04

Around 8:30 a.m. ET, users began reporting they couldn’t log in, view posts, or refresh feeds. Within fifteen minutes, over 25,000 complaints had piled up on Downdetector , a site that tracks user-submitted reports on technical issues. The blackout hit hard, and with no warning, it left a wide chunk of the platform’s base locked out. By mid-morning, X had yet to say a word. No updates. No system messages. Users flooded other platforms to complain, some suggesting it was another cyberattack like the one that shut the platform down back in March. During that incident, Elon posted, “We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources.” Source: Downdetector Elon juggles outages, political power, and backlash at Tesla Elon bought X in 2022, back when it was still called Twitter. Since then, the site’s had multiple blackouts, and every one of them adds fuel to the criticism about how it’s being run. This latest breakdown landed while Elon was busy with more than just tech. From May 17 to May 23, the billionaire was also handling his job as a senior advisor to President Donald Trump, focusing on something called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). On May 23, he posted on X about DOGE’s role in managing government spending, writing that “accelerating GDP growth” was now key to avoiding financial collapse. He also said the federal government wastes $100 million a year on unused phone lines and claimed DOGE is working to fix that. But Elon’s government ties aren’t sitting right with most people. Critics have raised concerns that his Grok AI, which is being adopted in government systems, creates a conflict of interest. If Elon’s advising the White House and also signing contracts to sell AI tools to federal agencies, it’s fair to ask where the line is. Elon is also trying to hold together Tesla, where things haven’t been smooth. Sales have dropped, and many blame the brand’s strong association with Trump for turning off potential buyers. Still, Elon went to the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha on May 20, where he told Bloomberg he was staying on as Tesla CEO for another five years. He claimed he’s focused on autonomous driving and developing the Optimus humanoid robot, which Tesla has been hyping for years. But while Elon talks robots, Tesla’s board is now working on a new compensation deal. A Delaware judge blocked his earlier $56 billion package, and the board is trying to figure out a new one. Outside of politics and cars, SpaceX is still flying–literally. On Friday night, Elon posted a congratulatory message to his team after they pulled off their 450th successful Falcon rocket landing. It’s a major number in the race to make space travel cheaper and reusable. Elon’s also been using his platform to hammer legacy media. Over the past week, he called them untrustworthy and pushed solar energy as the answer to everything. He claimed that solar is “very obviously the future,” backing that up with what he called “elementary math.” But even with solar panels and rockets in play, the controversies keep stacking up.

WLF further rejects the WSJ’s claims that the crypto project talked with Pakistani government officials about US policies during a business trip to the Middle East. Zhao described the WSJ article as a hit piece and a poor example of journalism, citing Cunningham’s law that the best way to get a correct answer is to broadcast a false answer first. The WSJ made various allegations against Zhao and WLF. The newspaper alleged that Zhao introduced WLF representatives to Pakistan, Malaysia, and Kyrgyzstan government officials. WSJ claims that Zhao used his extensive contact list to help WLF meet with government officials in these areas. WSJ argues that WLF only named Pakistani official Bilal Bin Saqib as an advisor after receiving help from Zhao, introducing the crypto startup with public figures in the Middle East. However, Zhao denies these claims and says that he is not a fixer for anyone. Zhao took to the X platform to deny the WSJ’s claims. The WLF crypto project is connected with President Trump through his sons, Eric and Donald Junior Trump. His sons are involved in the company’s management. Some suggest that Zhao seeks closer ties with Trump companies to secure a pardon. Zhao was imprisoned during the previous administration’s ‘war on crypto’. The WSJ claims Zhao was a fixer between WLF representatives and Pakistani government officials. Zhao denies acting as a fixer for WLF representatives, including WLF co-founder Zach Witkoff. The WSJ further suggested that WLF representatives and Pakistani officials created a memorandum of understanding. Zhao claims that the WLF officials were friends with the Pakistani official Bilal Bin Saqib long before he met him. Zhao argues that he met Saqib for the first time when he visited Pakistan. Zak Folkman, WLF co-founder, joined Zhao in denying the WSJ’s claims. Folkman said the WSJ article was false because Binance and WLF did not coordinate talks with Pakistani officials. Folkman revealed details about the WLF business trip to Pakistan. He said that WLF representatives, including himself, met up with Bilal Bin Saqib, whom he describes as a long-time friend. The WSJ article, however, claimed that Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao facilitated talks with Pakistani officials. Both Zhao and Folkman are adamant about falsehoods in the WSJ article. Folkman stated that he had not discussed foreign policy with the Pakistani official. For such a prominent newspaper to make a mistake would surely demand an explanation if such is the case. Zhao, moreover, believes that media outlets have a vested interest in disparaging the crypto industry. Zhao thinks the WSJ has become a mouthpiece for groups that wish to stop crypto growth in America. He also believes these groups want to thwart America from becoming a global leader in blockchain innovation. Zhao believes some groups still want to block American attempts to embrace crypto.

On XRPL alone, RLUSD reached a market cap of $44.2 million, making it the largest stablecoin on the network, according to the latest report by Messari. Due this growth, the total market cap of fungible tokens, known as Issued Currencies, surged by 6.5% QoQ to $281.5 million. RLUSD Stablecoin: Q1 2025 Despite this milestone, stablecoin adoption on XRPL remains limited compared to dominant stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which ended Q1 with total market caps of $144.0 billion and $60.1 billion, respectively, across all supported networks. Historically, the introduction of a trusted stablecoin in a new execution environment has triggered major liquidity events, as seen with Cardano’s iUSD in 2023, often serving as a key pairing asset in automated market makers (AMMs). Until recently, regulatorily compliant tokens like RLUSD, which feature Clawback – a mechanism on XRPL that lets issuers retrieve distributed tokens – were not compatible with the network’s automated market maker (AMM) due to the lack of Clawback support. This changed in January when the AMM Clawback amendment was implemented, allowing such tokens to be traded on the AMM. The update is expected to boost AMM activity as more compliant assets launch on XRPL. Potential applications include enabling on-chain trading of previously illiquid real-world assets (RWAs), earning yields through AMM participation, and cross-chain price arbitrage. Adoption Curve RLUSD launched publicly on December 17, 2024, on both XRPL and Ethereum. It is fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents, with monthly attestations provided by third-party firms. In January, Ripple announced the integration of Chainlink Price Feeds on Ethereum to provide RLUSD pricing data. In April, RLUSD was added to Ripple’s cross-border payment platform, Ripple Payments, while Kraken launched trading support. Additional Q1 listings came from LMAX Group, Zero Hash, and Bitstamp, joining Uphold, Bitso, MoonPay, Archax, CoinMENA, Independent Reserve, and Bullish. Further boosting infrastructure around RLUSD, Korean custody provider BDACS signed a strategic partnership with Ripple in February to offer custody services for XRP, RLUSD, and other digital assets.

The ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been around for the better part of the last eight years but struggled to take on more popular competitors like Ethereum throughout this time and, more recently, Solana and XRP. Finally, we may look at a trading pattern that might turn things around for the programmable digital currency. Popular X (formerly Twitter) trading analyst Ali Martinez said that ADA will likely present a massive move above $0.92 soon, provided the $0.72 support level is maintained. He tweeted this analytical graph: Image Source: X.com This pattern shows a high likelihood of ADA breaking the considerable resistance present above $0.9 and eventually shooting for the stars. However, to truly enter the altcoin season, it must overcome the major $1.24 price level it posted in December 2024. Cardano Holding Above $0.72 ADA is changing hands at around $0.75 at press time, up from sub-$0.65 levels from just a month ago. While ADA’s price recovery has been shown in the spot market, it has not shrugged off any price pullback concerns. Here is the graph from the last 40 days: Image Source: TradingView The price of ADA has reflected the considerable surge in the value of Bitcoin and the larger altcoin market during this time. However, it has performed below par, and the reason is that it is not able to carve out a unique position in the highly competitive altcoin market. Cardano Gearing Up For Massive Network Upgrades Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is on a mission to prove the programmable digital currency’s long-term utility. He is betting on a string of recent cross-chain capability-focused updates to the Cardano Network to help boost its credibility . Hoskinson tweeted : “What we are introducing with Leios, and eventually with the rest of the pipeline, will make Cardano the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet”. Cryptocurrency investors are looking at this upgrade with dogged enthusiasm as they prepare for a potentially massive second half of the 2025 calendar year, with huge gains to be made. It remains to be seen just how effective this update will be and whether or not it will challenge the authority of more fancied networks like Solana (SOL) in the coming months.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 14:23:04

While Ethereum and Bitcoin go up, Solana’s Layer 1 is quietly building momentum with new DeFi innovations and a good price structure. Now the question is can SOL ride this wave and outperform its big brothers? Jupiter Lend Drives Solana’s DeFi Growth Jupiter, a major decentralized exchange aggregator on the Solana blockchain, has launched Jupiter Lend, a lending protocol announced during the Solana Accelerate conference. Unlike traditional asset-collateralized platforms, Jupiter Lend has an 90% debt-to-asset ratio, allowing users to borrow more with less assets. This is designed to attract both retail and institutional players looking for efficient capital management. Features: One-click deposits and a “vault protocol” for easy borrowing Low fees of 0.1% Integration with Fluid , bringing Ethereum expertise to Solana’s ecosystem Jupiter has about 95% of Solana’s DEX aggregator volume, so it’s a big player. After the launch, JUP surged 12%. Analysts think this will boost Solana’s transaction volume and its position in DeFi. Kraken’s xStocks Expands Use Cases of Solana Kraken has launched xStocks , tokenized versions of Apple, Tesla, Nvidia and other major global equities, all tradable on the Solana blockchain. https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1925558402849112228 This is for international investors, especially in Europe, Asia and Latin America, to access US stocks through tokenized assets backed by real-world securities. Advantages: 24/7 trading on a blockchain known for speed and low fees Real-world asset backing via partnerships with Backed Finance Liquidity options to redeem for cash or use as collateral in DeFi strategies This puts Solana as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto, and attracts global traders looking for flexible, 24/7 access to both markets. Solana Technical Analysis – Bullish Bias In Play Solana price prediction remains bullish as on the 2-hour chart, SOL is consolidating in an ascending channel, making higher highs and higher lows—a sign of a strong uptrend. The 50-period EMA at $175.42 and the trendline at $173.06 are strong buy zones. Candlestick patterns show spinning tops, meaning indecision, but the recent bullish engulfing candle means buying is back. Technicals: Break above $181.57 and it’s $187.64 and $192.98 MACD crossover could mean momentum turns bullish Risk management : pullbacks to $173.06 are buys with stops below $165.50 For new and experienced traders, this is a clear opportunity to ride Solana’s breakout if momentum aligns with ETH and BTC. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the SOL/USD pair hovers near $176.40, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

This is the first uninterrupted streak of daily ETF inflows in four weeks and highlights renewed institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin ETFs Weekly Inflows Surge 4.5× According to Farside Investors data, between May 17 and May 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs amassed $2.75 billion—up sharply from $608 million the previous week. The spike coincided with Bitcoin’s climb above its January all-time high of $109,000 on May 21 and a fresh peak of $111,970 on May 22 . ETF inflows have historically tracked broader market momentum, and this week’s inflows suggest growing confidence in Bitcoin’s near-term outlook. On May 23 alone, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $211.7 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out, adding $430.8 million and extending its consecutive inflow streak to eight days. In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw $89.2 million in outflows, while ARK 21Shares’ ARKB shed $73.9 million. The performance gap underscores a rotation toward cheaper fee structures and broader issuer choice within the ETF space. Through May 23, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have gathered approximately $5.39 billion in monthly inflows. With five trading days remaining, they are poised to surpass November 2024’s record $6.49 billion monthly total. A new monthly high would further cement ETFs as a primary conduit for institutional capital into Bitcoin. Bitcoin traded around $108,141 at the close of May 23, down from the $111,970 all-time high two days earlier. Over the same period, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 66 (“Greed”) from 78 (“Extreme Greed”), pointing to a mild cooling in market exuberance amid heavy inflows. Meanwhile, spot exchange volume mirrored ETF flows, with 24-hour volumes exceeding $50 billion on key venues. ETF Flows vs. Traditional Markets The inflows into Bitcoin ETFs occurred alongside weakness in U.S. equities. On May 22, the S&P 500 fell 0.7% amid rising Treasury yields, even as Bitcoin peaked. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s decoupling from stocks during this bout of volatility underscores its maturing status as a portfolio diversifier. Analysts highlight that ETF inflows could drive a structural shift in Bitcoin’s liquidity profile by shifting demand from spot to regulated vehicles. Key catalysts include U.S. macro releases, particularly the May CPI report due May 13 and the Federal Reserve’s subsequent policy signals. Regulatory developments, such as potential SEC approvals for additional Bitcoin ETFs, may also steer fund flows.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin ETF|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 14:28:35

The university said about 20% of its foreign students in 2024 were from China, which directly placed the elite school at the center of Washington’s growing fight with Beijing. The decision was temporarily halted on Friday after a federal judge blocked the order following a lawsuit filed by the Cambridge-based university. Harvard said the federal government was targeting it for its “perceived viewpoint,” which it claimed violated its rights under the First Amendment. The accusation wasn’t Harvard’s first encounter with Washington’s suspicions, but this time, the Trump White House is dragging out the full file. Trump officials link Harvard to Chinese government activities According to Reuters, multiple Republican lawmakers and White House officials said Harvard had allowed the Chinese government to gain access to Jim technology, dodge national security laws, and crush open criticism on American campuses. “For too long, Harvard has let the Chinese Communist Party exploit it,” said a White House official, who claimed the school ignored “vigilante CCP-directed harassment on-campus.” For decades, Harvard has run China-focused programs, accepted major financial gifts, and hosted academic centers connected to Chinese institutions. These partnerships gave Harvard global reach—but now they’re being painted as tools of foreign interference. The House Select Committee on China, led by Republicans, has echoed the administration’s stance and listed Harvard’s public health training with Chinese entities as evidence. One case that drew major attention was Harvard’s training programs for officials from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC). The XPCC is a Chinese paramilitary group that was sanctioned by the Jim in 2020 for its role in the abuse of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. The Department of Homeland Security said those ties continued through 2024 despite sanctions. Beijing’s response came quickly. The Chinese embassy in Washington said: “Educational exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States are mutually beneficial and should not be stigmatized.” Still, both the Trump and Biden administrations have labeled Beijing’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, and any links to organizations tied to that region have now become politically toxic in D.C. Harvard donations, expelled activist, and foreign funding probe stir backlash Scrutiny also deepened over Ronnie Chan, a Hong Kong-based billionaire who helped orchestrate a $350 million donation to Harvard in 2014 that resulted in the School of Public Health being renamed after his father, T.H. Chan. Ronnie is a member of the China-United States Exchange Foundation, an organization labeled a foreign principal under Jim law. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, lobbyists working with the group are legally required to disclose their ties. That raised red flags about whether Harvard was properly reporting its international donations and influence. In April, the Education Department asked Harvard to hand over its foreign funding records, citing incomplete and inaccurate filings involving large gifts and contracts from overseas. That came the same month a Harvard student activist was physically removed from a public event after interrupting a speech by China’s Ambassador Xie Feng. The person who removed the activist wasn’t a university official or campus security; it was a Chinese exchange student. That incident added more fuel to claims that Chinese-linked students are policing free speech on Jim campuses. Harvard has also faced fallout from its past faculty. Charles Lieber, a former Harvard chemistry professor, was a central target of the Trump-era China Initiative, a program launched in 2018 aimed at stopping Chinese espionage and theft of Jim intellectual property. Lieber was convicted in 2021 for lying about his ties to China while conducting federally funded research. By April 2024, he had become a full-time professor at a Chinese university. The China Initiative itself was shut down by the Biden administration, after critics claimed it resulted in racial profiling and created a chilling effect on international scientific collaboration. But the Trump administration clearly hasn’t let it go. The new actions against Harvard show that concerns over China’s influence in Jim institutions are far from over.

According to a bulletin from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, which reports breaches of unsecured protected health information affecting 500 people or more, the Missouri-based healthcare company Ascension has been hit by a “hacking/IT” incident. Ascension says 437,329 people are affected, and a letter that’s being sent to clients says the firm “inadvertently disclosed information” to a former third-party business partner, and the information was most likely stolen due a software vulnerability. Ascenion says an investigation determined that its clients’ names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender, and Social Security numbers (SSN), as well as clinical information related to inpatient visits, such as place of service, physician name, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and billing codes, medical record numbers, and insurance company name, may have all been exposed, depending on the individual. The company has not addressed whether the compromised information had been used by bad actors. However, in the governent’s alert, the Ascension hack was reported to have affected 437,329 victims. For now, Ascension is offering its clients two years of complimentary identity monitoring services, and urges vigilance against fraud. “We regret any inconvenience this incident may cause and are providing you with information about steps you can take to help protect your information.

The event, held at Trump National Golf Club in Loudoun County, served as a celebration for top investors in the meme-based $TRUMP coin and a statement of policy direction. “The U.S.A. is DOMINATING in Crypto, Bitcoin, etc., and we are going to keep it that way!” the president posted on Truth Social hours before attending the event on May 23. Addressing a high-profile crowd of crypto investors, including TRON founder Justin Sun, who reportedly invested over $1.3 million in TRUMP, President Trump praised attendees as “pioneers” of the new digital economy. Despite the event’s prestige and luxury, several guests expressed disappointment over the president’s lack of substantial interaction. “He just gave a few remarks and left,” one VIP attendee commented, noting that hopes for a Q&A or deeper engagement were unmet, according to a source familiar with the meeting. The gala, attended by roughly 220 guests, including 25 top wallet holders who received special access at a VIP cocktail hour, has drawn criticism from ethics watchdogs and congressional Democrats. Concerns were raised over potential conflicts of interest, influence peddling, and donor transparency. Critics argue that events like these could provide wealthy crypto figures with outsized access to the president, potentially shaping policy to benefit their interests. Responding to the backlash, the White House insisted that Trump’s financial assets are managed in a blind trust and that he remains compliant with all conflict-of-interest laws. A spokesperson emphasized that the administration’s commitment is rooted in innovation, not favoritism, highlighting recent initiatives such as creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader national digital asset stockpile. The administration claims these steps are part of a larger push to ensure that the U.S. remains at the forefront of the rapidly evolving digital financial system. Supporters argue that Trump’s policies mark a long-awaited shift in federal attitude toward crypto, moving from skepticism to aggressive support. However, the president’s show of confidence in crypto leadership came on the same day markets were shaken by geopolitical tensions. Trump’s threat to impose 50% tariffs on EU imports triggered a wave of volatility in global financial markets, with European stocks dropping sharply and Bitcoin falling from its new all-time high of $111,340. The move also raised concerns over how U.S. protectionist policies might influence the delicate balance of risk appetite in crypto markets.

45045726,https://zycrypto.com/?p=106483,1748097731,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Analysts Forecast Institutions Will Own 20% of Bitcoin Supply by 2026,https://zycrypto.com/analysts-forecast-institutions-will-own-20-of-bitcoin-supply-by-2026/,"According to a Thursday report from crypto investment firm Bitwise, institutional investors are on track to hold a staggering 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply, approximately 4.2 million BTC, by the end of 2026 . This projection highlights a new chapter in Bitcoin’s adoption story, driven not by retail enthusiasm or tech innovation but by strategic financial decisions from governments, corporations, and wealth managers. Bitwise’s estimates peg the cumulative institutional inflows into Bitcoin at $120 billion in 2025 and another $300 billion in 2026, assuming a benchmark BTC price of $100,000. These inflows would bring the institutional share of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million coin supply to more than 20%. “We’re entering an era where Bitcoin isn’t just an investment—it’s becoming a balance-sheet imperative,” said Bitwise analysts. “From nation-states to Wall Street wirehouses, everyone is eyeing Bitcoin as a strategic asset.” Notably, the report breaks down institutional buyers into five key groups: nation-states, public companies, U.S. states, wealth management platforms, and sovereign wealth funds. According to the firm, the U.S. government already leads the pack with 198,000 BTC in federal custody. If new legislation like the BITCOIN Act is passed, the analyst projects that that number could climb by 200,000 BTC annually for the next five years. Corporations, too, are accelerating adoption. Public companies hold over 600,000 BTC, and Bitwise expects that number to nearly double by 2026. One notable newcomer, Twenty-One, a Bitcoin-native public company backed by Tether and SoftBank, is launching with over 42,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Bitwise credits recent accounting rule changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the corporate sector as a major tailwind. These rules allow companies to mark Bitcoin holdings at fair market value, incentivizing broader adoption. Wealth management firms, long considered sleeping giants, are also awakening. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and other firms managing a combined $60 trillion in assets are beginning to greenlight Bitcoin ETFs. If even 0.5% of that wealth shifts into BTC, that alone would account for over 3 million coins, which is roughly 14% of the total supply. Perhaps most striking is the momentum behind sovereign adoption. Central banks facing inflation and geopolitical instability are increasingly eyeing Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The Bitwise report models a scenario where even 5% of global gold reserves are converted into Bitcoin, resulting in 1.6 million BTC moving to state treasuries. At the state level, more than a dozen U.S. states are exploring Bitcoin reserve strategies. Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire have already passed legislation, and others like Ohio and North Carolina are considering similar moves. If the Bitwise forecasts are correct, Bitcoin’s supply dynamics will be permanently altered, setting the stage for heightened scarcity and potentially explosive price movement. “These aren’t short-term trades,” Bitwise concluded. “Institutions accumulating Bitcoin today are preparing for a world where it becomes a global reserve standard.”",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 14:42:11

Overall, the crypto market is in an upward trend, which often makes it the perfect time to invest in small cap tokens with a price below 1 cent. So far, Ripple (XRP) investors have identified Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the best options. Why Ripple (XRP) investors picked Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A major reason for picking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the potential for long-term stable returns. Amidst market volatility, investors in the crypto sector have a keen eye for projects that signal long-term strength through innovation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set itself apart in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world with dual model lending implementation. The first one is P2P, and the second one is P2C or peer-to-contract. Within the peer-to-contract (P2C) model, lenders deposit their assets inside into a common pool, for instance $3000 worth of ETH or another asset. Borrowers can then take loans from this pool using overcollateralization. The yield that lenders receive is based on the pool utilization, with higher utilization leading to higher percentage annual yields. Once a lender deposits their assets, they receive a corresponding mtToken, for instance, mtETH. These mtTokens can be redeemed for the principal amount they deposited, plus any interest accrued over that period. The mtTokens are an asset with unique use cases, that include being transferable to third parties. Additionally, it can be used on third party DeFi applications as collateral. The unique stablecoin design On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized stablecoin will be launched, which has unique features that make it stand out from existing decentralized stablecoins. One of these unique features is multi-asset collateralization. In most existing DeFi stablecoins, each asset used as collateral goes into a separate vault. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a unique multi-asset system that will allow users to use a basket of assets as collateral to receive stablecoins. In all instances, the stablecoin will be overcollateralized to ensure the long-term stability of the system. This stablecoin will launch at a fixed price of $1. To ensure price stability at this point, the platform will rely on market forces through arbitrage. In short, market forces will determine the price of the stablecoin, with borrowers incentivized to maintain it through a series of automated actions. Price stability will promote mass adoption, while also growing ecosystem participation by investors looking for arbitrage opportunities. To bolster the long-term strength of the stablecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will employ a strategy of multiple issuers. These issues, who are approved by smart contracts, will have the power to create and destroy stablecoin, based on specific strategies. Each issue will have a set allocation, which has a cap on how many stablecoin they can generate. Authorized maintainers will set these allocations, which can be revised over time. Instead of a single mechanism, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) envisions multiple strategies being used by different issuers to stabilize the stablecoin. Consequently, it diversifies how stablecoins are issues, which could improve liquidity, and maintain the peg at $1. With these strategies, there is the opportunity for new, and innovative strategies to be utilized to help the stablecoin adapt to new technologies, and changing conditions. Cost optimization on L2 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to optimize transaction costs on layer 2 (L2) networks by focusing on calldata, which is the main contributor of fees. To do this, the protocol will compress all required information into a single byte-encoded string, reducing on-chain storage and thus transaction costs. The project is also working on special contract logic that will ensure transactions are efficient and low cost. This aligns with the developer team’s goal of great scalability, and accessibility for lenders and borrowers. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not plan to be just another DeFi protocol. It seeks to revolutionize how DeFi works with unique approaches to decentralized stablecoins, network fees, and lending mechanisms. By creating multiple avenues to earn, it will ensure long-term staking returns for its stakers. The opportunity to be part of this ecosystem is ripe, with the phase 5 presale tokens going for $0.03 per token. For those who grabbed the opportunity in phase 1, they managed to get the tokens at just $0.01. However, with a planned listing price of $0.06, the opportunity is still there. You can be part of this revolution in decentralized finance today, before the presale enters phase 6.

In his statement on his social media account, Wedson stated that the BTC/USD parity, which has the highest trading volume against the dollar, broke the record, but said that the same was not the case for other fiat currencies. According to Wedson, in order for Bitcoin to break records against other major currencies, it needs to rise at the following rates: 10.3 percent against the euro 11.5 percent against the British pound 11 percent against the Swiss franc 10 percent against Japanese yen 8 percent against the South Korean won 5 percent against the Canadian dollar 29 percent against the Russian ruble 8 percent against the Brazilian real Related News: A Person Who Attended US President Donald Trump's Crypto Dinner Shared Inside Details: He Also Revealed How Much He Paid to Attend Wedson noted that these differences clearly demonstrate the impact of exchange rates on the cryptocurrency market. “Looking beyond the dollar, we see that there is still significant room for upside. But this also indicates that new resistance levels may be formed,” he said. Wedson also pointed out some advantages that most investors are not aware of: “Bitcoin pairs traded with currencies such as the euro and ruble may offer higher statistical asymmetry compared to the dollar pair. However, this is not talked about much in the market.” *This is not investment advice.

James Wynn holds a $1.1B Bitcoin long with 40x leverage on Hyperliquid exchange. $HYPE’s price surge triggered liquidations, but strong momentum keeps bulls intact. Arthur Hayes ignited discussion on May 24 when he tweeted about a $HYPE “cleanse.” The statement came after dramatic price increases for the token that began on May 23, when the value climbed as high as $37.24. As a result of the spike, several short positions were liquidated, and one position was said to have lost $23 million. Hayes’ remarks hinted that a large bullish trader might face liquidation, sparking speculation about future volatility. Hayes mentioned a “degen bull whale,” which probably refers to James Wynn, a pseudonymous trader who often takes high-risk strategies. The question arose about whether Wynn could be under pressure to adjust his exposure because of recent market turbulence.

With XRP currently trading near $2.32, it remains one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for those seeking a fundamentally sound asset with large-cap stability. However, for investors with a higher risk appetite aiming for exponential gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap crypto is performing well. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one faster than expected. Over $9.1 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,000 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. Some analysts believe its ultra-low entry point and rapidly growing community position it as the next crypto to explode, possibly outperforming XRP in the short term. For those asking what crypto to buy now, both coins offer unique upside, but Mutuum’s potential for a 50x return is turning heads fast. XRP Price Prediction: Ripple Targets $5 as Market Momentum Builds Ripple’s XRP, which stands currently at around $2.32, is gaining traction once again with rising legal certainty and global adoption of its payment systems. Insiders are predicting a likely rise to $5 in the coming bull cycle fueled by rising institutional demand and Ripple’s steady push towards the incorporation into financial infrastructure. With its established history and usability, XRP is among the leading cryptocurrencies to invest in for short-term and long-term gains. While XRP’s upside potential is enormous, newer entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also becoming popular for their explosive growth potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. That more than 11,000 investors have invested $9.1 million in the presale is a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $1 after launch. Transforming DeFi with a Hybrid Lending Approach Mutuum Finance is unique in that it combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. Through the P2C model, users are able to accrue passive income through USDT liquidity pools, reaping the advantage of automated lending by smart contracts. On the other hand, the P2P model facilitates direct-to-peer transactions without the involvement of an intermediary, giving users complete control over their funds. By hybridizing these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, which is a perfect offer for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards. Ten lucky users will be given $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and by inviting friends to join, users can earn as more rewards. Over $9.1 million raised and more than 11,000 investors onboard mark a powerful signal that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining unstoppable traction. As the presale price climbs from $0.03 to $0.035, early buyers are locked in for a 100% ROI at launch—and possibly far more as analysts eye a 50x breakout in 2025. Ripple’s XRP may be targeting $5, but MUTM’s ultra-low entry point, disruptive DeFi model, and explosive demand make it one of the most compelling crypto investments right now. Once Phase 5 ends, this price window closes for good. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance today before the next price hike leaves you behind.

Despite this, the broader outlook for XRP is bullish, with the altcoin generally moving in lockstep with Bitcoin and the wider crypto rally. According to recent analysis, a key technical signal just flashed, one that previously preceded a massive 600% rally in November 2024. Familiar Weekly RSI Signal Returns After 200 Days According to crypto analyst Dark Defender, XRP has once again produced a rare Golden Cross on its weekly RSI indicator, an event that last occurred on November 4, 2024. That signal directly preceded XRP’s explosive 600% rally, and its reappearance points to the potential emergence of a similar trajectory for the crypto. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explains XRP Price Roadmap To $37 As Bears Fight For Control Notably, the appearance of the new RSI cross coincides with the elimination of a long-standing weekly resistance trendline after XRP broke to $2.59 on May 14. The analyst’s chart clearly highlights this breakout, with a bright green trendline now breached and a bullish pin bar candlestick forming just above it, adding strength to the bullish case. The RSI’s behavior in the 1W candlestick timeframe chart below is also particularly telling. The purple RSI line has crossed above the yellow moving average once again, exactly as it did in early November 2024. Back then, XRP flashed the cross when its price was trading around $0.5. However, the ensuing price action saw it explode by over 600% to peak at a multi-year high around $3.31 on January 12, 2025. $3.33 In Sight, But $5.85 May Be The Real Prize Considering the previous price action after the weekly RSI cross in late 2024, crypto analyst Dark Defender’s outlook is based on repeating the same 600% rally or close in the coming weeks. Following this development, Dark Defender has outlined two key price targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Confirms Bullish Reversal Setup With This Demand Zone The first is $3.33, close to the multi-year peak in January 2025. Should XRP break past that level, the next major target lies around $5.85, corresponding to the 261.8% Fibonacci level. The analyst refers to this upper range as the parapet, meaning that this level could be the next all-time high peak after the price rally. The Elliott Wave structure plotted on the chart outlines a five-wave impulsive move, and XRP is now about to enter wave III, the longest and most powerful wave in a bullish cycle. If this structure plays out as expected, XRP could rapidly push through $2.59, hold above $3.33, and rally toward the upper boundary of the projection range. Interestingly, none of these price targets uses a repeat of the full 600% rally. The $3.33 target is 43% away from the current price level, while $5.85 represents a 150% gain from the current price. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.34.

Garlinghouse acknowledged that he was “hurt but excited” to finally be spotlighted in such high-level discussions after years of being overlooked — but more importantly, he emphasized the transformative significance of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for institutional players. JUST IN: Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse explains growing institutional adoption of $XRP and $RLUSD pic.twitter.com/TR20ajAULF — Crypto Briefing (@Crypto_Briefing) May 23, 2025 Unlocking Institutional Access to Crypto According to Garlinghouse, institutional investors—those traditionally active on Wall Street—have long faced barriers when it comes to entering the crypto market. Previously, their options were limited: they could either self-custody assets, which raises concerns around security and complexity, or work through centralized crypto exchanges, which many investors distrust for various reasons, including regulatory uncertainties and counterparty risk. Crypto ETFs, however, change the game entirely. These investment vehicles allow institutions to gain direct exposure to digital assets through familiar Wall Street channels, bypassing many operational and regulatory hurdles that once kept institutional capital on the sidelines. Garlinghouse underscored that this represents a major “unlock” for capital pools like pension funds and endowments, which can now access the crypto market in a compliant, regulated, and easily tradable format. Bitcoin ETFs Signal Broader Institutionalization Garlinghouse also pointed to the remarkable success of the Bitcoin ETF, which became the fastest ETF in history to reach $1 billion in assets under management. This rapid institutional adoption, he noted, signals not just a passing trend but the broader institutionalization of the crypto market as a whole. The comparison to gold ETFs underscores a key narrative: crypto, once seen as fringe or speculative, is now entering the financial mainstream alongside legacy assets like gold. Crypto ETFs’ record-breaking success and substantial inflows are boosting institutional investors’ confidence in digital assets’ long-term prospects. XRP’s Strength in the Institutional Landscape While much of the public attention has focused on Bitcoin ETFs , Ripple’s CEO is looking beyond Bitcoin toward Ripple’s own expanding ecosystem, particularly XRP. XRP has long been positioned as a bridge asset for cross-border payments, and institutional interest in it has been accelerating, particularly as regulatory clarity improves in key markets. Notably, XRP was one of the few tokens explicitly identified as not being secure in last year’s landmark ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, giving institutional players added confidence to engage with the asset. This clarity, paired with Ripple’s robust network of banking and payment partners, has positioned XRP as a leading candidate for institutional use cases, from liquidity provision to international remittances.

Stablecoins are increasingly viewed as essential financial instruments for crypto-native and traditional institutions, offering a reliable on-chain store of value and medium of exchange. With RLUSD, Ripple can now offer institutions a compliant, enterprise-grade stablecoin solution, tightly integrated with its payment and liquidity solutions. This expansion is especially critical as regulatory scrutiny intensifies: institutions are looking for partners and products that combine technological innovation with regulatory reliability, and Ripple is positioning itself to meet that demand head-on. Shaping the Future of Institutional Crypto Adoption While Bitcoin dominates the market narrative, Ripple is focused on establishing XRP and RLUSD as institutional assets in their own right. As crypto ETFs continue to break records and mainstream digital assets, Ripple’s focus on regulatory clarity, enterprise integration, and cross-border utility sets it apart from many competitors. As evident in Garlinghouse’s comments , Ripple’s leadership demonstrates that the company is not just following the institutional trend but actively driving the future of institutional adoption in crypto. With financial giants increasingly interested in crypto markets, XRP, RLUSD, and the maturing ETF landscape suggest that Ripple is poised for growth. As the market evolves, Ripple’s dual emphasis on technological innovation and regulatory alignment may be its most valuable assets, drawing in the kind of institutional capital that could redefine the scale and scope of the crypto economy in the years ahead.

Gox (Bitcoin) Collapse,https://timestabloid.com/expert-strongly-warns-xrp-holders-avoid-a-replica-of-mt-gox-bitcoin-collapse/,"Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and well-known XRP advocate, has issued a stark warning to XRP holders, urging them to consider the consequences of trusting centralized exchanges with their digital assets. In a recent post on X, Farina revisited the infamous 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox , one of the most catastrophic events in cryptocurrency history, as a cautionary example for modern investors. Study Mt. Gox (BTC Collapse in 2014). An inside job in which 850,000 BTC were “lost”. Customers didn’t get back their Crypto.

Gox trustees held… — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 27, 2025 According to Farina, the loss of approximately 850,000 Bitcoins during the Mt. Gox debacle remains a critical lesson in the risks of third-party custodianship. Many users at the time were left with little recourse after the exchange abruptly halted operations, citing vague technical issues. Farina argued that the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the funds pointed to internal foul play rather than an honest mistake. Those who failed to secure their Bitcoin outside of Mt. Gox lost access to their holdings and missed the immense growth that followed. When the exchange went offline, Bitcoin was trading around $400. The asset recently crossed $110,000, and some investors are yet to recover all their assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Partial Recovery and Long-Term Impact The platform’s trustees maintained possession of a significant portion of the recovered assets, delaying repayment for years. Although some progress has been made through a civil rehabilitation process, Farina noted that the damage had already been done. By mid-2024, the trustees had returned over 140,000 BTC and additional assets to creditors. However, the vast majority of users only regained a small portion of what they originally lost. Many were compensated in fiat currency, calculated using Bitcoin’s value at the time of the collapse. Others received partial repayments in digital currency, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Estimates suggest that users recovered roughly 15% of their original holdings. For affected individuals, this meant that for every 100 BTC lost, they might have received only 15 BTC, significantly undercutting potential long-term gains, particularly considering Bitcoin’s price at the time of distribution in 2024 had risen to around $63,000. The Lesson for XRP Investors Farina connected the lessons of Mt. Gox directly to today’s XRP investors, stressing the importance of self-custody in an increasingly volatile exchange landscape. Farina recently advised XRP holders to transfer their assets to cold wallets , and high-profile failures like the 2022 collapse of FTX and the earlier demise of QuadrigaCX reinforce this stance. Self-custody solutions such as the Xaman wallet (formerly Xumm) are good options for software-based storage, and a har dware wallet like Ledger that keeps private keys offline can eliminate the risk of third-party compromise.

During that time, it has proven to be one of the most transformative technologies in the financial world. At the core, DeFi is a technology that offers most of the benefits of the legacy financial system, coupled with greater efficiency, transparency, and speed. One of the latest projects developed in the DeFi space is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which combines all developments of decentralized finance in the last decade, coupled with new implementations of the technology. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is gearing up to be one of the most disruptive ecosystems in recent memory, and the crypto world is taking note. How DeFi is reshaping and complementing traditional finance DeFi has been a force of disruption in traditional finance. When DeFi started gaining momentum a few years back, most platforms had no real use cases. At the time, DeFi was still immature, and as a result, had low trust from the masses. However, it also planted the idea that a financial system could grow without having to ask for permission from centralized organizations. The shift in mindset continues today, as DeFi projects continue to put out real products that have a real impact on people worldwide. It is also solving real world problems, while managing to maintain a high degree of autonomy from the centralized financial system that is often cloaked in mystery, and secrecy. Today, crypto-native traders demand professional products and data that can compete with the best in the legacy financial world. Thus far, as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will demonstrate, when it goes live, the DeFi developers have kept up with these changing preferences. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at the helm of the DeFi revolution, it could help to enhance products currently offered in the legacy financial world. One of the main advantages it brings is real-time dynamic yield adjustment based on prevailing conditions. It will also allow users to unlock their value of their assets in real time, and benefit from their value appreciation later on. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a major step up in DeFi capabilities While the future of the financial world is not going to be wholly centralized or wholly decentralized, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating that it can innovate its way to success. The project operates via a dual lending model that combines peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) capabilities. With the peer-to-peer (P2P) model, users can interact directly with each other, set the terms, and borrow and lend assets from each other via smart contracts. The P2P model allows lenders to potentially get higher returns, while borrowers can have access to assets with much higher volatility. On the peer-to-contract (P2C) model, lenders deposit assets in common liquidity pools, for instance, $10,000 worth of ETH. In return, they received an annual percentage-based yield, which is determined by the utilization of the pool. Borrowers who wish to access assets deposited in these pools can deposit collateral that is more than the amount they need. In exchange, it allows them to unlock the full potential of their assets, while at the same time preserving them for potential future gains. Lenders are incentivized through various mechanisms besides the interest on their assets. One of them is buy back and distribute, where the project will utilize fees from various platform activities to buy back MUTM tokens, and distribute a portion of them to stakers who maintain liquidity in the ecosystem. As a result, lenders will experience an appreciation of their MUTM assets due to upward price pressure, while at the same time, receiving new MUTM assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduced a unique setup for its decentralized stablecoin. Instead, the traditional setup where borrowers need separate vaults for each asset they want to use as collateral, the protocol supports multi-asset collateral for minting stablecoins. The process helps to simplify access to the decentralized stablecoin, while maintaining the highest level of transparency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale pulls in the masses The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been a shining success since its launch. Currently in phase 5, it has managed to raise over $9,2 million from over 11,000 participants. Many of these buyers joined the presale in phase 1 while the token price was just $0.01. Since then, they have continued to increase their MUTM holdings, even as the price has appreciated 200% to $0.03. With its listing price set at $0.06, they still view it as a massive bargain. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project represents a rare opportunity for anyone to become part of the future of DeFi. Its innovative products will position it well and attract buyers looking for stable, long-term growth. With the price set to go up in phase 6, joining now could be a great move.

In an open X post, Bjelic reflected on the project’s history, writing, “As projects get mature and grow up, it is understandable for visions to diverge and grow.” He added that he will continue to support the ecosystem from the sidelines. Industry Reactions to Bjelic’s Exit The announcement had a strong response across the crypto ecosystem. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal referred to Bjelic as “a force behind so much of what makes Polygon what it is today.” Others did as well. Polygon’s head of marketing, Leon Stern, thanked Bjelic for his efforts, and Skale Network CEO Jack O’Holleran wished him well in his next adventure and congratulated him on his achievements. Aave-chan Initiative’s Marc Zella called it a “Big L for Polygon.” Not the First Founder Exit Bjelic’s exit is one of a chain of departures for Polygon’s original leadership. Over the last two years, co-founders Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun also departed Polygon. Arjun now leads Avail, a spin-out data availability and consensus layer project. Though absent, Bjelic continued to express his enthusiasm for the crypto environment: “You will most likely still see me around,” he said. Polygon Keeps Expanding Through Leadership Transitions Regardless of these shifts in leadership, Polygon remains active with massive developments . During March, DigiShares launched tokenized real estate on Polygon in live form with RealEstate.Exchange (REX). Earlier, in January, Indian telecom giant Jio Platforms announced a partnership with Polygon Labs to implement Web3 solutions.

This move not only corroborates XRPL's rising appeal for regulated issuers but serves as a shot across the bow that Ripple intends to take on entrenched stablecoin hubs such as Tron and Stellar for compliance and functionality. A Set of Regulated Stablecoins EURØP : Paris-headquartered central bank-licensed Schuman Financial unveiled EURØP as the first MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin on XRPL. Every token is fully collateralized by stored euros in well-known European banks such as Société Générale and is frequently audited by KPMG to ensure transparency and trust. EURØP is registered as an electronic money token under the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rule, which requires full reserve backing and tight governance — conditions that are rapidly becoming the standard for stablecoins in Europe. USDB : Brazil's Braza Group issued USDB, a USD-pegged stablecoin designed to supplement its earlier Brazilian real-backed token, BBRL. USDB is backed by United States and Brazilian government bonds and expects to capture a major share of Brazil's USD stablecoin market within the coming year. The token is designed for institutional and retail consumers and acts as a hedge against local currency volatility while enabling faster, lower-cost digital payments particularly for remittances and cross-border trade. XSGD : StraitsX, the Southeast Asia payment infrastructure leader, has listed XSGD, a Singapore dollar-backed stablecoin, on XRPL. Fully backed by reserves at DBS Bank and Standard Chartered, XSGD is already present in considerable numbers on various blockchains. Its listing on XRPL will surely inspire adoption by fintech startups, developers, and financial institutions that need rapid, programmable, and compliant cross-border payments. Liquidity, DeFi, and the Hooks Upgrade What sets XRPL apart is that it has a natively integrated decentralized exchange (DEX) and novel ”Hooks” protocol upgrade, facilitating automated market making and custom smart contract logic at the protocol level. What this means is that newer stablecoins like EURØP, USDB, and XSGD can be traded immediately, paired, and utilized in DeFi applications without the lag of third-party smart contract deployment. The XRPL DEX auto-bridging feature additionally fosters liquidity by allowing low-cost, instant swapping between XRP, stablecoins, and other assets in a matter of seconds. The Gold Standard for Euro Stablecoins MiCA, the EU's blanket crypto regulation, is transforming the stablecoin environment by mandating full reserve backing, routine audits, and rigorous operational transparency. EURØP's launch puts XRPL in the frame as a compliant network for networks such as Tron, which are yet to witness major MiCA-compliant euro stablecoins. As EU exchanges start delisting non-compliant tokens, MiCA-approved assets such as EURØP stand to grab institutional and retail demand for regulated, euro-denominated digital money. Ripple's Competitive Edge: XRPL over Tron and Stellar While Tron dominates stablecoin volumes in emerging markets and Stellar is renowned for open-access remittances, Ripple's XRPL is carving out a niche among regulated institutions and commerce. The benefits of XRPL include fast and low-cost settlement, a native DEX with liquidation, regulatory tooling for compliance-focused issuers, and tokenized real-world asset and DeFi support. In contrast with Stellar, which prioritizes decentralization and user access, Ripple prioritizes connecting traditional finance with blockchain strength making XRRL a go-to destination for banks, fintechs, and regulated stablecoin issuers. Cross-Border Payments and DeFi Growth The launch of these three stablecoins — all backed by strong institutions and built for regulatory suitability marks a new chapter for Ripple DeFi and cross-border payments. Since remittances and global trade demand speed, openness, and transparency across rails, XRPL's stablecoin ecosystem is now poised to serve as building blocks for the next generation of on-chain, compliant, and borderless financial innovation. Now that the stablecoin fray is heating up, Ripple's XRPL is no longer just a contender — it's paving the way for regulated, real-world cryptocurrency.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-24 15:29:34

Sun’s declaration follows his attendance at an exclusive dinner event for holders of Trump’s meme coin . The crypto entrepreneur wrote in a social media post that the administration recognizes America’s potential to become “the hottest region for blockchain and crypto.” He also promised to do “everything” in his “power” to keep it that way. https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1926157044077265093 Trump shindig draws scrutiny According to reports , Sun was among notable attendees at the private gathering held at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. The dinner hosted the top 220 investors of the Trump ( TRUMP ) coin. The guest list reportedly included executives from major crypto firms. This includes BitMart, Wintermute, Delphi Digital, CTS International, Hyperithm, Origin, Acheron Trading, Magic Eden, Synthetix, and Kronos. The event has generated controversy due to Trump’s use of a presidential seal-adorned podium during his address to the crypto investors. According to Forbes , legal experts have raised questions about potential violations of federal law. They specifically cited Section 713 of Title 18 of the United States Code, which prohibits unauthorized use of the presidential seal in ways that could suggest federal endorsement. You might also like: Will Tron price rise as crypto billionaire Justin Sun meets Trump? The statute carries penalties of up to six months’ imprisonment or fines for violations. This is because the presidential seal is traditionally reserved for official government occasions. Historical precedent shows that previous administrations like those of Obama and Biden avoided using the presidential insignia during private business activities. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed conflict-of-interest concerns surrounding the dinner. She emphasized that Trump attended “in his personal time” and clarified that it was “not a White House dinner” or an official government event. Still, both Democrats and Republicans are taking issue with the fact that Trump and his family are directly profiting off the Official Trump meme coin and granting exclusive access to the U.S. Executive branch to those who pay up — which is what Sun did. Sun, a China-born entrepreneur and billionaire who once avoided the U.S. altogether due to legal scrutiny surrounding Tron, is suddenly attending a VIP dinner hosted by Trump. According to the Wall Street Journal, he owns some $23 million in Trump’s memecoin. Other observers are pointing out what they perceive as blatant hypocrisy, considering the Trump family — for years — levied accusations against the Biden family over their business dealings. Congressional investigations followed. Hunter Biden, Trump and his allies alleged, sold access to Joe Biden back when he was vice president during the Obama administration, with no conclusive proof. Zeteo News editor-in-chief Mehdi Hasan put it bluntly : “Nothing Hunter Biden did comes even close to this level of open corruption.” Read more: UK wants more crypto user data just as trust in KYC takes new hit",News|Donald Trump|Justin Sun|Tron,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-24 15:29:44

If signed into law, Texas would be the first US state to officially consider Bitcoin as a treasury asset, signaling the start of a new era of institutional adoption and potentially rewriting the rules for state-level fiscal policy. A New Frontier for State Treasuries The bipartisan bill, which is sponsored by lawmakers, seeks to make Texas's financial reserves more diversified with the investment of state funds in Bitcoin. According to the proponents, through such a move, the state would be hedging against inflation, providing non-correlated returns, and position itself as a leader of digital asset innovation. The Texas BTC bill has received huge publicity because it is prescriptive in nature, with proponents pointing out Texas's dominant energy sector and pro-crypto regulatory environment as ideal for such an ambitious initiative. ”Texas is leading the way in financial innovation,” said State Rep. Cody Harris, author of HB 4903. A Bitcoin reserve will help secure our future while sending a clear message: Texas welcomes the next generation of money. Why Bitcoin — and Why Now? As concerns about inflation continue and fiat assets remain vulnerable to volatility, the decentralized and fixed nature of Bitcoin offers a compelling choice for state governments. Texas, already having a strong sector of Bitcoin mining, is well-positioned to leverage its energy excess and pro-Bitcoin policymaking to attract greater investment and talent. Crypto commentator Caitlin Long tweeted on X (formerly Twitter): Texas is about to make history. If HB 4903 passes, expect other states to follow. This could be the domino that brings Bitcoin to the heart of US public finance. How Would the Reserve Work? In HB 4903, Texas Comptroller can purchase, hold, and invest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. The bill includes strict guidelines for custody, transparency requirements, and regular audits for security and public trust. Regular rebalancing would be carried out with potential reinvestment of profits to public projects or to balance budget deficits. The transition is not without risk. Analysts warn of price volatility and federal regulatory risk of Bitcoin. Yet supporters are confident that Texas's pioneering could give it an advantage as a first mover if digital currencies become a routine part of public finance. Institutional Adoption: Ripple Effects Beyond Texas The Texas BTC bill has broad implications that extend far beyond the state. Institutional crypto adoption by one of America's top states would accelerate development of approved investment vehicles, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, and encourage other states to follow suit. It also sends a powerful signal to Washington and Wall Street that digital assets are being drawn from the fringes of finance into its core. In a recent string, fintech commentator Nic Carter wrote: Texas isn't stacking sats for itself — it's stacking the deck for adoption nationwide. This is the kind of leadership that gets markets moving. A Roadmap for Others? With the bill on its way to the Texas Senate, everyone in Austin is waiting with bated breath. When HB 4903 becomes law, it can serve as a template for other states and even countries trying to diversify their reserves and join the digital economy. The Lone Star State's action now could become a model for institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and Bitcoin mainstreaming into the apparatus of government finance in the near future. Whether Texas's Bitcoin holding is a masterstroke or a moonshot remains to be seen. But this is one thing that is for sure: the state is throwing down the gauntlet as a pioneer on the frontier of digital cash, and the world is watching.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-24 15:48:38

He announced his decision on X, saying he had thought over the issue and decided it was time to go. Bjelic will leave the board of Polygon Foundation and wind down his involvement with Polygon Labs. Sandeep Nailwal will be the only remaining co-founder to work on the project. Polygon was originally called Matic and was founded by four developers, including Mihailo Bjelic, Sandeep Nailwal, Jaynti Kanani, and Anurag Arjun. Bjelic had a keen eye for blockchain Research and Development (R&D), contributing many technical whitepapers for the community. Nailwal acknowledged Bjelic’s contributions and wished him well for the future. Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, offered a warm farewell to his colleague Bjelic. Nailwal mentioned that Bjelic made a valuable contribution to the project. “More than a co-founder, you’re a brother” , said Nailwal on X. He went on to say that Bjelic had a lasting influence on the blockchain, commenting that most of the features on Polygon were influenced by Bjelic. Nailwal also pointed out that Bjelic had a firm conviction and was essential to starting the project. Nailwal said that they would always cheer for Bjelic, whatever he did. Nailwal ended his farewell comment with “brother from another mother, ” highlighting his bond with Bjelic. Bjelic co-founded Polygon in 2017, known then as the Matic Network. It was a layer 2 project built over the Ethereum network. As with many projects built over the Ethereum network, the focus was improving transaction times and lowering fees. The Polygon team was focused on improving the usability of the blockchain for customers. They built their project using the powerful features provided by the Ethereum network. They aimed to create a blockchain that could scale easily. Polygon has contributed to blockchain research and development, providing new areas of study for zero-knowledge proofs and proof of stake. Even today, Polygon is still developing its blockchain and adding new features. However, Bjelic does not want to be part of this project anymore and feels that his goals have diverged from the project’s goals. Polygon Labs has seen three high-profile departures within the last two years, including Bjelic, Jaynti Kanani, and Anurag Arjun. Marc Zella, founder of Aave Chan, said Bjelic’s departure was a “big L for Polygon.” Arjun left Polygon to build the blockchain service Avail, which operates a consensus layer. Meanwhile, Polygon has implemented more Web3 functionality to boost the network and improve customer service. Bjelic discovered crypto in 2013 and went down a self-discovery rabbit hole, learning everything he could about the new technology. When he joined the Polygon project, he was able to use a wealth of knowledge that he had built up during his exploration days. Polygon became one of the top scalability options on the Ethereum blockchain because of its contribution. Bjelic said he worked on technical improvements, such as with zero-knowledge proofs, to fulfill his vision of a truly scalable blockchain. However, for someone with such a strong vision, Bjelic has found that his vision has diverged from the vision of Polygon. He attributes this development to a natural occurrence where projects and people evolve, diverging from their starting point. Due to his changing path, Bjelic believes he can no longer contribute to Polygon to the best of his abilities. Bjelic, however, still believes in cryptocurrency and will most likely be involved in future blockchain projects.",Cryptocurrency|News|MATIC|Polygon,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MATIC|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 15:49:32

While BTC stole the spotlight this week, surging to a new all-time-high of $111,340, DOGE maintained a more measured pace, consolidating within a rising channel that has defined its structure over the past several months. Despite the broader market euphoria, Dogecoin posted modest gains of around 32.45% over the past month and just over 4% this week, signaling cautious optimism among traders. Sentiment remains mixed but leaning bullish, as technical patterns hint at a potential breakout if momentum sustains. On Friday crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus shared an analysis suggesting that Dogecoin could climb as high as $0.95, representing a +560% increase from its current price around $0.17. His post highlighted DOGE’s pattern of bull flag formations. “ Dogecoin Explosive Price Projection,” he tweeted Friday. “DOGE has been moving nicely within this uptrend structure, fueled by long-lasting bull flag channels. The first flag yielded a +90% return, the second +215%, and the third +440%. This fourth flag could potentially take the price of DOGE up to $0.95.” While some are skeptical of such lofty targets, Bitcoinsensus is not alone in his bullish outlook. Another analyst, DimaPotts, referenced historical patterns from 2017 and 2020, where Dogecoin experienced 94x and 190x rallies following Bitcoin’s all-time weekly closes. According to the pundit, if Bitcoin’s current breakout holds in 2025, Dogecoin may follow a similar explosive trajectory. However, he warned that price targets as high as $10, implying a $1.48 trillion market cap, remain unlikely in the current $2.66 trillion total crypto market context. Meanwhile, CobraVanguard added to the bullish chorus by pointing to an AB=CD harmonic pattern on Dogecoin’s 3-day chart, projecting a more conservative price target of $0.65. This setup however suggests a potential 347% gain from current prices, provided DOGE maintains its current ascending channel and breaks key resistance levels. Beyond charts and speculation, on-chain data also supports the bullish narrative. Recently, popular analyst Ali Martinez noted a dramatic spike in Dogecoin network activity on May 16. Daily active addresses, transaction volumes, and whale participation have surged significantly, metrics often viewed as precursors to major price movements. Most notably, whale activity has exploded , with over 1 billion DOGE purchased by large holders in the past month, and 127,570 active addresses now on the network, a sharp rise from February’s low of 66 whale transactions and under 60,000 addresses. That said, with technical indicators, historical cycles, and on-chain activity aligning, analysts believe Dogecoin could be poised for a major breakout. However, much still depends on Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its gains and broader altcoin market sentiment. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.2266 reflecting a 7.60% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 15:52:23

Notably, XRP had been following a steady upward trend within an ascending channel. However, the price encountered strong resistance near $2.50, aligned with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, which triggered a sharp rejection and subsequent sell-off, as observed by analyst Rocksorgate . In a May 24 TradingView post , the analyst suggested that XRP’s recent drop was likely a coordinated move to break below the 200-period exponential moving average ( EMA ), a vital dynamic support that typically signals trend direction. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Currently, XRP is hovering near the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.35, a critical support area. If this level holds, it may lead to price stabilization. However, if it fails, the next support lies at the 0.618 ($2.29) and 0.786 ($2.20) Fibonacci levels, which could come into play. The analyst observed that the $2.42 to $2.45 zone remains a key resistance. Reclaiming this area could signal a return to bullish momentum and possibly a re-entry into the ascending channel. XRP’s upside target Further up, broader resistance is seen at the $2.99 and $3 range. Should XRP rebound convincingly, this zone may be retested. On the flip side, failure to hold above current support could pave the way for a drop toward $2.10. For now, XRP’s outlook hinges on whether it can reclaim the 200 EMA and maintain key Fibonacci support levels or continue slipping into a lower price range. Meanwhile, an outlook from pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Crypto Yoddha suggested XRP may be gearing up for a significant move. According to the expert, XRP is forming a bullish pennant pattern following a strong breakout earlier this year. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView To that end, after a prolonged accumulation phase stretching from 2021 to late 2024, XRP surged past $2 in early 2025, an event marked as “Round 1.” Now consolidating within a tightening range, the current setup hints that “Round 2” may be imminent. The bull pennant formation points to a potential breakout, with the analyst targeting the $5 to $10 range based on historical resistance and technical projections. XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.35, down approximately 0.85% over the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the asset has posted modest gains of 0.4%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, XRP is showing moderate strength, holding above both its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2.24 and its 200-day SMA at $1.91. This suggests a generally bullish medium- to long-term trend. However, short-term indicators paint a more cautious picture. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 48.85, placing XRP in neutral territory, not overbought nor oversold.

Maple ( SYRUP ) price soared to a high of $0.42 on Saturday, its highest level since November last year. It is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies this year after soaring by 405% from its March lows. SYRUP price has jumped as third-party data shows that the total funds locked in its ecosystem rose to a record high of over $1.39 billion . This is a strong performance since it started the year with $290 million in assets. It had a TVL of $16.5 million in the same period last year. You might also like: SYRUP price double-tops as Maple makes major network changes This growth has pushed Maple’s monthly fees to $2.55 million, up from $556,000 in April this year. Maple earns fees by providing financing to institutions. It gets its funds from investors who allocate cash to its High-Yield, Blue-Chip, and bitcoin-yield products. Further data shows that the staking market capitalization of SYRUP has jumped to a record high of $194 million, up from less than $500,000 in January. This growth is due to both the rising SYRUP price and increased inflows. The staking market cap has jumped to 75.5k in ETH terms.

This surge accelerated after Binance and Bitget listed it earlier this month. SYRUP has recently surged above the key resistance level at $0.1920, the highest swing on March 8. It has also moved above all moving averages, while oscillators show it is overbought. Therefore, while more gains are possible, the price is likely to retreat soon as some investors start taking profits. Such a retreat would bring it to $0.25 before resuming its uptrend.

Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale offers tokens at a price of $0.03 per token. Acquisition by more than 11,000 presale buyers has produced a robust investor backing that has raised $9.1 million. Buyers of Mutuum Finance Phase tokens during this phase get 100% profit at the projected $0.06 launch price. While Solana (SOL) continues to battle network congestion and centralization concerns, Mutuum’s sleek architecture and under-the-radar status make it one of the best cryptos to buy now before it explodes. Analysts are already eyeing a 100x surge, with realistic targets placing MUTM at $3 by 2025. For anyone asking what crypto to invest in today or looking for the best cheap cryptocurrency with real upside, Mutuum Finance may be your golden ticket. Mutuum Finance Presale The project has surpassed a significant milestone as its presale accumulates more than $9.1 million from participants who have exceeded 11,000 in number. Since presale initiation the MUTM token value has increased to $0.03 and will steadily grow up to launch at $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Lending System Mutuum Finance introduces a double-lending protocol to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all the requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system regulates automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which simplifies capital efficiency. Users can establish direct loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P model because this system represents a superior way of managing assets. Users benefit from increased security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings on exchanges will improve user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts by certik, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance returns to its users by distributing $100,000 in MUTM tokens in a ten-winner giveaway where each winner gets $10,000 in tokens. Its referral program powers organizational growth through bonus incentives that users get as they attract new investors into the organization. Mutuum Finance has already secured over $9.1 million from more than 11,000 presale investors, which indicates strong market confidence at its current token price of $0.03. Valued at around $0.06 when it first came out and with analysts predicting that it could potentially reach $3 by the year 2025, the potential for huge profits becomes apparent. The potential of this pioneering platform to double-lend, the complete security scanning, and the synchronized expansion plans put MUTM at the top of the altcoin market.

Wall Street Ponke focuses on security and education, while Solaxy simplifies blockchain development on Solana. Their innovative features and early success suggest both offer 100x return potential to strategic investors. Wall Street Ponke: A Meme Coin With Real Utility Wall Street Ponke is building a unique ecosystem that combines meme culture with practical crypto solutions. In its first presale days, it raised over $317,000, generating early momentum and investor trust. Unlike celebrity hype coins, it focuses on the core of blockchain basics. The AI-powered token scanner is a necessary final layer in protecting against fraud and risky tokens, and prevents users from investing their money in garbage tokens. This security tool runs in real time and will be attractive to cautious investors who see the benefit of a transparent smart contract. What makes WPONKE distinct is that it’s one of the few meme coins with real safeguards. Welcome to Wall Street Ponke . WITH THE $WPONKE TRADING PLATFORM YOU’RE NOT JUST TRADING, YOU’RE TRADING SMARTER SAFER AND WITH PEACE OF MIND #WPONKE $WPONKE 🔗: https://t.co/lQk6PYik7O pic.twitter.com/30dUCoIcsU — Wall Street Ponke (@Wallstreetponke) May 14, 2025 Plus, the platform is adding a gamified learning hub that teaches users about topics related to crypto, such as DeFi, staking, and introductory-level blockchain. Based on the educational model, trades are made, and loyalty to the platform and greater engagement of users are encouraged. It’s not speculation, and it creates lasting community value. 1232% APY: Staking That Rewards Loyalty With an eye-popping 1232% APY, the staking program aims to keep user holdings rather than being sold immediately after the Stenals launch. This decreases the complexity, i.e., the volatility observed post a meme coin launch, and promotes price stability. This high-yield staking results in token value correlated with community involvement and long-term growth. Wall Street Ponke ‘s official website supports ETH, USDT, and BNB purchases through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. After buying the tokens, investors can lock them immediately to begin earning rewards. After launch, new platform updates are scheduled to be added for further utility. Solaxy: A Developer-First Layer on Solana Solaxy integrates development tools directly into the Solana blockchain while enhancing accessibility through the Igniter Protocol. Igniter is the no-code launchpad that lets anyone without a technical background create a token and deploy it. The entry barrier is dropped, and the user base increases. For example, the real user demand of Igniter created such a demand that the platform raised over $1 million shortly after Igniter’s release. Solaxy addresses the growing need for simplified, accessible token creation in a fast-moving blockchain environment. Only recently has it changed its strategy to reflect democratized blockchain access, where more users can build and innovate. While critics question the need for a Layer 2 on Solana, early traction justifies Solaxy’s unique role. If the project plays out as we believe it will, sceptics will be surprised, and early believers will be rewarded.

Says Ryan Israel, Pershing Square’s chief investment officer, in an investor conference call, “We felt that the company would be able to work through any slowdown in the cloud computing division Amazon Web Services and we did not judge that tariffs would have a material impact on the earnings in the retail business.” Ackman and his team say Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy has the business acumen to put the retail giant in a position to witness “more profit margin expansion at a high rate of revenue growth.” Pershing Square also gobbled up shares in car rental company Hertz (HTZ.O) and transport giant Uber (UBER.N). AMZN stock closed Friday’s trading session at $200.99, down more than 1% on the day.

One such rising star is Mantix, which is catching attention for its strong fundamentals and bold innovation. Mantix ($MTX) is a next-gen decentralised trading platform that incentivises crypto users with the lowest fees in the market. With over $600K raised in its presale, which is currently priced at $0.02 in stage 1, Mantix has been recognised as one of the top altcoins to watch during this crypto bull run . Litecoin in 2025: Resilience, Renewed Momentum, and the Road to ETF Approval Litecoin (LTC) is on the path to a stable growth trajectory . With a robust market cap, Litecoin remains a top choice for peer-to-peer payments. Litecoin has witnessed significant merchant adoption , with over 4,000 businesses now accepting Litecoin globally. Litecoin also surged amid the anticipation of a spot Litecoin ETF. Investor sentiment remains strong due to Litecoin’s similarities with Bitcoin, as charts suggest that Litecoin could rally, making it one of the top altcoins to watch in Q3 2025. Cardano Whales Accumulate 80 Million ADA Despite Recent Dip Although Cardano (ADA) recently dipped , whales scooped up 80 million tokens. Analysts now predict that Cardano could rally, with crypto bull run targets set at $1. If Cardano sees another correction, prices could hover around $0.684. Meanwhile, Cardano’s ecosystem continues to grow, as shown by smart contract activity in the Cardano ecosystem. However, Cardano founder faces accusations of Cardano token misappropriation , which might cause a decline. Solana Faces $200 Resistance Despite ETF Inflows and Network Growth Solana (SOL) dipped recently. Consequently, Solana is now trading around $168 . Solana’s decline mirrors broader crypto bull run trends, with tariffs contributing to Solana’s volatility. However, Solana investors remain optimistic as the odds for spot Solana ETF approval by the SEC have increased. The leveraged 2X Solana ETF has seen consistent monthly inflows , while active accounts on the Solana ecosystem now exceed 101 million, hinting that Solana’s price could rebound if Solana ETF momentum and investor confidence are in place. Mantix Revolutionises Decentralised Trading with Unmatched Leverage, Utility and Rewards Mantix ($MTX) is redefining the decentralised trading landscape with deep liquidity, ultra-low fees, and unmatched leverage up to 1000x.

Pundit Predicts $20 Surge,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-shock-incoming-pundit-predicts-20-surge/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with renewed excitement as FinanceBro, a well-known crypto influencer, issued a bold prediction that XRP is on the verge of a massive supply shock that could catapult its price past $20 within days. In a recent video clip shared on X, FinanceBro pointed to key macro events — particularly the anticipated passage of the U.S. stablecoin bill — as the catalyst for this dramatic surge. XRP SUPPLY SHOCK COMING IN DAYS AND WILL PUSH #XRP PAST $20 IN DAYS ACCORDING TO CRYPTO INFLUENCER pic.twitter.com/jNNV4vXJGh — FinanceBro (@FinanceBroYT) May 24, 2025 Why the Stablecoin Bill Matters for XRP According to FinanceBro, the upcoming stablecoin legislation is not merely a regulatory footnote but a game-changer poised to reshape the entire digital asset landscape. He emphasized that major financial institutions like Citi, Fargo, JPMorgan, and Bank of America are not expending resources and attention on the stablecoin space without concrete signals that the legislation will pass. These institutions, often cautious and strategic in their moves, are positioning themselves ahead of what FinanceBro calls “the biggest shift in the stablecoin game.” The stablecoin bill, which has been making its way through U.S. legislative channels for months, is designed to provide legal clarity, regulatory frameworks, and compliance guidelines for issuing and managing stablecoins. If passed, it is widely believed it will unleash institutional demand and pave the way for blockchain-based payments, cross-border settlements, and liquidity corridors — areas where XRP’s native efficiency shines. XRP’s Unique Position in the Coming Liquidity Wave What sets XRP apart from other cryptocurrencies is its inherent design as a bridge asset for cross-border payments. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has spent years cultivating partnerships with banks, payment processors, and central banks to leverage XRP’s near-instant settlement capabilities. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which often face scalability bottlenecks, XRP boasts low transaction fees and high throughput, making it an ideal candidate for liquidity movements once institutional capital enters the ecosystem. FinanceBro argues that this upcoming wave of regulatory clarity will ignite institutional flows into XRP, effectively draining available liquidity on exchanges — a classic setup for a supply shock. With a capped circulating supply and significant portions of XRP locked in escrow (managed by Ripple), even a modest uptick in institutional demand could trigger disproportionate price movements. Why $20 Isn’t as Far-Fetched as It Sounds Skeptics may question the notion of XRP leaping from its current price to over $20 within days, but FinanceBro’s reasoning aligns with fundamental supply-and-demand mechanics. When a high-demand asset has a constrained circulating supply, price discovery can become volatile and exponential. Historical crypto market patterns — notably Bitcoin’s surge in late 2020 following institutional adoption — serve as precedents for how quickly prices can react when institutional money moves in. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, the geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop adds further weight. As the U.S. inches closer to regulatory clarity, global institutions are scrambling to secure early-mover advantages in blockchain infrastructure. Ripple’s recent legal victories against the SEC, including Judge Torres’ pivotal 2023 ruling that XRP sales on secondary markets are not securities, have removed one of the biggest overhangs on XRP’s price. With regulatory barriers falling, FinanceBro argues the conditions are set for an explosive breakout. The Countdown to XRP’s Next Major Chapter While crypto markets are notoriously unpredictable, the narrative surrounding XRP has shifted dramatically over the past year. From a token beset by regulatory uncertainty, XRP has transformed into one of the most strategically positioned assets for the institutionalization of blockchain payments. FinanceBro’s prediction that a supply shock will push XRP beyond $20 hinges not on mere speculation but on observed market signals — institutional positioning, regulatory progress, and liquidity setups. Investors, traders, and enthusiasts should keep a close eye on the unfolding legislative developments in Washington, as the passing of the stablecoin bill could act as the final green light for institutional capital to flood into the XRP ecosystem. Whether or not XRP reaches the ambitious $20 target in mere days, one thing is clear: the coming period may mark one of the most pivotal moments in XRP’s history. As FinanceBro put it, “They understand what’s about to happen in the stablecoin game.” And if he’s right, the XRP community is on the brink of witnessing an unprecedented chapter in its journey.

AAVE ( AAVE ), the biggest player in decentralized finance, continued doing well this week as the total assets in its network jumped to a record high. According to its website , the total market size on Ethereum has soared to $33.5 billion, with those borrowed being $13 billion. The funds available to borrow have jumped to $20.45 billion. AAVE has also been growing in other chains, like Base, Sonic, and Arbitrum. Its total market size on the recently launched Sonic has jumped to $383 million, while on Base hit $882 million this week.

AAVE price technical analysis AAVE price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that AAVE price has soared in the past few weeks. This rebound happened after it formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. It has now moved above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level, while the Average Directional Index has moved to 40. An ADX figure of over 25 indicates that the trend is strengthening. AAVE has formed a golden cross as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for AAVE is bullish, with the next point to watch being the last November high of $400.

The businessman’s insights come amid the latest launch of the first XRP futures ETF on Nasdaq and ongoing regulatory delays from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Friday in Ripple’s “Crypto in One Minute ” series, Garlinghouse emphasized two key reasons behind the growing excitement around crypto ETFs. First, ETFs finally provide institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, and mutual funds with a streamlined, regulated way to gain cryptocurrency exposure. Previously, their options were limited to self-custody or trading on centralized exchanges, both of which have drawbacks and regulatory complexities. “For the longest time, institutional investors really haven’t been able to access crypto directly,” he said . “This is an unlock for capital that couldn’t come in before.” He further noted that ETFs allow institutional players to trade crypto assets through familiar Wall Street mechanisms, effectively bridging the traditional financial world and the emerging crypto ecosystem. This increased accessibility could bring substantial new capital inflows to digital assets. Secondly, the pundit pointed out that ETFs are “institutionalizing” the crypto market. He cited the remarkable success of Bitcoin ETFs, which set records as the fastest ETFs to reach $1 billion and subsequently $10 billion in assets under management. “We’ll eventually close in on the gold ETF ,” he added, underscoring the accelerating mainstream adoption of crypto investment vehicles. Garlinghouse’s remarks coincide with significant developments in the crypto ETF landscape. On May 19, 2025, CME Group launched XRP futures contracts, marking a pivotal moment for XRP’s institutional adoption . On its first day, the launch garnered over $19 million in trading volume, surpassing expectations and highlighting strong institutional demand. Following this, on Thursday, May 22, Volatility Shares launched the first-ever XRP futures ETF in the United States, which is now listed on Nasdaq under the ticker XRPI. This ETF primarily invests in XRP-linked futures contracts, providing institutional investors with an additional regulated pathway to access Ripple’s native token. Analysts have pointed to strong demand potential, citing similar successes in the crypto ETF space. However, regulatory hurdles remain. The SEC has delayed decisions on several other ETF applications, including Bitwise’s and CoinShares’ XRP ETFs, a Litecoin ETF, and Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF proposal. These delays reflect the agency’s historically cautious stance toward approving crypto investment products. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart speculated this week that approvals could start rolling out as soon as late June or July if the SEC decides to ease its deferrals.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 16:15:54

Investors are buzzing with anticipation as these altcoins show resilience amid recent corrections. Ethereum is holding strong with bullish signals, while XRP breaks key resistance, hinting at upward momentum. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention with its phase 5 presale, raising $9,200,000 and selling over 505 million tokens to 11,500 holders. This DeFi project’s lending model is driving demand, positioning it as a top crypto to buy now. Let’s explore why these cryptocurrencies are primed for growth. Ethereum’s Resilient Climb Ethereum is navigating a correction but remains a standout in the crypto market. Analysts are eyeing a $4,000 target, fueled by strong performance across multiple timeframes. Despite a recent dip, ETH has delivered 57.2% returns over the past month. Large holders are accumulating between $2,400 and $2,600, signaling confidence in its trajectory. Technical indicators, like the Ichimoku Kijun line, confirm an intact uptrend. However, some whales are exiting positions, with one selling 7,000 ETH at a loss. This mixed behavior underscores opportunity. Investors are watching crypto charts closely, as ETH’s next move could redefine its role among top cryptocurrencies. Market activity is heating up for Ethereum. Trading volumes are climbing, reflecting growing interest. The crypto fear and greed index suggests cautious optimism, with prices holding above key support levels. Analysts view the $2,400 zone as a prime accumulation area before a potential rally. Ethereum’s fundamentals remain robust, supported by its Trillion Dollar Security initiative. This altcoin’s ability to weather corrections makes it a top crypto to invest in. As crypto prices stabilize, ETH’s technical strength signals it’s one of the best cryptos to buy now for long-term gains. XRP’s Breakout Momentum XRP is showing promise after breaking a falling wedge pattern. Currently trading at $2.35, it’s up 0.25% in 24 hours, with trading volume surging 31.95% to $3.77 billion. This spike highlights XRP’s growing appeal among altcoins. Technical analysis points to targets of $2.95, $3.39, and $3.87, with consolidation above $2.30 fueling optimism. Despite a 7.69% weekly drop, XRP’s 26% jump from the $1.85-$1.90 range signals strength. Crypto predictions for 2025 vary, with some forecasting a rise to $5.16, making it a crypto to buy now. The breakout is validated by volume indicators, with XRP trading above the 100-hourly moving average. The hourly MACD and RSI confirm bullish momentum, though resistance looms at $2.45. A break above this could spark the next leg up. Investors are monitoring crypto prices today, as XRP’s consolidation suggests potential for explosive growth. While some predict a conservative $2.10 by 2025, the bullish setup favors XRP as a top cryptocurrency. Its ability to sustain support above $2.20 positions it as a strong contender among crypto coins. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the DeFi space with its lending model. Phase 5 of its presale is underway, with tokens priced at $0.03, a 200% increase from the opening phase’s $0.01. Investors purchasing now are guaranteed a 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, offering a potential 8,233% return. The project has raised $9,200,000, with over 505 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders. This demand underscores MUTM’s appeal as a new cryptocurrency with real utility. MUTM’s Lending Mechanics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enables users to lend and borrow in a decentralized ecosystem. Lenders deposit assets into liquidity pools, earning interest based on pool utilization. Borrowers lock collateral, like $7,000 in ETH for a $5,000 USDT loan, ensuring stability. The platform’s mtTokens, such as mtETH or mtDAI, accrue interest over time, offering passive income. These tokens are transferable across DeFi platforms, boosting flexibility. A peer-to-peer lending feature allows direct loan negotiations, supporting assets like meme coins. This utility makes MUTM a top crypto to invest in for diversified portfolios. Buy Pressure and Rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is enhancing investor confidence with a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Platform revenue buys back MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers, creating constant demand. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with results to be announced on socials. A new dashboard features a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing loyalty. Phase 6 will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, urging investors to act now. This altcoin’s structured tokenomics position it as the best crypto to buy for exponential growth. Riding the Volume Surge Marketwide volume spikes are highlighting Ethereum, XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as top cryptocurrencies to watch. Ethereum’s technical strength and whale accumulation signal a $4,000 target. XRP’s breakout and volume surge point to $3.87 potential. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its DeFi utility and presale success. Its guaranteed 100% ROI at launch, with predictions of a $2.50 post-launch price, makes it a compelling crypto investment. Investors are eyeing crypto prices today, asking what crypto to buy now. MUTM’s lending model and buy pressure make it a prime choice.

These tokens will be airdropped to the blockchain’s active users in the coming weeks. The decision to leverage Solana underscores the blockchain’s Stellar reputation amongst its counterparts. WalletConnect Token Started From Optimism’s OP Mainnet The launch on Solana marks the third chain WalletConnect has been utilizing since Optimism’s OP Mainnet and Ethereum. It is worth noting that the WCT token first went live on Optimism’s OP Mainnet before heading to Ethereum about a month ago. The current Solana expansion is leveraging Wormhole’s native token transfers (NTT) framework. This will explicitly allow WCT to move natively and not as a wrapped token across the OP Mainnet, Ethereum, and Solana. WalletConnect Continues to Airdrop From its 185 Million WCT Bag Notably, the 5 million WCT airdrop, designed to support the launch, will go to only active Solana users. The distribution exercise will involve partners like Phantom, Jupiter, Backpack, and Solflare. According to WalletConnect founder and director Pedro Gomes, the tokens are a scoop from the 185 million WCT that the foundation earmarked for airdrops last September. The total token airdrop is an initiative to reward the platform’s loyal user base and incentivize future network participation. A user’s engagement with the WalletConnect network is a crucial determinant of the volume of their airdrop. This is the second major WCT airdrop from the ecosystem so far. The first season was in November 2024, and members of the WalletConnect community received 50 million tokens then. Moving From Solana to Ethereum and Vice Versa It is not new that projects seek expansion across blockchains, although most do so because they are dissatisfied. In recent times, crypto experts have been discussing the possibility for Solana to outpace Ethereum . Their comparison is usually based on speed, innovation, and market momentum. While Ethereum still powers the backbone of smart contracts, Solana’s edge in performance has analysts buzzing. The Solana blockchain prides itself on offering ultra-fast transactions at an inexpensive rate, which has attracted several projects to the network. Its performance has consistently put it on the lips of developers attempting to build their projects.

What It Could Mean for Solana’s (SOL) ATH Potential,https://bitzo.com/2025/05/can-rising-eth-open-interest-lead-to-a-50-price-pump-what-it-could-mean-for-solanas-sol-ath-potential,"Ether 's climbing open interest signals potential for a big price surge. This development has stirred excitement among investors, who are eager to see if ETH can lead the market to new highs. The focus is also shifting to Solana , with speculation on how these movements might influence its price trajectory. Explore which tokens might be gearing up for significant growth. Ethereum Price Analysis: Recent Surge and Six-Month Pullback with Key Levels Ethereum rallied by about 51% over the past month while experiencing a 21.5% decline over the last six months. A modest increase of 4.6% was observed in one week, indicating short-term optimism amid broader volatility. Price movements have been dynamic, showing a strong monthly bounce contrasting with longer-term setbacks. Trading action has been mixed, with rapid gains emerging even as the overall sentiment remains cautious. Current trading sees prices fluctuating between approximately $1469 and $2038. Immediate support is near $1142, with another cushion at $573, while resistance stands at $2281 and again at $2850. Bulls remain active despite weak momentum, suggesting potential buys near support and measured exits at resistance. Solana Price Trends and Key Levels Over the last month, Solana showed strong upward movement with a 20.92% price gain, while over the past six months it experienced a downturn of nearly 29.28%. Price activity has been volatile, with significant positive movement in the short term counterbalanced by longer downturns. Historical data suggests periods of rapid recovery followed by marked corrections, emphasizing a fluctuating pattern in the coin’s performance. Current trading shows Solana in a range between $109.63 and $171.27. Immediate resistance stands at $194.93, with a secondary level at $256.57, while support appears at $71.65 and then at $10.01. Indicators like a 64.57 RSI combined with a slight negative momentum hint at cautious bullish control. Trades within these levels may favor buyers if prices hold above support and clear resistance is eventually breached. Conclusion ETH 's rising open interest could boost its price significantly. This increase may also affect SOL 's potential to reach new highs. If ETH pushes ahead, it might draw more attention to the broader crypto market. SOL could benefit from this surge. Both coins could see positive effects, bolstering their appeal. Investors might find renewed interest, sparking further gains. Watching their performance could provide insights into future trends.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-and-xrp-to-soon-take-over-from-swift-heres-the-latest/,"The geopolitical and financial landscapes are shifting once again, and the cryptocurrency world is paying close attention. According to crypto analyst and influencer Amelie , the European Union is considering a new sanctions package that could see 20 Russian banks removed from the SWIFT global payment system. This development raises a critical question that has long simmered beneath the surface of financial innovation: Could Ripple and its digital asset XRP finally seize the moment to step in as a next-generation cross-border payment solution? BREAKING: EU CONSIDERS REMOVING 20 BANKS FROM SWIFT GLOBAL PAYMENT SYSTEM IN NEW SANCTIONS PACKAGE TO ESCALATE PRESSURE ON RUSSIA! COULD THIS BE THE MOMENT NEEDED FOR #XRP TO BE USED? https://t.co/XxKaLc7qsa pic.twitter.com/e7LZaX7XQq — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 24, 2025 Why SWIFT’s Role in Global Finance Is Being Challenged For decades, the SWIFT system has been the backbone of international money transfers, connecting over 11,000 financial institutions across more than 200 countries. However, SWIFT’s reliance on correspondent banking relationships, slow settlement times, and vulnerability to geopolitical weaponization — as evidenced by past sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and now Russia — has increasingly exposed its limitations. When major economies or blocs like the EU begin contemplating large-scale disconnections, it not only strains the targeted countries but also creates friction and inefficiencies across the broader global financial system. Amelie’s post brings this issue back into the spotlight. If the EU proceeds with cutting off 20 Russian banks from SWIFT, it would escalate the financial isolation of Russia, but it would also drive the search for alternative systems that are faster, more neutral, and less politically entangled. This is where Ripple and XRP come into the conversation. Ripple and XRP: A Ready-Made Alternative? Ripple has positioned itself for years as a blockchain-based solution designed to modernize cross-border payments. Using XRP as a bridge currency, Ripple’s payment protocols allow financial institutions to move money across borders in seconds , compared to the days it can take under the traditional SWIFT network. Unlike SWIFT, which merely sends messages between banks to coordinate payments, Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service facilitates the instant movement of value, eliminating the need for pre-funded nostro and vostro accounts. With Russia facing intensified sanctions and cut-offs from the legacy financial system, Ripple and XRP theoretically offer an alternative route for institutions and economies looking to maintain liquidity and settlement efficiency without violating international laws. That said, it’s crucial to recognize that Ripple, as a U.S.-based company, operates under strict compliance frameworks and is unlikely to serve sanctioned entities. However, the bigger picture is that global demand for resilient, decentralized, and politically agnostic payment rails is growing, and Ripple is perfectly positioned to meet that demand for compliant institutions. The Timing Couldn’t Be More Critical The current moment is particularly opportune for Ripple and XRP because of several converging factors. First, Ripple’s long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has seen major development recently with a settlement agreement filed by the SEC. This regulatory clarity has reignited institutional interest in leveraging Ripple’s technologies. Second, central banks and major financial institutions worldwide are exploring or launching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which require interoperable and scalable settlement layers. Ripple has already engaged in numerous pilot projects and partnerships aimed at integrating CBDCs into its network, making it a serious contender for future global payment infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Third, the rising instability and fragmentation in global finance, driven by sanctions, trade wars, and shifting alliances, create a natural demand for alternatives to SWIFT. Whether it’s for emerging economies, sanctioned regions, or even compliant multinational corporations seeking efficiency, Ripple offers a solution that blends the speed of crypto with the oversight of enterprise-grade compliance. Could Ripple and XRP Take Over? While some XRP enthusiasts may be quick to declare a total “ takeover” of SWIFT, the reality is more nuanced. SWIFT’s dominance is deeply entrenched, and wholesale replacement would require years of coordinated effort, regulatory buy-in, and institutional trust-building. However, Ripple and XRP do not need to replace SWIFT entirely to be transformative. Even capturing a fraction of cross-border payment flows — especially in emerging markets, remittance corridors, and CBDC interoperability — would mark a massive shift in how global finance operates. Amelie’s post taps into a growing sense among the crypto community that the world is approaching an inflection point. With geopolitical tensions mounting and the old financial order showing its cracks, Ripple’s blockchain-based solutions may no longer be viewed as experimental or peripheral. Instead, they stand ready as the next phase of global payments — faster, cheaper, and less reliant on outdated intermediaries. As the EU weighs its next sanctions move, the broader financial world should pay close attention. The question is no longer if blockchain-based systems like Ripple and XRP will reshape cross-border finance, but when. And if current signals are any indication, that moment may be arriving sooner than most expect. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

45048507,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/dogecoin-forecast-can-doge-reach-1-before-ozak-ai-hits-1,1748104046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/45048507.jpeg,Dogecoin Forecast: Can DOGE Reach $1 Before Ozak AI Hits $1?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/dogecoin-forecast-can-doge-reach-1-before-ozak-ai-hits-1,"Crypto markets are beginning to stir ahead of the anticipated 2025 bull run, with two very different tokens attracting attention: the ever-popular Dogecoin (DOGE) and the innovative presale-stage project Ozak AI (OZ) . Known for its network hype and celebrity endorsements, Dogecoin aims once more at the elusive $1 mark. However, even as Dogecoin experiences a mild rebound, Ozak AI has captured investor interest with its impressive utility-based model and the potential to grow 100 times from its presale price of just $0.003. DogeCoin Expected to Surge to $1 Dogecoin currently trades at around $0.243 and has garnered renewed interest thanks to broader market optimism and its continued social media presence. The token has historically surged during bull markets, largely due to community enthusiasm and support from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. If Bitcoin and Ethereum push to new all-time highs, Dogecoin is likely to follow suit. Technical analysis highlights critical resistance levels near $0.26 to $0.285, reinforced by the daily 200-SMA at $0.27. A break above those zones could put $0.50 in sight, especially if bullish momentum and retail investor FOMO return. However, Dogecoin lacks a fundamental utility or technological roadmap; it remains a meme-based asset, driven more by sentiment than utility. While $0.50 is a realistic stretch target in a strong bull market, it hinges almost entirely on market psychology and influencer-driven hype. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.2450 level and the 100-hour simple moving average. Moreover, a connecting bullish trend line is forming with support at $0.2460 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Ozak AI The project merges artificial intelligence with blockchain, offering predictive insights through its Prediction Agents and decentralized streaming tech (Ozak Stream Network). This positions it in two hottest sectors: AI and decentralized infrastructure. Analysts believe Ozak AI has the potential to hit $1 before 2025 if adoption accelerates and market tailwinds persist. That would represent more than a 300x return for early investors. Moreover, the project focuses on security. The platform utilizes Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) to store financial data securely. By eliminating centralized points of failure, Ozak AI minimizes risks such as data breaches and system downtime, which often plague traditional monetary systems. With a presale entry price of only $0.003, this presents an exciting opportunity for early adopters. Analysts and initial investors believe that once Ozak AI is listed on exchanges, its value could potentially increase 100 times, particularly if it maintains its current growth rate. The 3rd stage of the Ozak AI presale is currently going on, and the project is already making waves in the crypto community. With an impressive $1M raised so far, Ozak AI tokens are currently priced at just $0.003 each, with the next stage price set at $0.005. This early-stage opportunity is poised for significant growth, with projections suggesting that the token could reach $1 by 2025. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that integrates AI and Blockchain on its Platform, which specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI ensures real-time, accurate, and actionable insights that help crypto enthusiasts and businesses make informed decisions.

The current sideways price movement has seen the price of DOGE stall, with price momentum failing after an earlier surge a few weeks ago. Dogecoin’s current price movement suggests it is time to look for a better alternative. Many retail investors are now eying the promising Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project, which is shaping up to be a hidden jewel in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could disrupt the DeFi space Mutuum Finance (MUTM) wants to revolutionize the entire DeFi space with its unique twin lending mechanism. The project incorporates peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) mechanisms, which are designed to hand over control to users and ensure long-term ecosystem growth. Participants in this ecosystem can contribute into lending pools by providing reputable coins like $2000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) in a given pool. In exchange, they will receive annual percentage yields determined by the utilization rate of the pool. In the P2P model, assets with less liquidity like PEPE, borrowers and lenders can negotiate terms directly, which includes duration, interest rates, and partial fills. Since there is no shared liquidity pool in this model, lenders could potentially higher interest rates, while ensuring the overall safety of the protocol. In the P2C models, the lenders pool assets into smart contracts, where they collectively supply liquidity to borrowers who overcollateralized their loans. The rates for assets are dynamically adjusted based on usage, with higher utilization leading to higher rates. This ensures a positive feedback loop that ensures maximum efficiency. When depositors fund this model, they get mtTokens, which is representative of their share in the pool, and accrued interest. These mtTokens can also be used as collateral for new assets. With time, depositors can exchange these mtTokens for their original principal, and the interest gained. How stability is maintained All loans, whether P2P or P2C, are overcollateralized. The stability factor is used to measure how secure the collateral for a loan is. If the collateral drops in value below set thresholds, liquidation happens. The liquidators buy back their outstanding debt at a discount, which stabilizes the system, and prevents bad debt from accruing in the system. Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) multi-asset collateralization stablecoin system In most existing DeFi systems, a decentralized stablecoin is based on single-asset vaults. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) envisions a new system where users can deposit different types of assets into a protocol and mint a stablecoin based on this consolidated pool of assets. The result is that the ecosystem’s stablecoin remains secured by a wide range of tokens. For users, nothing changes; they deposit the collateral, but with greater flexibility when it comes to managing price fluctuations. Another benefit is that users do not have to manage multiple vaults at once, while not having to close separate positions. Reducing the friction that comes with single asset vaults ensure a much stronger hedge against volatility. If one asset goes down in value, that can be potentially cancelled out by another asset experiencing an appreciation in value. In short, using multi-asset collateral ensures that the system is much simpler, and more unified for minting a decentralized stablecoin. Stability of the stablecoin’s price at the designated $1 price point is maintained via arbitrage. In short, this allows market forces to maintain the price of this decentralized stablecoin at or near the $1 mark, with arbitrage traders having multiple opportunities at both the upper and lower price points to make a profit. Since all actions are recorded on the blockchain, it will ensure a more transparent system, helping to build trust and increase the user base. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale attracts massive interest The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has attracted a massive amount of interest, as the crypto world has become aware of the unique value proposition of the project. Since its launch, it has raised over $9,2 million from over 11,000 buyers. Many Dogecoin (DOGE) retail investors, looking for more lucrative opportunities, have intensified their interest in MUTM. Consider Looking Into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Each token is currently on sale at $0.03 per token, which is the phase 5 price. Those who noticed the opportunity earlier bought the tokens at a 200% discount of $0.01 per token. However, there still exists a massive opportunity, with the listing price set at $0.06. If you wish to be part of the future of DeFi, adding MUTM to your portfolio could potentially be a wise move.

This isn’t about guesswork. It’s about clear signals, strong communities, and what’s actually coming next. From a locked-in presale price on a rising network, to post-lawsuit activity on a popular token, and a bullish pattern forming on a major chain, this list breaks down the coins worth looking at today. If you’re deciding on the best crypto coin to buy, these four picks give you different levels of risk and reward, with BlockDAG leading the way on value and upside. 1. Blockdag - Locked Price Until June 13 & 20 Cex Listings Ahead BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about names in crypto presales, raising over $265 million and selling more than 21 billion BDAG coins. What makes it stand out is its current presale price of $0.0020, which is locked until June 13. After that, pricing will return to the standard batch system and start increasing again. With a projected launch price of $0.05, early buyers could see a return of over 2,400%. This setup puts BlockDAG in a strong position as the best crypto coin to buy right now, especially for those looking for major upside before exchange trading begins. The June 13 event will reveal BlockDAG ’s first 20 centralized exchange listings, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank. On the tech side, the beta testnet is already live, the X1 miner app has over 1 million users, and more than 17,600 hardware miners have been sold. BlockDAG also runs on a hybrid DAG + PoW model, allowing for high throughput and energy-efficient consensus. With its tech, user base, and confirmed listings all aligning, BlockDAG isn’t just another presale, it’s a full ecosystem getting ready to go live. That’s why it continues to be seen as the best crypto coin to buy before the market prices in what's coming. 2. XRP - Legal Clarity Secured, Now Eyeing $3.00 Breakout XRP is currently priced at $2.34 after dropping 4.10% in the last 24 hours. Even with short-term price dips, the bigger story is that Ripple has finally closed its long legal battle with the SEC as of May 8. That alone is a major weight lifted off the token. Now the focus is on whether XRP can hold and push past key resistance zones at $2.70 and $3.00. Analysts say that if XRP clears those levels, a run toward $27 by July 2025 is on the table. Despite winning the case, XRP has underperformed over the past three months, sliding 6% while the broader market gained 10%. But with legal uncertainty removed, this lag might actually create an opportunity. Traders looking for strong upside potential with confirmed catalysts are now watching XRP again. If you’re trying to figure out the best crypto coin to buy, XRP sits right on the edge of a possible rally, with fewer risks than it had just a few weeks ago. 3. Polkadot - Rounded Bottom Pattern Forming, Breakout Potential Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $4.59 after a 7.27% drop over the past 24 hours, but its technical chart is one of the more interesting right now. Analysts have pointed out that DOT is forming a rounded bottom,a bullish setup that, if confirmed, could drive a major upside move. Key resistance levels are set around $9.21, $11.10, and $12.73. If DOT breaks above the $5.50 to $6.00 range, a surge could follow quickly. Polkadot’s 2025 price forecasts range from $4.14 on the low end to highs of $13.90, with some long-term models calling for a stretch to $19 if certain momentum levels are hit. That range makes it a solid medium-term hold. As of now, DOT’s dip gives buyers a chance to enter before a potential lift-off. When people ask what the best crypto coin to buy is under $5, Polkadot often ends up near the top of the list because of its technical setup and historical resilience. 4. Near Protocol - Ecosystem Expansion Pushes Forecasts Higher NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is trading at $2.81, down 8.17% in 24 hours. The price has been volatile, but NEAR has held strong above the $2.70 support level. Much of the recent interest comes from the growth of its ecosystem and its role in pushing forward Web3 applications. Analysts believe that NEAR could hit $3.26 by May 29 and reach $5.18 by year-end, offering short- and medium-term growth potential from current levels. The NEAR ecosystem has been growing fast, with developers and apps moving in due to its user-friendly infrastructure. It’s also being picked up in more cross-chain integrations. This activity has translated into real interest in the coin, not just speculation. For anyone scanning for the best crypto coin to buy under $3, NEAR is gaining attention as a play with strong fundamentals, growing usage, and decent upside through 2025. Key Insights Each of these coins brings something real to the table. NEAR is growing fast through Web3 adoption. Polkadot is building toward a technical breakout. XRP finally has legal clarity and is positioned for a possible rally. But BlockDAG stands out with the clearest short-term upside. Its price is locked at $0.0020 until June 13, with 20 exchange listings already confirmed and a projected launch price of $0.05. The ecosystem is live, the user base is growing, and the roadmap is being executed without delay. For anyone looking for the best crypto coin to buy, BlockDAG offers a rare mix of timing, traction, and return potential that makes it hard to overlook at this stage.

The move marked a historic moment for the market, solidifying bullish momentum and pushing BTC into a new price discovery phase. However, the excitement was short-lived. Following comments from US President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose a 50% tariff on European Union imports, global markets turned cautious, causing a broad risk-off sentiment that sent Bitcoin prices lower. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger The sell-off came swiftly, pulling BTC back below local highs as investors reacted to rising geopolitical and economic uncertainty. While this retracement is not unusual after such a strong rally, it underscores the sensitivity of crypto markets to macro headlines. Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical perspective, noting that Bitcoin has now returned to the daily EMA 8. Holding this moving average could signal that bulls remain in control and that this pullback is simply part of a healthy consolidation. Bitcoin Steady As Market Uncertainty Grows Bitcoin continues to show resilience in the face of persistent macroeconomic uncertainty. As US Treasury yields remain elevated and volatility sweeps across global stock markets, BTC has managed to hold strong after recently pushing into new all-time highs. While many risk assets falter under these conditions, Bitcoin is proving its narrative as a macro hedge, attracting interest from institutional and retail investors alike. However, despite its recent breakout to $112,000, the rally has not yet been confirmed as a sustainable bullish phase. Analysts widely agree that a clean break above $115,000 is essential to trigger the next leg of price discovery. Without that confirmation, the current move could be seen as an overextension, especially amid broader market instability. Cheds shared a key technical insight this week, noting that Bitcoin is now back at the daily EMA 8 level—a moving average that has acted as reliable support since the $80K range. This suggests that the current pullback could be a healthy retest of trend support rather than the start of a deeper correction. If BTC manages to bounce from this level, bullish momentum could resume quickly. But if the EMA 8 fails, downside risk may increase, especially if traditional markets continue to slide. For now, all eyes remain on how Bitcoin reacts at this technical crossroads. Related Reading: Ethereum Climbs Back To $2,700 – Bulls Ready For A Breakout? BTC Retests Key Level As Uptrend Pauses Bitcoin is currently retesting key technical levels following its sharp rally to a new all-time high near $112,000. As shown in the 4-hour chart, BTC has pulled back to the 34-period EMA (currently around $107,800), a level that has served as reliable dynamic support during this uptrend. The latest candle action shows buyers stepping in slightly above this area, suggesting it’s still holding. Price is also hovering just above the 50-SMA at $106,273, reinforcing this zone as a confluence of support. Volume has picked up slightly on the pullback, which could indicate healthy profit-taking rather than panic selling if this level holds, a continuation toward the previous high, and potentially a push above $112K remains on the table. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,500 While BTC Leads the Charge – Key Levels To Watch However, if the support fails and BTC dips below $106K, eyes will shift toward the next major horizontal support at $103,600. A drop to this region would still be technically valid within the broader uptrend but could shake short-term bullish momentum.

By the time a project hits major news sites or trends on social media, much of the early momentum is gone. Prices spike fast, then stall, and late entries get trapped chasing hype. The real edge comes from spotting signals that appear before the news cycle kicks in. These early signs often come from unusual wallet activity, subtle volume spikes, or patterns hidden in blockchain data. Investors who rely on headlines usually miss these signals and enter too late. That's why many are starting to watch Dawgz AI —an Ethereum-based meme coin with a built-in AI analysis layer. It’s not just about speculation. Projects that combine on-chain signals with intelligent tracking are beginning to shape how investors find the next crypto to explode. What Really Causes a Crypto to Explode (Without News)? When a cryptocurrency breaks out, it’s rarely because of headlines alone. In most cases, price movements begin days or even weeks before the public becomes aware. The real triggers often come from large wallet movements, early exchange listings, or shifts in liquidity pools—data points that live directly on the blockchain. Platforms like CoinGecko and DeFiLlama track these changes in real time, giving early signs before any news coverage appears. What separates projects that rise from those that stall is activity beneath the surface. A sudden increase in wallet holders or a spike in decentralized exchange volume often signals accumulation. Binance Market Tracker is another tool that lets investors view these patterns as they happen. When a token gains traction across multiple metrics without any announcements, it often points to quiet confidence among early backers. These are the signals that typically mark the next crypto to explode . Relying only on headlines often means arriving too late. Investors who study on-chain activity use signals that don’t rely on external narratives. They watch how tokens move through networks, how users interact with smart contracts, and how liquidity flows shift. These are the data-backed indicators that reveal which project might break out next, long before it makes the front page. The Smart Way Investors Spot the Next Crypto in 2025 Experienced investors depend on behavior patterns rather than headlines. They track wallet distributions using tools like Etherscan to identify accumulation by large holders. If a small group of wallets begins to acquire a token steadily without social media hype, it often signals quiet conviction. These movements are early clues that a coin may gain traction before broader awareness sets in. Another method involves monitoring sudden spikes in decentralized trading volume. CoinMarketCap’s Liquidity Tracker helps identify when volume shifts toward a specific token without new listings or announcements. These movements show that investors are entering positions before any marketing push. In many cases, such volume shifts precede major breakouts by several days. More investors are applying these signals to projects that use artificial intelligence to track real-time patterns. That’s one reason Dawgz AI is drawing attention—it reflects this shift toward data-based decision-making. It’s not about forecasts based on emotion. The next crypto in 2025 may come from communities using measurable trends, not price speculation. Forget the News Cycle — Watch These On-Chain Signals Instead The earliest signs of a breakout often come from changes in wallet activity. When a token starts gaining hundreds of new holders in a short period, it suggests that buyers are entering quietly. Tools like Dune Analytics or Nansen allow investors to see real-time wallet growth and track movements from high-value addresses. This behavior usually signals internal momentum that news stories will miss until it’s too late. Another key signal is abnormal volume flow on decentralized exchanges. A sudden increase in trades on platforms like Uniswap without major announcements often reflects accumulation by insiders or early adopters. These buyers are not reacting to headlines. They’re watching metrics and acting before prices surge. When paired with rising liquidity, these volume shifts become even more important. Presale activity is also worth tracking. Some projects gain early traction by attracting high engagement before launch. When on-chain metrics show strong token holder growth before public trading begins, it often indicates growing demand. Investors who noticed early volume shifts in meme coins like PEPE or FLOKI saw similar signals. Dawgz AI has shown comparable early traction without relying on influencer campaigns or media exposure. Why AI-Powered Crypto Projects Are Drawing Attention in 2025 Artificial intelligence is becoming a core tool for tracking crypto signals. Investors are no longer depending on gut instinct or community chatter. AI models can scan thousands of wallets, contracts, and exchange orders to find patterns that point to future price movements. It is changing how some traders identify opportunities before they go mainstream. Platforms like IntoTheBlock use machine learning to detect sentiment shifts, wallet clustering, and smart money trends. The value of AI in crypto comes from speed and precision. It can process more data in real time than any manual system. Analysts at CoinDesk have noted that AI models are now being used to track capital flows and social signals across multiple chains. When a project applies AI to on-chain data and behavioral trends, it becomes easier to act before price surges. It gives long-term investors tools to filter noise and focus on actionable movement. Projects like Dawgz AI are aligned with this shift. Instead of promising high returns, they focus on using AI to follow what the data shows. It’s not about speculating on hype. The goal is to track indicators that are already moving before the wider market reacts. This focus on signals over sentiment is why many investors believe AI-backed coins may become more common in 2025. Dawgz AI – Built for a Market Where Timing Is Everything Timing in crypto is often the difference between meaningful gains and missed chances. Projects that reward early discovery offer more upside than those that depend on media waves. When a token gains early traction from wallet activity, smart contract engagement, or steady presale demand, it signals more than speculation. It points to utility and planning. That’s why investors are starting to notice projects with verifiable metrics rather than hype cycles. One of those projects is Dawgz AI, a meme coin built on Ethereum with a unique twist—its foundation lies in real-time AI-powered signal analysis. The project has already been audited by SolidProof , signaling a commitment to contract safety and transparency. As of now, Dawgz AI has raised over $3.6 million in its presale at a price of $0.00438 per token. What stands out isn't just its theme but how it connects AI insights to token momentum, something that many meme tokens often lack. Rather than depending on influence or speculative announcements, Dawgz AI focuses on tracking wallet growth, liquidity trends, and user behavior. These are the same signals discussed throughout this article. The value here lies in its alignment with how serious investors now measure potential. The fact that it combines on-chain clarity, AI tracking, and verified security is why it’s becoming a project to watch, especially as more coins enter the market with little to no real structure behind them. For more details, please watch the following video: 3 Signals That Could Reveal the Next Crypto Before It Moves Wallet Clustering by High-Value Holders When a small number of wallets begin buying large amounts of a token, it’s not random. This behavior—called wallet clustering—often signals quiet accumulation by investors with strong conviction. Using tools like Arkham Intelligence or Etherscan , traders can track how concentrated a token supply becomes over time. If the top 50 wallets are increasing their positions without public promotion, it often indicates preparation for a move. Spikes in Real-Time Mentions on Social Platforms Early community activity plays a major role in a token’s success. Projects that start gaining mentions on Telegram, X (formerly Twitter), and Discord without coordinated campaigns usually show organic interest. Tracking tools like LunarCrush allow investors to measure social volume in real time. A rapid increase in mentions can indicate growing trust and curiosity, especially when paired with stable trading volume. Presale Growth Combined with Holder Expansion Many tokens launch with large presale numbers but fail to retain attention. The difference comes when a project sees consistent wallet growth and token distribution during and after the presale. CoinGecko tracks presales and new launches. If a token shows steady wallet growth before listing, it often reflects genuine demand. Dawgz AI, for example, has shown both a strong presale and expanding wallet base, which is why some investors see it as a project to watch before it gains broader attention. How to Research New Projects Without Getting Lost in Hype Before entering any token, investors need to look beyond price charts. One of the first steps is checking smart contract quality. Projects that publish verified contracts and undergo third-party audits show a stronger commitment to safety. Sites like SolidProof and CertiK allow users to review audit status and code transparency. If there’s no audit or contract verification, the risks increase sharply. Next comes token distribution. Investors should avoid projects where one or two wallets hold most of the supply. DexTools and TokenSniffer help review wallet concentration and real-time liquidity status. A fair distribution with locked liquidity often signals more sustainable movement. When token holders increase slowly over time, it shows long-term interest rather than speculation. Finally, community behavior matters. Real engagement comes from public discussions about features, development goals, or use cases. Not giveaways or vague promises. CoinMarketCap Community and project Telegram groups provide a look at how active and informed the holders are. Dawgz AI, for instance, has shown consistent traction in wallet growth and community conversations without depending on hype, which is why many consider it a credible meme coin with long-term potential. The Bigger Picture – Why Predictive Analysis Will Be the Crypto Edge in 2025 Crypto trading in 2025 is moving toward data over emotion. Investors are shifting away from speculation and using predictive signals powered by AI. Tools like IntoTheBlock and Nansen track on-chain data to spot breakout potential early. Wallet trends, volume shifts, and token flows are now central to decision-making. Projects aligned with this shift are gaining more serious attention. Dawgz AI reflects this model by using AI to analyze real-time blockchain behavior. This focus on measurable activity is why data-backed strategies are expected to grow. As markets expand, those using predictive tools may spot breakout tokens before they reach peak attention. It’s not about guessing. It’s about reading what the chain already shows. Final Take: Watch Signals, Not Headlines The tokens that break out first rarely wait for headlines. By the time news spreads, the early momentum has passed. Investors who watch real-time signals—wallet growth, volume shifts, and presale strength—often gain the advantage. Crypto in 2025 will reward those who act on data rather than noise. The projects worth watching are the ones that offer transparency, strong community behavior, and measurable movement. They don’t chase attention. They build momentum through action on-chain. If you're looking for a project that aligns with this approach, Dawgz AI stands out for its AI-based tracking, smart contract clarity, and growing community traction. Explore Dawgz AI for yourself. The next move might already be underway. FAQs Section What is the next crypto to explode in 2025?

The decision was given as “diverging visions.” In the last two years, other co-founders Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun had also left the project. In his announcement on X (formerly Twitter), Bjelic said, “As projects develop and mature, visions can change and even diverge. As a result, I no longer feel I can contribute to Polygon in the best way possible.” However, Bjelic maintained his confidence in the project, saying, “I believe Polygon leadership is committed to making the project a success. I will always support from the sidelines.” Related News: Massive Whales Executed Transactions Worth Millions of Dollars Today: Here Are the Altcoins They Bought and Sold Bjelic is leaving his roles at Polygon Labs, Polygon’s main development studio, and the Polygon Foundation. He co-led the project, which was founded in 2017 as an Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution called Matic Network, with Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun. Polygon has made significant R&D contributions to date in areas such as zero-knowledge proof and proof-of-stake. In late 2024, a token migration was launched as part of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap, where MATIC tokens were swapped 1:1 for POL tokens. This migration aimed to expand the use of the network’s native token in areas such as gas fees, staking, and infrastructure systems (e.g. AggLayer). *This is not investment advice.

Meta Platforms, through its flagship apps Facebook and Instagram, is becoming a “cornerstone of the internet fraud economy,” reports the Wall Street Journal. According to people familiar with the matter, Meta accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle at JPMorgan Chase between the summers of 2023 and 2024 – numbers that are similar across all US banks. Internal Meta documents reportedly reveal a staggering 70% of newly active advertisers on its platforms promote scams, illicit goods or low-quality products. The scammers are often linked to Southeast Asian crime networks that exploit Meta’s oversight, cryptocurrencies and generative AI to flood its platforms with fake ads for puppies, giveaways and bargain goods. Meta allows advertisers up to 32 automated “strikes” for financial fraud before banning accounts, which critics say prioritizes the company’s $160 billion ad revenue stream. Meta’s Marketplace, now larger than Craigslist, has become a scammer’s playground due to its peer-to-peer model. Meta says it’s working with banks and tech companies to combat scams while deploying new tools like facial recognition and user warnings. In court, the company has argued that it has no legal obligation to require advertisers to verify their identities or demonstrate that they’re licensed to sell such products.

According to a post by Good Morning Crypto on X, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently emphasized the sheer scale of the opportunity before Ripple and XRP , noting that trillions of dollars flow across the globe through the SWIFT network, a technology architecture developed 50 years ago. Garlinghouse pointed out that this aging system offers no opportunity to modernize, particularly given the U.S. government’s historically combative stance toward innovation. However, he added that this is beginning to change, citing what he called “the Trump effect” as a profound force for shifting the landscape. JUST IN: MARK YUSKO TALKS “MODERNIZING PAYMENTS” & THE POSSIBILITY OF RIPPLE $XRP REPLACING SWIFT! “EVERYTHING HE (RIPPLE CEO) TALKS ABOUT IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY & THE GOAL, I AM IN VIOLENT AGREEMENT WITH.” — @MarkYusko DO YOU BELIEVE RIPPLE IS REPLACING SWIFT? Comment… pic.twitter.com/Z7k0cqaymv — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) May 24, 2025 In an eye-catching endorsement, legendary investor Mark Yusko weighed in on the discussion of modernizing payments, signaling strong alignment with Ripple’s vision. “Everything he (Ripple CEO) talks about in terms of technology and the goal, I am in violent agreement with,” Yusko declared, reinforcing the growing sentiment that blockchain solutions like Ripple’s could soon challenge SWIFT’s longstanding dominance in cross-border financial transactions. Why Ripple and XRP Are Positioned to Modernize Global Payments SWIFT has been the backbone of international payments for decades, facilitating interbank communications and money transfers across more than 200 countries. Yet despite its global reach, SWIFT’s system is widely criticized for slow settlement times, high costs, and dependency on intermediaries, creating friction that no longer aligns with the needs of a real-time digital economy. Ripple, on the other hand, offers a blockchain-based alternative designed to address these inefficiencies. Using XRP as a bridge asset, Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution enables financial institutions to settle cross-border payments in seconds, eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts and significantly lowering costs. Ripple’s blockchain network delivers speed, transparency, and interoperability — attributes that SWIFT’s legacy architecture cannot easily replicate. Garlinghouse’s statement underscores the vastness of the opportunity: we are talking about trillions of dollars that could be moved more efficiently, securely, and transparently. The fact that this opportunity has been restrained, in part, by regulatory hurdles and government resistance is not lost on key industry observers. But Garlinghouse believes that the dynamic is shifting, particularly in light of evolving political leadership and a global push to embrace innovation. Mark Yusko’s Backing: Why It Matters Mark Yusko is no ordinary voice in the financial world. As the founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, Yusko has long been a respected figure in both traditional finance and digital asset investment circles. His public endorsement of Ripple’s technology and mission — described in his own words as a “violent agreement” — is a powerful signal that institutional investors and asset managers are taking Ripple’s role in the future of payments seriously. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Yusko’s alignment with Ripple’s vision reinforces the idea that the modernization of payments is not just about technological upgrades but about fundamentally transforming how value moves across borders. This isn’t merely a crypto story; it’s a macroeconomic evolution, one where blockchain-based systems could create new standards for efficiency, inclusivity, and cost reduction at a global scale. Can Ripple Replace SWIFT? The million-dollar question is whether Ripple can fully replace SWIFT. While the possibility excites many in the crypto space, the reality is nuanced. SWIFT’s entrenched infrastructure, regulatory entanglements, and massive institutional buy-in make a complete takeover unlikely in the short term. However, Ripple does not necessarily need to replace SWIFT entirely to have a transformative impact. Even capturing a portion of SWIFT’s market share or providing a parallel system for high-friction corridors could generate massive value and reshape industry practices. Good Morning Crypto’s post brings this debate to the forefront: do we believe Ripple is on the verge of replacing SWIFT? The signs suggest that at the very least, Ripple is positioned to become a formidable alternative, especially as political, regulatory, and institutional environments grow more receptive to blockchain-based innovation. Ripple’s recent legal victories over the SEC, particularly the 2023 ruling that clarified XRP’s status on secondary markets, have cleared significant barriers, allowing institutional players to reengage with confidence. The Road Ahead The financial world is watching closely. As political climates shift and institutional champions like Mark Yusko voice their support, Ripple’s potential to reshape the global payments ecosystem is no longer a fringe conversation — it’s a mainstream debate. While the future of SWIFT is far from over, its monopoly over cross-border payments is no longer guaranteed. As Garlinghouse noted, the opportunity is massive. And with industry veterans like Yusko standing in “violent agreement,” Ripple and XRP may soon step beyond the shadow of SWIFT and carve out their historic place in the evolution of global finance.

Token Presale Has Raised $850,000 From Cardano Whales",https://thecoinrise.com/is-this-ai-fund-the-next-crypto-giant-token-presale-has-raised-850000-from-cardano-whales/,"As the Cardano price steadily climbs toward the $1 milestone, savvy investors are looking beyond ADA, and they may have just found their golden ticket: Unilabs. It is an AI-powered asset management platform that’s already managing $30 million in assets under management. With backing from prominent Cardano whales, Unilabs is emerging as a powerful market player. Could this be the breakout star to watch while the Cardano price gains pace? Let’s find out. Unilabs: The AI-Powered Investment Game-Changer As the Cardano price shows signs of bullish reversal, smart investors have found a new project that can potentially lead the market in the coming time. Unilabs is a fully functional AI-backed asset manager with over $30 million in assets under management (AUM) as of Q2 2025. It offers four powerful AI-backed funds, including the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. These funds provide investors the exposure they need to both DeFi and TradFi assets, thus maximizing their earnings potential by not missing out on any opportunity. Unilabs further elevates the game by making the platform more investor-centric through its passive income opportunities. One of the most exciting out of these is their staking feature. It lets investors stake their UNIL holdings to earn revenue and support the platform’s liquidity. It further makes use of its Early Access Scoring System (EASS) feature, and provides investors best-performing tokens across different markets. Through this feature, Unilabs spots the leading upcoming crypto projects by deeply analyzing their utility potential, tokenomics, and team using its proprietary AI-backed technology. Lastly, on Unilabs, users can educate others and earn passively through it. The earning potential is related to the amount of value a user provides. Cardano Price Outlook: Is ADA Set to Break $1? The Cardano price has gained traction in recent weeks, with bulls rebounding key price levels and projected exchange outflows of $932 million by 2025. These outflows follow patterns experienced before ADA’s climb to $3.10 in 2021, which sparked increased investor attention. The leading crypto project is currently trading at $0.74, signaling intraday gains as bulls defend this support zone. Technical analysis shows that for the current trend to continue, the Cardano price must trade above the $0.68-$0.74 area. If Cardano price remains at this level, experts predict a resistance zone at $0.84 as the next goal. Breaking over this level may propel ADA into the psychologically significant $1 milestone, with subsequent gains potentially reaching $1.32. However, if the current support zone is lost, the Cardano price might fall below $0.55. On the technical level, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator has been rising, indicating strong demand for ADA in recent weeks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has challenged the neutral 50 level for support and looks to be moving upward. The 4-hour chart similarly displays a bullish pattern, with ADA breaking over descending trendline resistance. This technical breakthrough, along with the OBV’s upward progress, shows that momentum is now bullish. Unilabs Presale Surge: A Future Giant in the Making? Unilabs , despite being a fresh entry in the market, has taken over the market. The asset management platform has recently started its presale, and the response has been overwhelming. The presale has managed to raise over $850k within two presale rounds. Investors have already hoarded over millions of UNIL tokens, making sure not to miss its low entry price of $0.0051. Leading market experts have forecasted Unilabs to offer a massive ROI to investors, pointing to the past growth trends of solid foundation projects with low-cost entry. Final Thoughts The Cardano price is showing all the signs of a bullish comeback, with whales moving in and technical patterns flashing green. At the same time, Unilabs is rising with lightning speed. From its rapidly growing presale numbers to $30M in AUM and AI-powered tools, the project is offering investors a once in a blue moon investment opportunity. Its current $0.0051 price is all set to surge to $0.0062 in the next round, generating a decent return within the presale.

While Arbitrum also saw hefty inflows, other major chains like Berachain and Solana faced big withdrawals of capital. Analyst Jelle notes the broader TOTAL3 altcoin index is flashing bullish signals, now eyeing a major breakout toward $2 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) has come out as the top blockchain network for net capital inflows over the past month, pulling in a hefty $475 million in new funds. Fresh data from Artemis, highlighted by on-chain watcher @rovercrc, shows the platform easily outpaced all other chains, cementing its spot as a go-to backing layer for digital assets. Arbitrum wasn’t far behind, attracting over $400 million in net inflows, making it the second most popular pick for capital during the same stretch.

According to a recent post by Levi of Crypto Crusaders on X, banks are now exploring how XRP can be used not just to send money, but to enable a wide range of financial applications — including digital currencies, secure asset storage, and the tokenization of real-world assets. This evolution positions XRP as more than a piece of code; it could soon become the foundational system for global finance. BREAKING: XRP isn’t just for sending money anymore! Banks are looking at XRP for much more like digital currencies, secure storage, and turning real-world assets into digital ones. It’s not just code it could be the future system that runs global finance. pic.twitter.com/MitUgbhZAJ — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) May 24, 2025 XRP’s Expansion From Payments to Multi-Use Financial Infrastructure When Ripple first introduced XRP, its main selling point was speed and cost-efficiency in cross-border transactions. Using On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Ripple allowed banks and payment providers to bypass slow, expensive correspondent banking networks by settling transactions almost instantly across borders. But as blockchain technology matures and the financial sector’s appetite for innovation grows, the narrative around XRP is rapidly expanding. Levi’s observation highlights a critical development: banks are now looking at XRP not merely as a tool for remittances but as a versatile infrastructure for the future. This includes using XRP’s ledger to support central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), enable tokenized representations of real-world assets like real estate and commodities, and provide highly secure, decentralized storage solutions for institutional funds. These use cases represent a seismic leap in how XRP could integrate into the architecture of global finance. Tokenization of Real-World Assets: A Game Changer One of the most exciting areas where XRP is gaining attention is the tokenization of real-world assets. Tokenization refers to converting ownership rights or asset claims, such as real estate, stocks, or commodities — into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process dramatically increases liquidity, reduces settlement times, and cuts down administrative overhead, all while offering transparent, immutable recordkeeping. Banks exploring XRP for this purpose see an opportunity to modernize asset markets and improve accessibility. For example, tokenized real estate could enable fractional ownership, opening markets to smaller investors and creating more dynamic liquidity pools. XRP’s high throughput and established network make it an appealing platform for these next-generation financial products. Supporting Digital Currencies and Secure Storage Levi’s post also draws attention to another crucial dimension: XRP’s potential role in supporting digital currencies, including both CBDCs and private digital assets. Ripple has already launched multiple pilot programs with central banks to explore how its technology can support CBDC issuance and interoperability. The XRP Ledger’s inherent scalability, security, and energy efficiency make it a strong candidate to serve as a backbone for future digital currency ecosystems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, XRP offers compelling advantages for secure storage solutions. Its decentralized, cryptographically protected ledger reduces single points of failure, making it an attractive option for institutional-grade custody of digital assets. As banks continue to expand their digital asset offerings, having a secure and efficient blockchain foundation becomes mission-critical. XRP is increasingly being viewed as a robust platform capable of meeting these demands. The Future of Global Finance Runs Through XRP? What makes this moment particularly compelling is that XRP is no longer just a payments innovation; it’s evolving into a multi-use infrastructure with the potential to reshape entire financial systems. As Levi of Crypto Crusaders points out, “It’s not just code — it could be the future system that runs global finance.” This statement underscores the growing realization among financial institutions that the blockchain revolution is not limited to cryptocurrencies as speculative assets but extends to the very frameworks upon which modern finance operates. With Ripple’s legal clarity following its victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the doors are wide open for banks and major institutions to explore and deploy XRP-based solutions without the regulatory overhang that once loomed large. From payments to tokenization to digital currency infrastructure, XRP is poised to play a pivotal role in the next chapter of financial evolution. As banks intensify their exploration of XRP’s broader applications , one thing becomes increasingly clear: XRP’s future is about far more than just sending money. It’s about transforming the very foundations of how value moves, is stored, and is represented in the global economy.

Despite facing regulatory challenges, many investors believe in XRP’s long-term potential. Some analysts think it could finally reach the $10 mark. Alongside XRP, another project called Ozak AI (OZ) is quickly becoming popular. It has an innovative use of AI and a presale price of just $0.003. Investors are asking a key question: Will the price of XRP reach $10? Recent news, such as the SEC dropping its lawsuit against Ripple Labs and the growing use of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, has raised optimism among investors. XRP Targets to Break Above the $10 Mark The price of XRP is stabilizing between $2.42 and $2.43 after encountering resistance around the $2.47 to $2.48 levels, which have previously limited its upward movement. The breakout above the descending trendline observed on the 4-hour chart earlier in May initially generated some optimism. However, the recent price movements indicate signs of short-term fatigue, as the market finds it challenging to advance further. XRP’s current trading pattern suggests a significant price movement may be on the horizon. According to analyst Captain Faibik, XRP has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle formation, a traditional setup that precedes sharp price fluctuations. The critical level to watch is $2.50; if XRP manages to break above this point, it could target the next resistance level around $3.70. $XRP Road to $5 Falling Wedge Breakout is Already Confirmed.. Bulls so far are in Complete Control.. Still You can Accumulate it for the Midterm & just HOLD, You'll thank me later.. #XRP #XRPUSDT #XRPCommunity pic.twitter.com/4aNCwUDcmD — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) May 13, 2025 If buyers can successfully reclaim the $2.47 to $2.48 resistance zone with strong volume, the price may aim for targets between $2.63 and $2.70. Conversely, if XRP fails to maintain support above $2.39, it could experience a deeper retracement toward the $2.31 to $2.20 support zone, where demand for XRP may reemerge. Youtube embed: $1 Target Set for OZAK, Buy OZAK AI at $0.003 is The Best Altcoin investment of 2025 Ozak AI XRP’s potential to reach $10 may require a favorable legal environment and time, while Ozak AI (OZAK) represents an early-stage token with significant growth prospects due to its innovative approach and lack of legacy constraints. Positioned at the convergence of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, Ozak AI is developing a decentralized platform focused on predictive analytics, on-chain data intelligence, and automated decision-making. The project has successfully raised over $1 million during its presale phase, and analysts predict that Ozak AI could reach $1 by 2025. If this prediction holds, it would represent a remarkable 300x return, offering a percentage return on investment that exceeds what XRP is projected to achieve. The 3rd stage of the Ozak AI presale is currently going on, and the project is already making waves in the crypto community. With an impressive $1M raised so far, Ozak AI tokens are currently priced at just $0.003 each, with the next stage price set at $0.005. This early-stage opportunity is poised for significant growth, with projections suggesting that the token could reach $1 by 2025.

He clearly thinks this move will force Brussels into making major trade concessions, even as investors warn it could wipe out the modest global stock market recovery. Until now, talks between Washington and Brussels have made only slow progress. But Trump’s sudden announcement that he will impose heavy duties on EU goods has shifted the negotiating ground. If no agreement is reached, he plans to begin on June 1. FT reported that financial markets have been at ease recently due to Trump’s friendlier trade talks with Britain and China. Now, investors worry that a fresh tariff war with Europe could undo the recovery in global stocks and strain relations with long‐time allies. “It’s a classic Trump bullying tactic,” said Bill Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “If he doesn’t get what he wants, he pushes back with threats and waits to see what happens.” Reinsch added that the aim is to make European leaders “back down,” though he doubts they will. On Friday afternoon in the Oval Office, Trump insisted he was in no rush to strike a bargain before the deadline. “That’s the way it is,” he declared, reaffirming his plan to proceed with the 50% tariffs unless Brussels agrees to US demands. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that the tariffs were meant to “light a fire under the EU.” He hinted there could be room to talk both before and after the official start date. A note from Oxford Economics said the threat of tariffs “will keep policy uncertainty elevated” since the administration may use duties as leverage any time talks stall. It remains unclear what the US wants from the EU In a social media post on Friday, Trump listed complaints about EU taxes, regulations, and trade rules that would be hard to fix quickly. Washington trade experts are fed up because the EU is repeating the same offers as before, and those offers never led to a deal. “Traditional methods haven’t produced a US‐EU agreement under any administration,” said Kelly Ann Shaw, a former White House trade official. Shaw, now a partner at Akin Gump law firm, said the threat of much higher tariffs “creates an action-forcing event” that will force both sides to decide soon whether they can reach a deal. From Washington’s view, the Europeans don’t seem to grasp that this round of talks is different and won’t follow the usual give‐and‐take, Reinsch said. On Friday, EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič held talks with US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Trade Representative Katherine Tai. There was no sign of a breakthrough. Afterward, Šefčovič wrote on X that “EU‐US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” Trump’s efforts to divide the EU could backfire EU officials wonder why they should give in so much when US and EU import taxes are nearly the same, only about one percentage point apart, and Europe’s VAT works out much like sales taxes in the US. Brussels also resists giving the US market access that other countries lack, warning it would violate World Trade Organization rules. Further complicating matters, many of the trade barriers the US objects to are set by national governments, even though EU trade policy is handled in Brussels. “EU negotiators should hold their nerve,” said Georg Riekeles, associate director at the European Policy Centre in Brussels. He pointed out that Canada and China have met US pressure with strong retaliation. “If the EU is ready to fight back, US bullying is ultimately self‐harmful, and you can move toward a deal.” But some EU members, such as Ireland and Italy, rely heavily on US exports and have decided against tough countermeasures. Trump may be hoping these splits will weaken Europe’s unity. Michael Smart, a former congressional trade counsel, warned that trying to split the EU could backfire. Most EU governments have so far backed the commission’s cautious approach of talking while buying time.

The conviction follows an extensive 12-day trial and an 18-month investigation into one of the most high-profile crypto fraud cases in recent memory. Prosecutors alleged that Karony and his associates deliberately deceived investors by falsely claiming SafeMoon’s liquidity pool was locked and untouchable, when in reality, they were stealing millions from it to fund a lavish lifestyle. According to the official press release by the DOJ, evidence presented in court revealed that Karony used investor funds to purchase luxury vehicles, including an Audi R8 and a Tesla, as well as multimillion-dollar real estate in Utah. While Karony maintained that liquidity funds could be accessed only in emergencies, testimony from SafeMoon’s former CTO, Thomas Smith, who took a plea deal, painted a picture of calculated deception. Smith admitted the executive team routinely coordinated public statements to cover their tracks and manipulate investor sentiment, all while personally trading SafeMoon tokens in ways that influenced the asset’s price. Karony’s conviction also includes the forfeiture of at least $2 million worth of assets, including residential properties. With sentencing looming, he faces a maximum of 45 years in prison. US Attorney Joseph Nocella described SafeMoon as a “front for theft” and Karony as someone who “lined the driveways of his million-dollar homes with luxury cars.” While Smith awaits sentencing and Kyle Nagy, the project’s elusive founder, remains at large. In an official statement, HSI New York Acting Special Agent in Charge McCormack said, “Steered by his selfish desires and insatiable greed, Braden John Karony treated millions of dollars in investors’ funds as his own personal bank account. The defendant will soon be trading his sprawling real estate and luxury vehicles for a jail cell within the four walls of a federal penitentiary.” Safemoon had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2023.

Ethereum ( ETH ) traded at $2,550 on Saturday, a few points below this month’s high of $2,735. It has jumped 85% from its lowest level this year. Most Polymarket traders believe that ETH price will jump to $4,000 in 2025. A poll shows that the odds of this happening have risen to 40% from last month’s low of 16%. These odds are at their highest level since March 1. Moving to $4,000 would imply a 60% surge from the current level. Polymarket places the odds of Ethereum price hitting $5,000 at 25% and $6,000 at 17%. On the other hand, the odds that it will crash to $1,000 have fallen to 16%.

It formed a golden cross as the 50-day and 200-day Arnaud Legoux Moving Averages crossed each other earlier this month. Ethereum is also forming a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. The flagpole started earlier this month and peaked at $2,736, the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. The recent consolidation is part of the flag formation. Therefore, there’s a chance that the coin will rebound in the next few days or weeks. A move above the 50% retracement at $2,736 will point to more gains, potentially to the 61.8% retracement point at $3,052. Rising above that retracement will point to more upside to $4,000.

As geopolitical instability gave way to regulatory clarity, digital assets experienced a fresh resurgence. The U.S. SEC softened its stance on decentralized infrastructure tokens, while the European Union ratified a uniform framework under MiCA, effectively inviting institutional money to flow into promising blockchain projects. As a result, token sales began heating up again — especially among those that align with long-term utility and short-term execution.Amid this resurgence, Qubetics emerged as a standout force. Meanwhile, blue-chip projects like BNB and Aptos are navigating this renewed market confidence with major partnerships and technology upgrades of their own. This shift has changed the question from which coin has the most hype to which projects offer the most near-term value. For those tracking the best crypto presale to join in May 2025, Qubetics, BNB, and Aptos aren’t just candidates — they’re top-tier picks. Qubetics ($TICS): Driving Scalable Web3 Utility Across Chains with Real Tools The Qubetics crypto presale is now in Stage 35, offering $TICS tokens at $0.2785. It has already surpassed 512 million tokens sold, engaging over 26,900 holders and raising more than $17.3 million. These figures represent more than excitement — they reflect belief in a system designed to streamline blockchain interoperability and digital access across borders. At its core, Qubetics addresses a persistent problem in Web3: cross-chain application development. Using a two-pronged solution built around QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE, it enables developers and enterprises to launch applications that function seamlessly across Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and BNB chains without the usual overhead or security risk. Real Applications in Emerging Regions In places like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the UAE, enterprises are testing Qubetics-based deployment kits to launch blockchain-powered systems for ID verification, remittances, and logistics. These aren’t testnet experiments — they are enterprise-grade pilots validated by regulatory sandboxes and academic research hubs. Qubetics doesn’t attempt to be another “Ethereum killer.” Instead, it complements the Layer-1 ecosystem by providing infrastructure that smooths integration and reduces development friction. That has made it one of the best crypto presale to join in May 2025, especially for those seeking short-term adoption alongside long-term scalability. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics delivers actual tools that developers and businesses are using now. Its growing ecosystem, real-world application focus, and presale momentum make it a serious contender for those evaluating the best crypto presale to join in May 2025. BNB (Binance Coin): Expanding Beyond the Exchange with Greenlighted Ecosystems BNB started as a utility token for the Binance exchange, but in 2025, it has become a multi-dimensional digital asset embedded in DeFi, GameFi, and even payment systems. This month, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was approved by Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) for a pilot decentralized financial sandbox — granting legitimacy to its scaling technology and governance model. Transaction volumes on BSC reached a 90-day high, spurred by newly launched apps in synthetic asset trading, cross-border FX settlement, and gamified token economies. The network also introduced opBNB, a new L2 rollup designed to improve scalability without sacrificing decentralization — a direct response to Ethereum’s L2 dominance. BNB’s use case now includes fee reductions on Binance, collateral in DeFi protocols, access to token launchpads, and even proof-of-identity applications. With active partnerships across Mastercard, Vodafone MENA, and Paymob, BNB’s influence continues to stretch beyond crypto-native circles into legacy payments. The latest news that Binance Cloud will expand into 14 new markets — powered by BNB — adds weight to the claim that BNB remains a stable, well-backed project amid an evolving market. BNB is more than a token — it’s a bridge between traditional finance and Web3 ecosystems. This maturity, scalability, and institutional integration affirm BNB’s role as one of the best crypto presale to join in May 2025, particularly for stable infrastructure plays. Aptos (APT): From Meta DNA to Modular Momentum Aptos was born from Meta’s abandoned Diem project but has since forged its own identity. In Q2 2025, Aptos reached a new milestone: processing 15,000+ TPS (transactions per second) while maintaining cost-efficiency and network decentralization. That performance, validated through open-source benchmarks and GitHub audits, has drawn comparisons to Solana — without Solana’s historical instability. Major moves came earlier this year when Aptos announced its partnership with Microsoft Azure’s confidential computing wing, allowing secure, private smart contract execution for use cases in healthcare and confidential enterprise data sharing. New DeFi protocols are launching on Aptos at a record rate. According to Messari, Aptos added 37 unique DeFi projects in Q1 2025 alone, thanks to its fast finality and Move-based programming — an architecture that emphasizes safety and efficiency. The Aptos Foundation has also allocated $45 million for early-stage dApps, with specific focus on on-chain games, loyalty systems, and real-time AI integrations. Aptos is delivering a high-throughput Layer-1 network that’s secure, scalable, and battle-tested. It’s positioned for both Web3 and institutional adoption, earning its place among the best crypto presale to join in May 2025. QubeQode and Qubetics IDE: Making Blockchain Development Scalable and Accessible Qubetics isn’t just a coin — it’s a toolkit. Here’s how QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE are enabling Web3 development like never before: Enables drag-and-drop smart contract deployment across major chains Supports Rust, Solidity, and Vyper with live code compilation Integrated node monitoring and analytics dashboards Offers compliance automation tools for GDPR, FATF, and MiCA Built-in testing environments for multi-chain deployments These tools empower both solo developers and institutional teams to scale blockchain infrastructure without starting from zero — a unique value-add in a fragmented ecosystem. Conclusion: Market-Ready Solutions for 2025’s Demand Surge The shift toward utility-based, regulation-compliant crypto infrastructure has created clear demand for tools, ecosystems, and tokens that serve tangible needs. Qubetics is filling the infrastructure gap. BNB is scaling beyond its exchange roots. Aptos is proving modular scalability and real-world readiness. In this landscape, these projects don’t merely exist — they solve. And that’s why they stand out as the best crypto presale to join in May 2025 for builders, institutions, and technologists alike. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the current stage of the Qubetics presale? Qubetics is in Stage 35, offering $TICS at $0.2785, with over 512M tokens sold and $17.3M+ raised. How is BNB evolving beyond exchange use? BNB now powers financial sandboxes, L2 networks, DeFi protocols, and legacy payment integration projects. Why is Aptos gaining developer momentum in 2025? Its Move-based secure architecture, low latency, and Microsoft-backed use cases are accelerating adoption. How does QubeQode benefit blockchain developers? QubeQode simplifies smart contract deployment and compliance integration across multiple chains. Are these projects suited for short-term impact or long-term holding? Each project demonstrates strong near-term catalysts, real-world use, and long-term ecosystem relevance.

Chainlink has moved past its downward trend, sparking interest. Meanwhile, Litecoin aims for a bullish flag breakout, raising questions about potential new highs. Find out if these coins are gearing up for a summer rally and which ones show the most promise for growth. Chainlink: Mixed Momentum and Key Ranges Signal Trading Opportunities Chainlink experienced a 17.71% gain over the past month but showed a 4.15% decline over the last six months. The recent week brought a 4.04% rise, showing a short-term uptick amid volatility. Price movements have oscillated between enthusiasm and longer-term pullbacks, indicating fluctuating investor sentiment and market responses. Current trading places Chainlink within a range of $11.15 to $16.41. Immediate resistance lies at $18.52, with a secondary level at $23.77. Support can be found around $8.01 and $2.75. With a relative strength near 60, the market shows mixed momentum with bulls and bears competing. Traders might look to buy near support levels and sell at immediate resistance. Litecoin Price Analysis: Short-Term Gains and Long-Term Stability Litecoin showed a noticeable boost over the past month with a nearly 20% rise while the six-month change remained close to flat at just under 1%. Price swings between roughly $68 and $94 marked recent activity, reflecting short-term buying interest combined with minimal movement over a longer period. The indicators point to some conviction among traders during this burst of monthly momentum yet a steady longer-term outlook. Current trading sees Litecoin confined between clear key levels—a support near $53 and immediate resistance at about $104, rising to a secondary resistance around $129. Bulls are in play short-term, evidenced by the monthly rally, but the mix of positive and negative signals means no clear trend is set. Traders might consider buying when prices revisit support and look to sell near the resistance zones. Conclusion LINK has broken its trendline, showing potential for upward movement. LTC is approaching a bullish flag breakout, suggesting a positive trend. Both cryptocurrencies are positioned for growth. New all-time highs could be seen this summer if current trends hold.

Investors added over $2.7 billion to the Bitcoin ETF during the week when BTC hit a new all-time high (ATH). Massive Inflows Drive Bitcoin ETF Market to New Heights Farside Investors’ data show $2,750,200,000 worth of Bitcoin ETF. This leaves the inflow volume about $309.8 million less than the figure posted in April when Bitcoin ETF investors added $3.06 billion to the market. The latest inflow marks the sixth consecutive week for the Bitcoin ETF market, bringing cumulative inflows to $44.53 billion. Comparatively, the gold ETF, which has recorded $4.9 billion in inflows this year, has a cumulative total asset of $100 billion. This is despite being in the financial space since 2004, about 20 years before the spot Bitcoin ETF made its debut. This has led to predictions that the Bitcoin ETF could flip its gold counterpart in a few years, if not months. IBIT Leads Institutional Surge, Challenges Gold ETF Dominance Interestingly, the iShares Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has seen $48 billion in assets, worth $71 billion. Grayscale is next with $21.7 billion, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $21 billion. Other big funds in the ecosystem include Bitwise, Ark Invest, and VanEck. The figures show that IBIT, the leading Bitcoin ETF , is already giving SPDR Gold ETF a good chase. If IBIT sustains the current inflow momentum, it could also flip the gold ETF. This development indicates that investors are more attracted to Bitcoin ETFs and that the asset class is growing in institutional adoption. Bitcoin Price Faces Pullback After New ATH Meanwhile, in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin, after a drawn-out period of consolidation, witnessed a breakout that saw it set a new ATH. The move wiped Bitcoin’s previous ATH of $109,487 . On May 22, 2025, it set a new ATH of $111,970.17 in a bullish rally that rubbed off on altcoins. As of this writing, Bitcoin’s price has dropped to $108,922.20 following renewed trade tariff conversations from the U.S. Bitcoin exchanges , representing a 0.46% decline in the last 24 hours. The pullback has affected investor interest as trading volume dipped by a significant 20.93% to $52.71 billion.

In the wake of this rally, investors are scanning for promising altcoins and meme tokens, and Solaxy is gaining traction. The project brands itself as the first-ever Layer 2 solution built on the Solana network—an appealing proposition on paper. However, a closer examination raises questions about its necessity and potential impact. Layer 2 solutions are typically designed to help slow blockchains with high fees—useful for Ethereum, but perhaps less so for Solana, which is already fast and low-cost. Introducing a Layer 2 on a network that doesn’t face major performance issues may not offer meaningful value. While early hype around Solaxy could yield a short-term 5x return, long-term value remains uncertain. This has many investors shifting their focus—and that’s where Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is gaining serious ground. INPEPE Has a Stronger Foundation: Real Tools, Real Market Impact, Real Vision While Solaxy benefits from technical intrigue, Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is quickly emerging as the top utility-focused meme coin of 2025. INPEPE offers a real-world solution to a massive market—the $25+ billion influencer economy—by acting as a borderless, fee-free payment system for digital creators. Unlike meme coins driven solely by hype, INPEPE is built for long-term ecosystem growth. Its core features include: Instant, borderless payouts for creators No platform fees or intermediaries On-chain proof of performance and engagement A staking APY of 4754%, offering unmatched passive income potential Education and community resources, helping users navigate crypto with confidence With a presale price of just $0.0000002051, $150,093.82 has already been raised toward the $505,881 funding goal—demonstrating strong early demand. What Sets Influencer Pepe Apart in the 2025 Meme Coin Arena: Built for Utility – Unlike meme coins with no function, INPEPE solves real problems for creators struggling with delayed payments and platform fees. Massive Staking Yields – Early users can earn a whopping 4754% APY through the staking dashboard. Cultural and Financial Relevance – INPEPE bridges the influencer economy with blockchain technology, giving it both narrative and utility strength. Upcoming Tier 1 Exchange Listings – Roadmap includes listings on top crypto exchanges. Viral Community Growth – Driven by creator partnerships and community memes, the project is gaining visibility beyond traditional crypto circles. The Origin Story: Why INPEPE Could Be Bigger Than the Meme INPEPE draws inspiration from meme coin giants like PEPE and Dogecoin but adds functionality and purpose. According to community supporters, the meme legacy of “Pepe” was missing two critical pillars—Technology and Optimization—which INPEPE aims to fulfill. Rather than clinging to nostalgia, Influencer Pepe has built a practical framework for creator payments in Web3. As the influencer economy moves toward decentralization, INPEPE is poised to become the go-to payment method for digital talent and content creators. Some even speculate that individuals tied to early Pepe coin developments are involved in INPEPE’s mission—offering both a cultural reset and a technical upgrade to the meme coin model. The Bottom Line: INPEPE Brings Real Utility in a Time When Meme Coins Must Offer More The market has matured. With Bitcoin above $110K and XRP surging, investors are prioritizing substance over spectacle. The days of meme coins pumping purely on internet jokes are fading—projects now need utility, structure, and a vision. Influencer Pepe delivers on all fronts—from staking and payment rails to education and ecosystem growth. It’s a meme coin designed not just to entertain, but to function. Solaxy may still enjoy attention as Solana’s experimental Layer 2, but for those looking to back a meme coin with real-world adoption potential, INPEPE is proving to be the more complete package. What a $10,000 Investment in Influencer Pepe Could Mean for Your Portfolio? Some early adopters are already speculating that a $10,000 investment in Influencer Pepe today could potentially 64x, reaching $640,000 — especially as the influencer economy continues to grow. With the global influencer industry projected to hit $48 billion by 2027, projects that merge crypto with creator culture are catching serious attention. If $INPEPE gains traction as a go-to payment option among influencers, its market cap could challenge — or even surpass — meme coin giants like Dogecoin and PEPE. That kind of adoption could fuel the kind of momentum meme coin investors dream of. How to Join the $INPEPE Project: Set Up a Wallet – Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Add Funds – Deposit ETH, USDT, or BNB. Access the Presale – Visit influencerpepe.com to buy tokens. Stake and Earn – Begin earning high APY rewards through the staking dashboard. Why $INPEPE Stands Out? INPEPE merges meme energy with real-world functionality. With its zero-fee payout model, high staking returns, and Web3 creator tools, the project is turning heads across the retail and influencer communities. And here’s the big picture: if just a fraction of the $48 billion influencer marketing industry adopts INPEPE as a preferred payment method, the token could realistically challenge—and even outperform legacy meme coins like Dogecoin and PEPE in terms of market cap. In a market driven increasingly by utility-backed narratives, Influencer Pepe is leading the next wave of meme coin evolution.

One name making waves recently is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its utility token, MUTM . With growing excitement around its unique lending model, dynamic interest structure, and upcoming platform beta launch, analysts are starting to pay closer attention. Some even predict that MUTM could climb as much as 15x by October. While no one can forecast the market with absolute certainty, there are several reasons why this projection doesn’t seem far-fetched. Why MUTM is Gaining Attention MUTM isn’t just another speculative crypto token. It has been created to power a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol. Mutuum allows users to lend, borrow, and stake crypto assets through a system that automatically adjusts interest rates based on supply and demand. It offers both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models—making it attractive to casual users, yield seekers, and advanced DeFi strategists alike. The platform’s automated interest rate adjustment is one of its most attractive features. When borrowing activity increases and liquidity becomes limited, interest rates go up. When there is excess liquidity, rates drop, making borrowing more accessible. This natural balancing mechanism helps avoid liquidity crises and encourages consistent participation across market cycles. For lenders, this model provides a fair and transparent way to earn income, and for borrowers, it creates flexible and responsive borrowing terms. Mutuum’s presale is structured in 11 phases, with each phase slightly increasing the price of MUTM. Phase 1 began at just $0.01. The current phase—Phase 5—has pushed the price to $0.03, already showing a 200% gain for early supporters. At the time of writing, over 503 million tokens have been sold, and more than 11,000 users are holding MUTM, signaling strong early adoption. As the presale moves forward, each new phase brings an automatic price increase. By the time it reaches Phase 11, MUTM will be priced at $0.06—a 500% increase from the initial entry point. This gradual appreciation model has fueled ongoing demand, while also creating a sense of urgency. The window for high-margin entry is closing, and many believe that once the token is listed publicly and trading begins, rapid price discovery could follow. Beta Launch and Momentum Building According to the project’s roadmap, the team is planning to release a beta version of the Mutuum platform by the time the token goes live. This timing is important. It means that when tokens are unlocked, users won’t just be trading—they’ll also be able to start using the platform. This level of readiness is rare among presale projects and adds credibility to Mutuum’s mission. Analysts often look for signals beyond just token prices. A working beta, especially in a sector as competitive as DeFi lending, adds major weight to a protocol’s long-term potential. Once users begin lending and borrowing on the live platform, MUTM’s utility will move beyond speculation. It will become the fuel that powers borrowing incentives and yield payouts. This is where value could start to scale quickly. Community Growth and $100K Rewards Program Community sentiment around Mutuum is building fast. With over $9 million raised already, the momentum shows that this isn’t just a project with a clever whitepaper. It has user backing. The team has also launched a $100,000 promotional giveaway to reward new users, expand reach, and keep buzz growing around the token sale and eventual platform launch. Giveaways like these are not just marketing—they’re early growth engines. They bring in curious users, some of whom become long-term holders, liquidity providers, or stakers. In DeFi, community participation often equals liquidity, and liquidity is what drives returns. Staking, mtTokens, and Long-Term Value Mutuum has taken a unique approach to rewarding its users. When you deposit assets into the protocol, you receive mtTokens—representing your share of the liquidity pool plus earned interest. These mtTokens can also be staked in a safety module that gives you access to dividends. Here’s how it works: the protocol uses part of its revenue to buy back MUTM tokens from the market and redistributes them to those who stake their mtTokens. This creates a cycle where more lending and borrowing leads to more revenue, which funds more buybacks, which reduces supply and increases demand for MUTM. For long-term holders, this mechanism creates passive yield and supports long-term price stability. A Perfect Storm for Token Discovery Mutuum isn’t just launching a token—it’s launching an ecosystem. And once the token is live, all eyes will be on price discovery. With the current price at $0.03 and strong forecasts pointing to as much as a 15x rise by October, some investors see this moment as a rare opportunity. If the token does reach $0.45 after launch, that would represent significant gains even for those joining in Phase 5. But for those waiting until after launch, the upside may not be as substantial. Analysts are closely watching the token’s entry into public markets, the community response to the beta platform, and the level of adoption for lending and staking. These are not speculative dreams—they’re real economic signals that point to strong fundamentals. If user activity explodes after launch, the price could move quickly, catching latecomers off guard. While there are no guarantees in crypto, the pieces are falling into place for something big. A 15x gain by October may seem ambitious, but it’s rooted in logic, not just hype. As the DeFi space continues to grow, Mutuum is becoming a project to watch closely—and possibly act on while the presale is still underway.

Industry leaders and market analysts say the bill if passed in its current form, would eliminate vital tax credits and damage solar businesses and homeowners. This week, the House approved a large tax and spending bill that removes tax credits for both companies that lease rooftop solar systems and homeowners. These credits have been a key financial tool for making solar power more affordable and accessible. Without them, the solar market could face major disruptions. The industry is already struggling with several challenges. These include high interest rates, new tariffs on imported solar equipment, and reduced state incentives, particularly in California, the biggest market for rooftop solar in the country. One of the nation’s largest solar companies, Sunnova Energy International Inc., is reportedly preparing for a potential bankruptcy. Solar supporters are lobbying in the senate Solar companies and green energy supporters have started lobbying in the Senate. They hope that moderate Republicans may oppose the House version of the bill. Some senators are already expressing concerns about removing support for clean energy. However, with a slim majority, Senate lawmakers may find it difficult to make changes without facing resistance from more conservative members. Despite support from the Inflation Reduction Act, passed during President Joe Biden’s term, the residential solar industry has not had smooth sailing. Higher borrowing costs have made it harder for solar companies to raise money and for homeowners to finance installations. Additionally, California’s policy changes have cut the amount of money that solar customers can earn by selling excess power back to the grid, making it take longer for them to recover the cost of their systems. Meanwhile, the U.S. International Trade Commission voted this week to move forward with new tariffs on solar equipment from four Southeast Asian countries. These countries supply most of the solar cells and panels used in the U.S. The new tariffs, which range from 34% to over 3,500% depending on the country and manufacturer, come after a months-long trade investigation. Some duties are already being collected. The U.S. residential solar market declined by 20% last year, according to Bloomberg. If the tax credits are removed, another 18% drop could occur over the next decade, said BNEF analyst Pol Lezcano. Removing solar credits would make the US solar industry unstable Following the House bill’s release on Thursday, solar company stocks plummeted. Sunrun lost over one-third of its market value. Other companies, like Enphase Energy Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc., also saw sharp declines. Critics say the bill effectively rolls back many clean energy supports included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Removing the credits now would take away the stability that foreign companies need to continue investing in the U.S. green energy sector. The possible loss of tax credits could also severely affect small installation firms, many of which are family-run businesses. The impact on solar leasing would be especially severe, analysts warn. Joseph Osha of Guggenheim Securities noted that leases make up around 70% of new solar installations. “It’s pretty dire,” he said. In response, the solar industry is preparing for a strong lobbying effort in the Senate. Leaders say they are fighting to stop a law that could cause large-scale job losses and economic damage. Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, spoke at the trade group’s convention in Phoenix and urged lawmakers to change course. “We urge the Senate to reject the strident House approach and pass a reasonable energy policy for the American people,” he said.

According to the forecast, Bitcoin could blow off to an astonishing $325,000 price peak — and the most shocking aspect of this analysis is not just the price target but the accelerated timeline for this meteoric rise. Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K Bitcoin Price To Peak At $325K? The $325,000 Bitcoin price forecast by Gert van Lagen, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) is based on a technical analysis chart spanning BTC’s movements from 2009 and 2025. The chart applies Elliott Wave Theory on a High Time Frame (HTF), tracking a massive five-wave impulsive structure, with each wave representing a major bullish cycle driven by halving events. Lagen disclosed that Bitcoin is currently in Wave 5, the last wave of this mega-cycle, suggesting that the market is on the verge of its final parabolic blow-off. Each of Bitcoin’s past bull markets, according to the analysis, has ended with a near-vertical explosive surge, where price accelerates rapidly before crashing into a corrective phase. This surge has always been defined by a price angle of at least 82 degrees from the bottom. The crypto analyst has drawn a trendline connecting the peaks of Wave 1 and 2, creating a rising wedge pattern. The lower boundary of this wedge is represented by the 210,000 block SMA, which acts as a long-term support. Additionally, the upper trendline of this wedge intersects with the forecasted market top of Wave 5, which sits at around $325,000. Notably, this bullish prediction relies heavily on Bitcoin maintaining strong momentum and completing Wave 5 as a single clean impulse move, without any deviation or elongation, just like past cycles. Lagen’s bold $325,000 price forecast for Bitcoin comes with an exceptionally near-term timeline. The market expert predicts that BTC could reach this ambitious target as soon as July 5, 2025, which is just over a month away. Interestingly, this timeline is grounded in the movements observed in previous post-halving cycles. The analyst’s projected trajectory of Bitcoin’s surge to a market top also aligns closely with the past patterns that followed each Bitcoin halving cycle. These halving events have triggered strong bull markets during past cycles. The current rally also follows Bitcoin’s fourth and most recent halving event, which took place on April 20, 2024, reinforcing the repetitive and cyclic nature of Bitcoin’s price movements. A Historic Correction Could Follow This Price Surge Beyond the dramatic $325,000 Bitcoin price prediction, Lagen’s analysis also carries a foreboding bearish outlook. He cautions that after Bitcoin reaches this projected market top, what comes next may be a high time frame price crash, possibly lasting several years.

Bitcoin price was hovering at $108,000, while the market cap of all coins tumbled to $3.4 trillion. This article provides a forecast for top cryptocurrencies like Jupiter (JUP), Bonk (BONK), and Hyperliquid (HYPE). Jupiter price prediction JUP price chart | Source: TradingView Jupiter token has bounced back in the past few weeks, soaring by over 83% from its lowest level this year. Still, it remains significantly below last November’s high of $1.4400. JUP token was trading at $0.5500 on Saturday, a notable level since it was the lowest swing in July last year. It was also the neckline of the head and shoulders chart pattern. It has moved slightly above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls are in control. JUP has also formed an ascending channel shown in red. Therefore, JUP price needs to move above the resistance at $0.6338 to confirm the bullish breakout. There is a risk that it has formed a break-and-retest pattern, by retesting that resistance. A break-and-retest is a popular bearish continuation sign. Bonk price technical analysis Bonk token chart by TradingView Bonk, the second-biggest meme coin on the Solana ecosystem, has bounced back in the past few months. This rebound started after it formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.000008953. It has moved above the neckline at $0.00001543. A double bottom is one of the most common bullish reversal patterns. Bonk price has formed an ascending channel and moved slightly above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. The 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages are about to cross each other, forming a mini-golden cross pattern. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the Bonk price rises and hits the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00003460, which is about 60% above the current level. HYPE price forecast HYPE price chart | Source: TradingView Hyperliquid token price has surged recently as the network has emerged as the biggest player in decentralized finance. Data shows that its protocol handled over $74 billion in transactions in the last seven days. That figure is significantly higher than what top DEX networks like Uniswap and Raydium handled during the month. Hyperliquid has now handled over $1.55 trillion worth of transactions since its founding. The cumulative total is much higher than that of other perpetual futures exchanges like Jupiter, edgeX, GMX, and Vertex Edge, combined. Jupiter has also become a highly profitable player as its daily profits surged to over $5 million this week. The daily chart shows that the HYPE price has soared from about $9.4 on April 7 to $35 today. It crossed the important resistance level at $28.38, the upper side of the cup-and-handle pattern whose depth is about 67%. A C&H is a popular bullish continuation pattern. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, by measuring 67% from the cup’s upper side, we can estimate that the HYPE price will keep rising and possibly hit the target at $47.7. A move below the support at $28 will invalidate the bullish HYPE forecast.

The retreat happened as market risks increased on Friday following Donald Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on European goods and Apple products. Subsequently, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropped from over $3.5 trillion on Friday to $3.4 trillion on Saturday. Pepe has also retreated as on-chain data shows that the supply held by whales continued falling this week. Santiment data shows that whales hold about 141.2 trillion coins valued at $1.4 billion, down from 165 trillion in February. Their current holdings is the smallest it has been since November last year. Pepe whales | Source: Santiment More data by Nansen shows that smart money investors have been reducing their holdings in the past few months. These investors hold 244 billion worth of Pepe, down from 380 billion a year earlier. Pepe smart money trends | Source: Nansen Nansen defines smart money investors as sophisticated and highly experienced holders who have demonstrated substantial success over time. These investors are normally quick to spot trend reversals. There are also concerns that Pepe balances on exchanges has started rising. There were 252.9 trillion Pepe coins on exchanges on Saturday, up from this week’s low of 251.3 trillion. An increase in these balances is often a red flag since it signals that more investors are moving them from self-custody and selling. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe price chart | Source: crypto.news On the positive side, Pepe has strong technicals, which could draw smart money and whales. The daily chart shows that it is about to form a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages near their crossover. This crossover often leads to more gains in the long term. Pepe has also formed a rounded bottom pattern, which often leads to a continuation. Therefore, these technicals point to more gains in the coming weeks. A move above this week’s high of $0.00001625 will confirm more gains, potentially to a record high of $0.00002840.

45051760,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=734201,1748110503,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45051760.jpeg,Nvidia to launch lower-cost Blackwell AI chip tailored for China amid US export bans,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-in-cheaper-blackwell-chip-for-china/,"Nvidia is reportedly planning to launch a cheaper Blackwell AI chip specifically made for China amid the US export restrictions, sources close to the developments have revealed. According to sources cited in a Reuters report, Nvidia is expected to start mass production of the new AI chip in June, which will be sold at a significantly lower price compared to the restricted H20 model. Nvidia’s price for the new chip reflects its weaker specs According to the two sources cited , the restricted H20 was priced at between $10,000 and $12,000. But Nvidia has set the price for the new Blackwell processor at between $6,500 and $8,000. The price is reportedly a reflection of the weaker specifications for the latest generation Blackwell, as well as the simpler production processes. The sources added that the new chip, tailored for the Chinese market, will be based on Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor. It will also use conventional GDR7 memory as opposed to the more advanced high bandwidth memory, according to the report. While the three sources that Reuters cited refused to be named as they were not authorized to comment on the matter, they revealed that the new chip will not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s (2330.TW) advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology. Although TSMC refused to comment, a Nvidia spokesperson indicated that the company was still weighing its “limited” options. “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market.” Nvidia Spokesperson. This comes as China has been a huge market for Nvidia, contributing 13% of the company’s total sales during the past financial year. The latest development marks the third time that the American chip-making firm has had to specially make a GPU for China following restrictions imposed by US authorities. The H20 restrictions forced Nivida to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and according to CEO Jensen Huang, the company also had to let go of $15 billion in sales. Nvidia revealed it has lost a significant market share in China The US imposed bans on the H20 in April forcing Nvidia to consider making a lower version of the Chip specifically for China, but the plan failed to work, according to sources. Last week, Huang also revealed that Nvidia’s old Hopper architecture, which the H20 uses could not take any further modifications under current export restrictions. In a note published on Tuesday by Chinese brokerage firm GF Securities, the new GPU would likely be called B40 or 6000D, although the firm did not indicate the price or sources of the information. However, the two sources Reuters cited revealed that Nvidia is making another Blackwell-architecture chip for the Asian giant. According to Reuters, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week that the company’s market share in China fell from 95% before 2022, when export curbs started, to about 50% currently. He also cautioned that continuing with US export curbs could push more Chinese customers to turn to Huawei chips, which is Nvidia’s main competitor producing the Ascend 910B chip. He added that US firms could lose billions in dollars as a result of the export embargoes. Some semiconductor analysts have also said that the US export restrictions are making way for Chinese firms. Since the export bans were imposed, Huawei has stood as a leader in China’s AI race to compete with Nvidia, analysts have indicated. According to a recent report from independent semiconductor research firm SemiAnalysis, although Huawei remains “a generation behind chips,” the tech firm is making waves with the hardware that uses them.

Social media feeds burst within minutes. Traders clamored to get in, and prices for the two tokens increased by nearly 20% within hours. For many, it was déjà vu all over again from the initial days of the meme coin craze. The Background Story of the Tokens MOODENG is not just another animal coin. Its mascot, a perpetually confused-looking baby pygmy hippo, has become a viral sensation on crypto Twitter and TikTok. The community, known as ”The Herd,” has been quite determined with their meme campaign, catapulting MOODENG from unknown to $230 million market cap in a few weeks. Robinhood listing was the spark that ignited a powder keg of retail pent-up demand, and the stock rose 21% in a day. MEW, meanwhile, has a devoted cult following. Hailed as ”the cat that outsmarted the dog coins,” MEW's clever branding and tongue-in-cheek mythos were a hit with day traders hungry for the next new thing. After its strong May, the Robinhood news propelled MEW another 19% higher, with Discord servers and Telegram channels in an uproar speculating as to where the coin would go next. The Surge Unfolds As listings news emerged, order books on large exchanges burst into life. Whale wallets swooped in, making six-figure buys on Coinbase Pro and OKX. On-chain metrics saw the number of new wallets with MOODENG and MEW within spike, suggesting a fresh batch of retail buyers. Activity on both coins tripled overnight, and social media reach reached all-time highs since launch. It wasn't only retail traders piling in. Derivatives indicators revealed a focused blast of leveraged bets on further upside, with open interest in MEW futures at an all-time high. The tension was in the air — memes flew around, and stories of overnight gains circulated far and wide. Can This Spark a New Alt-Season? Robinhood's move comes at a time when the cryptocurrency space is already on edge, with Bitcoin teetering on new all-time highs and regulatory clouds starting to clear in the U.S. Adding MOODENG and MEW is seen by most as a signal: the door is open to more speculative products, and retail traders are chomping at the bit to get back. Traders are watching closely. When Robinhood recently added its most recent crypto, it set off a domino effect that saw dozens of altcoins trend upward. If things keep going as they are, MOODENG and MEW could be the beginning of another wave of retail-fueled rallies. The Takeaway The Robinhood addition of MOODENG and MEW rekindled the meme coin mania for at least now. Prices are increased, volumes are thru the roof, and there's a sense of expectation in the air. For traders and for meme proponents both, it's evidence of just how quickly fortunes can change in crypto and how much gas one listing can feed the next big tear.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-24 18:23:55

Wallenberg’s AstraZeneca Plc, Ericsson AB, Saab AB, SEB AB, and Wallenberg Investments have agreed to build what they termed the largest enterprise AI supercomputer in Sweden. Nvidia offers to provide AI training and build an AI tech center in Sweden The Wallenberg businesses plan to deploy two Nvidia DGX Superpods featuring the tech firm’s Grace Blackwell GB300 systems in their supercomputer. One of the Swedish companies, Saab, also claimed it would offer AI methodology to expedite the development of the defense systems. Additionally, Nvidia stated it would open its first AI technology center in Sweden to support industrial research. The chip manufacturer also pledged to provide access to its experts and offer hands-on training through its Deep Learning Institute to enhance AI talent development. Moreover, Ericsson claimed it would use its data science knowledge to develop advanced AI models with better performance and efficiency rates and elevate customer experience. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca and SEB clarified their intentions to build AI infrastructure. AstraZeneca claimed they would use the technology to enhance drug discovery and development, while SEB asserted they would use AI to fuel productivity and power consumer projects. The Swedish business consortium and Nvidia claim they want to promote AI innovation with their planned developments. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang even commented, “The country is building its first AI infrastructure — laying the foundation for breakthroughs across science, industry, and society.” Marcus Wallenberg, Chair of Wallenberg Investments, also stated that investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure would accelerate AI adoption in the country. He added, “We believe this initiative will generate valuable spillover effects—enabling upskilling, fostering new collaborations, and strengthening the broader national AI ecosystem.” Nvidia could introduce new, cheaper AI chips for the Chinese market. Nvidia is also preparing to introduce a more affordable AI chipset for the Chinese market. According to sources, the firm could start manufacturing the chips early in June. The chips are part of Nvidia’s Blackwell-architecture AI processors, and prices will range between $6,500 and $8,000 and well below $10,000 to $12,000. However, the reduced costs will come with scaled-down specifications and simplified manufacturing processes. The chips will be built similarly to the firm’s RTX Pro 6000D, incorporate a server-class graphics processor, and be embedded with GDDR7 memory instead of a more advanced high bandwidth memory. While Nvidia has yet to confirm this news officially, one of the firm’s spokespersons stated that it was still considering its options. He asserted that they are halting their sales in China’s market until they decide on a new product design and earn the US government’s approval. China’s market is vital to Nvidia’s sales, accounting for over 13% of sales in the last fiscal year. Nvidia has had to reconsider its options following the April US government ban on its H20 series. Huang, however, claimed that the company’s older Hopper architecture, which H20 utilizes, cannot support further modifications under current export controls. Huang also claimed that the change in export restrictions caused its market share to drop to 50%, down from 95% before 2022. Nvidai’s top rival in China is Huawei, which sells the Ascend 910B chip. If US export restrictions persist, Huang believes Huawei could take over part of its market share. Nonetheless, sources familiar with Nvidia’s workings stated that the firm is working on another Blackwell chip for the Chinese market, with production set to start in September.

Related News: What Are America's Ultra-Rich Doing with Bitcoin: An Executive Managing $200 Billion Speaks Out, Secrets Revealed Garlinghouse began his speech by saying, “It’s exciting to be on this platform after being overlooked for years,” and attributed the interest in crypto ETFs to two main reasons: First, Garlinghouse stated that institutional investors trading on Wall Street have not been able to access crypto directly for a long time, and that these investors have had to either use their own custody solutions or turn to centralized exchanges. He said that thanks to these new ETF structures, institutions can trade crypto assets directly through Wall Street. Secondly, Garlinghouse said that this development accelerated the institutionalization of the crypto sector, reminding that the Bitcoin ETF was the fastest ETF to reach $ 1 billion to date. He also stated that it passed $ 10 billion in record time and could approach the gold ETF. *This is not investment advice.

Santiment notes in a new post on the social media platform X that Chainlink registered 532.43 notable GitHub events in the past 30 days. The figure far exceeds the second-ranked RWA project, the layer-1 blockchain Avalanche ( AVAX ), which clocked 290.87 GitHub events. The peer-to-peer payments project Stellar ( XLM ) was third, with 240.7. Chainlink has occupied the top spot on Santiment’s list all year, often clocking multiple times the number of GitHub events as the second-ranked project.

With market dynamics shifting, there's a growing buzz about whether May could mark a pivotal turning point for these tokens. This article delves into the current market conditions and explores if these assets are poised for a breakthrough. Kaspa's Rally Amid Mixed Momentum and Key Price Levels Kaspa showed a 16.71% rise over the past month alongside a significant six-month drop of 25.01%. Price movement witnessed short-term gains countered by longer-term weakness, pointing to volatile sentiment. The one-week decline of 1.87% adds to the narrative of fluctuating momentum and recovery attempts, with overall behavior reflecting both positive bursts and cautionary retreats. Current pricing trades between $0.0585 and $0.1150. With resistance at $0.1403 and a secondary wall at $0.1967, traders could look to initiate long positions near the strong support level of $0.0274. RSI near 58.60 hints at gentle bullish pressure even as momentum indicators remain weak, suggesting careful plays around these technical points. Quant QNT: Monthly Surge Contrasts with Mixed Six-Month Trends QNT price data shows a strong monthly gain of over 42% alongside a modest weekly rise of 1.66%. A slight overall decline of 1.11% over six months reflects variable momentum. Recent movements highlight periods of rapid gains contrasted with longer-term hesitation. Market history underscores a mix of rally potential and extended sideways action without a consistent upward trend. Current prices trade between $63.20 and $82.20 with immediate resistance at $89.40 and support at $51.40, and a secondary resistance at $108.40. Bulls hold sway within this range, but indicators like a marginally negative momentum reading suggest caution. Traders may consider entering near support and taking profits near resistance while monitoring for any emerging trend shifts. Conclusion KAS and QNT are facing important resistance levels. If these resistances are broken, it could signal the start of a strong upward move. Market behavior will be key in the coming weeks. Focus remains on whether these tokens can surpass their current barriers. Analysts will be watching closely for any positive signs. The upcoming month may provide crucial indicators for future performance. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Chairperson Joseph Tsai urged Asian firms to explore opportunities within the region and in Europe as US-China tensions continue to linger. At a tech conference in Macau on Saturday, Tsai hinted at criticism of the Trump administration’s trade policies, saying “some governments try to tear down this bridge that we have built between Asia and the rest of the world.” He encouraged business ties among East Asian nations, Southeast Asia, and, eventually, South Asia, and described Europe as “an incredible opportunity” for companies based in Asia. Alibaba’s main operations have felt the impact of the drawn-out standoff between Washington and Beijing. Shares of the Hangzhou-based e-commerce giant dipped this week after The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had voiced concerns over a possible AI partnership between Apple Inc. and Alibaba. While Apple has not publicly addressed such an alliance, Tsai confirmed earlier this year that the companies were in talks. He stopped short of saying whether Alibaba would serve as Apple’s exclusive AI provider in China. A local collaborator could help boost iPhone sales in China, where Apple has fallen behind rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. in rolling out AI-enabled handsets. Regulations in China prevent Apple from offering its full range of AI features without teaming up with an accredited domestic partner. Alibaba’s e-commerce business is affected by the closure of a tariff loophole Alibaba’s e-commerce has also been hurt by a recent decision by the US that shut a tariff loophole for small parcels sent from mainland China and Hong Kong. That move, part of the US government’s broader trade measures, has added pressure to the company’s bottom line. Last week’s disappointing earnings sent Alibaba’s shares tumbling by their largest margin in over a month. Investors are growing cautious about the company’s ability to weather China’s ongoing economic slowdown and to leverage its position in the AI race sparked by the launch of models like DeepSeek. Alibaba stock price. Source: Google Finance Nevertheless, Tsai defended Alibaba’s direction on Saturday, saying the firm was on “a very good path” and emphasizing its continued focus on e-commerce and artificial intelligence. Since taking charge in 2023, Tsai and Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu have steered Alibaba through a period of intense regulatory scrutiny. They have prioritized investments in AI and core retail operations while divesting non-essential assets to fund continued growth and global expansion. Alibaba has been busy rolling out AI offerings this year, aiming to keep pace with international rivals. Just last month, the company unveiled its Qwen3 flagship model, which it claims matches or exceeds DeepSeek’s performance on several benchmarks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The US dollar index also had the worst performance since April, when Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped to a record high of $111,900, while the market capitalization of all altcoins excluding Bitcoin soared to $1.29 trillion, the highest point since February this year. The Dow Jones, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies, dropped to $41,340, down by 3.45% from its highest level this month. Other top blue-chip indices fell by over 1.2%, erasing billions of dollars in value. The US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s performance against a basket of currencies, dropped to $99.10, moving into a technical correction. A correction happens when an asset’s price drops by 10% from a local top.

In it, the biggest asset manager in the world noted that gold was becoming a hedge against the soaring US public debt. Therefore, Bitcoin rose after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating from Triple-A to a notch lower, citing the substantial debt. Moody’s joined the other two rating agencies, S&P Global and Fitch, which have also slashed their Triple-A rating. The sell-off of stocks and the US dollar continued after the House of Representatives voted for Donald Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill, ” which cuts over $4 trillion in taxes. The bill is estimated to increase the public debt by $4 trillion to $5 trillion over a decade, a concerning development as the national debt is approaching $37 trillion. U.S. stocks dropped on Friday after Trump warned that the U.S. would implement a 50% tariff on European goods on June 1. The EU has warned that it will reciprocate, a move that will disrupt annual trade volumes worth over $1.7 trillion. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s fundamentals are strong enough to withstand these concerns. For one, data shows that demand among institutions is rising, as supply continues falling this year.

Pundit Says $1,000 XRP Price Is Certain",https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-built-for-generational-wealth-pundit-says-1000-xrp-price-is-certain/,"In the ever-volatile world of cryptocurrencies, few tokens stir as much debate and passionate prediction as XRP. According to BarriC , a prominent voice in the crypto community who recently shared his views on X, XRP is not just poised for a price surge — it is set to climb to an astonishing $1,000 very shortly . BarriC argues that this milestone will usher in unprecedented generational wealth for those who hold XRP, sparking widespread discussion across the digital asset space about whether such a valuation is realistic or merely wishful thinking. $XRP will hit $1,000 in the very near future Bringing about generational wealth — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 24, 2025 What Fuels the $1,000 XRP Prediction? The belief that XRP can reach $1,000 stems from several foundational arguments within the XRP community. At its core, XRP was designed as a utility token, built to solve one of the most critical pain points in global finance: cross-border payments. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution allows financial institutions to move money across borders instantly and at minimal cost, bypassing traditional, clunky systems like SWIFT. As the global financial system becomes increasingly digitized, the demand for fast, scalable, and reliable settlement solutions is expected to surge, and XRP is often positioned as the best-fit solution. Supporters like BarriC believe that as major banks, payment providers, and even governments adopt Ripple’s technology, the value of XRP will rise exponentially. This is not just about speculative trading; it is about XRP becoming an integral part of global financial infrastructure. If the XRP Ledger were to underpin trillions of dollars in daily transactions, the price of each XRP token could theoretically climb to reflect that scale of utility and demand. The Case for Generational Wealth BarriC’s claim that XRP will bring “generational wealth” taps into a vision shared by many early adopters in the crypto space. Generational wealth refers to wealth so substantial that it not only changes an individual’s financial future but also reshapes the economic prospects of their children and grandchildren. For XRP holders, the idea is that a meteoric rise in price, from under a dollar today to $1,000 or more, would create life-changing gains. This vision is fueled by the belief that the global financial system is on the brink of transformation. With the tokenization of assets, the rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and an increasing push for instant, low-cost payments, blockchain platforms like Ripple are seen as inevitable winners. If XRP becomes the global standard for liquidity and settlement, its value could skyrocket, unlocking wealth for those who positioned themselves early. Skepticism and Realistic Perspectives While the optimism is compelling, it’s important to ground the conversation in realism. A price of $1,000 per XRP would imply a market capitalization in the tens of trillions of dollars, far beyond the current size of the entire cryptocurrency market and larger than the GDP of most major economies. For this to materialize, XRP would need to achieve unprecedented global adoption, capture significant portions of the world’s financial flows, and overcome both technological and regulatory challenges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, XRP’s supply dynamics are very different from Bitcoin’s, which has a capped supply of 21 million coins. XRP’s maximum supply stands at 100 billion, meaning the price per token naturally requires much larger flows of value to sustain dramatic increases. While BarriC’s confidence reflects a bullish, long-term belief, many analysts caution that such price levels are speculative and should be approached with measured expectations. Why the Future Still Holds Promise Even if XRP does not reach the lofty $1,000 target anytime soon, its trajectory still offers significant opportunities. Ripple’s expanding partnerships with financial institutions, its involvement in CBDC pilots, and its potential full resolution of its legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have all bolstered market confidence. These achievements position XRP as one of the few digital assets with real-world utility, distinguishing it from purely speculative tokens. BarriC’s post reignites the conversation around XRP’s long-term potential, reminding the crypto world that beneath the daily price charts lies a bigger story: the chance to reshape how money moves globally. Whether or not XRP reaches $1,000, its role in the future of finance is increasingly clear, and for many believers, that alone is reason enough to hold on and watch closely. As the global financial system evolves, XRP remains a critical token to watch, not just for its price action but for its potential to help build the foundations of a new era of digital, borderless, and generational wealth.

The project stands out as the best coin to invest in today because of its focus on securing and boosting users' chances of scaling their earnings on its platform. With $MTX now live, here's why DOGE and TON investors rally at this presale! Dogecoin (DOGE) Faces Increased Whale Activity After Cool Off DOGE recently witnessed a surge in its daily transactions due to the activity of large holders over the last 24 hours. According to data from IntoTheBlock, whales moved tokens worth approximately $23.3 billion, indicating users' bullish stance. DOGE currently trades at about $0.22, declining over 5.6% within the last seven days due to its recent price correction. Yet, investors remain optimistic following the rise of $MTX, a new altcoin with the potential for 100x ROI. DOGE investors look forward to DOGE's rise this quarter due to whale activity, yet Mantix takes centre stage with its solid ecosystem. Toncoin's (TON) Future Is Uncertain Following Telegram Crackdown TON investors faced new challenges due to Telegram's crackdown on illegal transactions on its platform. This recent activity met with a series of questions, yet TON investors expressed renewed hopes following the decision to shut down prominent black markets on the Telegram ecosystem. TON has declined over 9.3% within the last seven days due to the overall market volatility, yet experts believe that the recent developments on the Telegram platform could cause a price turnaround. However, TON investors have set their sights on new opportunities in the market like $MTX that could level up their portfolios. Mantix (MTX) Gives Investors A Chance To Level Up Their Portfolios! $MTX is one of the presale coins that ushers DOGE and TON investors into a new era through its distinctive trading platform.

While Wall Street Ponke has already shown that it has the legs and the technology to go much further, Solaxy showed promise. Why Solaxy is Losing Its Appeal Solaxy had its moment, and now it's over. Thanks to its solid branding and strong community support, it attracted early recognition. However, Solaxy appears to have reached a ceiling, similar to many other meme coins that came before it. Some investors are unsure about what will happen next because of a lack of new infrastructure and actual utility. The cryptocurrency market is changing quickly, and traders are fed up with holding tokens that don't change with the times. $WPONKE fills that gap by providing more than just momentum and memes. Enter Wall Street Ponke: A Smart Memecoin Built for the Future Wall Street Ponke ($WPONKE) isn't just another meme coin with a funny name. It's a layer-2-based decentralized platform integrating AI-powered tools to help traders navigate the often confusing world of cryptocurrency investing. Its goal? It's to bring trust, security, and insight to a space plagued by rug pulls, scams, and volatility. $WPONKE provides useful solutions in contrast to Dogecoin, which mostly depends on community settlement while preserving meme culture's lighthearted nature. Key Features That Make $WPONKE a Game-Changer AI Market Scanner $WPONKE uses an AI detector that scans the crypto landscape in real-time. It identifies potential scams, audits token contracts, and highlights suspicious liquidity behavior. This gives users a serious edge, helping them avoid bad actors before it's too late. E-learning Platform The $WPONKE project includes an educational hub where beginners and seasoned traders can access tutorials, market updates, and smart trading strategies. It's designed to empower users with the knowledge they need to make confident moves. High-Staking Rewards Staking with $WPONKE is safe and rewarding. With a 10% staking return, users can passively earn while supporting a token prioritizing long-term sustainability. Investor Protection Tools Through its smart AI systems and transparent infrastructure, $WPONKE identifies and flags exploitative developers and front-running attempts, adding an extra layer of protection for every transaction. Why Analysts Are Calling $WPONKE the 100x Memecoin of the Summer There is more to the buzz surrounding Wall Street Ponke than just noise. Given $WPONKE's potential for rapid development, prominent FLOKI holders and even some early SOLAXY holders have already begun reallocating their holdings. Early adopters are racing for their share before it is listed on mainstream exchanges, as the token price is still below one penny, and the presale has already raised over $310,000. Crypto experts view $WPONKE as the perfect storm of humor, utility, and innovation. In the current meme market, that is a rare mix of entertaining and essentially sound.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin in the past month alone has seen a 40% surge and analysts say the positive sentiment is pushing investors to spread their wings. Many of the Dogecoin investors who made a fortune from DOGE’s early days are looking to multiply their holdings. As a result, special emphasis is being placed on new Defi projects that combine innovative technology with robust tokenomics. These early investors in Dogecoin are now looking to Mantix , a sophisticated and deep liquidity DEX whose new token presale has raised over $600,000 and promises up to 50xreturns in the coming weeks. Let us find out more. Dogecoin's Resurgence and Market Outlook As SEC Delays DOGE ETF Decision The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed making a ruling on the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF proposal, extending the review period in order to decide on conformance with investor protection regulations. This news on May 20, 2025, affects the original May 21–22 filing deadlines for both the Dogecoin and XRP ETF proposals. Despite the delay, Dogecoin today trades at approximately $0.23 , up 2% over the past 24 hours. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that these delays are typical in the crypto ETF approval process because final approvals can take up to 240 days. The ETF is set to have its next review in June 2025, although it will probably be approved in early Q4 2025. Experts predict that Dogecoin can reach up to $0.34 by August 2025, a growth of a potential 48% from its current price positioning DOGE as a high prospect coin in 2025. Mantix: A Revolutionary DEX Trading Ecosystem For You Emerging as a force to be reckoned with in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, Mantix is a new Defi project that brings a revolutionary trading platform that beautifully blends artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. The hybrid infrastructure model of the system offers users unrestricted access to cross-chain trading, staking and liquidity provision, all held within a safe and open framework. In presale currently, Mantix has attracted significant attention, raising more than $600,000 so far. The cost of the MTX token is $0.02 , providing a low cost entry point for top ICO investors who want early exposure to a very promising asset. Like many top altcoins, the new Defi project features innovative tech such as AI-driven trading algorithms and a decentralized governance model that emphasize its aim for empowering users to earn maximally. Make the Most Out of Mantix Just like with Dogecoin’s early days, being an early adopter of the Mantix DEX and buying into its presale sets regular investors on the pathway to millionaire status. MTX token holders also enjoy revenue-sharing rewards and governance rights putting power where it truly belongs- in the hands of the community. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios and be a part of the next wave of crypto innovation are invited to join the Mantix presale. With its robust infrastructure and forward-thinking vision, Mantix is the new pioneer in the decentralized trading space.

The company, led by founder and CEO Norma Chu, exchanged 254,333 class A ordinary shares for BTC, in a transaction valued at roughly $2.28 million, according to a press release . The move positions DDC among a growing cohort of public companies using BTC as a treasury asset. Two more purchases totaling 79 BTC are expected in the coming days, bringing the company's initial holdings to 100 BTC. In a shareholder letter issued last week, Chu outlined plans to accumulate up to 500 BTC within six months and aim for 5,000 BTC in three years. While companies adopting bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset often see major price rises, DDC saw the opposite. The company’s shares dropped more than 12% on Friday’s trading session, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1%.

With the market driven by rampaging AI altcoins and rekindled ETF speculation for many top altcoins, the hunt for the best crypto to buy has never been more frantic. Investors who were fortunate to get Bitcoin at a discounted price after its pull back in April are once again scouring the horizon for the next 100x gem. This time top ICO investors see Mantix built on Ethereum with its $600,000 token presale as a potential 100x ERC20 cointhat is still flying under the radar of so many. Let us find out why. Bitcoin Wipes Out $300 Million In Positions Following EU Tariffs More than $300 million in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated in four hours as a sudden Bitcoin plunge was unleashed by new tariff threats from then U.S. President Donald Trump. As of today, BTC sits at a price of $108,210 and a market cap of $2.15 trillion and Bitcoin has gained 4.48% this week thanks in part to $3.06 billion entering U.S. spot ETFs and news of Morgan Stanley starting direct crypto trading. Analysts believe that a larger increase to $120,000 in Q3 2025 for Bitcoin might occur if support at $100,000 isn’t breached. But, should the price fall below $97,000, the demand for short selling might grow pushing Bitcoin toward $90,000. Ethereum set to break resistance and surge higher Ethereum has confirmed a trend change after months of consolidation, breaking out of its downtrend with a string of solid good bullish signals. The Supertrend indicator went green, Ethereum’s key demand area around $2,400 has held staunchly with ETH at $2,550 today and the downtrend line has been violated with strong buy volume behind the move. Top analysts predict that Ethereum prices can average $3,400 in Q3 2025, with some projecting highs of $4,000 if market sentiment aligns with growing institutional interest. As the second-largest crypto, Ethereum's rise is also lifting the fortunes of many ERC20 coinsbuilt on its chain, Mantix being one of them. Mantix Is new ERC20 DEX backed coin making waves in presale circles Mantix is rapidly gaining traction in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), setting itself up to be a threat to today’s DEX platforms. Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, Mantixenables users to trade, stake and participate in Perpetuals trading with up to 1000x leverage using its native $MTX token. One major thing that sets Mantix apart is that with elephant it has prioritized real-world utility and user focus. The platform's low fees, deep liquidity and capacity for cross-chain trading also make it accessible to a broad range of customers. This positions the Defi company as the next big avenue for investors who value growth; with MTX being touted as the best crypto to buy now over Ethereum and Bitcoin. Already in Phase 1 of the presale, Mantix has seen over $600,000 raised with $MTX tokens currently trading for a low price of $0.02. This early-stage investment opportunity is attracting experienced Bitcoin and Ethereum investors and retail traders looking for significant returns. Mantix tokenomics offers a model of revenue sharing in which holders get passive income without the need to provide liquidity directly.

With the market gaining strength, it looks like Solana can break past $200 owing to SOL’s growing role in Web3 and DeFi. Hyperliquid is likely to surge past $50 by the end of the year, according to experts, thanks to its fast-developing decentralized derivatives framework. Compared to Solana and Hyperliquid though, Mantix is just starting out in its presale stage and is already turning heads as an exciting cross-chain decentralized exchange. Over $600,000 has been raised and promises of large liquidity, low costs and superior trading tools means Mantix is fast becoming a standout 100x option for those looking for the best crypto to invest in for 2025. Solana price prediction: Can $SOL shake its volatility shadow? Solana saw its price rebound above $170, a 20% gain in the last month after a series of DeFi protocol adoption and NFT marketplace revivals. Analysts at Coincodex point to a potential leap above $200 for Solana if daily volumes remain at their current pace and macro sentiment remains positive. While Solana's speed and low fees remain an attraction, volatile swings spurs investor caution. Even with its volatility, Solana is one of the most closely watched tokens this cycle, drawing in traders looking for quick Layer-1 performance without the congestion of Ethereum. Hyperliquid moves in an upward direction as perpetuals pick up momentum Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual exchange, has seen a strong pick-up in user use quarter-on-quarter. HYPE, its native token, is up 95% month-on-month according to Coinmarketcap, capitalizing on the trend for leverage and synthetic trading pairs. Arthur Hayes, BitMEX co-founder and former CEO, made a striking prediction for Hyperliquid on X, stating it could surpass Solana’s price performance. Hayes believes HYPE could break into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, flipping SOL along the way. However, as competition intensifies for Hyperliquid, investors are also considering newer platforms that offer next-generation innovation and better incentives. Mantix: The new DEX with early-stage potential Stealing the headlines among the new platforms is Mantix, a decentralized cross-chain exchange with a feature-rich ecosystem powered by the $MTX token. Built on Ethereum as an ERC20 coin, Mantix boasts ultra-low fees, 1000x leverage and AI tools all on a completely open, community-governed system. Currently in Stage 1 of presale, $MTX is priced at only $0.02, with over $600,000 already raised. Additionally, Mantix offers revenue sharing to token holders, giving passive income on holdings without the need to provide liquidity directly. Its buyback-and-burn mechanism, executed in an instant, also provides long-term price stability by reducing token supply as volume increases. The Mantix network also includes staking, futures trading and simple cross-chain bridging and thus it is an end-to-end trading suite rather than another DeFi protocol. Compared to chains like Solana and Hyperliquid, Mantix stands out by offering not just a scalable network but also a very integrated reward system to its users. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025, Mantix offers early-stage exposure to a utility-rich platform ahead of the general market.

In a lengthy X post, Charlie claimed that the real issue has nothing to do with fraud, misconduct, or ethical failure. He said the attacks are coming from “a group of deeply disgruntled, now deranged, people” who have decided he’s a villain and will stop at nothing to ruin his name and his company, Input Output Global (IOG). Charlie argued that these people operate with the same political rage that Americans saw with Hillary Clinton and now-President Donald Trump. “Every event involving controversial public figures is viewed through a political lens and transformed into either a negative or positive spin,” he wrote. In Charles’ view, Cardano has no defense mechanism against what he described as “derangement syndrome,” which he said could “ultimately kill the ecosystem if left unchecked.” Hoskinson links criticism to growing online hatred Charlie said his haters will twist any Cardano success into a personal scam. If Midnight, Cardano’s privacy-focused sidechain, makes billions for ADA holders, they’ll call it an exit scam. If Leios, another protocol in the works, gets delivered, he claimed they’ll say it was someone else’s idea. “It will worsen yearly and eventually become complete fantasies and bizarre conspiracies,” he added. He also claimed the hate may one day lead to violence, saying some critics are so far gone they might try to physically harm him or IOG employees. “It saddens and disgusts me,” he wrote. “Something is causing this mental illness on a mass scale, and it destroys a lot of lives, especially the people afflicted.” Charlie said these people live in “a self-inflicted hell where nothing but negativity is present, spiraling faster each month— isolation and despair combined with a rot of the soul.” He ended his post saying he’ll keep going and invited readers to “consider how to cure this cancer together.” Allegations trace back to 2021 MIR transaction The storm around Charlie began weeks ago, after Masato Alexander, an NFT creator, alleged that Charlie used a “genesis key” during the Allegra hard fork in 2021 to rewrite the Cardano ledger and reroute a massive amount of ADA to staking and treasury pools. Masato pointed to a specific MIR (Move Instantaneous Rewards) transaction dated October 24, 2021, that moved 318 million ADA from reserves. The transfer, which was publicly visible on Cardanoscan, quickly became the focus of online speculation. Critics questioned why that volume of ADA was moved without a public explanation. The suspicion was that the action wasn’t authorized or transparent, and people began asking how Cardano handles dormant or unclaimed ADA tokens. The accusations picked up steam, leading to mounting pressure on Charlie and the Cardano Foundation to respond. Charlie first addressed the allegations on May 6, calling them “false and misleading.” He said the redemptions remained open for three years after that transaction. He also said that the whole redemption process stretched over seven years, giving original buyers plenty of time to claim their ADA. On May 18, Charlie returned to X to clarify his point again, saying: “IOG never gave itself 350 million unclaimed ADA. This is a lie. The vast majority was claimed, and the remaining was forfeited after seven years of waiting was donated to Intersect.” At the moment, the Cardano Foundation is working on an official audit report, which Charlie said will address the full timeline and provide clarity. But the report hasn’t been released, and until it lands, the noise around the issue isn’t going anywhere. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Despite the broader market’s bullish momentum, TRX is still trading nearly 66% below its early December peak. However, this lagging price action has not gone unnoticed—investors and analysts are increasingly watching Tron as a potential breakout candidate. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Above Key Prices – Data Points To $2,900 Level As Bullish Trigger As one of the top-performing Layer-1 blockchains over the past year, Tron’s fundamentals remain strong. The network continues to lead in stablecoin settlement volume and user activity, positioning it well for renewed upside if altcoins follow Bitcoin’s lead. Recent on-chain data from CryptoQuant adds to the optimism: the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta, which measures net buying or selling activity over the past 90 days, shows that TRX has re-entered a buying pressure zone. Historically, this signal has preceded bullish price movements, especially when combined with strong fundamentals and improving market sentiment. If buying pressure persists and price breaks above current resistance levels, Tron could stage a significant rally to catch up with the broader market. For now, all eyes are on whether this fresh demand can spark TRX’s next leg higher. Tron Holds Strong As Bullish Momentum Rebuilds Tron (TRX), one of the most resilient altcoins in recent years, continues to show strength despite a challenging environment for most non-Bitcoin assets. Since late 2022, TRX has followed a steady uptrend, defying broader market corrections and maintaining strong on-chain fundamentals. Now, the asset consolidates near critical technical levels, preparing for what could be its next leg upward. Although Bitcoin has clearly led the current cycle—hitting new all-time highs and attracting the majority of capital—many altcoins like Tron are still lagging. This divergence has led several analysts to question whether an altseason is still on the table. Most believe this is a Bitcoin-dominant cycle, especially given the inflow to BTC ETFs and macroeconomic uncertainty. However, hope remains for a rotation into altcoins. Supporting that optimism, CryptoQuant insights reveal that TRX has returned to a buying pressure zone. The Buy/Sell Pressure Delta shows a clear transition out of the selling pressure area. Demand is once again exceeding supply, favoring bulls. Importantly, TRX has not yet reached the historical thresholds that typically precede price tops. This suggests that there is still room for growth before caution sets in. If the broader market supports a rotation, Tron could emerge as a standout Layer-1 performer once again, especially as traders search for strong setups beyond Bitcoin.

Technical Analysis: Bulls Defend Higher Lows Above Support The daily chart for Tron shows that the asset is consolidating after a strong push toward the $0.28 resistance zone. Price action has maintained a clear bullish structure since early April, with higher lows forming consistently along the 34-day EMA ($0.26), which now acts as dynamic support. The 50, 100, and 200 SMAs are all trending upward and tightly aligned beneath the current price, signaling long-term bullish alignment. TRX remains in a short-term consolidation range between approximately $0.26 and $0.28. The price recently tested this upper boundary twice but failed to break through with strong momentum. However, support at $0.26 has held firmly, suggesting buyers are still in control.

On the downside, losing $0.26 would weaken this setup and likely trigger a drop toward the $0.2430 region, where the 100 SMA currently sits.

According to McCourt, the Ripple-affiliated digital asset stands out for its robust practical applications, setting it apart in an increasingly crowded crypto market. XRP Ledger’s High-Speed Performance McCourt highlighted that one of XRP’s most notable strengths lies in the impressive capacity of its underlying technology — the XRP Ledger. Designed for efficiency, the ledger is capable of handling up to 1,500 transactions per second, a performance level that reinforces its reputation as a reliable and scalable solution for cross-border payments and beyond. Vibrant Spot Market Activity Another point emphasized by McCourt is the significant trading volume XRP enjoys in the spot market. This high level of activity not only signals strong investor interest but also reflects the token’s established presence within the crypto trading ecosystem. Its liquidity and market depth make XRP an attractive asset for both institutional participants and individual traders alike. CME Group Expands Crypto Offerings with XRP Futures On May 19, CME Group took a major step forward by introducing XRP futures contracts, following the rollout of similar futures products for Solana (SOL) earlier this year. McCourt explained that these new offerings were developed in direct response to “well-articulated customer demand,” underscoring how client needs continue to shape the company’s evolving crypto product suite. Interestingly, McCourt pointed out that CME has launched both standard and micro versions of the XRP futures contracts simultaneously — a first for the derivatives powerhouse. This dual-approach release reflects the diverse needs of their customer base, which includes both institutional investors seeking large-scale exposure and retail traders looking for more flexible, bite-sized contracts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Maturing Market with Institutional-Grade Infrastructure During the interview, McCourt noted that the cryptocurrency space is undergoing rapid maturation. To support this evolution, CME Group is committed to providing the sophisticated infrastructure that market participants require, including transactional tools and mechanisms that mirror those available in traditional exchange-traded products (ETPs) and ETFs. Regulated Futures as Critical Market Infrastructure CME Group envisions its regulated XRP futures contracts as essential components within the broader ecosystem of exchange-traded products. By offering these futures, the Chicago-based derivatives giant aims to deliver the transparency, risk management tools, and regulatory oversight that are vital for fostering greater institutional involvement and market confidence. In sum, CME Group’s recent moves not only spotlight XRP’s compelling real-world applications but also highlight how the token’s expanding derivatives footprint is poised to play a crucial role in the next phase of crypto market development. With both strong technical foundations and deepening institutional infrastructure, XRP continues to cement its place as a major force in the digital asset space.

As the Sui network prepares for an on-chain governance decision, the Foundation revealed it will not take sides or vote, leaving the choice entirely to the community. Sui Validators Quickly Freeze Stolen Funds Right after the attack on the Cetus protocol resulted in the loss of $260 million worth of crypto assets, Sui validators acted fast to prevent further damage. They used a tool in the network to block certain wallet addresses, which helped freeze about $162 million that had been stolen. This fast response stopped the attacker from moving more funds off the network, although around $60 million had already been lost before the freeze took effect. Each validator used its settings to ignore transactions linked to the hacker. Notably, these measures are not permanent and can be turned on or off by each validator based on risk analysis or legal needs. Cetus Requests a Protocol Upgrade After the emergency freeze, Cetus asked the Sui community to approve a protocol upgrade. This upgrade would help return the frozen funds to users without changing the blockchain’s history or undoing past transactions. Validators and SUI token holders will participate in the upcoming vote. Cetus has agreed to accept whatever the community decides, noting that no single party should decide alone. Furthermore, Cetus revealed its team is working with security experts, analysis firm Inca Digital, and international law enforcement to track the hacker and recover the missing $60 million. As part of the recovery efforts, the team even offered the attacker a $6 million bounty in hopes of recovering the funds. Sui Foundation Stays Neutral The Sui Foundation has set clear conditions for its involvement. It will not vote on the upgrade and will not influence the decision in any way. Instead, it sees its role as a neutral party that helps somewhat guide the process. The Foundation also expects Cetus to commit publicly to using all available resources to repay affected users in full. This vote will be a major test of the Sui network’s governance model. It will show how a decentralized system can come together during a crisis and how its future may be shaped by its supporters.

With the token’s highly anticipated listing drawing closer, traders are scrambling to secure their positions before the next price increase kicks in. The goal? A simple, yet powerful calculation: turn $1,000 into $25,000 —a projected 25x return that’s generating serious interest across crypto forums and trading circles. But that window is closing fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale structure is designed for speed, scarcity, and early advantage. Once the next pricing tier activates—or worse, listings go live—the ability to enter at ground-floor valuation disappears. That’s why the urgency is peaking now. Why the Urgency? In the world of crypto, timing is everything. When an asset is about to break out, those who hesitate are often left watching from the sidelines as prices soar. MAGACOIN FINANCE is flashing all the classic signals of an imminent price shift: surging community interest, tightening supply, and social proof as new investors pile in. The message is clear—act now or risk missing out. Countdown to Opportunity Scarcity and urgency are proven psychological triggers that drive action. When buyers see a limited-time window—whether it’s a flash sale or a countdown to a price increase—they’re far more likely to move quickly. This effect is amplified with visible countdowns and urgent calls to action, turning passive interest into decisive action. The $1K to $25K Formula: Real ROI, Not Just Hype What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart in this crowded market is the clarity of its value proposition. The $1K to $25K example isn’t just a marketing slogan—it’s a direct, tangible return on investment that buyers can grasp instantly. In financial marketing, specificity matters. When you show a clear, achievable ROI, you tap into a powerful motivator: the dream of multiplying your money in a measurable way. Here’s how the math works. If you invest $1,000 and the price target of $25,000 is hit, that’s a 2,400% return. In crypto, such exponential gains are rare but not unheard of, especially when timed ahead of a major catalyst. This kind of concrete financial framing doesn’t just create excitement—it gives buyers a rational reason to act fast. Strong Calls to Action Drive Results Effective financial copywriting leverages urgency, specificity, and emotional triggers to drive conversions. The most successful calls to action are those that combine a clear benefit (“Turn $1K into $25K”) with a pressing reason to act now (“Only days left before the price moves!”). This approach doesn’t just inform; it compels. “A well-crafted financial copy can drive conversions and boost your bottom line. By clearly articulating the value and benefits of your offerings, you can overcome skepticism and hesitation.” What Happens Next? Once the price moves, the opportunity to buy at current levels is gone. Those who wait may find themselves priced out, forced to chase higher entry points or miss the run entirely. That’s why the final days before a major move are so critical—every minute counts. Take Action Now Don’t wait: The price window is closing fast. Act decisively: Secure your position before the breakout. Aim high: Join the buyers targeting $25K from just $1K. The next chapter of MAGACOIN FINANCE is about to be written. Will you be part of the story, or will you be watching from the sidelines? The choice—and the countdown—are yours. Buy now. The clock is ticking.

This optimism is fueled by significant developments, including the implementation of on-chain governance and substantial exchange outflows—approximately $1 billion worth of ADA, indicating strong accumulation trends. While ADA’s growth potential is notable, other tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and TRON (TRX), all priced under $0.50, are also gaining traction due to their unique market positions and community support. Investors seeking higher risk-reward opportunities might also consider emerging DeFi projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.1 million with over 11,000 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. Cardano Price Forecast: ADA Aims for a Breakout in 2025 Cardano (ADA) is steadily gaining traction in the cryptocurrency space, selling at around $0.74 today, with analysts predicting it will reach between $1.88 and a bull target of $2.36 by 2025. This optimism arises because Cardano’s ADA is about to receive ADA ETFs in 2025. On-chain statistics also show nearly $1 billion of ADA withdrawn from exchanges, showing sound accumulation and investor confidence. While ADA’s fundamentals are robust, traders looking for explosive gains are also targeting newer altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for even more aggressive potential upside. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by integrating both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Through the P2C model, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT in pools of liquidity under the protection of smart contracts, getting passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow cash easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen since lenders and borrowers can exchange directly. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Mutuum Finance is rapidly generating buzz in the DeFi community with its game-changing lending solutions. Despite being in presale, it has already surpassed more than $9.1 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,000 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle, projections see the leap over $2. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives The early users of Mutuum Finance all get to enjoy tantalizing benefits, including a $100,000 prize draw where 10 people will be awarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Community growth is also facilitated by a referral system that rewards clients for bringing in new investors. Early backers also get VIP privileges when it comes to information about the platform. All these benefits not only spur early adoption but also ensure long-term stickiness among token holders. MUTM is proving its value early, with over $9.1 million raised, 11,000+ investors, and an innovative dual-lending DeFi model. As Phase 5 nears its close and a 16.67% price increase approaches, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as one of 2025’s most promising altcoin plays.

On one hand, Pepeto is banking on hype, culture and usability; on the other hand, Solaxy’s novel strategy is writing the script for the next generation of blockchain architecture. PEPETO: Meme Culture Meets Usability Pepeto has caught investor attention with its strong branding and a zero-fee decentralized exchange called PepetoSwap. Its frictionless nature appeals to meme coin traders and decentralized finance users. Combined with high-stakes rewards, Pepeto is building more than just meme value. The long-term holders who are pro-hunting passive income through token staking couldn’t have done better with its current annual percentage yield of 350%. The bridge technology, which facilitates easy token swaps between varied blockchains, also appeals to investors. That addresses the ongoing cross-chain liquidity problem throughout the crypto space. Viral branding surrounding the token exploits meme culture, specifically frogs online and, more recently, Elon Musk’s activity on social media. With a presale of over $5.2 million, Pepeto ’s demand continues to grow steadily. Currently, the low entry price of $0.000000107 is fueling relentless retail interest. SOLAXY: Infrastructure With Long-Term Potential Solaxy enters the scene uniquely positioned as a Layer-2 protocol built directly on Solana. Using a proprietary model, Royal Technology, the aim is to increase transaction scalability. This model batches transactions off-chain and confirms them on-chain. Although primarily built for developers, Solaxy’s infrastructure could support a new generation of decentralized applications. The testnet bridge has already been launched and partners with Hyperlane to validate validator integration. Yet, it does not offer yield incentives, which may not attract the short-term shallow investors. Despite this, Solaxy continues to build steadily, attracting those who prioritize blockchain innovation over short-term price action. With a foundation in scalability and technical reliability, the team is set up for strong growth in the future. Utility-driven projects like Solaxy may see increased relevance as the crypto market matures. Pepeto and Solaxy approach the market with different tactics, but share one goal—positioning themselves for long-term impact. Pepeto capitalizes on viral momentum and community-driven features, while Solaxy prioritizes infrastructure to support scalable blockchain solutions.

33767162,[object Object],1748116806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"The Stars Align: Crypto Analyst Predicts 1,700% Rally For XRP In 2 Months",https://bitcoinist.com/700-rally-for-xrp-in-2-months/,"A crypto analyst has predicted that the XRP price could increase by a staggering 1,700% over the next two months. If accurate, this explosive move could catapult the altcoin well above its current all-time high of $3.84 , marking a historical moment and reigniting investor excitement amidst the volatile market. XRP To Replay 2017 Explosive Rally To $27 Egrag Crypto, a prominent crypto analyst, has presented a striking forecast for the XRP price in an analysis on X (formerly Twitter). According to the post, the token could be on the verge of replicating one of its most legendary historical price surges , with the potential to rise by 1,700% over the next two months. At the heart of this bullish price prediction is a comparative study of XRP’s meteoric rally in 2017 , when the altcoin surged by over 1,772.13% in just 63 days beginning from October 30. Egrag Crypto has overlaid this historical surge with current market behavior, and according to the analysis, the altcoin is showing uncanny similarities to its 2017 bullish setup and could end up completely repeating this pattern. The analyst’s chart features an expansive Fibonacci circle framework, with concentric arcs possibly representing future zones of resistance and support. Within this macro pattern, XRP is forming a triangular consolidation, just like it did in its previous ATH breakout . The chart identifies July 21, 2025, as a potential cycle top for XRP, placing the altcoin within a similar 63-day window that previously preceded its rally to all-time highs. If history repeats , it could be poised for an explosive rally, targeting the $28 level—a price that extends far beyond former ATHs. Major Fibonacci levels have also been marked on the chart. A breakout of the 1.0 Fib around $3.35 is seen as a gateway for exponential growth, with additional targets placed at $8.489 (1.272 Fib), $13.79 (1.414 Fib), and an eventual moonshot toward $27.68 based on the 1.618 extension. Zooming In: Key Resistance And Support Levels To Watch While the macro view of Egrag Crypto’s XRP price chart showcases a stage for a grand rally, zoomed in, the chart shows that the altcoin is currently consolidating within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern. The chart also shows that the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) , situated near the $2.3 price level, is acting as a vital support area and last line of defense for the token. The analyst has indicated that holding above this line is critical to XRP maintaining bullish momentum . From a resistance standpoint, the analysis highlights $2.7 as the first major threshold to overcome, coinciding with the 1.414 Fib. A close above this level would be a clear breakout signal that could trigger a rally toward the $3.00 – $3.35 zone. Additionally, surpassing this region would potentially mark the start of the projected parabolic run to a cycle top in July. Notably, XRP won’t be the only cryptocurrency potentially experiencing a bull rally during the 63-day timeframe. Egrag Crypto suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market could also enter a new phase of bullish expansion around the same period.",XRP|Altcoin|bitcoin|btc|Egrag Crypto|EMA|Exponential Moving Average|Fibonacci Levels|Symmetrical Triangle|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-24 20:00:06

One prominent XRP-focused commentator has suggested that a key factor, token velocity, could explain the asset’s lagging price movement. While leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have delivered significant returns over the past month, XRP’s growth has been notably slower. Bitcoin has gained approximately 17%, climbing above the $110,000 mark. Ethereum has seen an even steeper increase, rising nearly 50% to approach $2,700. In comparison, XRP has only recorded a 9% uptick and remains confined to the lower $2 range. Although any upward movement can be viewed positively, some XRP holders have become frustrated with the asset’s limited progress, especially after the sharp price surge seen between November 2024 and January 2025. Analyst Attributes XRP’s Price Stagnation to Token Velocity According to the operator of the “ All Things XRP ” account on X, a potential reason behind the subdued price performance lies in XRP’s high token velocity. The analyst believes that many investors are unfamiliar with the concept and how it affects the token’s market behavior. 74.1% OF XRP INVESTORS DON'T KNOW WHAT ""TOKEN VELOCITY"" IS. And it could be the real reason XRP struggles to moon. If you hold XRP, you NEED to understand this. Here’s the breakdown. pic.twitter.com/3wcgJv0tRJ — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 27, 2025 Token velocity is an economic metric that measures how frequently a digital asset changes hands over a specific period. It is typically calculated by dividing the total transaction volume by the circulating supply. A high velocity suggests that the asset is actively traded, while a lower value indicates that holders are more inclined to retain it. The analyst argues that a higher velocity exerts downward pressure on price because it implies frequent selling activity. When more holders are willing to retain their tokens rather than trade them, supply becomes constrained, which can support upward price movement. XRP’s Function in the Payments Sector Fuels High Velocity XRP’s design contributes directly to its high velocity. Built for speed and cost-efficiency, the XRP Ledger was intended to facilitate fast transactions, especially within cross-border payments . Many institutions using Ripple’s solutions, such as banks and remittance providers, typically purchase XRP to process transactions and then sell it shortly after. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This transactional behaviour differs from Bitcoin, which is often viewed as a long-term investment, or Ethereum, which benefits from staking and decentralized finance activity that encourages holding. By contrast, XRP’s use in rapid payment settlements keeps it in continuous circulation. Adding to this dynamic are periodic token releases from Ripple’s escrow, which further increase the circulating supply and sustain high transaction volumes. Exploring Strategies to Reduce Velocity and Drive Value To address this challenge, the analyst proposed several ideas aimed at decreasing token velocity and encouraging longer-term holding. One approach involves implementing staking rewards on the XRP Ledger . This would provide holders with incentives to lock up their tokens, reducing market supply and potentially supporting price increases. The analyst emphasized, however, that staking alone may not be sufficient. He pointed to the tokenization of real-world assets, such as property, commodities, and private equity, as a more impactful development. By using XRP in tokenization processes that require extended holding periods, velocity could be reduced, thereby enhancing scarcity and potentially driving price appreciation. He also cautioned against the assumption that XRP’s role in payments alone will significantly increase its value. While the asset performs well in transaction processing, he argued that broader adoption through tokenization would provide a more sustainable and scalable source of demand.

Chicago Fed leader Austan Goolsbee warns in a new interview with CNBC that Trump’s policy choices could also lead to an unfavorable economic environment known as stagflation, which is dominated by stagnant economic growth, high inflation and high unemployment. “In the short run, we have to just wait for the dust to come out of the air… Everything’s always on the table, but I feel like the bar, for me, is a little higher for action in any direction while we’re waiting to get some clarity. And then, over the longer run, if they’re putting in place tariffs that have a stagflationary impact, which is to say a slowed-down output by raising the cost of production, while also raising prices, then that’s the central bank’s worst situation.” Goolsbee says the Chicago Fed has been in conversations with business owners in their districts who say they’re hoping for policy consistency. “The CEO of a construction company said, for them, they’re now in a put-your-pencils-down moment where they just have to wait. If every week or every month or every day, there’s going to be a new major announcement, they just can’t take action until some of those things are resolved.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Jacob Irwin-Cline, 30, says he was drugged by a fake Uber driver in the early hours of May 9, who allegedly used coercive tactics and a spiked cigarette to steal access to Irwin-Cline’s crypto holdings. In the process, the victim was drained of a staggering $123,000 from his digital wallets. Drugged, Injured, and Robbed According to a report by MyLondon, the Portland native had stepped out for drinks at The Roxy nightclub in Soho and planned to return to his Bayswater hostel shortly after 1:30 AM. But after calling a legitimate Uber through the app, a man resembling the driver’s profile pulled up in a different vehicle, a dark sedan rather than the listed Toyota Prius. Lured by familiarity, Irwin-Cline accepted a cigarette from the driver, which he believes was laced with scopolamine, a drug known to render victims pliable and amnesic. What followed was a blur: Irwin-Cline recalled that he intermittently lost consciousness, during which he said to had handed over passcodes, and vaguely navigated through his apps before being ejected from the vehicle. He also said that the driver struck him during the abrupt escape. The attacker reportedly exploited Irwin-Cline’s Revolut app to access multiple crypto wallets and extracted roughly $72,000 in XRP, $50,000 in Bitcoin, and smaller altcoin amounts. The victim’s phone and laptop were both compromised – his laptop was remotely wiped, and his phone was stolen. Despite a desperate scramble to recover his accounts, aided by a flatmate back in the US, the digital assets were gone within hours. He said he was left barely able to walk and emotionally devastated. While he does not believe he was deliberately targeted, the attack mirrors rising cases across Europe involving so-called “wrench attacks,” where physical coercion is used to force crypto access. The Metropolitan Police and FBI cybercrime team are now investigating, but Irwin-Cline fears the odds of recovery are slim. Physical Attacks Escalate As the industry gains wider acceptance and popularity, there has been a worrying increase in physical assaults targeting individuals holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Earlier this month, a failed kidnapping attempt in Paris targeted the daughter and grandson of a prominent crypto executive. Masked attackers ambushed the family during a school drop-off but fled after the couple resisted, with one attacker’s gun later revealed to be a replica. The incident, caught on camera, adds to a string of violent crypto-related crimes in France. Victims were confirmed to be relatives of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. Previous attacks include a kidnapped crypto millionaire’s father and a ransom assault on Ledger’s co-founder, both involving mutilation.

The statement comes as the token continues to trade within a narrow range despite broader market momentum. The commentator, known as BarriC, has developed a reputation for making bold predictions about XRP’s future. He has consistently argued that the token is capable of reaching price levels many consider unrealistic, including valuations between $10 and $1,000. His most recent remarks appear to address critics who believe such projections are implausible. $XRP has skyrocketed from $0.006 to $3 + in 2017-2018 That’s over 500x To make the assumption that #XRP could NEVER do another 500x at any point in the future To push this narrative that in the entirety of $XRP future in crypto, that it could never see any positive price… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) April 26, 2025 Skepticism Remains High Despite XRP’s Historical Gains BarriC’s comments come during continued market hesitation around XRP. Since reaching a peak of approximately $3.40 in January 2025, the asset has failed to maintain upward momentum, now fluctuating around the $2 mark for several months. This prolonged consolidation has led to growing doubts among investors, particularly as other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have reached new all-time highs. Despite this, BarriC maintains that doubting XRP’s potential is short-sighted. He points to XRP’s historic surge during the 2017 bull market, when the asset rose from roughly $0.006 to over $3, an increase of more than 500 times. He argues that this historical precedent supports the possibility of another substantial rally in the future, even if the timeline remains uncertain. According to BarriC, those dismissing XRP’s long-term outlook often ignore the asset’s fundamental strengths and past performance. He suggests that the same disbelief seen during Bitcoin’s early days is now being directed at XRP, and those who remain skeptical could find themselves excluded from future gains. Comparisons to Bitcoin’s Growth Trajectory BarriC has drawn parallels between XRP’s current situation and Bitcoin’s historical path. He highlights how Bitcoin was once written off when it traded for less than $1, only to reach heights above $110,000 years later. He believes XRP has similar potential and that past underperformance should not be used to dismiss future growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Critics, however, counter this narrative by pointing to XRP’s stagnant price over the past few years and its struggle to surpass its 2018 all-time high. Some argue that XRP’s larger circulating supply and different utility model present structural limitations that could prevent it from achieving extreme valuations. Diverging Views on Long-Term Price Targets BarriC is not alone in his optimism, although timelines for high-value targets vary among analysts. Changelly forecasts that XRP could reach $100 by August 2034 and potentially hit $1,000 by June 2040. Meanwhile, Telegaon projects a $100 valuation sometime between 2035 and 2040 but offers no estimate for reaching $1,000. Still, BarriC remains steadfast in his view that price levels from $10 to $1,000 are not only possible but inevitable over time. He contends that those who continue to spread doubt, what he categorizes as “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD), will be the ones who ultimately miss out if the token reaches the ambitious benchmarks he envisions.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence. Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026. In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026 ,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027. Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: Bitwise Despite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns. Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profit The bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocation In addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack. Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios. In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion. The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply. In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC. The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.

With Solana and SUI also showing strength, the market is witnessing a rotation into both established and early-stage opportunities—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge for presale growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Presale, 50% Bonus, and 35x+ ROI JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate the presale landscape, with Stage 8 live and over $8 million raised, as each phase sells out faster than the last. Early buyers can now secure a 50% bonus on token purchases using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code, making MAGA even more attractive for those seeking transformative gains. Analysts are forecasting more than 35x ROI, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum holds. With its scarcity-driven supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the clear breakout presale of 2025 . Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Structure and Institutional Adoption Ethereum is trading at $2,560, with technical indicators pointing to further upside as it tests resistance near $2,700. Analysts predict a possible move toward $2,900 if bullish sentiment holds, citing strong institutional interest and ongoing Layer 2 growth as key drivers. While ETH remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the preferred choice for those seeking higher-multiple early-stage returns. Solana (SOL): Consolidation and Future Upside Solana is consolidating between $158 and $175, with analysts expecting a breakout above $175 to retest $183. SOL’s fundamentals remain strong, supported by high transaction speeds and robust DeFi activity. Forecasts suggest SOL could revisit the $240–$260 range later in the year, but its growth is more gradual compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which stands out as the top pick for outsized gains . SUI: Ecosystem Growth and Price Momentum SUI is trading near $2.17, with recent developments and growing ecosystem activity driving interest. Analysts highlight SUI’s scalable architecture and developer traction, but its upside is less dramatic than the presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. For investors targeting the next big breakout, MAGA remains the clear leader for high-growth early-stage returns. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Ethereum’s climb to $2,560 and Solana’s technical strength are impressive, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a $0.007 listing target, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The watch market is stepping into the Web3 ecosystem with a Solana-inspired, limited-edition series of watches that contain an embedded unique QR code to directly link to the user’s Solana address. The company’s Solana-inspired watch collection is limited to 1,111 units that will set buyers back 20,000 Swiss francs (around $24,300). While the watches feature a unique design that could appeal to Solana ecosystem participants, their launch comes at a time when, unfortunately, flaunting crypto-related wealth is becoming risky. The cryptocurrency industry has seen dozens of physical attacks just this year, with a notable case seeing the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of crypto platform Paymium, being targeted in a daytime attempted kidnapping. The attack was filmed and shared on social media. While that kidnapping attempt failed, an earlier one in the same city saw the father of a crypto millionaire get abducted. Police managed to rescue the man, but not before his finger was severed. Earlier this year, the co-founder of hardware wallet maker Ledger, David Balland, along with his wife, was abducted from his home and saw similar treatment. The couple was later rescued by authorities, and a ransom that had been paid out was seized. There have been many other similar attacks in recent months. Franck Muller is pitching the collection as a ""phygital"" (physical-digital) symbol of identity and ownership in the crypto age. While the watch is certainly a piece of crypto mythos, it may be a collectible that investors may not want to show off.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that prosecutors failed to prove Eisenberg made false representations to the platform. He also moved to acquit Eisenberg of wire fraud charges. The investor manipulated the price of Mango’s native token MNGO with massive trades by more than 1,000% in 20 minutes before getting the protocol to allow him to borrow and withdraw $110 million in various cryptocurrencies, backed by the inflated collateral. Eisenberg’s defense argued that the platform, which operated through smart contracts, allowed anyone to transact freely and that he simply exploited a vulnerability. The judge agreed, stating that Mango’s permissionless structure meant that there “was insufficient evidence of falsity” from prosecutors regarding Eisenberg’s representation to Mango Markets. Eisenberg was arrested in December 2022, and while this case collapsed, he is still currently serving a four-year sentence handed out after he pleaded guilty to the possession of child sexual abuse material. “From the beginning, we said this case was fatally flawed,” his attorney Brian Klein of Waymaker LLP said. “We are very pleased for Avi that the judge granted our motion and dismissed the case.”",Finance|Mango Markets|Avi eisenberg|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-24 20:35:19

No private keys, login credentials, or accesses to Coinbase Prime accounts were compromised during the leak, according to the exchange.

New documents show the Fed purchased $8.8 billion in 30-year bonds on May 8th via its System Open Market Account (SOMA) – a move that followed a $34.8 billion purchase earlier that same week. The move has triggered allegations that “stealth QE” has arrived, with a MarketWatch Op-Ed by Charlie Garcia calling the move “monetary policy on tiptoes.” The Fed has long stated such purchases are routine reinvestments of maturing securities to adjust the money supply and influence interest rates to meet its targets. The Fed’s buying spree follows a major Treasury sell-off from China. New numbers from the Treasury Department show China sold $18.9 billion in US bonds in March, while most other countries increased their holdings. China now holds $765.4 billion in US Treasuries and is in third place behind the UK and Japan, which hold $779 billion and $1.13 trillion, respectively.

Bitcoin Reaches New High, Then Falls Bitcoin recently touched a new all-time high of $111,000 before slipping to $108,000. This drop is partly caused by market worries about a 50% tax increase on imports from the EU. Ethereum also rose to $2,700 this week but is now back to over $2,500, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total crypto market is now worth $3.42 trillion, which is higher than last week’s $3.29 trillion. This means more people are investing in crypto, even though NFT sales are slightly lower.

Say hello to Ruvi AI, a cutting-edge platform that merges blockchain security with the intelligence of AI to tackle complex problems in today’s industries. Ruvi AI Redefines Blockchain Innovation Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,724.68 and has just released its Pectra upgrade which improves native staking for institutions. This makes the network more attractive for big players by simplifying infrastructure, increasing security and making staking and withdrawals more efficient. While Ethereum is strengthening its position as a blockchain leader another project is gaining traction in the blockchain and AI space. Say hello to Ruvi AI, a platform that combines blockchain security with AI to solve complex problems in today’s industries. Ruvi AI Redefines Blockchain Innovation Ruvi AI is going to disrupt healthcare, finance and logistics by combining the best of AI analytics with blockchain transparency. The goal is to create tools that make better decisions, simplify operations and drive real world impact. The Beta is live and users can access advanced tools for business workflows. Ruvi AI is listing on its first exchange and more to come. This means the platform is serious about getting its solutions out there and establishing itself in the tech world. Presale Success Means Confidence Ruvi AI has already captured the attention of early adopters through its presale. The Phase 1 presale was $0.01 per token and sold out in 2 weeks. Investors who got in early have already seen their token value increase by 50% as the price has risen to $0.015 in Phase 2. Analysts are bullish on Ruvi AI’s long term and many are projecting a $1 token soon after listing. This is a strong sign of confidence in Ruvi AI’s approach. Investment Opportunities Ruvi AI is offering presale bonuses for investors. Here’s what’s on offer: VIP 2 50,000 tokens during presale gets a 40% bonus and adds 20,000 tokens to total 70,000 tokens. This is a $750 investment at $0.015 per token. At listing price of $0.07 the investment would be worth $4,900 and if Ruvi AI reaches $1 per token the value would be $70,000. VIP 3 100,000 tokens gets a 60% bonus and adds 160,000 tokens. A $1,500 investment would be worth $11,200 at listing price of $0.07 and $160,000 if the token hits $1. VIP 5 500,000 tokens gets a 100% bonus and doubles to 1,000,000 tokens. At listing price of $0.07 this is $70,000 and at $1 per token it would be $1,000,000. Building a Community Ruvi AI’s roadmap is not just about technology; it’s about building a community of supporters and contributors. Through a leaderboard program the project rewards engagement: Top 10 contributors get 500,000 tokens each which would be worth $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens which would be worth $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens which would be worth $100,000 at $1. This encourages active participation and a collaborative ecosystem that benefits all. What’s Next Ruvi AI’s achievements so far show just how much it can shake up the intersection of blockchain and AI. That’s clear from its live Beta platform, its successful presale-and where it’s headed with those upcoming exchange listings. That makes it a project to watch in the tech innovation space. Right now, at $0.015, Ruvi AI is offering early supporters a pretty compelling reason to get in on the ground floor. With a confirmed listing price of $0.07 and the potential to reach $1 per token, the potential for growth is huge. Ethereum leads the way in blockchain advancements with updates like Pectra but Ruvi AI is showing how blockchain and AI can work together to create solutions that are both scalable and efficient.

While the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached a new all-time high, LTC failed to capitalize on the injection of bullish momentum into the crypto market. However, a prominent crypto expert has come forward with a claim that Litecoin might be the most undervalued asset in the market at the moment. Interestingly, the altcoin’s price seems set to enjoy a period of strong bullish impetus over the next few months. Here’s Why LTC Price Could Be Set For An Extended Rally Chartered Market Technician Tony Severino has put forward an exciting prediction for the price trajectory of Litecoin in the coming months. According to the crypto expert, the digital asset could be preparing for an extended bull rally of at least 1,000% — and up to 2,000% — price growth. Related Reading: Traders Pile In: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits All-Time High As Price Nears $112K This bullish projection is based on the movement of the Stochastic Oscillator on the 3-month LTC price chart. The Stochastic Oscillator is an indicator used in technical analysis to gauge price momentum and pinpoint potential trend reversals. The indicator is usually represented by two lines: %K and %D. %K is a faster line while %D is a smoothed moving average of %K, and they both oscillate between 0 and 100. When the Stochastic Oscillator falls below 20, it implies an oversold market; while values above 80 often indicate an overbought market. According to Severino, the Litecoin 3-month Stochastic is approaching the 50 mark, which signals rising bullish sentiment for the altcoin’s price. The indicator failed the last time it attempted to cross this level in 2021. However, the successful breach of this 50 mark is still historically significant, as it has marked the start of substantial bull rallies in the past. For instance, the altcoin’s price grew by 4,900% when the Litecoin Stochastic crossed the level in 2017. Severino noted that it is highly unlikely for the price of Litecoin to surge by nearly 5,000% from its current level if the Stochastic Oscillator crosses the 50 level. Nevertheless, the market expert believes the asset’s price could rise by at least 1,000% and up to 2,000% by the end of 2026. Finally, Severino mentioned that the Litecoin price is in an interesting place, with the asset being one of the most undervalued crypto assets at the moment.

The event was held for holders of his meme coin, who collectively spent $148 million just to attend. Guests were promised access, luxury, and a moment with Trump. What they got instead was bad food, weak security, and a brief fly-by appearance from the president himself. According to CNBC , it was a night that left many attendees frustrated — and some outright angry. Among the 220 people who showed up were crypto figures like Sandy Carter from Unstoppable Domains and former NBA star Lamar Odom, who used the occasion to promote his own token, $ODOM. Trump showed up, said a few words, and left in a helicopter without greeting most of the room. One guest, 25-year-old Nicholas Pinto, said , “He didn’t talk to any of the 220 guests — maybe the top 25.” Pinto added that he had nothing to drink besides Trump-branded wine or water. “I don’t drink, so I had water. My glass was only filled once,” he said. As for the food? “The food sucked,” he said plainly. Guests ignored, wallets tracked, and complaints everywhere The top 25 wallets were promised a special reception and tour. But others like Pinto — who was driven there in a Lamborghini by his dad — left unimpressed and hungry. Trump only stayed 23 minutes, gave a quick speech recycling old crypto lines, then flew off without taking pictures or answering any questions. Pinto noticed that phones were not locked in RFID pouches and said security became an afterthought once Trump was gone. “Once Trump left, they didn’t really worry about anything else,” he said. Inside the ballroom, guests flaunted money. “Richard Mille watches weren’t even rare,” Pinto said. “I saw at least 16 people wearing them.” But he said the energy was off. “Lots of people didn’t even hold the coin anymore. They were checking their phones during dinner to see if the price moved.” Outside the gates, about 100 protesters gathered. One of them was Senator Jeff Merkley, who showed up to support a new bill with Chuck Schumer. The bill — called the End Crypto Corruption Act — aims to stop presidents and high officials from profiting off crypto ventures while in office. Protesters held signs saying “Crypto Corruption” and “Trump is a traitor.” Inside the event, the #1 holder of the $TRUMP coin was Justin Sun, the Chinese-born crypto billionaire. Justin holds over $22 million in the $TRUMP token and $75 million in World Liberty Financial’s token. He’s currently facing SEC fraud charges, although the case has been paused. Justin didn’t seem worried though. “As the top holder of $TRUMP and proud supporter of President Trump, it was an honor to attend the Trump Gala Dinner,” he posted. “Thank you @POTUS for your unwavering support of our industry!” The chaos around the dinner added fuel to what’s becoming a mess on Capitol Hill. Representative French Hill, a Republican from Arkansas, said the Trump family’s involvement in meme coins is “making his work in Congress harder.” Hill is one of the lawmakers behind the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to finally regulate stablecoins. But now, with Trump’s name tied to controversial tokens, he says the gala was “a distraction from the good work we need to do.” The GENIUS Act now faces a serious risk. Senator Josh Hawley added a clause that would limit credit card late fees, which banks hate. It’s now being called a poison pill that could kill support for the whole thing. While the gala was happening, Senate Democrats said they would push for new rules blocking US presidents and top officials from profiting off crypto — a direct challenge to USD1, a stablecoin linked to Trump and launched this spring. If the bill collapses, the damage could go global. JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citi are reportedly in early discussions about building a US digital dollar. Their plan is to compete with Tether, which now dominates 60% of global crypto transactions. But those banks are waiting for legal clarity. If the GENIUS Act doesn’t pass, the US could lose momentum in the international crypto race.

Data from leading European alternative asset manager CoinShares revealed that inflows into Ethereum hit $205 million, marking a major increase from the previously reported $1.5 million. James Butterfill, a researcher at CoinShares , explained that the new development might be directly tied to Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade and the recent appointment of a new co-executive director as part of its leadership reshuffling process. “Ethereum was the standout performer, with US$205m in inflows last week and $575 million YTD, indicating renewed investor optimism following the successful Pectra upgrade and the appointment of new co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak,” The researcher wrote. Meanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency market saw inflows hit a staggering $785 million the previous week. The new metric, significantly topping outflows recorded earlier in the year, particularly between February and March, suggests that the market has been recovering steadily. Notably, year-to-date cryptocurrency inflows (YTD) have hit an impressive total of $7.5 billion. Despite the new figures marking a drop from last week’s total inflow of $882 million, the United States remarkably outperformed Hong Kong and Germany, which saw inflows totaling $24.2 million and $86.2 million, respectively. Acknowledging the mild decline in Bitcoin inflows recorded in the last week, CoinShare’s James Butterfill made the following assertion in the report: “Bitcoin attracted $557 million in inflows, a decrease from the prior week, likely due to continued hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Short-bitcoin products saw a fourth consecutive week of inflows, totaling $5.8 million, reflecting investor positioning amid recent price gains.” With last week’s development reflecting five consecutive weeks of positive inflows, it remains to be seen how much the positive sentiment can grow and how much the current trend could influence price action for Bitcoin and altcoins alike.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-24 21:04:41

However, according to the analyst, a key signal that a bearish formation is in play could be if the 21 exponential moving average (EMA) experiences a bearish cross with the 33 Simple moving average (SMA) on the weekly chart. “The top was in, and we’re heading into a bear market. Many will still believe we’re advancing, but that cross signals a major trend shift.” He asserted. Taking a step further, the analyst outlined key historical trends validating a potential bearish outcome for the altcoin. In May 2018 and November 2021, the crosses mentioned above were observed on the XRP chart, after which an 87% and 72% drop in price value was recorded. If the average cross movement is considered, the analyst sees the next major drop sending XRP down by 79.5% from the bearish cross point. Conversely, the analyst highlighted other bullish possibilities, stating that the aforementioned bullish patterns displayed in XRP’s technical chart could trigger another price rally for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This anticipated bull run could send XRP way ahead of its $3.84 all-time high and instead place the asset at a never-before-seen price value of $27 . “Based on these bullish signals, I believe XRP could see another major pump—similar to the 1600% move—this time pushing us toward around $27 from the current level.” The analyst wrote. Despite recording a 5% decline in price value over the last week, XRP has managed to sustain momentum above $2.

With Ethereum and Avalanche also showing positive momentum amid recent news, the crypto market is heating up and Solana has hit $176, reflecting renewed confidence and setting the stage for a breakout summer—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout presale of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Explosive Presale, 50% Bonus, and 9,800% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate early-stage watchlists, with Stage 8 live and record buy volume as investors rush to secure positions before listings. The project’s scarcity-driven model, capped supply, and HashEx-audited contracts provide a secure foundation for growth. Analysts are forecasting up to 9,800% upside, with on-chain data showing skyrocketing wallet activity and repeat buyers signaling strong conviction in the project’s long-term trajectory. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the clear standout for early-stage returns . Early participants can now use the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus on token purchases, making MAGA even more attractive for those targeting transformative gains. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum and Technical Strength Solana has surged from $100 to $176 since April, with technical indicators like RSI and MACD signaling sustained momentum and possible further gains. Analysts predict a potential move toward $200–$210 if bullish sentiment holds, especially as network activity and DeFi TVL continue to rise. Even with this strong performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers higher-multiple upside for early investors. Ethereum (ETH): Surge in Capital Inflows and Price Momentum Ethereum recently saw a dramatic 8.2% price surge in 24 hours, reaching $3,850 as trading volume spiked by 35% to $18.5 billion. This influx is attributed to institutional interest and a broader risk-on sentiment in tech markets, with ETH now testing resistance at $3,900. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, its near-term upside is steady compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Avalanche (AVAX): Ecosystem Growth and Price Outlook CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Avalanche is trading around $24–$25, with bullish patterns and strong DeFi activity hinting at continued growth. Analysts see AVAX potentially reaching $30–$56 in a bullish scenario, but its trajectory is steadier than the presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which stands out as the top pick for outsized returns . Conclusion Solana’s rise to $176 and the surge in Ethereum and Avalanche are impressive, but the real excitement is in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 9,800% upside forecast, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

The first batch of brain chips is expected to arrive in late 2025. The company, incorporated in 2019, published its first blog post about the new brain chip, positioning itself as a new competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Starfish stated that the custom electrophysiology chip will interact with multiple brain regions simultaneously. This means that the chip will read and write to connected parts of the brain, making it possible to help people with neurological disorders. Starfish is making a miniaturized brain chip Most existing brain chips are fairly bulky. Each side usually measures more than 5 mm (about the width of two stacked pennies) and may reach 10 mm or more per side. In addition, such chips consume a high power of 10s of milliwatts (mW). Starfish stated that the upcoming brain chip will be miniaturized, making it much smaller than expected. The chip will have physically small dimensions of 2 x 4 millimeter (mm) and a 0.3 mm-pitch Ball Grid Array (BGA) package. A BGA is simply a type of chip carrier used for integrated circuits (ICs). In terms of power consumption, the chip will operate at an ultra-low power range. During normal recording of brain spikes, the chip will consume a total of 1.1 milliwatts (mW). This is equivalent to powering a single LED or a low-power temperature sensor. By having a tiny chip that consumes ultra-low power, Starfish aims to reduce the surgical impact of brain implants. Other features include recording neural spikes and local field potentials (LFPs), which are the slower, smoother voltage fluctuations in the brain. Moreover, the chip will stimulate the brain by sending tiny electric pulses that go positive and then negative, known as biphasic pulses. The chip will also include 32 electrode sites that interface directly with brain tissue. It will record from 16 of these sites simultaneously. Each active channel samples at 18.75 kHz to capture rapid neural spikes and waveforms with high precision. There will be one current source for stimulating any pair of electrodes. Also, the brain chip will monitor impedance and measure voltage transients onboard. It will process data digitally, detect spikes in real-time, and transmit relevant data over low-bandwidth wireless links. The chip will be fabricated using TSMC’s 55 nm process for optimal size and efficiency. Starfish announced that it is “interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues.” The company is looking for people who work in fields like wireless communications or people who design custom implanted neural interfaces. However, any person who believes the brain chip is useful to their field of work is welcome to collaborate. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Yet among these giants, a new coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is turning heads with its explosive potential. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues as this high-growth altcoin sells at $0.03 and has collected $9.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.035 while attracting more than 11,000 investors. This phase’s investors will receive a 100% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. For investors looking beyond SOL, ETH and XRP, MUTM could be a pivotal play in the 2025 crypto boom. For investors searching for the best altcoin to buy now, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Gear Up for 2025 Altcoin Season Surge Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple’s XRP all enter 2025 with a lot of steam behind them, each one backed by niche fundamentals that will catalyze massive gains during the next altseason. Ethereum, currently trading at approximately $2,496, will probably break through the $10,000 mark with scaling enhancements like Pectra that cut through inefficiencies in its network. Solana, trading around $166, is rapidly emerging as a fast, inexpensive network powering DeFi and meme coins, and that’s where bullish projections believe it has a chance to break out to $500. XRP, in the meantime, remains an anchor for cross-border payments, and regulatory news in its favor can finally push it up to $5 from its current position at $2.35. While these giants prepare for liftoff, new tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are picking up steam with the capability of outperforming in ROI. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 11,000 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $9.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price has currently reached $0.03 in Phase 5 even though investors anticipate a 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 which will generate considerable profit potential. Analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining momentum with over $9.1 million raised and 11,000+ investors buying in at $0.03 during its presale. With a projected 100% profit at the $0.06 launch price and a forecasted surge beyond $5, MUTM presents a compelling alternative to Ethereum, Solana, and XRP in the 2025 altcoin season. Its innovative dual lending model combines automated liquidity pools with direct peer-to-peer loans, maximizing yield and decentralization. Backed by strong community incentives and transparent governance, Mutuum Finance is well-positioned to outperform established players and capture significant market share in the coming months.

Cardano is now inching toward $0.76, signaling renewed confidence among investors, but it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is rewriting the playbook for early-stage success in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unprecedented Presale Momentum and 13,000% Upside CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of the crypto community, with Stage 8 attracting record participation from both retail and institutional buyers. The project’s innovative tokenomics—a fixed supply, rigorous audits, and a compelling narrative—are setting a new benchmark for presale projects. Early backers can leverage the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code to secure a 50% bonus, amplifying the appeal for those seeking exponential gains. Analysts are now pointing to a potential 13,000% upside, fueled by robust on-chain activity and a rapidly expanding investor base. In a market hungry for innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the frontrunner for outsized early-stage returns . Cardano (ADA): Testing Resistance and Building Momentum Cardano is trading just shy of $0.76, with technical indicators hinting at a possible breakout if buying pressure persists. Recent developments in the ecosystem, including new DeFi integrations and partnerships, are bolstering sentiment. While ADA’s fundamentals remain solid, its growth trajectory is more gradual compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which continues to set the pace for early-stage excitement. XRP: Institutional Interest and Price Resilience XRP is holding steady above $2.35, supported by ongoing regulatory progress and growing institutional interest. Market watchers are eyeing a potential move toward $2.85–$3.40 if bullish trends continue, with some forecasts even suggesting higher targets by year-end. Despite its strong position, XRP’s upside is outpaced by the dynamic growth and presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, making MAGA the preferred choice for those seeking rapid appreciation. Bitcoin (BTC): Stability and Institutional Backing Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, trading above $110,000 with strong institutional backing and ETF inflows. Analysts anticipate a potential push toward $115,000 if current momentum holds, but the scale of BTC’s market cap means its growth is now more measured. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a project still in its formative stages, with far greater upside potential. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Progress and Future Prospects Hedera is consolidating near $0.21, with technicals indicating a period of stability after recent gains. Analysts are optimistic about a move toward $0.25–$0.30 in the coming months, but the pace of growth is expected to be steady rather than explosive. For those seeking the next major breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader for high-growth early-stage investments. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s approach to $0.76 and the steady performance of XRP, Bitcoin, and Hedera are noteworthy, but the spotlight is firmly on MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearing completion, a 13,000% growth path, and the PATRIOT50X 50% bonus still available, MAGA is the breakout opportunity of 2025.

According to an announcement from the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — a non-profit organization that advocates for universal human rights and individual liberty, and the host of the Oslo Freedom Forum — Durov will still deliver his keynote address remotely over a livestream. “It is unfortunate that French courts would block Mr. Durov from participating in an event where his voice is so needed,” HRF founder and CEO Thor Halvorssen said. Durov continues to be a vocal advocate for free speech and individual liberty. Tech and crypto industry executives closely monitor developments related to Pavel Durov and the implications for individual freedom from his ongoing legal battle in France. Source: Pavel Durov Related: Pavel Durov rejects EU pressure to censor Romanian election content Durov claims French intelligence services asked him to censor conservative voices Pavel Durov recently accused French intelligence officials of asking him to censor conservative-leaning political content related to the Romanian presidential elections on the Telegram platform. Durov said that he flatly denied the request . ""You can’t 'defend democracy' by destroying democracy. You can’t 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections,"" Durov wrote in a May 18 Telegram post . Although the Telegram founder did not initially name the intelligence official or the European Union country that asked him to censor the content, Durov later revealed more concrete details. The Telegram co-founder wrote in a May 18 X post : ""This spring at the Salon des Batailles, in the Hôtel de Crillon, Nicolas Lerner, head of French intelligence, asked me to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections. I refused. We didn’t block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran. We won’t start doing it in Europe."" Durov has repeatedly stated that Telegram will not censor political content on the platform and would exit markets before restricting free speech on the social messaging application. The Telegram co-founder said that complying with such heavy-handed political censorship constitutes a human rights violation. Magazine: Did Telegram’s Pavel Durov commit a crime?
