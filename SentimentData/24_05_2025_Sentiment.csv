Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has pushed back reports linking him to World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Summer Mersinger suggested that crypto perpetual futures could soon be introduced in US markets. US House members call for investigation into Trump's memecoin dinner Members of the US House of Representatives called for the Justice Department to investigate Donald Trump’s May 22 dinner for his top memecoin investors, citing concerns about “foreign influence over US policy decisions” and “potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” The call for an investigation and a press conference asking Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner both occurred hours before the event, which was held at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. A group of protesters, joined by Senator Jeff Merkley, gathered outside the venue with signs stating “illegal crypto party” and “democracy is not for sale.” CZ refutes claims in latest WSJ article on Trump-linked crypto dealings Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pushed back against a report in The Wall Street Journal, calling it a “hit piece” filled with inaccuracies and negative assumptions. In an X post, Zhao criticized the publication’s portrayal of his alleged involvement with World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by a business entity affiliated with US President Donald Trump. Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company. Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official. “I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng Zhao Crypto perp futures coming “very soon” to US: CFTC’s Mersinger Outgoing Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Summer Mersinger said on May 22 that the regulator could greenlight crypto perpetual futures contracts “very soon.” “We’re seeing some applications, and I believe we’ll see some of those products trading live very soon,” she told Bloomberg TV, adding it would be “great to get that trading back onshore in the United States.” Summer Mersinger on Bloomberg TV. Source: YouTube Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate, often with high leverage, on the price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning it and can be held indefinitely. Mersinger, who will leave the CFTC at the end of May to join the crypto lobby group the Blockchain Association as CEO, said having crypto derivatives trading and regulated in the US would be a “really good thing for these markets and would be really beneficial to the industry broadly.”",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-23 22:18:11

Traders and whales from Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum communities are reallocating capital into high-momentum alternatives—most notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE. As the market transitions into Q3, the narrative is clear: smart capital is leaving overextended majors for early-stage projects with breakout setups, meme traction, and clear accumulation signals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of this strategic rotation. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Renewed Optimism XRP is holding firm around $2.35 after bouncing from recent lows, with bullish divergence emerging across multiple technical timeframes. Whale accumulation wallets have steadily increased, suggesting that larger players are quietly building positions. The conclusion of Ripple’s SEC case and improved on-chain metrics have made XRP a strong candidate for Q3 rotation flows. As developers continue to build financial tools on its fast, low-cost settlement network, sentiment is improving. While analysts are eyeing a push toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, many long-time XRP holders are now diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper upside as the altcoin cycle heats up. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to speculative play for traders rotating out of Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. What began as a niche meme coin is now dominating early-stage Telegram groups and discussion threads, thanks to its timely political branding and viral community-driven momentum. The project’s deflationary model, capped 100 billion supply, and alignment with election narratives have made MAGA a favorite for those chasing asymmetric upside. Whale activity is surging, with a recent 72.95 ETH buy ($133,743) marking the largest early-stage purchase of 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a true accumulation phase, and analysts now call it the last major 50x opportunity of the cycle. As retail and institutional capital flows in, MAGA is poised for breakout price discovery before listings hit the public charts. Solana, SUI, and Ethereum: Capital Rotation Underway Solana (SOL) remains resilient above $170, but faces near-term exhaustion as price action cools. Some traders are reallocating profits into more volatile tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is more attractive. SUI is gaining attention after recent network upgrades and rising developer interest, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a long-term accumulation target. ETH’s Layer-2 activity and validator growth keep it foundational, but for short-term explosive returns, many investors are now selectively rotating into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin: From All-Time Highs to Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000 has been fueled by institutional demand and bullish technicals, with analysts forecasting potential highs of $125,000–$150,000 in 2025. However, as BTC stabilizes, the options market and on-chain data show traders increasingly shifting focus to altcoins for higher multiples. This rotation is driving new volume and volatility into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now seen as the high-conviction play for those seeking exponential upside in the current cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The current market is witnessing a major rotation as Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum traders move capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. With whale accumulation at record highs, a $0.007 listing target, and the largest single early-stage buy of 2025 already on the books, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the breakout candidate for Q3. As the window for early entry closes, analysts agree: MAGA is set to lead the next wave of crypto gains, making it the top altcoin to watch as capital rotates out of overextended majors.

According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the market can expect several large deals to be announced in the coming weeks. This kind of statement from such a high-level official is significant and warrants attention, particularly for those navigating the complex waters of the financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Who is Scott Bessent and Why Does His Word Matter for Market Impact? Scott Bessent serves as the Secretary of the US Treasury , a pivotal role in the United States government. The Treasury Department is responsible for managing the nation’s finances, including tax collection, currency production, and managing government accounts and public debt. More broadly, the Treasury plays a crucial role in shaping economic policy, implementing sanctions, and overseeing financial regulations. Therefore, any forward-looking statements from the Treasury Secretary carry considerable weight and can provide insights into the government’s economic priorities and upcoming actions. When Secretary Bessent speaks of expecting “several large deals ,” he is likely referring to significant transactions or initiatives that could have broad economic implications. These might involve: Major mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that require regulatory review or government facilitation. Significant government contracts or infrastructure projects. International financial agreements or trade deals. Potential regulatory changes or enforcement actions impacting major industries. Large-scale bond issuances or debt management strategies. The specific nature of these deals remains undisclosed, adding an element of mystery and prompting speculation across various sectors. What Kind of Large Deals Could the US Treasury Be Signaling? While Secretary Bessent’s statement is concise, the term “large deals” from the perspective of the US Treasury can encompass a wide range of possibilities, each with distinct potential outcomes. Understanding the potential scope helps us gauge the possible market impact . Consider these possibilities: 1. Infrastructure and Public Works: The government often facilitates or funds massive infrastructure projects. Announcements here could involve billions in spending on roads, bridges, energy grids, or digital infrastructure. Such deals stimulate specific industries and can have a ripple effect on employment and economic growth. 2. Regulatory Actions and Policy Shifts: The Treasury is involved in financial regulation. A “large deal” might not be a transaction but a significant policy shift or a major enforcement action against a large financial institution or industry. These can reshape competitive landscapes and introduce new compliance burdens or opportunities. 3. International Financial Agreements: In a globalized economy, the US Treasury is constantly engaged in discussions and agreements with other nations regarding trade, currency stability, sanctions, and international debt. Major deals here could impact global markets, currency exchange rates, and international capital flows. 4. Strategic Industry Support or Divestiture: Occasionally, the government might be involved in supporting or divesting from strategically important industries or assets. This could involve anything from energy sector support to the sale of government-held stakes in certain entities. 5. Debt and Fiscal Management: While perhaps less a “deal” in the traditional sense, major announcements regarding US debt management, bond issuance strategies, or significant fiscal policy changes could be framed as large financial undertakings by the Treasury. The ambiguity allows for broad interpretation, which is why market participants are keenly awaiting further details. The timing, described as “coming weeks,” suggests these announcements are imminent rather than distant. How Could These US Treasury Announcements Create Market Impact, Especially for Crypto? At first glance, news about US Treasury deals might seem unrelated to the world of cryptocurrency. However, the traditional financial system and the crypto market are increasingly interconnected. Major macroeconomic events and significant developments in traditional finance inevitably have a ripple effect on digital assets. Here’s how Secretary Bessent’s anticipated announcements could create market impact for crypto: 1. Overall Market Sentiment: Large, positive economic deals (e.g., significant infrastructure spending, favorable international agreements) can boost overall market confidence and risk appetite. When traditional markets are bullish, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, announcements perceived negatively (e.g., regulatory crackdowns, unfavorable economic outlooks) could lead to a flight to safety, potentially causing sell-offs in crypto. 2. Liquidity and Capital Flows: Major deals often involve significant movements of capital. Increased economic activity or investment stemming from these deals could increase overall liquidity in the financial system. While not directly flowing into crypto, higher liquidity generally creates a more favorable environment for asset prices across the board. 3. Inflation and Economic Outlook: Depending on the nature of the deals, they could influence expectations about inflation, economic growth, or interest rates. For instance, large government spending could be seen as inflationary, which has historically been a narrative that benefits scarce assets like Bitcoin. Announcements signaling economic strength might reduce the appeal of safe havens but increase confidence in growth assets. 4. Regulatory Environment: If any of the “large deals” involve new financial regulations or the enforcement of existing ones, this could directly impact the cryptocurrency industry. Increased regulatory clarity (or uncertainty) is a major factor influencing institutional adoption and market stability for crypto. 5. US Dollar Strength: Treasury actions and major economic deals can influence the strength of the US dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes put pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in USD and seen by some as alternative stores of value. It’s crucial for those following crypto news to pay close attention to these developments from the US Treasury . While the connection might not always be direct, the macroeconomic environment shaped by these announcements is a powerful force influencing investment decisions globally. What Should Crypto Investors Do Ahead of These Large Deals? Given the potential for significant market impact stemming from the anticipated large deals announced by the US Treasury , how should crypto investors prepare? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on traditional financial news outlets and official US Treasury announcements in the coming weeks. Understand the details of the deals as they are revealed, not just the headlines. Assess Potential Implications: Once details emerge, try to analyze how the specific nature of the deals could affect the broader economy, inflation expectations, regulatory landscape, and overall market sentiment. Consider both positive and negative potential outcomes. Review Your Portfolio: Think about how different scenarios resulting from the announcements might affect your current crypto holdings. Are you heavily invested in assets sensitive to regulatory changes? Or perhaps assets seen as hedges against inflation? Manage Risk: Volatility can increase around major economic announcements. Ensure your portfolio is adequately diversified and that you are not overexposed to sudden market shifts. Consider setting stop-loss orders or taking other risk management measures if you trade actively. Avoid Panic Reactions: Initial market reactions can sometimes be overblown or based on incomplete information. Take time to understand the full picture before making significant changes to your investment strategy based solely on the immediate news reaction. The comments from Scott Bessent serve as a heads-up that significant financial news is on the horizon. Proactive preparation and informed analysis will be key to navigating the potential market movements that follow. Potential Benefits and Challenges for Crypto from Treasury Announcements Let’s quickly summarize the potential upside and downside for the crypto market based on the type and reaction to these anticipated large deals : Potential Benefit Scenarios Potential Challenge Scenarios Deals boost overall economic confidence and risk appetite. Deals signal tighter regulation impacting crypto directly or indirectly. Deals involve significant stimulus perceived as inflationary. Deals lead to a stronger USD, potentially pressuring crypto prices. Deals create new infrastructure or tech opportunities beneficial to blockchain. Deals reveal negative economic outlook or increased fiscal instability. Deals improve international financial stability. Market reacts negatively to the specifics of the announced deals. Increased liquidity flows broadly benefit asset markets. Capital flows are directed away from risk assets towards traditional safe havens. This table illustrates that the impact is not predetermined and will depend entirely on the specifics of what Scott Bessent and the US Treasury announce. Conclusion: Staying Alert in a Connected Financial World Scott Bessent ‘s statement about expecting several large deals in the coming weeks is a clear signal that significant economic activity is anticipated at the highest levels of the US Treasury . While the details remain under wraps, the potential for these announcements to create notable market impact across various sectors, including the increasingly integrated world of cryptocurrency, is undeniable. For anyone tracking crypto news , this serves as a reminder that macroeconomics plays a vital role in the performance of digital assets. Staying informed about these developments, understanding their potential implications, and managing risk are essential steps in navigating the markets during periods of significant government announcements. The coming weeks promise to be interesting, so keep your eyes peeled for news from the US Treasury .

Head of Pantera Capital Dan Morehead, in an interview, revealed that many crypto companies are preparing for public offerings. In the next few months, both Circle and Figure will prepare for their IPOs. This is a significant change for blockchain activity in the United States, as the rules surrounding the industry become friendlier rather than stricter. Morehead believes the change resulted from recent policy updates. The SEC’s decision to withdraw Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 is an example of this kind of change.

Casten, Smith Call for DOJ Inquiry Into Trump Gala In the letter from Casten and Smith, backed by 35 House Democrats, the lawmakers claim that the dinner for the top 220 $TRUMP investors held on Thursday “invites foreign influence over U.S. policy decisions and raises potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” https://twitter.com/Eleanor_Mueller/status/1925606223539269693 “It is just the latest example of President Trump disregarding ethics norms, introducing further conflicts of interest, and using his office for self-enrichment,” Casten and Smith said. In particular, the two representatives emphasized concerns over Chinese Tron founder Justin Sun’s recent announcement that he was the top investor of Trump’s namesake meme coin , exacerbating foreign influence concerns. Sun faced fraud charges from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission over his Tron blockchain, though those were recently dropped shortly after investing millions in the Trump-affiliated crypto platform, World Liberty Financial. “U.S. law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to U.S. political campaigns,” the lawmakers said. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” Democrats Question $TRUMP Dinner Ethics Hosted at Trump National Golf Club just outside of Washington, D.C., the $TRUMP gala dinner drew a wave of pushback from Democratic lawmakers who expressed issues over potential ethics concerns. On Thursday, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters (D-CA) introduced a new bill that would prohibit elected officials from owning a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. However, it is still unclear if Democrats hold enough sway to enact legislation against Trump’s crypto affairs.

For those plugged into the crypto and blockchain space, staying ahead of the curve on frontier tech like AI is crucial, as these innovations often shape future digital economies and investment opportunities. A major development just hit the wires: OpenAI Jony Ive are joining forces in a monumental deal that signals a bold new direction for AI. OpenAI Jony Ive: A $6.5 Billion Bet on the Future In a move that sent ripples through the tech industry, OpenAI has acquired io, the secretive device startup co-founded by legendary designer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This wasn’t a small cash purchase; it was a staggering $6.5 billion all-equity deal, representing OpenAI’s largest acquisition to date. The core of the deal brings Ive, the design genius behind iconic Apple products like the iPhone, iMac, and iPod, into the OpenAI fold. Through his creative firm, LoveFrom, Ive will now lead design and creative efforts for OpenAI. The clear objective behind this massive investment and high-profile partnership? To take AI beyond the screen and spearhead the creation of a new generation of AI consumer devices . This isn’t just about software anymore; it’s about building tangible products that integrate AI seamlessly into our daily lives, potentially creating entirely new markets and user experiences. Sam Altman OpenAI and the ‘AI iPhone’ Vision The narrative surrounding the Sam Altman OpenAI and Jony Ive partnership is unmistakable: OpenAI is positioning itself to replicate the kind of paradigm-shifting impact Apple had with the iPhone. Sam Altman is being framed as the visionary, akin to Steve Jobs, while Jony Ive is the design maestro tasked with making that vision a tangible, desirable reality. The staged photos of the duo circulating on social media only reinforced this carefully crafted message. The goal is clear: take the revolutionary impact of the iPhone launch and apply it to artificial intelligence, creating devices that redefine how we interact with technology. This focus on AI consumer devices highlights a strategic shift. While much of the AI conversation has centered on large language models, generative AI, and software applications, the next frontier is integrating this intelligence into hardware that users interact with directly, intuitively, and constantly. Think wearables, ambient computing, or entirely new form factors we haven’t even imagined yet. Ive’s expertise in human-centric design and creating beloved products is precisely what OpenAI needs to translate powerful AI models into accessible and appealing devices. Contrasting Strategies: OpenAI’s Bold Move vs. Google AI Strategy This aggressive push by OpenAI, securing a design legend and betting billions on hardware, starkly contrasts with how other tech giants are approaching the AI race, particularly the perceived Google AI strategy . While Google has been a pioneer in AI research and continues to integrate AI into its vast suite of services (as seen with their AI-powered search upgrades demonstrated at Google I/O), OpenAI’s move with Ive suggests a focus on creating disruptive, standalone AI hardware products from the ground up. This isn’t just about enhancing existing products; it’s about building entirely new ones. The recent Google I/O event, as discussed on Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast, showcased Google’s advancements, including the return of concepts like Google Glass (albeit in a different context) and developer reactions to AI search. However, OpenAI’s partnership with Ive positions them not just as a leader in AI models, but as a potential leader in the future of AI hardware design, directly challenging established players in the consumer device space. The Promise of AI Innovation Beyond the Screen The potential for AI innovation driven by this partnership is immense. Jony Ive’s design philosophy has always been about simplifying technology and making it feel intuitive and magical. Applying this approach to AI could result in devices that are not just smart, but truly enhance human capabilities and interactions without the need for traditional screens or interfaces. Imagine AI companions integrated into wearables that provide real-time information, context-aware assistance, or seamless control over your environment, all designed with the elegance and usability Ive is known for. The implications for the broader tech ecosystem, including areas relevant to cryptocurrency and Web3, are significant. As AI becomes more embedded in physical devices, it could drive new forms of data ownership, decentralized AI processing, or novel incentive structures that intersect with blockchain technology. The infrastructure required to support billions of AI-powered devices will also present opportunities and challenges for decentralized networks. Beyond the OpenAI and Google news, the Equity podcast also delved into other notable tech stories, including: Insights from Google I/O, touching upon developer sentiment regarding AI tools and the potential resurgence of concepts like Google Glass. Updates on Luminar, the lidar startup, navigating layoffs, CEO changes, and fundraising efforts. A look at 23andMe’s new direction and the potential uses of its vast DNA data repository under new ownership. These diverse topics highlight the dynamic and interconnected nature of the current technology landscape, where advancements in one area, like AI, can have ripple effects across multiple industries. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Devices The partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive is far more than just a high-profile acquisition; it’s a strategic declaration that OpenAI is serious about bringing AI into the physical world through thoughtfully designed consumer devices. By combining cutting-edge AI research with unparalleled design expertise, they are aiming for nothing less than creating the next foundational technology platform, much like the personal computer and the smartphone before it.

According to the release, this move aims to improve Alchemy’s smart wallet ecosystem. Although the acquisition was completed on April 30, the financial details are not public. Benefits of Alchemy Acquisition Meanwhile, integrating HeyMint’s team and technology is expected to significantly enhance Alchemy’s developer tools and increase user engagement. As part of the acquisition, the main teams from HeyMint and its related platform, HeyMint Quest, will join Alchemy. This collaboration will help Alchemy grow its smart wallet ecosystem. Notably, HeyMint is a user-friendly launchpad that helps artists, brands, and developers create NFT collections easily, without needing advanced coding skills. Its simple tools and focus on community support make it a standout choice in the busy NFT market. Integrating these tools will help Alchemy provide a better solution for Web3 developers. This move also emphasizes Alchemy’s goal of being a one-stop shop for creating, launching, and managing Web3 applications, focusing on tools that put users first. Alchemy Expands Web 3.0 Developers’ Education Recall that the blockchain startup acquired ChainShot , a Web 3.0 educational platform for prospective developers, in 2022. With the deal, more developers gained free access to Web 3.0 developer education. This also aligned with the everyday goal of the blockchain development company, which is to “bring Web3 to a billion people.” Before now, Alchemy had noticed a huge gap preventing individuals from hopping into Web3.0. This course gives aspiring developers enough knowledge to dive into the crypto industry unperturbed. It is worth noting that this is the first of Alchemy’s acquisitions. Smart Wallet Simplifies Crypto Trading Recall that last year, the Coinbase exchange launched a new smart wallet designed to tackle key challenges in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem. As reported by TheCoinRise, the smart wallet is in sync with eight other networks: Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Zora, and Avalanche. Others are Polygon, BNB , and Arbitrum. Intriguingly, Coinbase says the goal is to expand and incorporate other networks over time. The smart wallet features are designed to streamline the enrollment procedures for new users. Furthermore, the wallet simplifies all the hurdles in getting started with crypto. It is also user-friendly and allows new users to set up and use their wallet with little effort. These advantages position it for wider adoption.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Barak said corporate service providers and centralized servers are expected to become honeypots for AI-assisted hackers and malicious actors looking to steal valuable data, including private keys, financial metadata, medical records, and government documents. Hackers targeting centralized entities have a ""massive"" return on investment (ROI) and are incentivized to hack centralized targets that contain millions of valuable records, the CEO told Cointelegraph. Barak added that ZK-proofs, a way of verifying onchain data without revealing it, solve this problem: ""Blockchain is going to improve cybersecurity around the world, because, for a hacker to get to actual data, they need to hack individual wallets, but their ROI would be one record instead of millions — not worth it. They are going to go elsewhere."" Privacy solutions have become a major focus for many Web3 developers, as the need to shield metadata from AI algorithms grows and large institutions demand privacy tools to protect sensitive data as a prerequisite to bringing their business operations onchain.

While Solana and XRP are grabbing headlines with their surging price action, the real story is the strategic positioning of smart money into MAGA before its public debut. With Bitcoin’s momentum steady and whale activity at record highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the top early-stage altcoin on every analyst’s radar. Ethereum Whales Signal the Next Altcoin Season Recent on-chain data reveals a surge in Ethereum whale accumulation, a classic precursor to altcoin season. According to Crypto Rover, large ETH holders have been aggressively buying, with one wallet alone scooping up 5,000 ETH—worth over $13 million—in a single hour. This buying spree has historically triggered bullish momentum not just for Ethereum, but for the broader altcoin market. As ETH whales load up, many are also diversifying into high-upside presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is even more attractive. With ETH trading at $2,650 and whale wallets betting on a broad rally, MAGA is perfectly positioned to benefit from the next liquidity wave. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Buys and Institutional-Grade Conviction MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing record-breaking whale activity, with a single 72.95 ETH transaction—valued at $133,743—marking the largest early-stage crypto buy of 2025. This direct allocation is not opportunistic, but a calculated institutional-style move that cements MAGA as a high-confidence project. With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting both retail and strategic capital before its $0.007 listing. Analysts are forecasting returns of 25x–200x, and with whales moving in before CoinMarketCap tracking even begins, the opportunity for outsized gains is clear. Early adopters are locking in their positions now, knowing that the biggest returns come before the public even sees the chart. Solana and XRP: Price Action Heats Up Solana (SOL) continues its steady climb, trading in the $170–$180 range and maintaining its position as a DeFi and developer favorite. Meanwhile, XRP is experiencing renewed whale accumulation and robust trading volumes, currently priced between $2.39 and $2.60. With regulatory clarity and the prospect of an XRP ETF, analysts are targeting $2.85–$3.40 in the near term, and $5.50–$15 by year-end if adoption accelerates. While both SOL and XRP are attracting smart capital, the most aggressive investors are also rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for a shot at exponential early-stage upside. Bitcoin and the Broader Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s anchor, recently surging past $109,500 and drawing renewed institutional and retail interest. Yet, as BTC stabilizes and capital rotates, the spotlight is shifting to altcoins with higher-multiple potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral narrative, capped supply, and record-setting presale momentum, is now the frontrunner for those seeking the next 100x opportunity in the current cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Ethereum whales are quietly loading MAGACOIN FINANCE as Solana and XRP heat up, signaling a pivotal shift in smart capital allocation for 2025. With the largest single whale buy of the year, over $8 million raised, and Stage 8 nearly full, MAGA is setting the standard for early-stage ROI. As the window for entry narrows, analysts agree: the real breakout for MAGACOIN FINANCE is just beginning.

45019010,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=162689,1748040046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45019010.jpeg,Stablecorp Funding Boosts QCAD Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Expansion,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecorp-qcad-stablecoin-funding/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecorp Funding Boosts QCAD Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Expansion In a significant move for the Canadian cryptocurrency landscape, Toronto-based Stablecorp has successfully closed a funding round, securing $1.8 million USD. This investment is specifically earmarked to accelerate the growth and capabilities of QCAD , the company’s pioneering stablecoin pegged directly to the value of the Canadian dollar. Why is This Stablecoin Funding Important? The successful completion of this stablecoin funding round highlights growing investor confidence in the potential of regulated, fiat-backed digital currencies, particularly within specific national markets like Canada. For Stablecorp and its QCAD project, this capital infusion is not just about expansion; it’s about building robust, transparent, and accessible financial infrastructure on the blockchain. The funding round saw participation from notable names in the crypto and venture capital space, including support from Coinbase Ventures . The involvement of a major player like Coinbase Ventures signals a strategic interest in the development of regulated stablecoins that can bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning world of decentralized applications and digital payments. What Does This Mean for QCAD and the Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Market? QCAD stands out as one of the prominent stablecoins designed specifically for the Canadian market, aiming to provide a digital representation of the Canadian dollar that can be easily transacted on blockchain networks. This funding is set to bolster several key areas: Enhanced FX Integrations: Improving the ability to seamlessly convert between QCAD and other currencies, facilitating international transactions and broader adoption. Payment Rail Development: Expanding the use of QCAD for everyday transactions and business payments, making it easier for individuals and companies to use the stablecoin for transferring value. New Trust Structure: Implementing a more robust and transparent structure for holding the reserves that back QCAD . This is crucial for building user trust and ensuring the stablecoin maintains its peg to the Canadian dollar stablecoin value reliably. Transparency around reserves is a critical factor for stablecoin credibility. The focus on these areas indicates Stablecorp’s commitment to making QCAD a practical and trustworthy digital asset for the Canadian economy. By improving infrastructure and transparency, they aim to address some of the common concerns surrounding stablecoins and encourage wider adoption among consumers, businesses, and financial institutions. Who is Stablecorp and What is QCAD? Stablecorp is a Canadian financial technology company focused on building infrastructure for digital assets. Their flagship product, QCAD , was launched to provide a stable, reliable digital asset equivalent to the Canadian dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, QCAD is designed to maintain a stable value, making it suitable for transactions, savings, and acting as a safe haven within the crypto ecosystem during market volatility. The operation of a stablecoin like QCAD typically involves holding reserves (in this case, Canadian dollars or highly liquid, Canadian dollar-denominated assets) equivalent to the amount of QCAD in circulation. The new trust structure aims to provide clearer oversight and verification of these reserves, aligning with best practices for stablecoin issuance and potentially paving the way for increased regulatory acceptance. The Context: Coinbase Ventures and Market Dynamics The news of Stablecorp’s funding round, reported by Betakit, came at a time when one of its investors, Coinbase, was navigating its own set of challenges, including a significant cyberattack and ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite these broader market and company-specific headwinds, the investment from Coinbase Ventures into Stablecorp underscores a strategic long-term view on the importance of stablecoins and the potential for growth in regulated markets like Canada. Coinbase Ventures’ investment portfolio often reflects Coinbase’s strategic priorities, which include fostering the growth of the crypto ecosystem through infrastructure development, expanding global reach, and supporting projects that enhance the utility and accessibility of digital assets. Investing in a Canadian dollar stablecoin aligns with these goals, potentially opening up new corridors for Canadian users on platforms like Coinbase in the future, or simply supporting the broader adoption of stable assets globally. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for QCAD? Benefits: Stability: Offers Canadian users a digital asset without the price volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies. Efficiency: Enables faster, cheaper transactions compared to traditional banking methods, especially for cross-border payments within Canada or internationally. Accessibility: Provides easier access to the crypto ecosystem for Canadians, acting as a stable on-ramp and off-ramp. Transparency: The planned new trust structure aims to increase confidence in the reserve backing. Innovation: Supports the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain use cases denominated in Canadian dollars. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: While Canada has made strides in crypto regulation, the specific framework for stablecoins continues to evolve. Adoption: Widespread adoption by consumers and businesses requires significant education and integration into existing financial systems. Competition: While QCAD is a leading Canadian dollar stablecoin, it faces potential competition from other stablecoin issuers or future digital currencies, including potentially a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the Bank of Canada. Operational Risks: Ensuring the security and reliability of the underlying technology and reserve management is paramount. Actionable Insights: What Should You Know? For individuals and businesses in Canada interested in digital assets: Keep an eye on QCAD’s integration into more platforms and services as a result of this stablecoin funding . Understand the difference between volatile cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like QCAD and how they can serve different purposes in a digital asset portfolio or for transactions. Pay attention to announcements regarding the new trust structure for reserves, as this is key to the stablecoin’s credibility. If you use platforms supported by Coinbase Ventures , this investment might signal future interoperability or support for QCAD . Summary: A Boost for the Canadian Digital Economy Stablecorp’s successful $1.8 million stablecoin funding round, bolstered by participation from investors like Coinbase Ventures , marks a significant step forward for the development and adoption of the Canadian dollar stablecoin , QCAD . By focusing on critical areas like FX integrations, payment rails, and reserve transparency through a new trust structure, Stablecorp is laying the groundwork for QCAD to become a more widely used and trusted digital representation of the Canadian dollar. While challenges remain, particularly regarding regulation and widespread adoption, this investment provides the resources needed to navigate these hurdles and push the Canadian digital asset space forward. The support from prominent investors like Coinbase Ventures underscores the global recognition of the potential for well-regulated, national currency-pegged stablecoins.

45019310,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=162688,1748040643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45019310.jpeg,Trump Memecoin Event: Potential Federal Law Violation Sparks Controversy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-memecoin-law-violation/,"BitcoinWorld Trump Memecoin Event: Potential Federal Law Violation Sparks Controversy The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency continues to generate headlines, and a recent event involving former U.S. President Donald Trump and a specific digital asset has ignited significant debate. According to a report by Forbes, a dinner event held for holders of the Trump Memecoin – often referred to simply as $TRUMP or TRUMP Coin – may have inadvertently crossed a legal line, potentially constituting a Federal Law Violation . What Happened at the Controversial Trump Memecoin Dinner? Picture this: a private dinner gathering specifically for individuals who hold a particular cryptocurrency named after a prominent political figure. This isn’t a campaign rally or an official government function. It’s an event celebrating and engaging with a specific, highly speculative digital asset – the Trump Memecoin . During this dinner, held recently, former President Trump reportedly appeared on a podium. The detail that caught the attention of observers, and subsequently Forbes, was the decoration on that podium: the unmistakable presidential seal. While appearing at an event is one thing, the use of official government symbols in specific contexts is governed by strict regulations in the United States. The event itself highlighted the growing trend of political figures interacting with the crypto space, particularly the phenomenon of memecoins tied to their personas or political movements. For holders of the TRUMP Coin , having the former President attend their dinner was undoubtedly a significant moment, potentially boosting morale and visibility for the digital asset. However, the presence of the presidential seal has raised serious questions about compliance with federal statutes designed to prevent the misuse of such powerful symbols. Decoding the Federal Law Violation Claim At the heart of the Forbes report is the assertion that the use of the presidential seal at this specific, private event linked to a financial asset could constitute a Federal Law Violation . This isn’t a minor technicality; it involves a specific statute designed to protect the integrity and non-partisanship of the symbols representing the highest office in the nation. The core argument is that placing the presidential seal on a podium used by a former President at an event for holders of a coin named after him could create a misleading impression. The law aims to prevent the public from believing that a private activity, organization, or product has official government approval, sponsorship, or endorsement when it does not. In the context of the Trump Memecoin dinner, the concern is that the presence of the seal might suggest that the event, or even the TRUMP Coin itself, somehow carries the imprimatur or approval of the U.S. government or the office of the President, even if it’s a former President using the seal. Understanding the Presidential Seal Law: Rules and Restrictions So, what exactly does the law say about using the presidential seal? The relevant statute is 18 U.S. Code § 713. This federal law explicitly prohibits the knowing display of the presidential seal, or any facsimile thereof, in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the false impression that such use is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the U U.S. government or any department, agency, or official thereof. The purpose of the Presidential Seal Law is clear: to safeguard the dignity and authority of the symbols of the presidency and prevent their exploitation for private, commercial, or partisan purposes. It ensures that when the presidential seal is displayed, it genuinely represents the official capacity and authority of the U.S. government, not a private venture or personal endorsement. Key aspects of the Presidential Seal Law include: Prohibition: It is illegal to use the seal in a way that falsely suggests government approval or authorization. Intent: The law focuses on whether the use is “reasonably calculated to convey the false impression,” meaning the likely perception by an observer is key. Scope: It applies to the seal itself and any representation so similar as to be easily mistaken for it. Penalties: Violators can face significant consequences, including fines and imprisonment for up to six months. While there are specific instances where the seal’s use is permitted (like official government documents, military use, or certain historical/educational contexts), its use in connection with private events, especially those tied to financial assets like the TRUMP Coin , falls into a legally sensitive area. The TRUMP Coin Phenomenon and Political Endorsements The rise of the TRUMP Coin is part of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market: political memecoins. These tokens are created, often on decentralized networks, and gain value primarily through speculation, community hype, and their association with a political figure or movement. The TRUMP Coin ($TRUMP on exchanges) is arguably the most prominent example of a memecoin directly tied to a former President. Holders and proponents often view these coins as a way to support or signal allegiance to the associated figure. However, they are highly volatile, lack underlying fundamentals, and are often susceptible to significant price swings based on news, social media trends, or activities of the associated person. The event where the presidential seal was displayed was, from one perspective, an engagement with this community and, from another, an implicit interaction with a specific financial asset tied to the former President’s name. The question of political endorsements in the crypto space is complex. While individuals are free to express support, using official symbols, especially those protected by law like the presidential seal, in a context that could be perceived as endorsing a private financial product, blurs the lines between personal political activity and the authority of public office. This is precisely the scenario the Presidential Seal Law is designed to prevent. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Political Events The dinner event for Trump Memecoin holders isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of an increasing trend of political figures wading into the crypto world, attending conferences, accepting donations in crypto, or having memecoins created in their likeness. These Crypto Political Events highlight the growing influence and financial power of the crypto community, making it an attractive demographic for politicians. However, this interaction comes with significant risks, both for the politicians and the public. For politicians, there are legal and ethical considerations, particularly regarding endorsements, financial regulations, and the use of official symbols. For the public and crypto investors, these events can be misleading, potentially giving undue credibility to speculative assets like memecoins based on perceived political backing. Understanding the nature of Crypto Political Events requires recognizing that they often operate in a regulatory grey area. Memecoins, in particular, are often difficult to classify and regulate. When combined with the strict rules governing political conduct and the use of official symbols, events like the one involving the Trump Memecoin and the presidential seal underscore the need for caution and clarity. What This Means: Potential Consequences and Future Scrutiny So, what are the potential repercussions of this alleged Federal Law Violation ? While Forbes reported the potential violation, whether any action will be taken remains uncertain. Enforcement of laws like the Presidential Seal Law can depend on various factors, including the specific circumstances, the perceived intent, and the discretion of relevant authorities like the Department of Justice. Potential consequences could range from no action being taken to an investigation, and in theory, the penalties outlined in the statute (fines or imprisonment) could apply if a violation is found and prosecuted. Beyond the legal realm, the event highlights the potential for negative optics and increased scrutiny on how political figures engage with the crypto market, especially with assets as volatile and speculative as memecoins like the TRUMP Coin . This incident could also prompt further discussion and potentially regulatory attention on the phenomenon of Crypto Political Events and the creation and promotion of politically themed tokens. It serves as a stark reminder that even in the fast-paced, often unconventional world of cryptocurrency, established laws regarding the use of official government symbols still apply and can have significant implications. Key Takeaways for Investors and Observers For anyone involved in the crypto space, particularly those interested in political tokens, the situation surrounding the Trump Memecoin dinner offers valuable lessons: Official Symbols Matter: Be highly skeptical of any private event or financial product that prominently features official government symbols like the presidential seal. This is legally restricted for a reason. Distinguish Personal from Official: A political figure’s personal interest or attendance at an event is different from an official government endorsement or approval. The Presidential Seal Law helps reinforce this distinction. Political Memecoins are High-Risk: Tokens like the TRUMP Coin are driven by sentiment and speculation, not fundamentals. Their value can be heavily influenced by political events, statements, and potentially misleading associations. Legal Grey Areas Exist: The intersection of crypto and politics is new and evolving, leading to potential legal ambiguities and risks that participants should be aware of. Due Diligence is Crucial: Always research the legitimacy of events, endorsements, and the assets themselves, regardless of who is involved. This event underscores the importance of understanding not just the technology and market dynamics of crypto, but also the legal and regulatory environment, especially when it overlaps with established political norms and laws. In conclusion, the Forbes report raising the possibility of a Federal Law Violation at a Trump Memecoin event due to the use of the presidential seal serves as a critical reminder of the legal boundaries surrounding the use of official symbols. While the ultimate legal outcome remains to be seen, the incident highlights the complex and sometimes fraught relationship between politics, speculative digital assets like the TRUMP Coin , and the laws designed to protect the integrity of government symbols. As Crypto Political Events become more common, vigilance and a clear understanding of applicable regulations will be essential for all involved.

One recent anecdote making waves in the memecoin news circuit involves a high-profile Trump memecoin dinner and a rather unimpressed crypto influencer . The High Cost of a Crypto Dinner Experience Imagine paying a staggering amount of money – not in traditional currency, but in volatile digital assets – for a single dinner event. That’s precisely what happened recently, according to a report by Fortune. Nicholas Pinto, a 25-year-old social media influencer, reportedly shelled out a hefty sum equivalent to $360,000 at the time, paid entirely in TRUMP token s (specifically, the MVPD token ticker). The event in question was a dinner associated with the Trump memecoin , an asset class that has seen significant attention and volatility, particularly in political cycles. Attendees were presumably hoping for an exclusive experience, networking opportunities, and perhaps close proximity to the former president himself. Crypto Influencer Nicholas Pinto’s Blunt Assessment However, the reality of the event, at least according to Pinto, fell far short of expectations. His candid remarks quickly became a talking point, highlighting a significant disconnect between the perceived value and the actual experience. The Food: Pinto’s description of the culinary offerings was anything but glowing. He bluntly labeled the food as “trash.” For a dinner costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto value, one would expect a gourmet experience, not something warranting such a harsh review. The Speech: Beyond the meal, the substance of the event also seemed to disappoint. Pinto described Donald Trump’s speech as “pretty much like bullshit.” This suggests a lack of meaningful content or engagement, further diminishing the perceived value of the high-priced ticket. The Access: A key draw for such events is often the opportunity to interact with the central figure. Pinto claimed that attendees didn’t even come into close contact with Trump. This lack of access, despite the enormous cost, appears to be a major point of contention for the influencer. Pinto’s experience underscores a critical challenge in the world of high-ticket events funded by volatile assets: expectations versus reality. The hype surrounding a political figure and a popular Trump memecoin might build immense anticipation, but the execution of the event itself might not live up to the monetary or symbolic investment. Understanding the TRUMP Token and Political Memecoins The fact that the payment was made in TRUMP token s adds another layer of complexity to this story. Unlike traditional payments, paying with a volatile asset like a memecoin carries inherent risks and implications. What exactly is the TRUMP token (MVPD)? It’s one of several cryptocurrencies that have emerged, often capitalizing on the political landscape. These tokens are typically highly speculative, driven by community sentiment, social media trends, and political developments rather than underlying fundamentals or utility. Their value can skyrocket or plummet based on news cycles, endorsements, or even simple online chatter. Paying $360,000 worth of a volatile asset means that the actual dollar value of the payment could have fluctuated significantly before and after the transaction. It’s a high-stakes gamble for both the payer and potentially the recipient, depending on how quickly the tokens are converted or managed. This event shines a spotlight on the broader phenomenon of political memecoins. They represent a unique, albeit often controversial, intersection of finance, technology, and political fandom. While some see them as a way to engage supporters and potentially raise funds, others view them as purely speculative gambles or even potential scams. What This Memecoin News Tells Us About the Market The story of Pinto’s disappointing crypto dinner provides valuable insights into several aspects of the current crypto landscape: The Power of Hype: The willingness to spend $360,000 worth of tokens on a dinner speaks volumes about the power of hype and perceived exclusivity within certain crypto circles, especially those tied to specific personalities or movements. Volatility Risks: Paying for goods or services with highly volatile assets like memecoins is inherently risky. The value of the payment can change dramatically in a short period. Expectation Management: High-profile events, particularly those linked to charismatic figures or trending assets, can generate unrealistic expectations. Attendees might anticipate unparalleled access or value that isn’t actually delivered. Influencer Economy: This event highlights the significant capital circulating among some crypto influencer s and their willingness to spend it on experiences they believe will offer unique value or networking opportunities. The rapid spread of this story through memecoin news outlets and social media also demonstrates the intense interest and scrutiny surrounding these novel assets and the figures associated with them. Beyond the Plate: Why Attend a Crypto Dinner Like This? Given the reported disappointment, one might wonder about the motivations for attending such an event, especially at such a high cost in TRUMP token s. Several factors could be at play: Networking: Events like this can attract individuals with significant wealth or influence in the crypto or political spheres. Networking opportunities could be a primary driver. Publicity/Content: For a crypto influencer , attending and reporting on such a unique event generates content and publicity, which is valuable in their line of work. The controversy or exclusivity itself can be part of the appeal. Belief in the Asset/Figure: Attendees might be strong believers in the political figure or the associated Trump memecoin , viewing the expense as an investment in a community or movement. Exclusivity: The high price tag creates an aura of exclusivity, appealing to those who wish to be part of an elite group. However, Pinto’s experience serves as a cautionary tale that even with a massive investment, the tangible benefits and overall satisfaction are not guaranteed. The Influence Game: What Does This Mean for Crypto Influencer s? Nicholas Pinto’s willingness to share his negative experience is notable. It adds a layer of perceived authenticity in a space often criticized for hype and shilling. His candor, while potentially burning bridges, could also build trust with his audience by demonstrating a willingness to speak truth to power, or at least, truth to expensive dinners. The incident also raises questions about the role and responsibility of crypto influencer s. Their actions, investments, and public statements can impact their followers’ perceptions and decisions. Paying a massive sum in a specific token for an event inherently ties the influencer to that token and the associated figure, for better or worse. It highlights the pressures and incentives influencers face, navigating the line between creating engaging content, pursuing opportunities, and potentially promoting assets or events that might not deliver value. Challenges and Actionable Insights The story of the disappointing Trump memecoin dinner brings several challenges to the forefront: Challenge: Volatility Risk. Paying or being paid in volatile assets means the value is constantly in flux. Challenge: Hype vs. Reality. High-profile events can be overhyped, leading to significant disappointment. Challenge: Access and Value. Expensive tickets do not always guarantee meaningful access or a high-quality experience. Challenge: Influencer Credibility. Influencers need to balance opportunity with maintaining trust with their audience. Based on these challenges, here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insight: Do Your Own Research (DYOR). Before investing in tokens like the TRUMP token or spending large sums on related events, thoroughly research the asset, the event organizers, and what is actually being offered. Actionable Insight: Manage Expectations. Be realistic about what you will gain from high-cost, high-hype events. Exclusive access or guaranteed returns are rarely part of the deal. Actionable Insight: Be Wary of Hype. Don’t let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or the perceived status of an event dictate your financial decisions, especially in the volatile memecoin market. Actionable Insight: Consider Payment Method. Understand the risks involved when paying for goods or services using volatile cryptocurrencies. Summary: A Costly Lesson in the World of Political Memecoins and Crypto Events The tale of the crypto influencer who paid $360,000 worth of TRUMP token s for a disappointing dinner is more than just a quirky anecdote. It’s a potent illustration of the dynamics at play in the current crypto landscape: the intense interest in political memecoins, the significant capital wielded by some figures, the risks associated with volatile assets, and the potential for high-profile events to fall short of lofty expectations. As the memecoin news cycle continues to churn out stories, this incident serves as a vivid reminder for investors and enthusiasts alike to approach hype-driven opportunities and exclusive events with a healthy dose of skepticism and rigorous due diligence. Not every expensive seat at the table guarantees a satisfying meal or meaningful access.

If so, you’ve likely noticed the persistent strength of TRON (TRX). Recent analysis suggests that the TRX bullish momentum is far from over, presenting an interesting scenario for traders and investors. Decoding the Persistent TRX Bullish Momentum The current performance of TRX has caught the eye of many market observers. Unlike typical scenarios where extended upward trends show signs of fatigue, TRX continues to push forward. This resilience is a key factor driving the current optimistic sentiment around the cryptocurrency. Several factors contribute to this sustained momentum: Network Activity: The TRON network maintains high levels of transaction volume and user engagement, driven by its focus on dApps, stablecoins, and a low-fee structure. Stablecoin Integration: TRON is a significant player in the stablecoin market, particularly with USDT, which drives utility and demand for TRX for transaction fees. Ecosystem Growth: Continued development and adoption within the TRON ecosystem contribute to the underlying value proposition of TRX . What Does CryptoQuant Data Reveal? Insights from on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant are crucial for understanding market dynamics beyond simple price charts. According to a recent observation shared by CryptoQuant on X (formerly Twitter), TRX exhibits high buying pressure. Typically, a sustained period of high buying pressure can sometimes signal an impending price top. This is because intense buying can exhaust available supply at certain price levels, leading to a potential reversal as demand wanes or profit-taking begins. However, the notable point highlighted by analysts, including Joao Wedson, Founder & CEO of Alphractal, is that despite this significant buying pressure, TRX has not shown the expected signs of peaking. This divergence from the usual pattern suggests that the demand absorbing this pressure is substantial and persistent, indicating potential for further price appreciation. Expert Price Prediction : Is Further Upside Likely? The observation from CryptoQuant and analysts like Joao Wedson feeds into the current price prediction narrative for TRX . The lack of a top signal, even amidst high buying pressure, suggests that the market believes there is still room for growth. What could this mean for the future TRX price prediction ? Continued Ascents: If buying pressure remains strong and is met with continued demand without significant sell-offs, the price could continue its upward trajectory. Target Levels: Analysts often look at historical resistance levels and Fibonacci extensions to identify potential next targets. A persistent bullish trend suggests these higher levels are becoming increasingly probable. Market Sentiment: The positive sentiment generated by this analysis can itself become a self-fulfilling prophecy, attracting more buyers. It’s important to remember that while current data is positive, the crypto market is inherently volatile, and predictions are not guarantees. How Does TRX Fit into Broader Crypto Market Trends? Understanding the performance of TRX requires context within the broader crypto market . While Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead market cycles, altcoins like TRX can exhibit unique trends driven by their specific ecosystems and use cases. Currently, the overall crypto market sentiment is influenced by various factors, including: Macroeconomic conditions Regulatory developments Institutional adoption trends Technological advancements TRX’s ability to maintain bullish momentum despite potential market fluctuations or sector-specific rotations highlights its relative strength or unique market positioning, possibly due to its utility-driven demand and stablecoin infrastructure. Actionable Insights for TRX Holders and Potential Investors Given the current analysis indicating sustained TRX bullish momentum , what should you consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange flows, active addresses, and transaction volume on platforms like CryptoQuant for early signs of trend changes. Set Price Alerts: If you’re looking to enter or exit a position, setting price alerts can help you act quickly on market movements. Risk Management: Always employ sound risk management strategies. The absence of a top signal doesn’t eliminate the possibility of a sudden reversal. Use stop-loss orders if trading. Stay Informed: Follow updates from the TRON foundation, news related to the crypto market , and analyses from reputable sources. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This article provides insights based on available data and analysis, but it is not financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. The observation that high buying pressure isn’t currently leading to a peak is a significant point for the TRX price prediction . It suggests underlying strength that could propel the price higher. Conclusion: The Unfolding Story of TRX ‘s Ascent The narrative for TRX remains compelling. The persistent bullish momentum , validated by on-chain data from sources like CryptoQuant , indicates a market dynamic where strong demand is continuously absorbing buying pressure without the typical signs of exhaustion. While no price prediction is guaranteed in the volatile crypto market , the current technical and on-chain signals point towards potential for further upside for TRX . Keeping a close watch on market developments and managing risk are essential as this story unfolds.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.” Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.” He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets. Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: Cointelegraph Akshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?” He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.

Zooming out, the S&P 500’s average valuation has been gradually rising for decades, driven by factors such as low interest rates, growing corporate gains, and investor optimism about technology. However, high valuations have also coincided with periods of market corrections, like the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. S&P 500 P/E ratio since inception. Source: Multipl According to Akshay, a way to combat this overheating is to open up certain markets to retail investors, a lofty goal that some sectors of crypto, like RWA tokenization , aim to facilitate. Akshay noted that some entrepreneurs had tried this before, but the available technology didn’t support this view. “[Crypto] starts with the game, and very quickly becomes profound.” “What it gives you is the ability for you to financialize all the productive assets in an economy, so you can have anybody who participates in that economy be an owner of that economy,” he said.

Market Turns Green as Bitcoin Charges Past $111K—Here’s What That Means for Qubetics, XRP, and NEAR",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-buy-right-now-market-turns-green-as-bitcoin/,"Is the market flashing green for a reason or is it just another temporary push? Bitcoin’s breakout past $111,861 has reignited bullish momentum across the board, pushing the crypto market back into price discovery territory. As reported today, this surge isn’t isolated—it’s spilling into the broader market with Ethereum, Solana, and several other altcoins bouncing back as confidence returns. This shift is backed by a clear uptick in trading activity and liquidity as macro sentiment stabilizes and crypto-specific narratives take center stage. In moments like this, coins with a strong foundational thesis and ongoing development cycles typically outperform—making timing, narrative, and utility more crucial than ever. Qubetics , currently in its structured presale stage, stands out for exactly those reasons: its strong ecosystem utility and clear roadmap offer a different kind of value play in a momentum-driven market. While many crypto projects are still catching up to real-world integration, Qubetics ($TICS) is already solving long-standing issues that past tokens couldn’t fully address. By offering a decentralized VPN built directly into its ecosystem, Qubetics answers growing concerns around online privacy, data monopolies, and censorship. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining traction as major wallet holders are increasingly aligning with global payment firms, and Near Protocol is being rated “very bullish” by nearly half of its user base. These signs of activity across the board point to a market where fundamentals are beginning to matter again. In this context, understanding how Qubetics compares alongside XRP and Near offers a clear perspective on identifying the best crypto to buy right now—not just for short-term surges but for long-term functionality and adaptability. The Real-World Case for Qubetics: How Its dVPN Is Solving Privacy Issues at Scale Qubetics is going beyond speculative tokenomics to address practical internet problems—starting with online privacy. Its decentralized VPN (dVPN) operates through a peer-to-peer blockchain protocol that doesn’t rely on centralized data routing. Unlike traditional VPN services that may log user data or be forced to comply with government surveillance demands, Qubetics’ dVPN offers censorship-resistant connectivity with no single point of failure. This makes it especially beneficial for journalists in high-censorship regions, remote professionals needing secure cross-border access, or even enterprise firms looking to decentralize their cybersecurity frameworks. By rewarding bandwidth providers through $TICS tokens, Qubetics also builds an incentive structure that naturally supports service stability and reach—without relying on centralized vendors. For example, a freelance researcher in a politically restricted country could use Qubetics’ dVPN to bypass firewalls without fear of being traced, as traffic routing is anonymized and encrypted. Similarly, a U.S.-based startup dealing with confidential IP could ensure its data remains outside third-party access points. What sets Qubetics apart is the added benefit of multi-hop routing and complete encryption—both user identity and usage logs are protected from all forms of tracing. And since the protocol is open and self-sustaining, it aligns with broader Web3 goals of sovereignty and user ownership. This makes Qubetics not just a speculative presale—it’s an application-driven network that’s actually shaping how privacy-first internet infrastructure could look. That’s why it continues to gain momentum in a market now leaning heavily toward utility-driven tokens—and it positions Qubetics as the best crypto to buy right now for users seeking more than just market exposure. Qubetics Presale Hits Stage 35 with $17.2M Raised and 513M Tokens Sold—Next Price Hike in 7 Days The Qubetics presale isn’t just another crypto campaign—it’s a fully structured rollout with predictable progression and real-world integration. Currently in Stage 35, Qubetics tokens are priced at $0.2785. With over 513 million $TICS sold, more than $17.2 million raised, and over 26,800 holders onboard, this presale reflects more than speculative excitement—it reflects community trust. Each presale stage lasts exactly 7 days, and prices increase by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, ensuring that early adopters are consistently rewarded for their timing. With the mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, this phase offers a timely opportunity to buy before exchange listings and utility unlocks begin. For those calculating returns, the upside is substantial. At current prices, an investment of $5,000 translates into 17,950 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s $17,950 back—already a 258.95% ROI. At a $5 price point, the same bag delivers $89,750 (1,694.74% ROI), and if it reaches $15 post-mainnet, the same investment becomes $269,250, marking a 5,284.21% ROI. These projections aren’t random guesses—they’re based on actual sales structure and historical returns from tokens with utility-focused launches. This structured system, coupled with the growing interest in privacy solutions, makes Qubetics presale a standout among many offerings right now. That’s why it holds weight in the conversation around the best crypto to buy right now , especially for those exploring utility-based early-stage entries in the best crypto presale space. XRP Whale Activity Heats Up as PayFi Pushes Toward Global Remittance Integration XRP has captured fresh attention after a series of whale moves aligned with emerging payment infrastructure. According to a May 22 update, multiple top XRP holders are now becoming affiliated with Remittix, a fintech platform aiming to power cross-border transactions through the blockchain. Simultaneously, PayFi—a separate payments entity—has started using XRP’s ledger to explore frictionless global settlements. These are not minor partnerships; both platforms are considered to be at the forefront of transforming international value transfer, a space that Ripple Labs has long aimed to dominate. This activity follows a sustained effort by Ripple to rebuild after regulatory headwinds. Now that legal battles have subsided and institutions are warming back up to Ripple’s offerings, the use of XRP for real-world remittances may be on track to expand faster than expected. Such partnerships suggest a higher transaction volume and more consistent liquidity in the months to come, which is particularly relevant for those watching XRP’s role beyond speculation. The move also points to a shift in strategy—from platform-level integrations to user-level adoption—putting XRP in an increasingly relevant position within the global payments infrastructure. Near Protocol Scores “Very Bullish” Sentiment as Price Forecast Shows Steady Rebound Near Protocol is showing signs of resilience despite broader market volatility. As of May 21, the token is trading around $2.83, with a +0.78% daily gain—small but meaningful during this kind of rebound phase. What’s more important is the platform’s long-term forecast: user-submitted projections suggest a potential 5% growth in the short term, with a steady upward trajectory through 2030. The current sentiment score reveals that 49.12% of participants rated NEAR as “Very Bullish,” supported by consistent engagement across Near’s application ecosystem and its scalable tech stack. This sentiment trend is notable considering the market had recently experienced stagnation among mid-cap tokens. NEAR, however, has continued to show upward price momentum and strong community trust. This level of consistent bullish sentiment often precedes heavier institutional interest, particularly in protocols offering both developer tooling and end-user simplicity. The combination of organic adoption, positive user perception, and realistic growth expectations places NEAR in a strong category of layer-1 tokens that aren’t driven solely by temporary market surges. As Bitcoin Surges, Market Stability Improves—But Long-Term Picks Still Matter Today’s crypto market trend—Bitcoin’s clean break above $111,861—is more than just a price headline. It’s the kind of event that resets sentiment and pulls liquidity into both majors and altcoins. With broader green candles appearing across charts, it’s clear this shift is breathing new life into previously sluggish portfolios. For XRP, it adds a tailwind to institutional remittance adoption. For NEAR, it reinforces community confidence, which is already trending high. And for Qubetics—which is currently in presale—this macro movement validates its long-term thesis. Unlike many tokens tied to hype cycles, Qubetics offers structural stability due to its fixed weekly 10% price jumps, giving early buyers a predictable growth runway. Conclusion: Why Now’s the Moment to Watch These Three From XRP’s strategic positioning in global payments to Near Protocol’s steady bullish sentiment and Qubetics’ utility-backed growth path, each of these projects presents a timely opportunity in the current bullish cycle. What separates them from short-term plays is the presence of real integrations, measured adoption, and clear incentive structures. XRP is finally seeing strategic traction post-litigation, NEAR is riding high on trust and consistent performance forecasts, and Qubetics is building an infrastructure layer for digital privacy—something the crypto space needs now more than ever. For those watching the charts while evaluating substance, these three deserve a deeper look. For those eyeing early-phase utility projects with proven ROI systems and ecosystem potential, this is the right time to join this best crypto presale and experience what may soon be one of the best crypto to buy right now.

While Bitcoin and Litecoin continue to anchor the market, all eyes are now on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum—each presenting compelling reasons to believe that a staggering 10,000% return could be within reach for early adopters. Among these, MAGACOIN PRESALE’s presale is rapidly becoming the focal point for those seeking the next crypto phenomenon. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Sensation With Monumental Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is electrifying the crypto sphere as its presale approaches a critical juncture, having already surpassed $8 million in contributions. With each stage filling faster than the last and the entry price still under $0.001, market forecasters are signaling a potential windfall of 10,000% or more for those who position themselves early. The project’s limited supply of 100 billion tokens, combined with rigorous security audits and a politically charged narrative, is sparking a frenzy of both retail and institutional interest. As the countdown to the $0.007 listing ticks on, MAGA is emerging as a once-in-a-cycle chance for exponential returns—a prospect that is drawing comparisons to the meteoric rises of other viral tokens, but with enhanced transparency and strategic tokenomics. XRP: Surging Confidence and Institutional Tailwinds XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism, currently priced above $2.30 and bolstered by regulatory victories and the introduction of CME futures. Market strategists anticipate a climb toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bold outlooks even eyeing $4.50 if current trends persist. The resolution of Ripple’s legal battles and the green light for institutional participation have cleared the path for broader adoption. While XRP’s trajectory is undeniably positive, the allure of early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—where the runway for explosive gains remains wide open—is proving irresistible to forward-thinking investors. Ethereum: Robust Tech and Expanding Horizons Ethereum continues to stand as a pillar of innovation, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 amidst ongoing network enhancements and growing institutional engagement. Despite market fluctuations, ETH’s technical foundation remains sound, with analysts projecting a move toward $3,000 and potentially beyond as upgrades and adoption accelerate. Some visionary forecasts even hint at a five-figure future, though such a leap would require a seismic shift in market dynamics. While Ethereum offers a stable and proven platform, the most ambitious capital is gravitating toward high-growth presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the promise of outsized returns is impossible to ignore. Bitcoin and Litecoin: Steady Hands in a Volatile Market Bitcoin maintains its dominance, trading above $100,000 and attracting unprecedented institutional inflows. Analysts suggest that a push toward $120,000 or higher is plausible if bullish sentiment endures. Litecoin, meanwhile, remains a reliable presence, offering stability and liquidity in a market often defined by turbulence. Yet, as savvy investors pivot toward higher-reward opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is emerging as the destination of choice for those aiming to ride the next wave of crypto wealth creation. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Closing Thoughts Analysts are unanimous in highlighting the extraordinary potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum as the market gears up for a possible 10,000% rally. With MAGA’s presale nearing its final stages, a fixed $0.007 listing price, and a community growing by the day, the project is commanding attention as the standout early-stage play of 2025. For those seeking to capitalize on the next major crypto breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the clear frontrunner.

If this trend continues, BTC may see further price appreciation in the near term. Buyers Regain Control Of Bitcoin Spot Market According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by crypto analyst ibrahimcosar, buyers appear to be dominating the BTC spot market. The analyst observed that the Bitcoin Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has shifted back into green territory. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD measures the difference between taker buy and taker sell volumes on spot exchanges over time. A rising Spot Taker CVD indicates that aggressive buyers are dominating the market, signalling potential bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market – New ATH Soon? BTC Spot Taker CVD turning green is signficant. Most notably, it means buy orders have regained dominance after an extended period in which sell orders led the market. A higher volume of buy orders over time suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum may persist. As shown in the chart shared by ibrahimcosar, the CVD remained mostly red for the majority of Q1 2025 – indicating strong selling pressure. This selling behavior aligned with BTC’s price action, which saw the asset fall from its previous ATH in January to a low of around $76,000 in April. The fact that BTC’s Spot Taker CVD has turned green while the asset is setting fresh ATHs makes this trend especially noteworthy. It indicates that buyers are willing to accumulate BTC even at historically high prices, likely in anticipation of continued upside. That said, recent price action might temporarily interrupt BTC’s momentum. In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that BTC could soon break down from its current range of $110,400 to $111,100. A Different Kind Of Rally Typically, BTC hitting a new ATH is usually met with wider market euphoria, leading to a sharp price decline that catches most investors off-guard. However, experts opine that the current rally is different from previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk suggests that new and short-term BTC investors are sitting on substantial unrealized profits, and not showing any signs of panic selling amid the cryptocurrency’s price surge to new highs. Similarly, whale reaction to BTC’s bullish price trajectory has been mixed. While new whales have been taking major profits during the ongoing rally, old whales have resisted selling their holdings, showing minimal selling activity. Finally, the neutral funding rates in the BTC futures market reinforce the idea that the current rally is more organic and less driven by speculation than those in the past. At press time, BTC trades at $108,553, down 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

While BTC’s ascent captures headlines, savvy investors are increasingly directing attention toward altcoins with explosive growth potential—notably MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana. With XRP and Ethereum also posting strong technicals, the stage is set for a dynamic period of gains across the digital asset landscape. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon With 25x–35x Potential While Bitcoin’s trajectory is impressive, the most aggressive capital is flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly establishing itself as 2025’s leading presale opportunity. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion, analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum persists. The project’s capped supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation by both retail and institutional investors. As each stage fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGA is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with enhanced transparency and scarcity-driven tokenomics. Bitcoin: The Macro Beacon With Unprecedented Momentum Bitcoin has recently shattered records, trading above $111,000 amid a wave of institutional inflows, corporate adoption, and robust ETF demand. Analysts now suggest that a sustained rally could propel BTC to $200,000 by year-end, driven by a combination of macroeconomic tailwinds, reduced supply post-halving, and global liquidity expansion. The options market reflects this bullish outlook, with traders placing bets on BTC reaching $300,000 by June. As Bitcoin solidifies its role as digital gold, the market’s risk appetite is broadening—opening the door for high-upside altcoin plays. Solana: Technical Breakout and Ecosystem Growth Solana is another standout, with its price consolidating between $158 and $175 as it builds momentum for the next leg higher. Analysts are eyeing a breakout above $175, which could open the door to a retest of $183 and beyond. Long-term forecasts suggest SOL could reach $240–$270 later in 2025, supported by robust DeFi activity, developer engagement, and whale accumulation. As Solana’s ecosystem matures, the network is attracting both institutional attention and speculative capital, making it a top pick for those seeking significant gains alongside Bitcoin. XRP and Ethereum: Strong Fundamentals and Upside Catalysts XRP is trading above $2.30, buoyed by legal clarity, the launch of CME futures, and ongoing ETF speculation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85–$3.40 in the near term, with some optimistic scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if bullish momentum persists. Ethereum, meanwhile, remains the backbone of DeFi and Web3, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades. Some analysts project ETH could reach $6,700 by year-end if institutional adoption and network improvements continue to accelerate. While both XRP and ETH offer stability and long-term value, the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. Near Protocol: Building Momentum for the Next Cycle Near Protocol (NEAR) is quietly building momentum, trading near $2.93 and showing strong technicals and developer activity. Analysts expect NEAR to stabilize at current levels before pushing higher in 2026, with long-term forecasts suggesting significant growth as the network’s scalability and ecosystem attract more users. While NEAR is a dependable hold, the most dramatic returns are currently being sought in presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin’s journey toward $200,000 is igniting market-wide confidence, but the real action is unfolding in high-upside altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are positioned for significant gains, with MAGA’s presale momentum and Solana’s technical strength drawing both retail and institutional capital. XRP and Ethereum remain core holdings, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender of 2025. As Bitcoin leads the charge, the window for early entry into the next crypto supercycle is closing fast.

This strategic focus on functionality and community engagement is attracting significant whale interest, signaling a shift towards more utility-driven meme coins. INPEPE’s Origins Uncovered: A Forgotten Founder Returns to Reclaim the Meme Throne Insiders suggest that a co-founder of the original Pepe coin, who was sidelined before its meteoric rise, is now leading the INPEPE project.

The Math Doesn’t Lie: INPEPE’s 100x Path Looks Realer by the Day With a current price of $0.0000002051 per token, INPEPE presents a compelling opportunity for early investors. The project’s presale has already raised over $150,000 out of a $505,881 goal, indicating strong market interest. Analysts suggest that if INPEPE reaches price levels comparable to established memecoins like PEPE, investors could realize returns exceeding 60 times their initial investment. Additionally, INPEPE offers a staking reward of up to 4754% APY, incentivizing long-term holding and contributing to supply scarcity. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is rapidly emerging as a next-generation memecoin, strategically placed at the crossroads of Web3 innovation and the thriving $25+ billion influencer economy. Unlike conventional meme coins, INPEPE is designed to serve as the primary currency for influencer transactions.

Legacy tokens like Polkadot and Polygon are starting to face hesitation, weighed down by technical hurdles and market uncertainty. Amid this shift, Unstaked ($UNSD) is emerging with a fresh narrative. Backed by artificial intelligence, DeFi-based incentives, and over $6.8 million in presale funding, it is capturing the attention of both retail participants and large wallet holders. Its platform rewards smart engagement and outlines a roadmap focused on long-term Web3 utility. With a current presale stage 14 price of $0.009545 and a projected launch value of $0.1819, Unstaked offers ROIs of up to 27x for early holders. As Polkadot and Polygon struggle to regain momentum, Unstaked is quickly gaining ground in the race for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Polkadot Struggles to Hold Gains Ahead of ETF Rulings Polkadot saw a 30% surge that lifted DOT above $5.30, but the momentum quickly faded as the price fell back to around $4.82. This move came just ahead of critical ETF decisions from the U.S. SEC, with Grayscale’s verdict expected on June 11 and 21Shares following on June 24. These decisions could serve as a spark or further suppress the current drift. Technically, DOT is trading below the Ichimoku Cloud, suggesting bearish sentiment. RSI has slipped below the neutral zone, and support at $4.45 is now under pressure. With capital inflows slowing, traders are approaching DOT with increased caution while exploring new high-upside alternatives. Polygon’s zkEVM Upgrade Could Shape POL’s Long-Term Value Polygon is progressing with its zkEVM rollout, a key step in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap aimed at improving scalability and reducing gas fees. This upgrade positions the network as a powerful Layer 2 solution for Ethereum and supports its transition from MATIC to the newly launched POL token, which is trading near $0.258. Price forecasts vary across platforms. CoinCodex expects a small climb to $0.27, while Coinpedia predicts $0.47 over the next year. DigitalCoinPrice offers the boldest target at $3.91 by late 2025. As adoption of the Agglayer Breakout Program expands, real-world traction will be the deciding factor for POL’s growth. New AI Coin Unstaked Goes Viral with 27x ROI & $1M Giveaway Unstaked is making waves in a market dominated by legacy networks chasing ETF approvals and technical upgrades. With $6.8 million raised and a presale price of $0.009545 in stage 14, the project stands out by offering a clear path to a $0.1819 launch value. That scenario presents ROIs of up to 27x, giving early participants a compelling reason to pay attention. The platform operates on a Proof of Intelligence model, which shifts rewards away from passive holding and toward informed, quality-driven participation. Users earn based on decisions and engagement, creating a system that feels more like an evolving ecosystem than a typical crypto launch. This intelligent structure adds long-term credibility to Unstaked’s model. The roadmap outlines future integration with utility-driven dApps, access to DeFi tools, and a strong emphasis on liquidity protection. These features are designed to reduce manipulation and encourage steady growth. Looking ahead, Unstaked also plans to scale into core Web3 functions such as decentralized identity, secure data exchange, and governance systems. Driving community energy is a $1,000,000 giveaway. Twenty winners will each receive $50,000 in $UNSD, with entry based on completing tasks, referrals, and a $100 contribution. Unstaked is quickly becoming a serious entry in the best crypto to buy 2025 conversation, powered by real structure and smart engagement. The Future of Crypto Polkadot’s ETF potential and Polygon’s zkEVM rollout may dominate headlines, but neither offers the immediate clarity or user-centric design that Unstaked brings. DOT is showing signs of slowing, and POL’s future depends heavily on broader adoption, which remains uncertain in the near term. Unstaked, on the other hand, is gaining real traction with over $6.8 million raised, a 27x return projection, and a Web3 roadmap that prioritizes utility and intelligence. For those exploring the best crypto to buy in 2025, Unstaked is no longer just an early-stage contender. It is building the foundation for something far more impactful.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Are Leading the Political Crypto Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/500-to-1m-magacoin-finance-bitcoin-and-xrp-are-leading-the-political-crypto-surge/,"A new era is dawning in the crypto world, where political narratives and market momentum are converging to create extraordinary opportunities. While Bitcoin remains the bedrock of digital finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are surging ahead as the vanguard of a political crypto movement. With Solana and Aptos also in the mix, early investors are positioning for what could be the most lucrative cycle yet—where a modest $500 investment might just pave the way to a million-dollar windfall. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Meme Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just another meme token; it’s a cultural force driving the 2025 political memecoin boom. Unlike fleeting trends that fade as quickly as they rise, MAGA stands out by combining a compelling political identity with real market traction and community engagement. The project’s presale has already attracted thousands of buyers and raised millions, with analysts projecting 25x–35x returns for those who enter before the $0.007 listing. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to sustain attention and volume—turning viral energy into lasting momentum. Built-in upside mechanics, a scarcity-focused supply, and a grassroots-driven community are fueling organic demand and real transaction activity. As traders migrate from established coins like XRP and SHIBA, MAGA is rapidly becoming the go-to destination for those seeking the next crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin: The Foundation of the Crypto Revolution Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, trading above $100,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors and ETFs. Analysts forecast a possible run to $116,000–$137,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. As Bitcoin solidifies its role as digital gold, its strength provides a stable backdrop for the explosive growth of political and narrative-driven altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum XRP is riding a wave of optimism, buoyed by regulatory breakthroughs, ETF speculation, and strong technical momentum. Currently trading above $2.30, XRP has surged more than 300% since late 2024 and is now poised for further gains. Analysts project a move to $2.80–$3.40 by June, with some scenarios even eyeing $5.50 by year-end if adoption accelerates. With pending ETF proposals and growing institutional interest, XRP is positioned for a supply shock that could drive prices to new highs. The combination of regulatory clarity, real-world utility, and political tailwinds makes XRP a core holding for those betting on the next phase of crypto adoption. Solana and Aptos: Technical Strength in a Shifting Market Solana remains a top Layer-1 contender, with robust DeFi activity and developer engagement supporting its price near $170. Aptos, meanwhile, is gaining traction with network upgrades and expanding partnerships. Both tokens offer strong fundamentals, but for investors seeking the highest upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is where the real action lies.

The space is seeing renewed interest with investors pouring into coins that blend hype with community rewards. Web3 ai is grabbing headlines with a $777K giveaway, open to anyone holding a minimum of $100 worth of $WAI in its ongoing presale. Dogecoin holds its position as a meme giant, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 launch is gaining traction, and Pepe keeps returning to the spotlight with its surprise market movements. Each of these projects is driving serious buzz. Among them, Web3 ai stands tall by mixing viral appeal with long-term use cases. Together, these four are shaping what many consider the top cryptos to buy now. Web3 ai ($WAI): $100 Qualifies for $777K Prize Pool and 1,747% ROI Web3 ai is changing how crypto presales are perceived. With a huge $777,000 giveaway and a low entry of at least $100, the project is turning heads among both new buyers and experienced traders. This low-barrier format gives regular users a chance to enter something that feels exclusive, like a jackpot. This model triggers viral appeal, similar to lottery mechanics, but with more than just luck involved. Unlike random prizes, entering the giveaway means becoming a $WAI holder, and that comes with genuine potential. Priced at $0.000383 in stage 6, it targets a listing at $0.005242, which equals an ROI of up to 1747%. So far, it has brought in nearly $5 million in presale funding. With only a $100 purchase needed to qualify and 10 winners sharing the giveaway, the excitement is spreading quickly. Web3 ai shows that success doesn’t require billion-dollar support, just the right mix of tools, timing, and vision. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community-Driven Meme Coin Dogecoin’s name remains strong thanks to its loyal fan base and unmatched popularity. While it started as a joke, DOGE now has a real place in the crypto world, with notable mentions from Elon Musk and speculation about possible integration with X. In 2025, meme coin excitement is back, and DOGE is once again gaining attention. For many, its brand power and community size make it one of the top cryptos to buy now. Though its wild 100x days might be over, it still has the strength to climb during retail-driven bull waves. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Real Ecosystem With Growing Features Shiba Inu’s growth story is no longer just about memes. It has launched Shibarium, a Layer 2 chain, and is now adding staking, governance features, and virtual world components. The “ShibArmy” continues to push for more adoption and development. In the search for top cryptos to buy now, SHIB is evolving into a serious Web3 player. With Ethereum’s high gas fees, Shibarium could draw more users. At its still-low price, SHIB offers potential for those seeking affordable entry into a growing platform. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Energy Still Turning Heads in 2025 Pepe came into the spotlight with its wild moves in 2023, and it’s not done yet. Its strength lies in its pure meme energy and unpredictable price action, earning listings on major exchanges. Pepe’s link to internet culture sets it apart. While risky, that very nature makes it one of the top cryptos to buy now. The coin’s price jumps catch many off guard, rewarding those who act fast. For those who thrive on volatility, Pepe may be both the wildest and most profitable play. Final Thoughts The strongest contenders in 2025 aren’t winning just by building tech, they’re gaining by standing out, exciting users, and offering real incentives. Web3 ai is drawing attention through its $777K giveaway and user-first design, showing how presales can build momentum by appealing to everyday buyers. Meanwhile, Dogecoin enjoys legacy status and loyalty, Shiba Inu is turning into a real DeFi project with Shibarium, and Pepe taps meme culture to fuel surprise runs. These projects prove that the top cryptos to buy now are those that connect with people, deliver excitement, and reward early support.

A lot of analysts and crypto fans believe it’s coming, but some are also convinced that when it does arrive, it will be the biggest one yet. One of those is Dan Krupka, head of Coin Bureau Research. He shared a video on Coin Bureau Trading’s YouTube channel, sharing his thoughts and expertise on why this altcoin season just might explode (in a good way). For starters, Krupka outlines spot Ethereum ETF approvals and rate cuts by the Fed, which are expected to come late this year. Additionally, crypto-friendly sentiment is increasing, especially in the US, adding fuel to the possibility of an altcoin season. Plus, the potential ETF applications for Solana, Layer-2 innovations, and growing user bases on new chains could all play an important role in a possibly huge altcoin season.

Neither avenue is supportive of employment growth.” The economists say that reshoring manufacturing jobs would likely take “many years and come at high cost.” “US labor costs are a hurdle. Labor cost differentials with the rest of the world require US manufacturing firms to be highly capital-intensive to compete in a global marketplace. Thus, an expansion in manufacturing employment would require significant capital investment. In order for manufacturing employment to return to its historic peak, we estimate at a minimum $2.9 trillion in net new capital investment is required. While sizable, we view this estimate as a lower-bound. The build out of new of capacity would likely unfold over multiple years, with further increases in capital intensity and inflation requiring a higher amount.” The Wells Fargo analysts also note that lower fertility rates and a recent reduction in immigration could negatively impact working-age population growth.

While ETH’s technicals and upgrades are drawing institutional eyes, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are already surging ahead—capturing both speculative capital and analyst acclaim. With Bitcoin anchoring the market and Kaspa quietly building, the stage is set for a summer of high-stakes gains and strategic positioning. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Frontrunner With Unrivaled Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the rules for early-stage crypto projects, commanding attention with a presale that has already surpassed $8 million and continues to shatter expectations. Analysts are not just bullish—they’re calling MAGA the breakout contender of 2025, with forecasts of up to 18,500% returns and a possible $1 valuation by year-end. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are driving a groundswell of demand from both retail and institutional investors. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing looms, MAGA is rapidly becoming the definitive early-stage play for those seeking life-changing upside. Solana: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is not just holding its ground—it’s accelerating, with price action consolidating between $158 and $175 and technicals hinting at a breakout above $175 to retest $183. Analysts are eyeing a summer run toward $200 and beyond, fueled by robust DeFi activity, developer traction, and whale accumulation. The network’s speed, low fees, and expanding ecosystem make it a magnet for both speculative and long-term capital. As Solana’s momentum builds, it’s clear that the smartest traders are already positioned for the next leg up. Ethereum: On the Brink of a Major Milestone Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators and bullish sentiment pointing to a potential surge past $3,000 in the coming weeks. The 50-day EMA, rising RSI, and recent bounce from key support levels all signal a robust uptrend. Analysts project that a sustained move above $2,700 could open the door to $2,900 and beyond, with some forecasts even targeting $3,200 by late summer. As Ethereum’s upgrades and institutional adoption continue to unfold, ETH remains a cornerstone for both stability and growth. Bitcoin and Kaspa: Steady Anchors in a Dynamic Market Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto universe, trading above $100,000 and drawing unprecedented institutional inflows. Forecasts suggest a possible run to $120,000 and beyond in the near term, with BTC’s strength providing a stable backdrop for altcoin surges. Kaspa, meanwhile, is quietly building momentum, with bullish technicals and a growing community of supporters. While KAS may not match the explosive presale potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, its steady progress and scalability make it a reliable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Ethereum’s bid for $3,000 is capturing headlines, but the real action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana—where early-stage momentum and analyst optimism are already delivering outsized gains. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion and Solana’s technicals pointing higher, the window for transformative returns is wide open.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days. May 30 Bitcoin options open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.ch The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry. Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels. Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.ch Among the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price. Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price decline If Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches. The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions . Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions. Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust. Ultimately, bears’ main hope lies in a weaker macroeconomic environment, which could increase risk aversion and reduce demand for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin bulls aim for $110,000 by May 30 Below are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies. Between $102k and $105k: $2.75 billion in calls (buy) vs. $900 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $1.85 billion. Between $105k and $107k: $3.3 billion calls vs. $650 million puts, favoring calls by $2.65 billion. Between $107k and $110k: $3.7 billion calls vs. $350 million puts, favoring calls by $3.35 billion. Between $110k and $114k: $4.8 billion calls vs. $120 million puts, favoring calls by $4.7 billion. Bulls can maximize their gains by driving BTC above $110,000, which could help set a new all-time high. However, the ongoing bullish momentum depends on developments in the ongoing tariff war, which has been a key focus in recent weeks.

While Bitcoin remains the bedrock of digital finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are rapidly emerging as favored destinations for smart capital. With XRP and TRON also seeing notable inflows, the current cycle is defined by a flight to quality and momentum, as investors position for the next wave of outsized returns. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Magnet Drawing Major Whales MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the standout presale of 2025, with whale wallets quietly amassing large positions ahead of the project’s public debut. The presale has already surpassed $8 million, and analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation—both from retail and institutional investors. Notably, even holders of XRP and Aptos are rotating profits into MAGA, eager to capitalize on what could be the most explosive early-stage opportunity of the year. As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as a rare ground-floor entry for those seeking transformative gains. Bitcoin: Whales Double Down as Retail Exits Bitcoin is experiencing a dramatic redistribution of holdings, with whales and institutions quietly accumulating while retail investors take profits. Between mid-April and mid-May, large holders increased their BTC positions by over 83,000 coins, signaling robust confidence in the market’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin’s price currently hovers above $100,000, and analysts forecast a possible surge toward $115,000–$140,000 in the near term. The options market is even more bullish, with bets on BTC reaching $200,000 by year-end. This silent accumulation by whales and institutions underscores Bitcoin’s enduring appeal as a core holding, while also highlighting the growing appetite for high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana: Whale Buys Signal Unshakable Confidence Solana is another top target for whale accumulation, with large investors withdrawing over 145,000 SOL (worth $21.8 million) from exchanges in recent weeks. On-chain data reveals that two wallets—likely controlled by the same entity—have scooped up more than 250,000 SOL (valued at $60 million) in the past month. This aggressive buying is a clear vote of confidence in Solana’s technical strength, DeFi ecosystem, and long-term growth prospects. Analysts are targeting the $200 level as a near-term milestone, with forecasts suggesting further upside as institutional adoption accelerates. Solana’s robust fundamentals and expanding developer activity make it a standout among Layer-1 platforms, drawing both speculative and long-term capital. XRP and TRON: Steady Accumulation, But MAGA Steals the Show XRP continues to attract whale attention, with over 880 million tokens accumulated in May alone as regulatory clarity and institutional adoption fuel optimism. Analysts project a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if sentiment remains strong. TRON, meanwhile, is seeing steady accumulation and remains a reliable hold for those seeking stable returns. However, neither XRP nor TRON can match the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly becoming the go-to allocation for whales seeking the next crypto supercycle. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Whale accumulation is intensifying across the crypto market, with MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and Solana emerging as the top targets for smart capital. MAGA’s presale is drawing unprecedented interest, Bitcoin’s macro strength is unshaken, and Solana’s technicals are signaling further upside. As the window for early entry narrows, these tokens are setting the tone for the next phase of crypto growth—offering investors a rare chance to ride the wave of outsized returns.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale, with a token price of $0.03 and a confirmed launch price of $0.06. That means early backers are already positioned for 100% upside even before the token reaches public exchanges. But the price itself isn’t the headline — it’s what’s being built behind the scenes. With over $9,1 million raised and more than 11,000 holders already participating, the presale reflects growing belief in the project’s design, roadmap, and future token performance. As more investors search for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, the MUTM presale is gaining traction not from buzz — but from a clear path to utility. Lending and Borrowing With Real Yield Potential At the heart of Mutuum’s protocol is a decentralized system for lending and borrowing digital assets. Here’s how it works: Lenders deposit supported assets into smart contract pools and receive mtTokens — digital tokens that represent their deposits and grow in value as borrowers pay interest. Borrowers provide collateral and access liquidity without selling their original assets. The protocol uses a Loan-to-Value (LTV) model to calculate how much can be borrowed, helping protect lenders and balance the system. For example, a user could deposit stablecoins to earn passive income through interest-bearing returns, while another user borrows against their crypto holdings to fund short-term opportunities — all on-chain, without intermediaries. This model brings utility to the token ecosystem and gives real function to MUTM beyond trading — a critical factor in long-term crypto investing. Utilities That Will Drive Future Demand Mutuum isn’t stopping at lending. The team is also developing a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin — one that will be backed entirely by assets held within the protocol. This stablecoin will be algorithmically controlled, ensuring stability and transparency while generating revenue through borrowing activity. That revenue becomes part of a broader buy-and-redistribute system. As revenue is generated through interest and user activity on the platform, a designated share will be allocated toward acquiring MUTM tokens directly from public markets. These tokens are then redistributed to mtToken holders — creating a system that rewards long-term participation and increases token demand organically. It’s a self-sustaining model that supports price growth through platform activity. And with each new feature planned for post-launch, the value proposition for MUTM continues to expand. With a beta platform set to launch alongside the token, early users will be able to interact with key lending and borrowing features from the beginning — a rare advantage for presale participants. This immediate access puts MUTM in a different category from many new tokens that launch first, then build. The upside isn’t theoretical. As more investors look beyond high-cap coins and into top crypto coins under $1, tokens like MUTM offer something critical: real structure with future earnings potential. And with infrastructure like Layer-2 scaling being built in, Mutuum Finance is addressing both cost-efficiency and user experience from the start. Many early investors from ecosystems like Solana and Tron have already joined the Mutuum presale — not because of hype, but because of vision. With its protocol design, stablecoin integration, and planned token rewards, the project is assembling a complete DeFi structure while the token remains accessible. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now before the next market breakout, MUTM is proving that you don’t need to chase trending coins to find long-term value — you just need to look where the structure is being built.

While popular names still lead charts, the latest shift shows strong gains from both meme projects and fresh Layer 1 networks. Utility, global access, and exchange support are setting the pace this year. In this article, we cover four standout names: BlockDAG (BDAG), Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE). From presale strength to whale buying and bullish chart setups, each one is catching serious traction. Whether you’re eyeing a quick flip or long-term upside, these are the altcoins to watch right now. BlockDAG: $0.0020 Frozen Price Before GO LIVE on June 13 BlockDAG is making headlines as one of the altcoins to watch for 2025. Its presale has already pulled in over $264 million, with more than 21 billion BDAG coins sold. Buyers still have access to the fixed $0.0020 entry until June 13, offering a potential 2,400% profit with the launch price set at $0.05. This isn’t just another presale. BlockDAG is fully EVM-compatible, meaning developers can easily port or launch Ethereum dApps on its fast, low-cost Layer 1 setup. That opens the door to major dApp migration and adoption. And with a strong focus on infrastructure, this project has legs beyond market hype. The June 13 GO LIVE reveal will confirm 15 new exchange listings, in addition to MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com already onboard. The testnet is active, the X1 Miner App has over 1 million users, and 17,000+ ASIC miners have been distributed. With serious development, accessibility, and exchange support, BlockDAG stands apart from hype-driven names. It’s not just another trend. It’s one of the altcoins to watch with real substance and massive upside. Pepe (PEPE): Price Action and Utility Fuel New Growth Pepe is proving it belongs on the list of altcoins to watch this May. It’s trading near $0.00001277 and showing a 13% gain in the last seven days. Analysts expect a potential jump to $0.000030 based on bullish chart patterns. Its upcoming Ethereum-based AI token, MIND of Pepe, has stirred more interest. Though it’s down from its December high of $0.00002824, PEPE is still nearly 5x up year-over-year. With strong community support and a growing development team, Pepe is evolving beyond its meme origins. If the current momentum continues, Pepe could remain one of the altcoins to watch throughout Q2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Whale Accumulation Sends a Signal Shiba Inu continues to gain traction, making it a strong candidate among altcoins to watch. It currently trades around $0.00001558, with May bringing a 16% increase. Analysts are closely watching after whales picked up more than 530 trillion SHIB. This activity points to a possible supply crunch that could lift prices toward $0.000025. While some drop-off has been seen on the Shibarium network, overall outlook remains positive. SHIB may finally break out of its extended consolidation. Those tracking altcoins to watch are monitoring this closely. If SHIB clears its resistance levels, it might unlock the upside that’s been building for months. Dogecoin (DOGE): Bullish Chart Sets Up Possible Rally Dogecoin is flashing bullish signals and stands out among altcoins to watch. The coin trades near $0.2462, with technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout. A bull pennant and a strong RSI reading suggest DOGE may climb toward the $0.45 range. Despite recent whale sell-offs totaling $40 million, trading volumes are rising. This could signal renewed confidence in DOGE’s price movement. Memecoins tend to thrive in waves, and Dogecoin’s large following gives it an edge when retail buyers return. Its liquidity, brand recognition, and new use cases keep it relevant. As the charts align, DOGE is holding its place as one of the altcoins to watch this season. Final Thought Altcoins to watch in 2025 come in different forms. Pepe brings AI and price momentum. SHIB has sparked attention through whale accumulation. DOGE shows clear bullish patterns. Each coin offers a different strength, from community backing to chart appeal. But BlockDAG is more than momentum. It offers tech, adoption readiness, and a solid roadmap. With $264 million raised and over 21 billion coins sold, its $0.0020 price remains frozen until June 13. With a $0.05 launch price and the GO LIVE reveal set to unveil 15 more exchange listings, the timing could not be better. If you’re narrowing down the altcoins to watch right now, this mix of memecoins and a Layer 1 project gives both fun and function. From here, the next breakout could come fast, so staying early matters.

The altcoin has not only broken resistance levels but is currently maintaining a stronghold above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). BNB Price Set To Catapult To $1,000 With momentum building, Binance Coin (BNB) could be gearing up for a significant price move to $1,000, taking it well above all-time high levels. This forecast, published in an analysis report by TradingView crypto expert Unichartz, notes that the BNB price action has broken above a long-standing descending resistance line, indicated by the red line in the chart. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Releases Next Potential Targets For Cardano, Is $1 ADA Still Possible? The breakout from this downtrend signals the end of a multi-month consolidation phase and a potentially imminent trend reversal. More notably, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed a historical support-resistance zone marked in the shaded gray area around the $460 – $535 range, which previously acted as a ”battleground for bulls and bears.” This key level is now serving as a potential launchpad for further gains, reinforcing the BNB chart’s bullish structure. Moving forward, the 50 EMA, highlighted by the orange line in the chart, has repeatedly acted as a dynamic support for the BNB price during pullbacks. The TradingView analyst has revealed that on multiple occasions, BNB bounced off this moving average, confirming it as a reliable foundation for a potential rally. As long as the price continues to trade above this 50 EMA and within the reclaimed zone, Unichartz’s outlook for BNB remains optimistic. With sustained bullish momentum, a retest of the all-time high zone around $793 is likely. A successful breakout above this level could trigger a 45.99% climb toward the psychological $1,000 mark. BNB Bulls In Control As Price Aims For Fresh Breakout Market analyst Wise Crypto has issued a bullish forecast for the BNB price, anticipating a massive breakout that could see the altcoin surge above $700 soon. According to the analyst, several technical indicators and bullish developments are aligning in favor of this projected price surge. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says “Altseason Is Dawning” As Bitcoin Dominance Reaches HTF Resistance, What To Expect On the technical side, Wise Crypto pointed to indicators like the EMA, DMI, and Ichimoku Clouds flashing bullish. Fundamentally, the analyst emphasized Binance Coin’s growing Decentralized Exchange (DEX) volume. Notably, BNB’s DEX volume has skyrocketed by an impressive 85.66% increase within one week. The DEX trading volume saw a rise of about $34.85 billion, placing it well above its major competitors, Ethereum and Solana. Moreover, Wise Crypto has declared that BNB bulls have finally taken control, with the market trend demonstrating strength. Supported by positive technical indicators and growing DEX volume, the BNB price is expected to climb approximately 2.21% from its current price of $684.85 to reach $700 in the near term.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout performer, leveraging its political meme appeal and presale momentum to attract both retail and institutional capital. Meanwhile, XRP and Ethereum are experiencing renewed interest as investors seek refuge in projects with strong fundamentals and upside potential. With Bitcoin and Solana providing stability, the stage is set for a dynamic period of growth and strategic positioning. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Meme Powerhouse Defying Uncertainty MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the leading political-themed token of 2025, with its presale already surpassing $8 million and a price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Unlike generic memecoins that rely on fleeting hype, MAGA taps into deep-rooted political energy and American identity, building a community-driven movement that transcends typical crypto cycles. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and scarcity-driven model are fueling a surge in early-stage accumulation, with analysts projecting returns of 25x–35x or more by launch. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to maintain momentum even as broader markets react to political turbulence. The project’s grassroots support and strategic marketing have created a sense of urgency among investors, many of whom are rotating out of established altcoins to secure early entry before listings. As each presale stage fills, MAGA is solidifying its reputation as a breakout contender in an otherwise unpredictable landscape. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism, buoyed by regulatory clarity and the prospect of an ETF. Analysts forecast a move to $2.65–$2.85 in the near term, with some bullish scenarios targeting $3.40 or higher if sentiment remains strong. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the appointment of a crypto-friendly SEC chair have removed longstanding uncertainties, making XRP a more attractive hold for both retail and institutional investors. Despite recent market volatility, XRP’s technicals and fundamental outlook remain robust. The launch of CME futures and ongoing ETF speculation are driving increased liquidity and visibility, positioning XRP for further gains as the political and regulatory environment evolves. Ethereum: Steady Growth and Institutional Adoption Ethereum continues to anchor the smart contract ecosystem, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 as of May 2025. Analysts expect ETH to target $2,800–$2,900 in the near term, with long-term forecasts suggesting even greater upside if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. Ethereum’s recent upgrades and the anticipation of spot ETFs have bolstered investor confidence, making it a core holding for those seeking both stability and growth. While ETH’s price action is more measured compared to early-stage presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, its resilience and institutional support make it a reliable choice in uncertain times. Bitcoin and Solana: Market Anchors in a Volatile Landscape Bitcoin remains the bedrock of the crypto market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $115,000 or higher if current momentum holds, with the $100,000 level acting as critical support. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, even as political and economic uncertainty persists. Solana is also holding firm, with price action consolidating between $158 and $175 and technicals hinting at a breakout above $175 to retest $183. Analysts are targeting $180–$190 in the near term, with further upside possible as DeFi activity and developer engagement continue to expand. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Strength Amid the Fray Stellar Lumens (XLM) is quietly building momentum, trading near $0.28 and benefiting from its role in cross-border payments and DeFi applications. Analysts project a range of $0.24–$0.64 by year-end, with some optimistic forecasts even suggesting $0.80 or higher if adoption accelerates. While XLM may not match the explosive presale potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, its steady growth and real-world utility make it a dependable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Conclusion As political uncertainty drives market volatility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is surging ahead with strong presale momentum and a unique political narrative. XRP and Ethereum are also attracting renewed attention, offering investors a blend of regulatory clarity, institutional support, and upside potential. With Bitcoin and Solana providing stability, the crypto market is poised for a dynamic period of growth—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the breakout contender to watch in 2025.

Yet, amid the excitement around established tokens, a quiet revolution is unfolding: MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the dark horse of 2025, with analysts projecting returns that could dwarf even the most bullish XRP forecasts. While Hedera and Bitcoin round out the picture with steady gains, it’s MAGA’s presale momentum and scarcity-driven model that are capturing the imagination of forward-thinking investors. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Contender That’s Redefining Early-Stage ROI While XRP is making headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly stealing the show. With over $8 million raised and a presale price still under $0.001, analysts are calling MAGA the breakout contender of 2025. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. What sets MAGA apart is its potential for outsized returns: forecasts suggest a conservative 35x gain, with some models projecting up to 50x or more if current momentum continues. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $130,000—highlights the conviction behind this early-stage gem. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing target nears, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle. XRP: Breaking Barriers and Building Momentum XRP’s recent surge to $2.45 marks a significant milestone, driven by a confluence of regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and technical strength. Analysts are eyeing a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the short term, with some optimistic models even targeting $3.40 if bullish sentiment holds. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the launch of CME futures have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional adoption and ecosystem expansion. Despite these bullish signals, XRP’s upside is seen as steady rather than explosive—making it a core holding for those seeking stability, but not necessarily the next crypto moonshot. Hedera: Quiet Strength and Consolidation Hedera (HBAR) is holding steady near $0.21, consolidating after a strong rally earlier in May. While HBAR’s technicals remain bullish, its near-term upside is more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts project a range of $0.19–$0.78 for 2025, with steady growth expected as the network expands its real-world use cases. For investors seeking stability, HBAR is a dependable hold—but for those chasing the next 50x, MAGA is the clear standout. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Unshakable Confidence Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. For those seeking exponential returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are the new frontier. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP’s climb to $2.45 is a testament to its resilience and institutional appeal, but the real action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With analysts projecting up to 50x returns and a presale that’s drawing unprecedented demand, MAGA is quickly becoming the breakout contender of 2025.

On Monday, the Senate advanced an industry-supported regulatory bill called the Genius Act. Meanwhile, the House Financial Services Committee has approved its stablecoin legislation , though the full House has not yet passed it. According to Paolo Ardoino, chief executive officer of Tether Holdings SA , they need to see how the Genius Act distinguishes between foreign and domestic issuers. He notes that their main interest will remain outside of the US. Genius Act could reshape oversight for foreign issuers Tether’s USDT stablecoin, based in El Salvador , represents over 60% of the stablecoin market and serves 420 million users across emerging markets. Despite facing conflicts with state and federal regulators over the years, the company has grown more active in the US, encouraged by a more crypto-friendly regulatory climate under President Donald Trump’s administration. Ardoino made his first trip to the US in March, stopping in Washington during Trump’s inaugural digital-asset summit. He noted that they are looking at the Genius Act in a way that will allow them to be compliant. He continued to say they could comply while focusing strongly on foreign markets. The stablecoin bills currently under consideration in the House and Senate mandate that these tokens—typically pegged to the dollar or another currency—be fully backed by cash and “safe assets” like short-term Treasuries. They also require issuers to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering regulations. Additionally, both bills would permit regulators to approve foreign issuers like Tether if they are governed by “comparable” regulations abroad. However, uncertainty remains regarding how strictly the law will enforce compliance for those who fail to meet the requirements. Ardoino said that stablecoins are important in the United States, but there are tons of ways to pay each other, such as Zelle, PayPal, debit cards, credit cards, and cash. Although Tether does not currently serve US customers, most of the private company’s reserves consist of assets that would comply with the proposed US legislation. Tether eyes compliance while targeting the unbanked However, the firm also backs its token with assets not permitted under the rules, such as Bitcoin and secured loans. Given its size, Tether would fall under federal regulation if it sought a US license under these regulations. In 2021, Tether settled with US authorities over accusations that it misrepresented its reserves. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., formerly led by Howard Lutnick, who served as Trump’s Secretary of Commerce, manages those reserves. Ardoino has indicated that the company may issue a new stablecoin designed to meet these regulatory requirements, potentially making it more appealing to institutional investors. The more supportive regulatory climate in the US has also motivated Tether to move closer to obtaining a full audit of its reserves by a Big Four accounting firm, which Ardoino said is still under discussion. Currently, Tether provides quarterly attestations certified by BDO Italia SpA. “They are going through a phase of adjustment, but a full audit is our priority,” Ardoino said. Stablecoins have become crucial to the functioning of crypto markets, with about $243 billion of them in circulation in May 2025. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a consortium of major banks, including JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, are exploring whether to issue a stablecoin jointly. Ardoino expressed confidence that competition from traditional banking giants would have minimal impact on Tether’s core business. While major U.S. banks are considering launching their own stablecoin, Tether remains focused on underserved global markets. According to Ardoino, these banks are likely to concentrate on Western economies, whereas Tether continues to target the roughly 3 billion unbanked individuals worldwide who remain outside the traditional financial system.

He is stepping down from the Polygon Foundation board and ending his role at the main development studio, Polygon Labs. Bjelic shared an X post stating, “After much thought and reflection, I’ve decided to step down from the board of the Polygon Foundation and wind down my day-to-day involvement with Polygon Labs.” This makes him the third founder to leave the team. He joins co-founders Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun, who had also stepped away from their active roles in the blockchain project. Kanani left the company in October 2023, while Arjun stepped down in March 2023 to concentrate on his modular blockchain project, Avail. Bjelic claims he can no longer give his best to Polygon Bjelic has played a pivotal role in taking Polygon to greater heights. In 2017, he co-founded the well-known Ethereum Layer 2, originally named Matic Network , along with Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun. Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions provide many advantages for the Ethereum network. These benefits include faster transaction times, lower fees, and better scalability. As a Layer 2 solution, Polygon uses these features to boost its own performance and improve the experience for its users. In support of this, it is evident that the firm has made significant contributions to blockchain research and development, particularly in zero-knowledge and proof-of-stake technologies. Polygon introduced MATIC for POL-on a one-to-one basis in late 2024 and initiated a token migration as a part of its 2.0 plan. This change was to drive more usage of the network’s main token for gas fees, staking, and infrastructure such as AggLayer. Following Polygon’s success, Bjelic’s 10+ years of experience as an IT engineer building technology products and platforms were greatly honored. However, on Friday, May 23, Bjelic shared an X post stating that he could no longer give his best to Polygon. Based on his explanation, as projects developed and evolved, it was natural for ideas to shift and sometimes become divided up. Afterward, Bjelic mentioned that Polygon leaders seemed sincerely dedicated to seeing the project prosper. He then offered support to them from the sideline and for whatever he could do to assist. Following his resignation, Nailwal praised Bjelic in an X post , stating he was not only a co-founder but also a brother to him. He added, “From the earliest days — whiteboards full of ideas, endless whitepapers, governance frameworks, strategy calls deep into the night — you have been a force behind so much of what makes Polygon.” Bjelic reveals himself as a strong crypto believer Bjelic revealed that he first learned about cryptocurrency in 2013. By 2017, he was really diving into it, excited by the idea of creating a worldwide, inclusive economy. Since then, he has dedicated himself to making that amazing vision a reality. This is evident since Polygon’s launch in 2019, as Bjelic and his colleagues have made great progress. According to reliable sources, they have achieved important advancements in zero-knowledge technology and brought on some of the biggest brands in the world, moving closer to that big dream. By undertaking this great journey, Bjelic initially highlighted taking pride in this and felt lucky to collaborate with many skilled individuals. Concerning his resignation, he mentioned that he still felt just as enthusiastic about the potential of cryptocurrency to change systems, empower people, and build a fairer world. Therefore, he added that this belief continues to motivate him, and as a result, he will probably be seen around. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

His resignation drew reactions across Polygon and the wider crypto community, with several seeing it as a loss for Polygon, which has been tied to several major developments in recent months. Bjelic winds down ‘day-to-day involvement’ “After much thought and reflection, I’ve decided to step down from the board of the Polygon Foundation and wind down my day-to-day involvement with Polygon Labs,” Bjelic said in a May 23 X post. “I’ll always be cheering from the sidelines and supporting however and whenever I can,” Bjelic added. “As projects evolve and mature, it is natural for visions to evolve, and sometimes diverge. With this in mind, I can no longer contribute to Polygon to the best of my abilities.” Fellow Polygon co-founder, Sandeep Nailwal, commended Bjelic’s contributions over the years, adding that Bjelic has always been “a force behind so much of what makes Polygon what it is today.” Source: Sandeep Nailwal Bjelic said that he remains “as passionate as ever” about crypto, and suggested he will stay active in the crypto industry. “You will likely still see me around,” Bjelic said. Aave-chan Initiative founder Marc Zella said it was a “Big L for Polygon.” Polygon’s head of marketing Leon Stern said the company is going to miss Bjelic. “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Polygon, and best of luck,” Stern said. Meanwhile, Skale Network CEO Jack O’Holleran said Bjelic should “be very proud” of all he has accomplished at Polygon and is excited to see what he does next. Source: Maggie Love Over the past two years, two of Polygon Labs’ early founders, Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun, also stepped away from the company. Arjun’s departure coincided with the Polygon spin-off Avail, a Web3 data availability and consensus layer, becoming an independent entity, with Arjun taking the lead. Bjelic has yet to reveal his next plans. Related: Crypto market cycle permanently shifted — Polygon founder Bjelic’s resignation follows several major announcements tied to Polygon this year. On March 25, Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform DigiShares announced it would bring tokenized real estate trading to Polygo n with the launch of RealEstate.Exchange, also known as REX. Just two months before, on Jan. 16, Jio Platforms, an Indian mobile network operator owned by Asia’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani, partnered with Polygon Labs to upgrade some of its existing offerings with Web3 and blockchain capabilities.

Yet, while XRP’s ascent captures headlines, savvy investors are turning their gaze toward MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—two projects where early-stage positioning and structural catalysts could unlock even higher returns. With Ethereum and Cosmos also in the mix, the stage is set for a summer of strategic portfolio shifts and explosive growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon With 35x–50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts are projecting returns of 35x–50x, with some models even suggesting a $1 valuation by year-end—a move that would eclipse the gains of most established altcoins. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $133,000—marks the largest single early-stage crypto investment of the year, underscoring the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking outsized returns before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. XRP: Bullish Breakout and Institutional Catalyst XRP is trading near $2.45, riding a wave of positive sentiment fueled by regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and growing adoption in cross-border payments. Technical indicators show a strong breakout setup, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the near term and some optimistic models even targeting $5 by year-end if bullish momentum persists.The recent resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the launch of CME futures have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional inflows and price appreciation. Despite these bullish signals, XRP’s upside potential is seen as steady rather than transformative—making it a core holding for those seeking stability, but not necessarily the next crypto moonshot. Cardano: Technical Strength and Growth Forecast Cardano is quietly building momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential rise toward $0.90 in the near term and a bullish target of $1.88 by year-end if key support levels hold. The project’s double bottom pattern and rising on-balance volume signal strong accumulation and growing investor confidence. While Cardano’s price action is less dramatic than MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale surge, its robust fundamentals and ecosystem expansion make it a compelling choice for those seeking steady, long-term growth. However, for investors chasing the highest multiples, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage entry and explosive upside potential are hard to ignore. Ethereum and Cosmos: Steady Performers in a Dynamic Market Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades. Analysts expect ETH to target $2,800–$2,900 in the near term, with long-term forecasts suggesting even greater upside if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. While Ethereum offers stability and proven value, its upside may be more measured compared to the explosive potential of early-stage presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cosmos (ATOM) is also gaining traction, with its focus on interoperability and developer engagement attracting a loyal following. While ATOM’s price action is subdued compared to MAGA’s presale momentum, its steady growth and real-world utility make it a dependable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP’s momentum is building, but the real excitement is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—where early-stage positioning and structural catalysts could unlock even higher returns. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion and a $0.007 listing target, the window for outsized gains is closing fast. For those seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender of 2025.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Shot Up Recently The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the sentiment held by the average trader in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The metric uses a numerical scale running from 0-100 in order to represent the sentiment. All values above 53 represent greed among the investors, while those below 47 indicate fear. The index lying between these two cutoffs implies a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals Besides these three main zones, there are also two ‘extreme’ regions called the extreme greed (above 75) and extreme fear (below 25). At present, the market sentiment is inside the former of the two, according to the latest value of the Fear & Greed Index. Historically, the extreme sentiments have held much significance for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as they have been where major tops and bottoms have tended to form. The relationship has been an inverse one, however, meaning that an overly bullish atmosphere makes tops likely and an excess of despair bottoms. Some traders exploit this fact in order to time their buy and sell moves. This trading technique is popularly known as contrarian investing. Warren Buffet’s famous quote sums up the core idea: “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” With the Bitcoin sentiment now making a return into the extreme greed region, it’s possible that followers of this philosophy may be starting to look toward the exit. That said, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of ‘just’ 78 at the moment. For comparison, the December top occurred at around 87 and the January one at 84. Earlier in the rally, the metric even hit a much higher peak of 94 in November. As such, it’s possible that the current market may not be quite that overheated in terms of sentiment just yet, assuming demand from the investors doesn’t let off. It only remains to be seen, though, how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would evolve under this extreme greed. Speaking of demand, whales have just made a significant amount of withdrawals from the Binance platform, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Exchange Netflow,” which tells us about the net amount of Bitcoin that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with a centralized exchange, which, in this case, is Binance. Clearly, the Binance Exchange Netflow has observed a large negative value, implying that the investors have shifted a notable amount of coins out of the exchange. More specifically, net outflows for the platform have stood at 2,190 BTC or about $237 million. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target?

Yet, as established giants like Bitcoin, XRP, and Polkadot trade in tighter ranges, the spotlight is shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose momentum and upside projections are eclipsing even the most established names. As Q3 2025 approaches, smart money is increasingly positioning for the next breakout, and MAGA is emerging as the top candidate for exponential gains. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, But Capital Is Rotating Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold its ground above $110,000, with institutional inflows and ETF adoption providing a strong foundation for further growth. Analysts forecast a potential surge to $116,000–$137,000 in the coming weeks, but as BTC’s momentum steadies, capital is rotating into altcoins with higher-multiple potential. Early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now drawing aggressive capital rotation, as investors look to maximize returns in the next phase of the bull cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Powerhouse With 12,000%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing the competition, with Stage 8 now live and over $8 million raised. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—has made it the #1 altcoin entry for ROI-focused buyers in 2025. Analysts are projecting up to 40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting a path to 12,000%–18,500% upside if momentum continues. A recent $132,000+ whale buy marks the largest single early-stage investment of the year, underscoring the conviction behind MAGA’s explosive setup. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next supercycle winner. Each stage is filling rapidly, and as visibility grows, MAGA is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. XRP: Bullish Momentum, But Limited Multiples XRP is trading between $2.36 and $2.65, having surged over 300% since late 2024 on the back of regulatory clarity and institutional partnerships. While technicals and ecosystem developments remain bullish, short-term momentum has slowed as XRP consolidates below recent highs. Analysts now project a breakout above $3.40 could push XRP toward $4.50–$7.50 by summer, but for now, the asset is in a holding pattern as the market awaits the next catalyst. Many traders seeking sharper upside are now looking to early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for more dramatic returns. Polkadot: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Polkadot (DOT) is holding steady around $7.50, with ongoing development and ecosystem expansion. While DOT remains a dependable hold for long-term investors, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 40x winner. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Solana’s approach to $190 is a testament to its resilience and institutional appeal, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 12,000%–18,500% upside are keeping it firmly in the spotlight. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery.

Key US regulatory shifts (GAAP, SAB 121) are now unlocking Bitcoin adoption by major corporations and banks. Major US banks like Chase and Citibank are actively planning Bitcoin access, signaling a structural market shift. Bitcoin (BTC) is stepping into what many observers are calling a new era; one that could fundamentally defy past expectations and reshape its very role within the global financial system. While skeptics often point to its notorious price volatility, a quieter, more profound revolution is taking place beneath the surface. Key political changes, pivotal regulatory shifts in the U.S., and surging institutional interest are all now aligning to drive Bitcoin towards genuine mainstream adoption. Investors who are only watching the day-to-day price swings might just be missing the bigger picture: Bitcoin is steadily embedding itself into the fabric of the global economy. As crypto investor James Lavish put it, what happens next for Bitcoin won’t just be another price rally, it could very well be a deep “ structural transformation .” … The post James Lavish Drops Truth Bomb: Bitcoin’s Future Path Will Shock Those Stuck In Old Cycle Thinking appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-05-24 03:03:28

While past epochs saw triple-digit rallies, a new story may be unfolding: one of rising maturity, deeper adoption, and network resilience.” The tweet landed minutes after the firm released “2024 Bitcoin Halving: One Year Later,” authored by senior analyst Daniel Gray, who contends that the apparent lull in price action masks “a strengthening foundation.” Fidelity Flags Bitcoin’s Silent Surge “Bitcoin presents a nuanced narrative a year after its fourth halving, with signs pointing toward consolidation, network resilience, and growing institutional adoption,” Gray writes, adding that structural indicators “suggest a strengthening foundation.” While previous cycles delivered triple- and even quadruple-digit percentage gains by this stage, Gray argues the softer trajectory signals maturation: “History suggests that we would be well into the bull run at this point in the fifth epoch — but this cycle may be unfolding more cautiously.” From a market-share perspective the data are unequivocal. “Bitcoin’s market dominance excluding stablecoins has risen to just over 72.4% as of 11 May, a new eight-year high,” Gray notes, pointing out that Ether and Solana have surrendered ground even as “fragmentation on the long tail of assets has failed to produce a clear alternative leader.” Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals On-chain security metrics tell a similar story: “Bitcoin’s daily hash-rate rose above one zetta hash per second twice in April, reflecting continued investment in mining infrastructure despite a 60 percent collapse in hash price since the halving,” he observes. Spot-market behaviour has begun to echo those fundamentals. Bitcoin printed a record intraday high of $109,486 on 21 May before extending above $111,000 on so-called Pizza Day, holding near $110,600 at press time. The move has been underwritten by renewed demand from US spot ETFs, which drew $934.8 million of net subscriptions yesterday, May 22— the heaviest single-day haul in almost four weeks. Derivatives activity mirrors the trend: aggregate futures open interest reached a record $80 billion on May 23, up roughly 30% since the start of the month, according to CoinGlass data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Blasts To $111,867 All-Time High—Here’s What’s Driving The Surge Meanwhile, funding rates in most crypto exchanges are at the baseline or below it. “This is the least euphoric new all-time highs in the history of Bitcoin,” crypto analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) wrote via X. Gray cautions that investors should focus less on headline returns and more on the architecture taking shape beneath them. “Although returns have been more measured compared to previous cycles, structural metrics suggest a strengthening foundation. Overall, it appears Bitcoin is potentially maturing—something investors may find more notable than short-term price movement,” he writes. His closing assessment is blunt: “One year post-halving, Bitcoin’s price performance may seem muted, but its fundamentals appear stronger than ever … this may be a cycle that redefines Bitcoin’s role in a modern portfolio.” In other words, Fidelity’s message for would-be spectators is as clear as its headline: do not blink. At press time, BTC traded at $109,563.

By glossing over this problem, we risk allowing governments and corporations to control the global conversation. Both AI technology and industry have gone parabolic. Its censorship potential becomes greater every day. Every one to two years since 2010, the computational power of training AI systems has increased by a factor of 10, making the threat of censorship and control of public discourse more real than ever. Corporations worldwide ranked privacy and data governance as their top AI risks, while censorship didn’t register on their radar. AI – which can process millions of data points in seconds – can censor through various means, including content moderation and control of information. LLMs (large language models) and content recommendations can filter, suppress or mass share information at scale. In 2023, Freedom House highlighted that AI is enhancing state-led censorship. In China, the CAC (Cyberspace Administration) has incorporated censorship strategy into generative AI tools, requiring chatbots to support “core socialist values” and block content the communist party wants to censor. Chinese AI models, such as DeepSeek’s R1, already censor topics like the Tiananmen Square massacre, in order to spread state narratives. “To protect the free and open internet, democratic policymakers – working side by side with civil society experts from around the world – should establish strong human rights–based standards for both state and non-state actors that develop or deploy AI tools,” concludes Freedom House. In 2021, UC San Diego found that AI algorithms trained on censored datasets, such as China’s Baidu Baike, which associates the keyword ‘democracy’ with ‘chaos.’ Models trained on uncensored sources associated ‘democracy’ with ‘stability.’ In 2023, Freedom House’s ‘Freedom on the Net’ report found that global internet freedom fell for the 13th consecutive year. It attributed a large part of the decline to AI. Twenty-two countries have laws in place requiring social media companies to employ automated systems for content moderation, which could be used to suppress debate and demonstrations. Myanmar’s military junta, for instance, used AI to monitor Telegram groups and detain dissidents and carry out death sentences based on their posts. The same happened in Iran. Additionally, in Belarus and Nicaragua, governments sentenced individuals to draconian prison terms for their online speech. Freedom House found that no fewer than 47 governments used comments to sway online conversations towards their preferred narratives. It found that in the past year, new technology was used in at least 16 countries to sow the seeds of doubt, smear opponents or influence public debate. At least 21 countries require digital platforms to use machine learning to delete political, social and religious speech. A 2023 Reuters report warned that AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation could “undermine public trust in democratic processes,” empowering regimes that seek to tighten control over information. In the 2024 US presidential elections, AI-generated images falsely implying Taylor Swift endorsed Donald Trump demonstrated that AI is already manipulating public opinion. China offers the most prominent example of AI-driven censorship. A leaked dataset analyzed by TechCrunch in 2025 revealed a sophisticated AI system designed to censor topics like pollution scandals, labor disputes and Taiwan political issues. Unlike traditional keyword-based filtering, this system uses LLMs to evaluate context and flag political satire. Researcher Xiao Qiang noted that such systems “significantly improve the efficiency and granularity of state-led information control.” A 2024 House Judiciary Committee report accused the NSF (National Science Foundation) of funding AI tools to combat ‘misinformation’ on Covid-19 and the 2020 election. The report found that the NSF funded AI-based censorship and propaganda tools. “In the name of combating alleged misinformation regarding Covid-19 and the 2020 election, NSF has been issuing multi-million-dollar grants to university and non-profit research teams,” reads the report. “The purpose of these taxpayer-funded projects is to develop AI-powered censorship and propaganda tools that can be used by governments and Big Tech to shape public opinion by restricting certain viewpoints or promoting others.” A 2025 WIRED report discovered that DeepSeek’s R1 model includes censorship filters at both the application and training levels, resulting in blocks on sensitive topics. In 2025, a Pew Research Center survey found that 83% of US adults were concerned about AI-driven misinformation, with many showing concerns about its free speech implications. Pew interviewed AI experts, who said that AI training data can unintentionally reinforce existing power structures. Addressing AI-driven censorship A 2025 HKS Misinformation Review called for better reporting to reduce fear-driven calls for censorship. The survey found that 38.8% of Americans are somewhat concerned, and 44.6% are highly concerned, about AI’s role in spreading misinformation during the 2024 US presidential election, while 9.5% held no concerns, and 7.1% were unaware of the issue altogether. Creating an open-source AI ecosystem is of the utmost importance. This means companies disclose training dataset sources and biases. Governments should create AI regulatory frameworks prioritizing free expression. If we want a human future, instead of an AI-managed technocratic dystopia, the AI industry and consumers need to build up the courage to tackle censorship.

Cardano’s surge and Bitcoin’s stability are drawing headlines, but the real buzz is around MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin that’s outpacing even the most established names. With Solana, XRP, and SUI consolidating, analysts are calling MAGA the leading early-stage play as Q3 approaches. Cardano: Academic Partnerships Fuel a Bullish Run Cardano (ADA) has broken past $0.82, powered by a series of global academic collaborations and real-world blockchain integrations. The network’s commitment to research and education is paying off, with analysts forecasting ADA could reach $0.90–$1.00 by early summer. While Cardano’s fundamentals and ecosystem expansion are earning it long-term credibility, some investors are looking to amplify returns by rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Presale and 35x Upside Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the 2025 presale cycle, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—capped at 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, and audited by HashEx—are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code MAGA50X , MAGA is being positioned as the rare ground-floor opportunity before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Unlike fleeting meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding a wave of real investor confidence, strategic rollout, and viral political energy—making it the top allocation for smart money heading into Q3. Bitcoin: Macro Strength and Capital Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s anchor, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. While Bitcoin’s macro strength is unshaken, its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. As retail investors take profits, smart capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early-stage entry points offer the kind of asymmetric potential that built fortunes in previous cycles. Solana, XRP, and SUI: Solid, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is consolidating near $170, with technicals hinting at a breakout above $175. XRP is trading between $2.36 and $2.65, holding steady after a 300% rally since late 2024. SUI is gaining traction with network upgrades and developer activity, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates out of consolidating assets and into high-upside plays, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next breakout. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s academic partnerships and Bitcoin’s resilience are impressive, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 35x are making it the breakout coin to watch for Q3 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar.

Yet, while Solana’s performance remains impressive, the spotlight is quickly shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose momentum and potential upside are dominating analyst conversations. With XRP, SEI, and Cardano also drawing attention, the race for the next major breakout is heating up, and MAGA is rapidly emerging as the must-watch contender. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 40x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage altcoins in 2025, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—has fueled a surge in demand from both retail and institutional buyers. Analysts are projecting 35x–50x returns as a conservative estimate, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if current momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGA is quickly becoming the primary entry point for those seeking exponential gains before listings reshape the market. Solana: Bullish Structure and Institutional Confidence Solana (SOL) continues to impress, trading in a tight range around $170 and supported by bullish momentum across all timeframes. Technical analysis points to a possible breakout above $175, which could pave the way for a retest of $183 and beyond. Experts predict that, with continued ecosystem growth and institutional adoption, SOL could revisit the $240–$260 range later this year. While Solana’s upward movement is now more gradual, its strong fundamentals and rising spot volumes keep it a top pick for long-term growth alongside explosive early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Bullish Structure and ETF Tailwinds XRP is showing renewed strength, trading near $2.50 and maintaining a bullish structure supported by multiple moving averages. After bouncing from the $2.10 range and breaking past key resistances, XRP is consolidating above $2.30. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate, with some stretch targets as high as $15. While XRP remains a core institutional asset, many long-time holders are now diversifying into early-stage assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper upside before the next leg up. SEI and Cardano: Quiet Accumulation, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight SEI and Cardano (ADA) are both quietly attracting smart capital, with ADA’s development ecosystem and staking rewards making it a favorite among long-term holders. However, neither SEI nor ADA offers the early-stage entry or explosive upside that MAGACOIN FINANCE brings to the table. As traders seek breakout returns, MAGA’s structured presale and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation heading into Q3. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion While Solana’s bullish trend continues and XRP maintains institutional momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a locked-in $0.007 listing price, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA stands out as the breakout altcoin to watch. For those seeking 40x–50x growth potential before listings go live, the window for early entry is closing fast.

History shows that early participation is where the real gains are made, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to more recent wins like Solana and Avalanche. Even Monero, once dismissed by many, eventually delivered major returns to those who held on. Today, all eyes are starting to turn toward Qubetics ($TICS), a rising project gaining traction for its practical tech, strong token dynamics, and growing support from early adopters. Qubetics has sparked substantial interest due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. As of May 2025, its presale is actively progressing, and the stage-based pricing model is already rewarding early adopters. With its strategic allocation for early investors, a cutting-edge technological framework, and a mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, Qubetics offers far more than speculative appeal — it offers timing, technology, and traction. For those still seeking one of the top altcoins to buy, Qubetics may be that overdue shot at a transformative ROI. Qubetics: One of the Top Altcoins to Buy Before This Presale Ends Missing out on Qubetics ’ earliest phase — where $TICS was available for just $0.01 during its quiet September 2024 rollout — is something many investors already regret. Multiple presale stages have already passed, each bringing a 10% price increase, and now the token is at Stage 35, priced at $0.2785. More than $17.3 million has been raised, over 513 million $TICS tokens sold, and more than 26,900 investors are now holders. Yet despite this traction, the door is still open. This top crypto presale is not out of reach yet. With each stage lasting only seven days and a 10% discount incentive on current pricing, Qubetics still qualifies among the top altcoins to buy. Backed by its upcoming Q2 2025 mainnet launch, Qubetics is built for sustainability. The project allocated 12.85% of the total token supply for early adopters — demonstrating a long-term commitment to community-driven growth. ROI projections remain exceptionally promising. At the current $0.2785 price, an investor could see a 258.95% ROI if $TICS hits $1 after launch. If it reaches $5, that return spikes to 1,694.74%, and at $6, the ROI rises to 2,053.68%. More ambitious scenarios show a 3,489.47% ROI at $10 and a staggering 5,284.21% ROI at $15. For example, a $2,000 investment now could yield up to $107,700 at a $6 valuation or as high as $179,500 at $10 — all while remaining below major cap thresholds. This ROI trajectory places Qubetics firmly among the top altcoins to buy for high-upside market plays. Qubetics stands apart because it solves a fundamental pain point in blockchain: interoperability. In the fragmented Web3 ecosystem, users and enterprises face siloed blockchains that don’t communicate natively. Qubetics bridges this gap. Whether you’re a supply chain company needing cross-chain transaction verification between Ethereum and Solana, or a Web3 developer building on Bitcoin but needing real-time access to Ethereum’s liquidity pools, Qubetics offers seamless asset transfer and protocol compatibility. Enterprises benefit through cost efficiency and reduced integration overhead, while individual users gain frictionless access to decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 dApps from multiple chains — through one unified, interoperable chain. Monero’s Story: The Silent Riser in the Privacy Coin Arena Monero (XMR), known for its robust privacy protocol, is a perfect example of a crypto that eventually delivered but only after years of waiting. It launched in 2014 with an ICO price under $1 and was largely ignored in its early stages. The project’s focus on fungibility and anonymity didn’t immediately translate into mass investor interest, as competitors like Ethereum were capturing the spotlight. Yet, Monero steadily built a core user base that valued its unique privacy advantages — and when privacy coins gained popularity, XMR skyrocketed. Its all-time high came years later, rewarding early believers with life-changing gains. Throughout its development, Monero has maintained a niche but loyal presence in the crypto space. Its Proof-of-Work model, RingCT technology, and fungibility features give it unmatched privacy capabilities. However, Monero’s slow climb and long dormancy periods meant that many only joined after the major growth occurred. While XMR still holds relevance, it highlights the importance of getting in early on crypto projects that offer real, differentiating use cases. The Monero narrative reflects why identifying top altcoins to buy before the masses catch on is a critical factor in building substantial ROI. Conclusion: The Next Wave Is Here — Will You Ride It? Cryptocurrency history repeats itself — and not always kindly for latecomers. Whether it was Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Monero, the highest gains have always gone to those who acted early with conviction. Today, Qubetics represents one of those rare moments of opportunity. Its ongoing presale structure, ambitious interoperability framework, and clear market utility all point to significant post-launch potential. If you’re still looking for top altcoins to buy, Qubetics checks every box — from ROI forecasts to real-world utility. The truth is, you still have time to join this top crypto presale before the final stages drive prices further. Qubetics is still accessible and poised for a breakout in 2025. For those tired of looking back with regret, this may be your moment to participate in what could become one of the top altcoins to buy for the upcoming expansion cycle.

With the SEC’s friendlier stance and ETF approvals in the spotlight, ETH’s resurgence is emboldening investors to explore new opportunities. In this climate, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP have become focal points for those seeking both early-stage momentum and institutional-grade upside. Avalanche and Bitcoin remain foundational, but the most aggressive capital is now chasing the next breakout in MAGA and XRP. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum and Whale Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the early-stage landscape, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling a wave of demand from both retail and institutional buyers. Analysts are forecasting 25x–40x returns for those who enter before listings, with some models even suggesting a $1 target by year-end if momentum holds. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts underscore the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential, while a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code MAGA50X is amplifying demand. As each presale stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the go-to allocation for those seeking the next 10x–40x winner in Q3 2025. Ethereum: Regulatory Wins and Renewed Bullishness Ethereum’s 2025 narrative has shifted from uncertainty to resurgence, with a 90% rally off its April lows and bullish technicals now pointing toward a possible $3,950 breakout. The SEC’s friendlier approach and ETF approvals have removed longstanding barriers, giving ETH a clear path for institutional adoption and price appreciation. As regulatory clarity returns, Ethereum is once again viewed as a stable springboard for capital—enabling investors to confidently rotate into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Institutional Momentum and ETF Speculation XRP is consolidating above $2.30, buoyed by legal victories, ETF buzz, and its growing role as a global settlement asset. The SEC’s resolution of its lawsuit against Ripple and the appointment of a pro-crypto chairman have eliminated years of uncertainty, making XRP a magnet for both retail and institutional capital. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some models targeting $5.50–$15 by year-end if ETF approval and institutional inflows accelerate. While XRP’s upside is robust, the window for exponential returns is now shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the entry price and risk/reward profile are even more compelling. Avalanche and Bitcoin: Steady Growth, but MAGA Steals the Show Avalanche (AVAX) is trading between $18.50 and $22.06, with analysts seeing a modest recovery for 2025. While AVAX and BTC remain dependable core holdings, their near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the surge potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates out of sideways-trading assets, early-stage opportunities like MAGA are capturing the attention of traders looking for outsized returns before listings go live. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s regulatory clarity is revitalizing confidence across the crypto market, but the biggest opportunities are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With whale accumulation, a scarcity-driven model, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA stands out as the most promising early-stage play of 2025. For those seeking to maximize returns before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout altcoin to watch as Q3 approaches.

The platform ends yield-generating services, opting for a 1:1 bitcoin custody system to reduce client risk. The change responds to rising BTC loan demand and regulatory pressure, distancing from altcoins and risky lending. On May 23, 2025, crypto lender Ledn confirmed it will stop supporting Ethereum (ETH) and shift entirely to a bitcoin-only lending model. The move takes effect on July 1, 2025, and comes as part of a broader strategy to simplify services and minimize risk. Ledn stated that it will no longer use client assets to generate yield. Instead, it will adopt a full custody model. This approach means users’ bitcoin will either remain in direct custody or with trusted custody partners, removing intermediaries and lending loops from the process. The decision reflects Ledn’s response to rising competition in the BTC-backed loan sector. It also signals the company’s commitment to reduce client exposure to lending risks that led to past collapses in the crypto lending space.

He pointed to the fact that XRP sits at about $2.35 right now. That price is low compared with where he thinks it will go. He told followers to pick up as much as they can while the chance is there. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight XRP Trading Below $3 XRP has climbed about 350% over the past year. That beat gains in some of the top altcoins in the market today. Yet many still see the move as slow. At $2.39 per coin, that view is easy to understand. Even so, BarriC calls anything under $3 a bargain. Predictions For A Rally Based on examination from his Twitter thread, BarriC expects XRP to hit $10 first. He then sees it pushing to $20 in the months ahead. Those moves would set a new high during what he calls the next alt season. If those figures come true, buyers who got in under $3 would see roughly a seven-fold gain at the $20 mark. $XRP will become very expensive to buy in the next few months and the next few years Right now, you can accumulate $XRP below $3 And somehow that’s considered a failure When $XRP skyrockets over the next few months and hits $10-$20 per #XRP That’s the new all time high… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 17, 2025 … But Possible Correction Ahead BarriC also warned of a pullback after a big rise. He thinks XRP could drop by about 50% once it reaches $20. That would put it back in the $5–$10 range. He sees that dip as a fresh chance to buy in. Even then, $5 is still higher than today’s $2.39. Long Term Vision For XRP Looking past the next cycle, BarriC outlined a bold scenario. He believes banks and big payment firms will use XRP for daily money transfers. In that case, demand could send the price all the way to $1,000 within 10 years. When banks start using $XRP We will know because of the insane price per $XRP We will see prices like $100, $500, $1,000 Per #XRP The fact that we can still accumulate $XRP at approx $2 means that banks aren’t utilising $XRP …. YET Once that day comes Once banks and… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 3, 2025 To reach that level, XRP’s market cap would top $58 trillion. That would put it on par with major pieces of the global money system. Technical Signals And Short-Term Outlook Technical indicators point to a possible drop to around $2.21 by June 22, 2025, which would be a -9.20% change from now. The current sentiment gauge reads Bullish, but the Fear & Greed Index sits at 0. Over the past 30 days, XRP had 13 out of 30 green days and showed about 5.10% price swings. Those numbers hint at mixed views. Some traders see room to run. Others expect more choppy action before the next big move.

If those start to speed up, we could see more buzz around XRP’s real-world uses. Until then, buying under $3 could look smart—or it could stay quiet for a while. Either way, investors will have to decide how much risk they want for the chance at a big payout in the years to come.

While ADA’s academic partnerships and technical progress are fueling its climb, the real excitement is building around early-stage tokens and blue-chip giants poised for even greater gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral presale momentum, and Ethereum, backed by robust fundamentals, are quickly becoming the top picks for investors seeking outperformance as summer 2025 approaches. Cardano: Bullish Surge and Real-World Progress Cardano (ADA) has rallied impressively, recently pushing above $0.82 and attracting fresh capital on the back of bullish technicals and expanding academic collaborations. Analysts predict that if ADA can sustain momentum above key support levels, it could test the $0.90–$1.00 range by the end of May, with further upside possible if the broader market remains favorable. While Cardano’s commitment to education and real-world adoption is earning it long-term credibility, its near-term price action is still influenced by overall market sentiment and Bitcoin’s performance. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Breakout Presale With Explosive Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing the competition as 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—a capped 100 billion supply, 45% allocated to presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next 100x opportunity before listings go live. As the broader market consolidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the watchlists of traders and analysts alike, with some even suggesting a $1 target by year-end—a move that would eclipse the gains of most established altcoins. Ethereum: Bullish Structure and Institutional Confidence Ethereum (ETH) is quietly building momentum, trading between $2,400 and $2,900 as of May 2025 3 . Technical indicators point to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900, with the Ichimoku Cloud and MACD both signaling a continuation of the uptrend. Analysts expect that sustained momentum above $2,650 could see ETH retest $3,000 as summer trading heats up. With institutional adoption, Layer 2 expansion, and the prospect of spot ETFs on the horizon, Ethereum remains a core holding for those seeking both stability and significant upside in the next cycle. Solana, XRP, and HBAR: Solid, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $158 and $175, with forecasts calling for a move to $180–$210 if macro conditions stay favorable. XRP is holding steady at $2.35, with analysts targeting $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks and $5.50–$15 by year-end if momentum persists. Hedera (HBAR) continues to build quietly, with price predictions for May 2025 averaging around $0.25. While each of these tokens offers solid fundamentals and growth prospects, none currently match the explosive presale momentum and upside potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Cardano’s surge past $0.82 is a testament to its progress and growing ecosystem, but the most aggressive capital is now flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion, a $0.007 listing target, and analysts forecasting up to 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast. For those seeking the next breakout winner as the market heats up, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum are the names on every smart investor’s radar.

This makes Cardano (ADA) a top cryptocurrency for investors seeking the next big crypto. Binance leads ADA trading volume at $2.19 million, with Bybit showing strong inflows. This activity suggests growing confidence in Cardano (ADA). Investors are locking up tokens, reducing available supply. Such moves often precede sharp price spikes.

A 500% surge seems plausible, but sustained momentum is key. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now enters the spotlight, offering a different kind of opportunity.

Analysts see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hitting $2.50 in 2025, yielding an 8,233% return from the current price. This positions it as a top crypto to buy for investors chasing high returns. The project’s focus on decentralized lending sets it apart in the altcoin space. Mutuum Finance’s lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers real utility through its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system lets users deposit assets like USDT into smart contract pools, earning interest based on pool demand. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model allows direct lending, ideal for niche assets like meme coins. Overcollateralized loans, like $7,000 in ETH for $5,000 in USDT, ensure stability. The platform’s mtTokens, such as mtETH, grow in value as interest accrues, offering passive income. These tokens are transferable, boosting flexibility across DeFi platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto for those seeking practical crypto investment options. The team is securing investor trust with a Certik audit of its smart contracts. Once finalized, results will appear on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s social channels. A leaderboard dashboard rewards the top 50 token holders with bonus tokens, encouraging long-term commitment. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates steady demand, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a best cryptocurrency to invest in. Its $100,000 giveaway for early investors adds excitement, drawing more into this new crypto coin. As phase 5 progresses, the window for low-price entry narrows. Mutuum Finance’s growth engine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fuels growth with dynamic interest rates, adjusting to market conditions. Lenders earn competitive APYs, while borrowers choose fixed or variable rates for flexibility. The upcoming stablecoin, backed by user collateral, enhances ecosystem trust.

Over 11,500 holders signal Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a crypto to buy now. Its structured approach positions it among the best cryptos to invest in for 2025, outpacing less utility-focused altcoins like Cardano (ADA). Pathway to crypto wealth Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer distinct routes to crypto riches. Cardano (ADA) banks on technical strength and whale accumulation, aiming for $10. Its market activity makes it a top crypto to buy for long-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its lending utility and presale momentum, promises a 100% ROI at launch and potentially 8,233% by hitting $2.50 in 2025.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor the market, analysts are increasingly highlighting the explosive potential of early-stage altcoins—especially MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With capital rotation intensifying and bullish sentiment building, these tokens are now at the center of the conversation for those seeking outsized gains in 2025. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Acceleration and 15,000% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% returns, with some forecasting a $1 target by year-end if current momentum continues. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation and early-stage investor enthusiasm. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with more transparency and a scarcity-driven model. Even a modest $500 stake could multiply many times over if projections hold true, making MAGA the breakout bet for the next supercycle. Ethereum: Technical Structure and Breakout Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators pointing to a possible surge toward $2,800–$2,900 if momentum holds. Analysts note that ETH is trading above its 50-day EMA and forming a bullish flag, with the RSI rebounding and volume poised to increase as summer approaches. A decisive move above $2,800 could trigger a multi-month rally, with some forecasts calling for a climb toward $4,500 by late 2025. As Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem expands and institutional adoption grows, ETH remains a cornerstone for both stability and upside in the evolving crypto landscape. XRP: Bullish Structure and Renewed Accumulation XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts closely watching as futures and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Whale accumulation has surged, historically a precursor to major rallies. Technicals show XRP forming higher lows and breaking above resistance, with projections of $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. While XRP’s legal clarity and infrastructure are positives, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. HBAR and Bitcoin: Steady Growth, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight HBAR continues to build through enterprise integrations and real-world use cases, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding above $103,000, with price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. Yet, as capital rotates for higher multiples, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the attention of those seeking the next 10x–100x opportunity. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s consolidation phase is fueling analyst interest in breakout altcoins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP now leading the charge for potential 15,000% gains in 2025. With MAGA’s presale nearly complete, a $0.007 listing target, and projections as high as 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast.

The company says investors deserve clear and timely decisions instead of silence without explanation. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel shared a post on X showing frustration with the SEC for delaying the company’s CBOE’s 19b-4 filing without explanations. SEC again delays ruling on CBOE’s 19b-4 to list options on VanEck $HODL ETF. We find the lack of explanation confounding & frustrating. Investors deserve transparency and timely action. @HesterPeirce — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) May 23, 2025 VanEck asks for answers after the SEC delays a decision on Bitcoin ETF options The SEC has again delayed a decision on whether to approve options trading for VanEck’s spot Bitcoin ETF trading under the ticker symbol $HODL. This delay further frustrated other crypto asset managers waiting for the SEC to decide on their applications. VanEck also awaits approval on a similar request to include in-kind creations and redemptions for the same Bitcoin ETF. Still, the SEC has not moved forward on that either. The feature would allow investors to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares and vice versa directly. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Matthew Sigel, posted on X claiming that the SEC does not explain why it keeps pushing back these decisions. He added that the lack of feedback makes the process more confusing and makes it difficult for applicants to understand what they need to fix or improve. Matthew described the SEC’s silence as “confounding and frustrating” because it makes the process feel unfair and unpredictable for companies trying to follow all the rules. He also tagged SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, expecting her Crypto Task Force to step in, provide answers, and show some leadership on an issue affecting many crypto players. The repeated delays without clear reasoning hurt investor confidence and slow growth and innovation as people feel uncertain about whether the SEC will ever make firm decisions or continue stalling indefinitely. The SEC keeps delaying crypto ETF decisions while new filings keep coming in The SEC has again delayed a decision on a major crypto ETF proposal affecting CoinShares’ application for a spot XRP ETF, which would be exposed to XRP through a regulated product. The SEC pushed back the decision from May 26 to Aug. 24 and sought public comments and rebuttals to the proposal rather than approving or rejecting it. This delay is one more instance in a trend where the SEC takes longer than usual without providing any explanation for the delay, leaving the applicants and the entire market wondering. The agency also stalled Fidelity’s proposals for in-kind redemptions in its spot Bitcoin ETF and a similar Ethereum-based product. The in-kind redemption is more efficient and tax-friendly because investors can swap actual crypto for ETF shares rather than using cash. The pace of new ETF applications is accelerating despite these repeated roadblocks because asset managers believe the rewards of being first to market with new crypto ETF products outweigh the frustrations of dealing with regulatory restraints. Firms have filed for ETFs based on a range of altcoins, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and XRP for the past few weeks. These products allow investors to access blockchain ecosystems and technologies outside the Bitcoin-Ethereum duopoly. Canary Capital recently filed to launch a staked Tron ETF that would track the price of the Tron token (TRX) and pass on staking rewards to investors. The SEC acknowledged this application, which shows that it might be warming up to innovative structures, even if it is not ready to approve them yet. Similarly, companies won’t stop applying because they believe the Trump administration favors crypto more than its predecessor. Industry leaders have also pointed to leadership changes and evolving political sentiment as signs that the regulatory climate may become more supportive or, at the very least, more predictable. The SEC has not released new crypto-specific guidance, but it continues to accept and publish new applications through its formal processes, which gives some hope that the agency may be preparing for a new phase of regulatory clarity KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-24 05:00:51

The price is continuing to form higher lows and higher highs on the daily chart — a positive sign for traders and investors. Current Support and Resistance Levels At the moment, XRP is finding strong support around $2.30 to $2.34. As long as the price stays above $2.30, the bullish trend remains intact. However, if XRP falls below this level with a confirmed daily candle close, there’s a chance it could drop further toward the $2.10–$2.15 zone. On the upside, there’s significant resistance at the golden pocket area between $2.55 to $2.62. A clean breakout above this zone could open the doors for a strong upward move. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Might Be the Next Crypto to Surge? , What’s Next for XRP? According to market patterns, XRP is currently following a local uptrend, though without strong momentum just yet. Analysts are watching for a potential five-wave upward move, which could confirm either a short-term rally or the start of a bigger bullish wave. There are two possible scenarios: Orange Scenario (Most Bullish): XRP needs to form five consecutive waves upward. After the first five waves, a higher low (called Wave 2) would need to hold above the May 19 swing low. If that happens, we could see further upside in Waves 3, 4, and 5, targeting $2.52, $2.58, and possibly up to $2.61. Blue Scenario (Still Bullish): This outlook allows for a slightly deeper pullback but remains positive as long as the price stays above the $2.15 support area. Even if a bigger correction happens, the market could recover strongly after. While XRP’s short-term momentum has cooled slightly, the overall trend is still bullish. As long as the key support at $2.30 holds, the market looks set for a potential climb towards $2.60 and beyond . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Currently in Stage 1 of its presale , Mantix is tipped to surge 100x in 2025 and investors are taking notice. As established platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX fight to maintain dominance, Mantix enters the scene with bold innovation, lightning-fast cross-chain trading and up to 1000x leverage. With momentum building fast, Mantix is setting the pace for the next era of DeFi trading. HYPE token climbs to global top 20 as momentum builds Hyperliquid has quietly become a serious force in crypto derivatives trading. As of May 21, 2025, it boasts a total value locked of $443 million, backed by nearly $147 million in daily volume and a staggering $7.92 billion in perpetuals trading. Unlike many of its peers, Hyperliquid hasn’t relied on aggressive VC funding or over-the-top incentive programs to draw attention. Its growth has been mostly organic, led by real traders who value performance over hype. This authenticity is reflected in its HYPE token, currently priced at around $35.28 with a market cap of $8.77 billion, ranking it among the top 20 globally. Price forecasts suggest an average of $45 this year, with possible highs near $70. Even with the usual market dips, longer-term predictions paint a bullish picture, with expectations stretching as high as $250 by 2030. DYDX news: Platform commits 25% of fees to monthly token buybacks dYdX is taking bold steps to reposition itself in a market that’s getting more competitive by the day. In an effort to reinforce token utility and strengthen network security, the platform recently rolled out a strategic buyback initiative. Announced on March 24, this program allocates 25% of dYdX’s monthly net fees to purchase tokens from the open market, which are then staked to support the protocol. If successful, that figure could scale up to 100% of platform revenue, an ambitious move designed to inject new confidence into the dYdX ecosystem. This development comes at a time when over 85% of dYdX tokens are already unlocked and actively circulating. The initiative sent the token price climbing nearly 8.5% to $0.6581 , offering a brief respite from a tough year that’s seen it drop more than 78%. New DEX Mantix targets gaps left by Hyperliquid and dYdX As platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX fight to defend their positions in the decentralized trading scene, a new contender is stepping in with serious firepower. Mantix is here to outperform. This new DEX offers everything traders want: cross-chain swaps, ultra-deep liquidity, instant settlement and leverage up to 1000x. But what truly sets it apart is its reward-driven ecosystem powered by the $MTX token. Holders get a slice of platform revenue without even needing to provide liquidity directly. Think of staking rewards but smarter. Mantix is built on transparency, speed and real ownership. No centralized gatekeepers. No silent whales making decisions in the dark. With decentralized governance, token holders shape the platform’s future. And thanks to its buyback and burn mechanism, MTX is deflationary by design. With its presale now live, Mantix is gearing up to go viral, because the market is ready for something better. Investors can pick up their MTX tokens for just $0.02, the lowest price it will ever be, as analysts project 100x gains by mid-2026.

Ethereum Ethereum (ETH) has seen significant price changes recently. In the past month, its price surged by 69.04%. Over the last week, it increased by 2.31%. However, over the past six months, the price decreased by 19.77%. This suggests a recovery from earlier losses. Currently, Ethereum’s price ranges between $2303.83 and $2715.19. The nearest resistance level is $2932; if the price breaks this, it could reach the next resistance at $3343. The nearest support level is $2109, with a secondary support at $1698. Breaking above the first resistance could lead to an 8% increase. Falling below the support may result in a 9% decrease. Technical indicators show possible future movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 68.30, close to the overbought level of 70. This may suggest a price correction soon. The Stochastic indicator is at 88.60, also indicating overbought conditions. The MACD level is 28.7005, pointing to bullish momentum. The 10-day simple moving average is $2608.14, above the 100-day average of $2509.58, which is a positive sign. Binance coin Binance coin (BNB) has been on a consistent rise. In the past week, its price went up by 4.86%. Over the last month, it increased by 14.53%, and in six months, it climbed 8.05%. The current price ranges between $626.63 and $684.83, showing a steady upward trend. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $680.39, above the 100-day SMA of $652.46, indicating short-term bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 69.47, nearing overbought levels, but suggests potential for further growth. The Stochastic oscillator reads 70.41, pointing to a bullish sentiment. BNB is approaching its nearest resistance at $717. Breaking this could lead to the next resistance at $776, representing potential gains of around 5% and 13% from current prices. Support levels are at $601.47 and $543.27, which could limit downside risks. Traders are watching these levels as BNB’s upward movement continues. Conclusion Just as ETH and BNB rose quietly to the top, XYZVerse now stands poised to lead the 2025 bull run with its unique sports-focused ecosystem.

This rare feat, as highlighted by Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, marks the first time IBIT has outpaced every other ETF in daily net flows including the ever-dominant VOO, which took an unusual backseat.

Will BTC Price Go Down to $100K?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-bitcoin-price-dropping-now-will-btc-price-go-down-to-100k/,"The post Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Now? Will BTC Price Go Down to $100K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price faced a notable pullback after a failed attempt to sustain itself above the gained levels. The BTC price dropped below $107K while Ethereum and the other altcoins also witnessed a similar pullback. The ongoing crypto crash occurred at times when the stock market has also been facing a sell-off. The BTC price recovered despite the Moody’s shockwaves in the financial market by downgrading the US credit rating . Regardless of the upward pressure, Bitcoin displays huge upward potential of marking a fresh ATH in the coming days. While the institutions are piling up Bitcoin , the retailers do not seem to have entered the space. The Google search trends show retail interest is still only half of what it was in November 2024, which suggests smart money is buying while retail stays silent. This can be considered a huge bullish signal, as there was no hype, no frenzy, despite the BTC price forming new highs. On the other hand, funding rates are neutral, which hints that the leverage is under control. While there are no signs of overexposure in futures, a healthy structure is expected to continue. With the BTC price holding up above $100K, the trade setup hints at more upside ahead. Will Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Rise to $120K or Drop to $100K? Bitcoin saw a sharp and aggressive drop following Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a 50% tariff on EU imports . The sudden macro triggered broad risk-off flows, with BTC quickly selling off from local highs near $111.3K and tapping into a key fair value gap around $107.5K. Although the price witnessed a short-term bounce since the low, it failed to be validated as a bullish reversal. Currently, the momentum remains fragile, and the overall structure still favors caution as Bitcoin trades within a compression zone. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Run Could Last Until 2027, Says Top Crypto Analyst , The BTC price is trapped between two major fair value gaps, which are currently the threshold for the upcoming market direction. If the bulls reclaim the $109K to $110K area, the bulls could gain strength and push the levels towards the higher resistance beyond $112K. These levels line up with a larger supply zone and could become a key-magnet zone. On the flip side, if the BTC fails to hold the lower FVG and breaks below $107,000, it may enter the liquidity pool around $106K, which could be supported by price inefficiency and unmitigated demand just below. The current trade setup hints towards a major compression, and hence it is important that the Bitcoin (BTC) price does not get trapped in the middle range. Therefore, it would be important to witness which FVG will be filled ahead of the monthly close. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Donald Trump’s tariff announcements historically trigger “risk-off” sentiment, leading to Bitcoin and altcoin sell-offs as investors move away from speculative assets amid global economic uncertainty. How does the downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s impact Bitcoin’s price? A US credit rating downgrade can sometimes positively affect Bitcoin long-term by shaking confidence in traditional finance, prompting investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin as a hedge.

Bitcoin is rising. Institutions are joining. And yet, the market doesn’t feel like it used to. Popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe recently shared a bold thought, this market cycle is unlike the one we’ve seen before. In fact, he believes it could be longer, more powerful, and very different from the classic four-year pattern everyone’s been expecting. Despite this, he believes Bitcoin could hit $400,000 to $600,000 by 2026 or 2027. Here’s why! Forget the Old 4-Year Rule Bitcoin, the biggest player in the crypto world, continues to hit new highs of $112k and claim a larger share of the overall market. Usually, Bitcoin goes on a big run, then altcoins catch up, and eventually, everything dips before starting over. But this time? The whole rhythm seems off. In the last 18 months, Bitcoin has been taking center stage—breaking highs and growing stronger while everything else follows. It’s now holding about 60% of the total crypto market cap, a number we haven’t seen in a while. That kind of dominance usually signals that Bitcoin might slow down soon. But this time, it’s not just retail traders behind the push—it’s big players too. Institutions Are Here—and They’re Changing the Game From spot Bitcoin ETFs to interest from government leaders, the stage is being set for something much bigger. Institutions now see crypto not just as risky bets, but as real investments with long-term potential. As Matthew Kimmell from CoinShares explains , Bitcoin usually gains strength in early recoveries, then cools off when traders chase riskier coins. But today, things feel more stable. That’s why van de Poppe says we need to open our minds, maybe this cycle won’t peak in 2025. Perhaps we’re looking at 2026 or even 2027. And yes, he even sees Bitcoin reaching $400K to $600K , with altcoins flying even higher. Bigger Game for Altcoins And it’s not just about Bitcoin. If this extended cycle plays out, altcoins could see even greater growth. With more real-world use cases, better infrastructure, and rising investor interest, coins beyond BTC might finally have their breakout moment. This isn’t just speculation—it’s a shift in thinking. Van de Poppe urges investors to approach the market with an open mind.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 05:41:44

The altcoins have also bled out on a daily scale, with more than $100 billion leaving the space within this timeframe. BTC Pushed Below $107K In general, it was a very good, some would say historic, week for the primary cryptocurrency. It started on a volatile foot as it pumped from $104,000 to $107,000 on a couple of occasions on Sunday and Monday but was stopped in its tracks and driven south hard. However, the bulls kept the pressure on, and that upper boundary finally gave in on Wednesday. Moreover, bitcoin rocketed past its January all-time high of $109,100 and set a new one at almost $110,000. It was met with immediate resistance there and a drop to $106,500, but that was short-lived. Bitcoin began another, even more impressive leg up in the following hours and tapped a fresh peak at $112,000 on Pizza Day. It retraced slightly to $111,000 on Friday but remained at around that level until the POTUS recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU to start from June 1. In minutes, BTC’s price tumbled below $107,500, bounced off, and then slipped again to under $107,000. It has recovered some ground now and sits above $108,000, but it’s still over 2% down on the day. Its market cap has plunged to $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Red The altcoins have followed BTC on the way south, with substantial losses of up to 10% from the likes of DOGE, ADA, SUI, SHIB, LINK, and AVAX. Ethereum has slipped by over 5% and is now down to $2,550. XRP has dropped to just over $2.3 after a 4.4% daily decline. Even more painful price drops are evident from ENA, WIF, TIA, S, IP, and PEPE as all of them have plunged by double digits.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For Second ‘Price Discovery Uptrend’ Following $109,000 Breakout – What’s Ahead For BTC? Litecoin Attempting Key Breakout Litecoin has seen a remarkable 63% rally from April’s lows over the past month and a half, surging above crucial levels in the past few weeks. Just this month, the cryptocurrency has recovered the $80 and $90 support levels and attempted to reclaim the $100 barrier again. Fueled by the market recovery and Bitcoin’s rally past the $100,000 mark, LTC hit a two-month high of $107 nearly two weeks ago. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to hold the $100 mark. However, analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show recently suggested that Litecoin “is about to pump.” The analyst highlighted a bullish pattern on LTC’s chart, which could see the cryptocurrency rise 20% toward the $117.5 mark for the first time since early March. According to Runefelt’s chart, the cryptocurrency formed a bullish flag pattern after hitting its two-month high. Since then, LTC has hovered between the upper and lower boundary, bouncing once before from the support line toward the pattern’s resistance line. Earlier this week, Litecoin bounced again from the support after touching the $92 level, which led the analyst to suggest it has “every chance to break out of this bullish flag to the upside.” On Friday, the altcoin jumped 11% from the pattern lows, briefly breaking out and hitting the $102 mark before retracing to the $96 mark. The cryptocurrency now hovers between the $98-$99 levels, just 1% below the pattern’s upper boundary. A surge above this level to confirm the breakout could set the stage for the pattern’s $117.5 target and mark a significant push toward a key horizontal level. LTC Preparing For Rally To $150? Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Litecoin needs a Monthly Close above its key resistance level to target the $150 mark and above. He highlighted the $110-$125 horizontal level, explaining that LTC “spends most of its time below it and very little time comparatively beyond it.” The analyst noted that since 2019, the rejection from this resistance level has been getting “progressively weaker over time to the point where only a couple of months ago, LTC tried to retest this region as support” during the early 2025 rally. Despite failing to reclaim this level, this could suggest that the resistance is “struggling to hold price down,” which is why the next breakout above this area could signal that “the chances of a successful retest are high.” Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? Moreover, the weakening of the resistance could be partly attributed to its multi-year Marco Higher Low, as Litecoin has bounced from the ascending trendline toward this resistance each time it has been retested. Based on this, the analyst considers that a Monthly Close above the key horizontal level, followed by a retest to confirm the breakout, would give the necessary strength for a 30% rally above the $150 mark for the first time since 2021. As of this writing, Litecoin trades at $98.60, a 2.7% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Yet, as Cardano’s ecosystem expands, the political meme coin sector is capturing the imagination of both traders and analysts. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its explosive presale momentum and viral narrative, is emerging as the breakout contender—offering a unique blend of political relevance and early-stage upside that’s hard to ignore. Cardano: Cutting-Edge Tech and Real-World Integration In 2025, Cardano is leading blockchain development with a suite of technological breakthroughs. Its Plutus smart contract language and Layer 2 scaling solution, Hydra, are enabling more efficient, secure, and automated business processes. Cardano’s smart contracts now power everything from instant supply chain payments to decentralized finance, while the network’s focus on interoperability is breaking down barriers between blockchains and fostering seamless asset transfers. Academic partnerships, such as the Cardano Foundation’s collaboration with PUC-Rio, are fueling research in blockchain economics, DeFi, and DAO governance, further cementing Cardano’s role as a research-driven blockchain leader. These advancements are not only attracting enterprise adoption but also inspiring new business models and decentralized applications that could reshape industries. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Momentum in the Political Crypto Arena While Cardano’s technological progress is impressive, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the playbook for political meme coins. Unlike fleeting trends, MAGA leverages a scarcity-driven model—capped at 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, and audited by HashEx—to create a foundation for exponential growth. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% ROI, with a $1 target by year-end seen as plausible if current momentum holds. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to channel political sentiment into tangible market traction. The coin’s presale has already raised over $8 million, with whale allocations and rapid sellouts highlighting strong conviction among early backers. MAGA’s blend of grassroots energy, viral marketing, and structured tokenomics is positioning it as the political crypto to watch as the 2025 election cycle heats up. Why the Market Is Watching MAGA Political meme coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are doing more than just riding election headlines—they’re building communities around shared identity and purpose. This emotional and financial engagement is driving unprecedented capital inflows, making MAGA not only a symbol of political culture but also a high-conviction investment for those seeking outsized returns before exchange listings. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering a rare ground-floor opportunity as the next wave of political and meme-driven crypto gains takes shape. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Cardano’s technological advancements are pushing blockchain into new territory, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s viral rise in the political crypto arena is redefining what’s possible for early-stage investors.

Table of Contents A step forward for Solaxy…But questions remain The next Pepe that will spread everywhere: PEPETO The untold origin story that crypto can’t stop talking about: PEPE…TO ? Behind PEPETO, there’s real tech and real plans Currently at $0.000000130, Tier 1 listing could hit any moment For those who have invested in Solaxy or are thinking about it, here’s something worth seriously considering. Solaxy markets itself as the first Layer 2 built on Solana, and while that sounds bold, ask: does Solana even need it? Layer 2 solutions make a big impact on Ethereum, where high gas fees and slow transaction speeds hold back usability. But Solana is already known for lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low fees. Adding another layer to an already efficient system might not bring the same level of improvement. Solaxy could still see short-term gains on hype alone, maybe even a 5x, but when it comes to long-term value, it’s not clear how this tech fills a real need. That raises a bigger question: without solving a clear problem, can Solaxy stay relevant? You might also like: Pepe climbs 60%: Which memecoin will be the next 100x this bull run, Pepe or Pepeto? A step forward for Solaxy…But questions remain Everyone’s watching what Solaxy does next , but is it building something people will remember? Recently, the team teamed up with Hyperlane to launch a testnet bridge. This lets users send SOL quickly and safely on a trial version of the network. They’re building a system that could later connect Solana to Ethereum, making it easier to move assets between blockchains. It’s a solid step forward. But let’s be honest, a testnet is just that: a test. It doesn’t prove long-term impact yet. It’s progress, yes, but it doesn’t have the kind of viral energy that turns a memecoin into a breakout star. Solaxy still doesn’t have a strong story. And in today’s crypto world, story matters just as much as technology. Solaxy is good, but good alone doesn’t guarantee staying power once the spotlight moves on. The next Pepe that will spread everywhere: PEPETO While others are still finding their footing, Pepeto is gaining serious momentum. Early buyers are stacking in before the noise hits, and this might be the memecoin everyone regrets missing in 2025. Let’s see why it checks every box for the next x 100 memecoin: The untold origin story that crypto can’t stop talking about: PEPE…TO ? Born from what many say was the original Pepe blueprint, Pepeto steps in with something the market hasn’t seen: purpose . While Pepe went viral, Pepeto brings back what was left behind — a full identity built on P recision, E nergy, P ower, and E fficiency… and the two missing pieces that change everything : Technology and Optimization . That’s what makes this more than a meme. It’s a comeback. Behind PEPETO, there’s real tech and real plans Most memecoins stop at community and jokes. Pepeto, aka God of frogs doesn’t. With its own multi-chain swap (PepetoSwap) being built, a staking system that rewards loyalty, and plans to support real movement between chains like Ethereum and Solana, it’s giving holders more than hope, it’s giving them tools. Here’s what sets Pepeto apart: Cross-chain PepetoSwap in development Early staking rewards to reward long-term holding A real story with viral potential Active community rooted in more than memes A meme coin that’s actually building something useful Currently at $0.000000130, Tier 1 listing could hit any moment Crypto whispers are getting louder: a Tier 1 exchange listing could be next for Pepeto. And yet, the token is still priced at just $0.00000013 . That’s the kind of number that made early Pepe (same market supply as PEPETO) and Shiba buyers millions. The difference? This time, you’re early. The price is low, the story is strong, and listing rumors are gaining traction. For those curious, take a look at the website and see what’s being built , this might be an early window before the spotlight arrives. How to buy Pepeto: Go to pepeto.io , connect MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and pay with ETH, USDT , or BNB. It’s fast. It’s simple. It’s right now. (With 288% staking rewards).

45031345,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=733848,1748066566,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45031345.jpeg,America is ‘going big’ on crypto after years of industry starvation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/besset-says-america-is-going-big-on-crypto/,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent affirmed that the administration is committed to positioning the country as the global leader in digital assets. Bessent, speaking to Bloomberg, said the government is “going big” on crypto, a striking contrast with the previous administration, which took a restrictive approach that left many companies struggling to survive. In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bessent said that, instead, the White House plans to tighten up anti-money laundering (AML) standards for digital assets, especially stablecoins. He said the administration will pursue strong compliance while encouraging innovation, stating, “Digital asset companies deserve regulatory clarity, and that’s exactly what we are working toward.” Bessent also highlighted one of his key projections that stablecoins will generate $2 trillion in demand for U.S. Treasuries and bills in the near term, far more than the current $300 billion. According to the Treasury Secretary, this shift will inject a lot of liquidity into traditional markets without weakening oversight. Legislative momentum is also building in Washington. A bipartisan stablecoin bill that recently cleared a procedural roadblock in the U.S. Senate could soon become a reality. The measure had been stalled by a filibuster, which the Senate voted to end 66–32 earlier this month, allowing debate on the floor. Key changes to the bill brokered by crypto-supporting Democrats led by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks brought the breakthrough. They also dropped demands for a ban on former President Donald Trump profiting from his family’s crypto investments. The legislation marks a pivotal step, but even though a final vote might not take place until after the Memorial Day recess, industry insiders say. If it passes, it will create a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, ending years of legal limbo and inviting more institutional participation to the industry. Bessent eyes relief for the Treasury market Bessent hinted at heavily transforming the traditional financial system beyond digital assets. He said U.S. regulators are nearing the end of a process that will remove the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) requirement on banks that trade Treasuries. As a post-2008 crisis safeguard, the SLR currently requires banks to hold more capital against holding trading Treasuries in their reserves. Bessent said that removal could increase liquidity in the $29 trillion market and lower Treasury yields by a few basis points. The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC are in discussions. This would represent a significant regulatory change and may help digital asset markets. Trump’s crypto dinner stirs debate Meanwhile, President Trump is seizing the opportunity to brand himself as crypto’s political champion. In a recent Truth Social post, he said the U.S. is ‘dominating in crypto, bitcoin, etc.,’ vowing to ‘keep it that way.’ The top 220 holders of Trump’s TRUMP meme coin were invited to a high-profile crypto dinner at Trump’s Virginia golf club. Legislators raised concerns about the VIP event’s transparency and its ethical implications. It was reported to have raised $148 million. They questioned the concentration among Trump-linked entities and the risk of foreign influence. Despite the criticism, attendees viewed the dinner as indicative of just how politically relevant crypto is becoming. The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the president was there in his personal time and that no official guest list will be released. Several guests attended with the intent of changing Trump’s stance on crypto regulation, the New York Times later reported.

The commentator outlines a broad vision where XRP, along with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s infrastructure, becomes an essential component in the digital transformation of global financial systems. According to this analysis, banks are preparing to leverage XRP for payments and a foundation for CBDCs, asset tokenization, digital custody, DeFi, and liquidity services. The post asserts that XRP is already integrated into significant financial systems. Over 100 financial institutions are reportedly utilizing RippleNet for cross-border payments. However, the commentary emphasizes that Ripple’s strategic direction is evolving. The original focus on remittances and international transfers is now being complemented by ambitions to embed Ripple’s technology deeper into the core operations of banking infrastructure. WILD TAKE: XRP won’t just power payments. Banks are eyeing it to run entire digital ecosystems — from CBDCs to custody to asset tokenization. This isn't just speculation. Let me show you why. pic.twitter.com/kOm9iQrQiA — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 21, 2025 CBDCs and XRP as Multi-Function Infrastructure The commentator points to the partnership between Ripple and Colombia’s central bank , which tests central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) using Ripple’s platform. This initiative is described as more than a pilot. The tweet suggests XRP could serve as the transmission layer, the storage system, and the transaction coordinator for CBDCs. If adopted broadly, banks could generate revenue through the distribution, settlement, and custody of these digital currencies. Further, the commentary addresses the XRP Ledger’s capacity for real-world asset tokenization . This includes tokenizing assets such as real estate, bonds, and commodities. The post proposes that banks could use these features to mint and manage tokenized versions of physical assets. According to the author, the potential mirrors traditional asset managers like BlackRock, but with blockchain-native mechanisms that streamline trading and management. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Digital Custody, DeFi, and Institutional Growth The analysis also focuses on digital custody . As institutional involvement in cryptocurrency grows, secure storage of digital assets becomes critical. The post claims that Ripple’s infrastructure could position banks to take on this custodial role, storing XRP and other crypto assets on behalf of clients. This service could provide banks with recurring revenue through custody fees, a model aligned with how traditional finance handles securities and vault services. DeFi, though still in an early stage within the XRP ecosystem, is identified as another area for growth. With emerging smart contract capabilities on XRPL, banks may one day offer services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming directly on-chain. According to the tweet, Ripple is preparing for this possibility now, setting the groundwork for a broader rollout once regulatory conditions are clarified. Liquidity Services and the Role of Regulation Liquidity provision is another proposed use case. Banks could supply XRP liquidity for foreign exchange (FX) markets, profiting from spread differentials, lending, and market-making activities. The author emphasizes the benefits of speed and scale, suggesting that XRP-based liquidity could eliminate the need for intermediaries and allow banks to handle volume with greater efficiency. The commentary acknowledges that many of these applications are still in development and not mainstream. However, the author insists the infrastructure is already in place, and interest from financial institutions is increasing. As regulatory clarity improves, particularly in the United States following the high-profile SEC lawsuit against Ripple, banks are becoming more confident in exploring XRP for a wider range of functions. In closing, All Things XRP proposes that the financial sector’s interest in XRP is not limited to accelerating payments. Rather, banks may be preparing to use XRP and Ripple technology to construct a new layer of global financial infrastructure. The message is clear: XRP is not just a tool for transactions but potentially a foundational component of future banking systems.

Despite the buzz surrounding this major exchange debut, PI’s price has fallen 3.5% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $0.7821, highlighting growing concerns about its volatility and centralization. Kraken Offers 20x Leverage for U.S. Traders With the new perpetual futures contracts, users on Kraken Pro can now go long or short on Pi with up to 20x leverage. The contract supports over 360 markets and accepts more than 40 different collateral options. This move makes it easier than ever for U.S. traders to access Pi futures without additional regulatory or platform hurdles. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts do not expire, allowing traders to hold their positions indefinitely—though funding fees may apply based on market conditions. This listing is seen as a potential signal of growing institutional interest in Pi, despite its absence from top-tier exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Centralization and Privacy Issues Raise Red Flags Despite development efforts, Pi Network continues to face criticism over its token distribution and privacy practices. Currently, about 60% of the total PI supply is still controlled by the core team. Dr. Altcoin, a prominent supporter of the project, has voiced serious concerns about the lack of transparency from the Pi Core Team, particularly regarding how user data is collected and used. He warns that this data could potentially be used for: AI training Identity theft Tracking users’ real-world movements Without proper disclosure, he believes user trust and data privacy remain at serious risk. New Ecosystem Updates from Pi Network Amid these controversies, Pi Network has introduced several ecosystem improvements, including: Five new community apps integrated into the Pi Mainnet Ecosystem Interface A simplified account recovery process, aimed at boosting accessibility and user participation These updates reflect ongoing efforts to enhance Pi’s utility and ecosystem engagement, though questions remain about transparency and market readiness. Final Thoughts Pi Network’s listing on Kraken’s futures platform marks a major milestone, giving the project more visibility and market tools for traders. However, the price slump, transparency concerns, and centralized token holdings may continue to weigh on sentiment. As institutional attention increases, the Pi Core Team’s next moves—especially regarding communication and decentralization—will be closely watched.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ZRX|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 06:08:22

What It Means for XRP Price and XRP News,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/why-solaxy-and-pepeto-are-the-fastest-growing-cryptocurrencies/,"The post Why Solaxy and Pepeto Are the Fastest Growing Cryptocurrencies? What It Means for XRP Price and XRP News appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Crypto Market Is Heating Up , And XRP Is in the Spotlight Bitcoin has surged past $110K, while XRP is making waves again with bullish price forecasts and rising interest. But outside the usual headlines, two lesser-known coins , Solaxy and Pepeto , are quietly building momentum. One leans on technical development, the other on community firepower and viral storytelling. The difference? One might trend , the other might take over. Solaxy’s Bold Claim , Is Solana’s Layer 2 Necessary? Solaxy is attracting attention by branding itself as the first Layer 2 project built on Solana. But Solana already processes transactions quickly and cheaply. Unlike Ethereum, it doesn’t struggle with speed or gas fees. So what value does a Layer 2 really add? Solaxy might still generate some early excitement and short-term returns, but it’s unclear if this tech delivers something game-changing in the long term. Building Behind the Scenes , But Not Breaking Out Yet Solaxy recently teamed up with Hyperlane to launch a testnet bridge, which lets users send native SOL in a secure test environment. The goal is to eventually support transfers between Solana and Ethereum. It’s a positive step, but testnets are still early-stage. They don’t typically create hype. Without a compelling story behind the product, even solid development can fly under the radar. Solaxy is progressing, but it hasn’t captured the spotlight , yet. Pepeto Steps Up , The Meme With a Mission Then there’s Pepeto. Not just a meme coin , it’s a mission coin. Backed by a fiery origin story and growing support, Pepeto has become the talk of meme circles. Some believe it revives the true roots of Pepe, but adds depth and structure. Its name says it all: P recision, E nergy, P ower, E fficiency, Technology, Optimization . That’s not just branding , that’s a blueprint for going viral in 2025. More Than Hype , Pepeto Is Building Real Tools That Matter Pepeto isn’t just riding a wave. It’s building it. PepetoSwap , a multi-chain swap platform , is already in the works, aiming to connect major ecosystems like Solana, Ethereum, and BNB Chain. Staking is live, with jaw-dropping early returns.

While established players like SUI and Dogecoin capture headlines with impressive price movements, a revolutionary newcomer is quietly building momentum that could reshape the entire gaming and DeFi landscape. BitLemons ($BLEM) isn’t just another token riding market waves—it’s a revenue-generating powerhouse that’s already proven its mettle with over $2 million raised and a fully operational crypto casino disrupting the $450 billion traditional gaming market. Smart money is flowing toward projects with real utility and sustainable tokenomics, and BitLemons delivers on both fronts with its groundbreaking 30% Gross Gaming Revenue allocation model. While SUI tests new highs and DOGE attempts crucial breakouts, seasoned investors are recognizing that BitLemons represents something far more valuable: a chance to get in early on a protocol that generates revenue 24/7, burns tokens systematically, and rewards holders through high-yield staking—all while being backed by dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof. Is SUI’s Momentum Sustainable at Current Levels? SUI has been commanding attention with its impressive surge to $3.86, driven by expanding adoption across the DeFi ecosystem and growing institutional confidence. The blockchain’s unique approach to parallel transaction processing has attracted developers and users alike, creating a virtuous cycle of growth that’s reflected in both price action and network activity. Technical analysis reveals SUI has maintained strong bullish momentum over the past seven days, with trading volume surging approximately 23% as the token broke through key resistance levels. The $3.80-$3.90 range has emerged as critical support, while bulls are eyeing the psychological $4.00 barrier. RSI readings suggest the token isn’t yet overbought, leaving room for continued upward movement if broader market conditions remain favorable. Can DOGE Finally Break the $0.40 Ceiling That’s Held for Months? Dogecoin is staging what could be its most significant breakout attempt in recent months, currently trading at $0.2451 while building pressure against the stubborn $0.40 resistance level. The meme coin’s community-driven momentum has intensified, with social media engagement and whale accumulation patterns suggesting renewed institutional interest in the original meme cryptocurrency. The past week has seen DOGE consolidate within a tight $0.23-$0.25 range, with volume increasing by roughly 18% as traders position for the anticipated breakout. Technical indicators show the 50-day moving average providing solid support around $0.22, while the $0.40 resistance remains the key level to watch. If DOGE can finally pierce this ceiling, analysts project a potential rally toward $0.48, representing nearly 100% upside from current levels. Why Are Savvy Investors Calling BitLemons the “Stealth Rocket” of 2025? While market participants debate whether SUI can maintain its momentum and DOGE can break its ceiling, BitLemons ($BLEM) is quietly executing a strategy that traditional crypto projects can only dream of achieving. This isn’t just another speculative token—it’s a fully operational crypto casino generating real revenue from over 8,000 games provided by industry giants like Evolution and Pragmatic Play. What sets BitLemons apart is its revolutionary tokenomics model that allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue directly to token holders through a dual mechanism: 15% funds systematic token buybacks and burns, creating deflationary pressure, while the remaining 15% flows to stakers as high-yield rewards. With dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof—validation that competitors simply cannot match—BitLemons has established itself as the institutional-grade choice in the GambleFi space. The numbers tell an incredible story of momentum and demand. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, Stage 2 has completely sold out, and Stage 3 is already 11.23% filled with tokens currently priced at $0.03. Having raised over $2 million including $1 million in seed funding, BitLemons is methodically advancing through its 13-stage presale structure, with each stage increasing the token price by $0.01. Industry insiders continue to whisper about potential listing prices between $0.17 and $0.18, representing extraordinary upside for current participants. BitLemons operates in a league of its own because it never sleeps—the platform generates revenue 24/7 while systematically reducing token supply and rewarding loyal holders. This creates a perfect storm of deflationary mechanics, passive income generation, and exposure to the massive $450 billion traditional casino market that’s ripe for blockchain disruption. Are you ready to position yourself ahead of the institutions who are quietly accumulating positions in the next generation of revenue-generating crypto protocols? While others chase momentum plays and hope for breakouts, BitLemons offers something far more valuable: a fundamentally sound investment backed by real revenue, audited security, and tokenomics designed to reward early believers. The window for seed-round pricing won’t remain open forever. With each presale stage bringing higher prices and growing investor demand, the opportunity to secure allocation at current levels represents a rare chance to participate in what could become the defining success story of the 2025 crypto cycle. Don’t let this incredible seed entry opportunity slip through your fingers while you’re watching others chase yesterday’s winners.

45032265,https://nulltx.com/?p=149901,1748068882,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"SOON Token Debuts with Volatility, Binance Airdrop, and Jump Crypto’s Return",https://nulltx.com/soon-token-debuts-with-volatility-binance-airdrop-and-jump-cryptos-return/,"Today, a prestigious newcomer arrived in the Solana Layer 2 ecosystem with the launch of the SOON token , the native asset of the SOON project (@soon_svm). The token entered the market with some fanfare, briefly spiking to $1.37 before promptly correcting and heading down to around $0.54. The project has created a lot of excitement in the crypto world, and for good reason—the price is moving, and it’s moving upward. Beneath the surface, though, what we’ve got is a project that is well supported and well financed, with some serious industry players behind it. This is all to say that it’s potentially very much a thing. SOON Trading Debut and Market Dynamics The SOON token was greeted by a wave of opportunistic trading, making its first hours of existence a spectacularly profitable affair for those who bought and sold it then. By the end of that initial trading day, it seemed that SOON had established a new normal around the 54-cent mark. But in the hours leading up to that new normal, SOON had become an instant hit, peaking at $1.37 before dropping almost 60% back to that 54-cent normal. At present levels, the circulating market cap of SOON is around $106 million, and the fully diluted valuation (FDV) is close to $530 million. These numbers—almost doubled from a month ago—certainly show some kind of a spotlight around the recent launch of SOON, shining investor interest and putting in long-term expectations for it to play some kind of role within the Solana ecosystem. Speculative trading might be the major force driving early price action on the market, but that doesn’t mean we’re just seeing a situation of buy and sell orders going through and nothing else. What Bitcoin’s price behavior right now shows is just how uncertain the market as a whole is. Not just about Bitcoin itself, but also about the myriad of narratives and stories the overall crypto-sector trade tells. Both to itself and to the outside world. Solana L2 project SOON @soon_svm debuted trading today, surging to $1.37 before dropping to ~$0.54. Current circulating market cap sits at $106M, with an FDV around $530M. @Binance to airdrop 180 $SOON (≈$97) to users with Alpha Points ≥190. #Solana #SOON pic.twitter.com/RltegXCGMn — Followin (@followin_io) May 23, 2025 Binance SOON Airdrop and Alpha Points Rewards The launch is generating some excitement, and adding to that, Binance has announced an exclusive airdrop campaign for SOON. It was said that there were users who had accumulated 190 or more Alpha Points—a measure of engagement and loyalty within Binance’s promotional ecosystem—and those users were to receive an airdrop of 180 SOON tokens. At the time, 180 SOON was valued at around $97. This airdrop creates not just a way to engage users but an actual incentive to balance the books of a newly traded token. For SOON, the airdrop is a way to drive liquidity and user acquisition in a methodical and, frankly, institutional fashion. That Binance would underwrite a moment like this in the creation of the SOON token is awash with institutional confidence. Also, the initial user response to the airdrop is quite upbeat, with a number of users noting that this is among the biggest rewards so far owing to the Alpha Points program. All this puts Binance squarely in the middle of a token’s launch and keeps the market moving. Jump Crypto’s Market-Making Comeback The apparent return of Jump Crypto as a market maker tied to SOON’s launch offers an intriguing storyline. And this time? Under the leadership of Donald Trump’s administration. Two days before trading commenced, blockchain data revealed that 2.5 million SOON tokens were transported from BNB Chain (BSC) to Solana utilizing LayerZero, a cross-chain interoperability protocol. The address to which these tokens were sent was 7kuKG…1pDqc. One day later, 2 million of those tokens were sent to Jump Crypto’s known public wallet (Gtxgn…LxKdq). Jump Crypto now seems to be actively supporting the SOON market, its first known market-making engagement since Donald Trump became president. This marks the firm’s apparent return to the market in what has been a relatively quiet period since the disruptions of 2022.

They are often seen as bringing joined-up thinking and acting to the sometimes-ungainly world of crypto token trading. In the past, they have been allies and partners to at least some extent in Solana. Conclusion: SOON Hype Meets Fundamentals With an eye-catching debut, a sizeable airdrop from Binance, and the re-emergence of a big institutional player like Jump Crypto, SOON has become one of the most buzzworthy token launches of late. Despite the fact that its initial price movement was volatile, the groundwork for this thing being a long-term vehicle of positive change seems good. With cross-chain technology, Solana integration, and institutional backers, SOON may be more than just another vehicle for speculators to push around — it could be the start of something genuinely and undoubtably transformative. Once launch day finally comes to a close, the spotlight will very quickly switch to SOON itself, and everyone will watch closely to see how it performs—will it keep right on rolling, or might it regress in the wake of launch as things so often seem to do in this life? We in the space will also watch for how SOON performs on specific verticals—business, politics, and soc. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45032266,https://nulltx.com/?p=149900,1748068975,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"BNB Chain Shows Resilience Amid Price Pressure, Institutional Optimism",https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-shows-resilience-amid-price-pressure-institutional-optimism/,"This week, the price of BNB has been performing disappointingly, but the ecosystem is showing strong fundamentals and moving forward with development. BNB Chain has encountered setbacks but is making major progress, painting a complex, but overall optimistic, picture for BNB Chain—a principal Layer 1 blockchain in the market. Recent developments in decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and institutional reinforcement mean that BNB Chain has advanced — seems to be advancing — even if that elevation hasn’t yet shown itself in the token’s price and market capitalization. BNB Price Dips Slightly as Bitcoin Dominance Weighs on Altcoins This week, the total market cap of the BNB Chain ecosystem saw a slight dip, falling 1.4% to just over $7 billion. BNB itself shed some weight, falling to just under $280 and holding a market valuation of about $91.8 billion as of Friday afternoon. This week, the decline of the BNB Chain ecosystem is a direct effect of the rising tide earlier in the week of Bitcoin. Short-term weaknesses notwithstanding, BNB Chain’s monthly performance still reveals a very healthy 15.7% gain that shows a longer-term uptrend. “Greed” is presently the market sentiment for Bitcoin, indicating that investors are generally optimistic about the leading cryptocurrency. Trading across the altcoin market has remained muted in recent days, with BNB and other altcoins seeing paltry volumes, as the market patiently awaits more significant Bitcoin price action. BNB price pullbacks look to be not so much about weakness in the chain but more about macro trends. All eyes are on Bitcoin, and as it goes, many altcoins are barely hanging on by a thread. This seems to be the case with BNB, which has actually flipped bullish on the BTC pair, but then again, that’s the kind of dynamic that too many altcoins are struggling with these days. DeFi Thrives: PancakeSwap V3 and Ecosystem Metrics Surge The price of BNB can be unstable, yet the DeFi infrastructure based on it seems to be thriving. This week, the leading decentralized exchange on BNB Chain, PancakeSwap, gave us a prominent metric to look at. It had a trading volume that surged by an unbelievable 152% from the week prior. What this looks at kind of at a top layer is: this is one of the major platforms on BNB Chain. It’s an interface through which a lot of folks are accessing the chain’s DeFi infrastructure. So to see it doing 152% better, that is quite an eyepopper. Increased activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the BNB Chain is offsetting a minor decrease in the total value locked (TVL) in the network’s DeFi protocols. The DEX week-over-week activity metric is up 81%, which is substantial and suggests that user preference is shifting to DEXs. In the DeFi layer of the BNB Chain, even with this small downturn of 2.4%, the total value locked (TVL) today is still the third-largest amount among all Layer 1 blockchains. Week in BNB Chain: Weak Price Performance, Fundamental Strength. PancakeSwap V3 volume surges 152%! Wello launches global PayFi app! Standard Chartered forecasts BNB at $1,275 by year-end! Let's examine BNB Chain's mixed signals this week 1/6 pic.twitter.com/Pf7JBFNTaR — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 22, 2025 The Platform Update The BNB Chain’s transaction costs are very low, and that’s a big part of the chain’s appeal. Right now, the average transaction cost is just $0.06. That’s about as low as it gets. And for those who want to do business on the BNB Chain, that’s a very nice price. Wello Launch and Institutional Confidence Paint a Bright Future Apart from DeFi, BNB Chain witnessed a notable development in the payments sector with the worldwide unveiling of Wello PayFi. The platform allows for rapid, inexpensive cross-border payments and plays nicely with Apple Pay, Visa, and more than 120 fiat onramps. Wello merges the decentralized security of blockchain with the user-friendly centralization necessary for mass adoption. This makes it a potentially huge player in the global remittance market. This product launch is the real-world adoption step for BNB Chain; it shows that BNB Chain can do what we really want — impact the world with user-facing financial applications. And it isn’t just a narrative; it shows that BNB Chain isn’t just a DeFi playground. It’s positioning itself as a viable full-stack blockchain ecosystem. Possibly the most encouraging aspect is the long-term look from institutions. Analysts at Standard Chartered are giving a very bullish forecast for BNB. They see it reaching $1,275 by the end of 2025, which would be a gain of more than 300% from current levels. Their report cites ongoing ecosystem growth and rising adoption as the main reasons they are confident in BNB’s future. Conclusion This week saw a slight drop in price, but the BNB Chain remains durable and full of potential. Surge in DEX Activity A group of 40 decentralized exchanges launched a global app on the same day. Bullish Institutional Sentiment Last week, news broke that the BNB Chain raised $3 billion in fresh capital from more than 100 institutional investors. Price Stability Stable growth in the Bitcoin dominance number suggests that BNB has a good chance of recapturing the kind of sustained price growth that rewards dollar-cost-averaging investors.

You could even say that as the Bitcoin ball kept rolling downhill—past $17,000, $18,000, and even $19,000—the excitement and participation level of the crypto space kept rising. At the same time, the crypto-killer ice storms of 2014 and 2018 seemed to be occurring further in the past than they really were. And then came late May 2019. The fresh dangers encompass a far-reaching 50% duty on all merchandise coming in from the European Union and a sharp 25% tax on imports that targets Apple directly if the company maintains its current course of building iPhones anywhere but in the U.S. Tariffs Target EU and Apple Amid Trade Frustration The announcement from President Trump was accompanied by some very sharp criticism of both the trade policies of Europe and of Apple’s global supply chain strategy. Expressing what he saw as frustrations with the negotiating process—specifically, he called the negotiations “stalled”—Trump made it very clear that unless things in trade talks started to improve, we could expect to see the proposed tariffs go into effect on June 1. One of the most valuable and famous companies in America, Apple, found itself in the political crosshairs. The tech giant was directly cited by Trump for moving much of its iPhone production to India, an American company in an American-style business move. Apple made this move to diversify its manufacturing base and reduce dependence on China, not in deference to any foreign government. The president warned, however, that unless Apple got the message and began relocating more of its production back to U.S. soil, it would face a 25 percent tariff on devices made overseas. Trump stated in a press release that the tariffs impose a balance and fairness to trade. He asserted that they are about bringing manufacturing to America and defending American workers. Although Trump’s rhetoric has always concentrated on the theme of economic nationalism, the sudden appearance and the sheer scale of these new threats caught lots of folks off guard. And it struck that way for a couple of reasons. First, the rhetoric had just recently begun to cool down, and we were in the middle of a global economic outlook conference when Trump poured fresh fuel on the fire. Crypto Markets React Swiftly to Tariff Uncertainty The immediate and intense effect on financial markets was evident. Bitcoin had only recently attained a new all-time high of $112,000, but in the blink of an eye, it lost more than 3%, with some brave (or foolish) souls even forecasting a price as low as $107,600. Analysts blamed the uncertainty unleashed by the tariff threat. The S&P 500 also slipped, and tech stocks took a notable hit in the aftermath of the announcement. Traders are becoming more uneasy about the unpredictable nature of U.S. tariff policies, which have the potential to disrupt global supply chains and investor confidence. Just a day after Bitcoin's new $112K all-time high was established, tariff drama was quickly brought back on to the menu and has temporarily spoiled the crypto party. President Trump has announced two new major tariff threats as the U.S. heads into Memorial Day weekend: … pic.twitter.com/6hgdBqGY6r — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 23, 2025 A crypto analyst said, “This is classic FUD,” referencing the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that often drives sharp market reactions. “Just as things were stabilizing post-China tensions, we’re right back to uncertainty. People are hesitant to make bold moves right now. Many are simply holding and hoping for clarity.” The atmosphere today mirrors the worries evident in early April, when surging trade tensions made the cryptocurrency markets uneasy. From April 7 to 9, crypto traders experienced significant volatility as it was predominantly the talk of tariffs that was lighting up the headlines. This latest round of threats seems to have revived that same anxiety uptrend. A Cautious Outlook Heading Into June With the June 1st deadline for tariffs fast approaching, markets will likely continue to be on edge. Investors and traders in virtually all sectors are now battening down the hatches for what is expected to be a pretty significant volatility spike, especially if the U.S.-EU trade talks don’t manage to get off the ground. If the talks do fail, that also opens the door for Apple to become the next poster child for the administration’s punitive tariff policy, a scenario that would truly rock the global tech supply chain. For traders in cryptocurrency, this situation reveals the larger truth that digital assets are not protected from the kinds of seismic macroeconomic shifts that can happen to any nation or region. Altogether, decentralized by design, the crypto market is more connected to the global financial system—and to the political decisions that impact the health of that system—than it often seems. The dust is settling, and the weekend is approaching; the mood that followed Bitcoin’s ATH has shifted to cautious optimism. The exuberance that came with this year’s all-time high for Bitcoin seems likely to continue only as long as the political and economic conditions that produced it remain unchanged.

This explosive growth means that the platform now finds itself in the unlikely position of occupying the fifth slot in the global crypto derivatives market. The only names it trails are those of four very large cryptocurrencies: Binance, Bitget, Bybit, and OKX. Not just the platform’s surging popularity but also its groundbreaking way of trading through a transparent, Web3-native infrastructure—one that is redefining how traders interact with digital assets—is what this achievement reflects. Web3 Transparency Brings New Era of Trust in Trading What distinguishes Hyperliquid in a surging field is its commitment to transparent on-chain activity. Its Web3 infrastructure allows users to directly observe trading behavior and positions on the blockchain. And traders can access a whole set of stats—from the behavior of their own trades to those of large players—in building a more informed trading environment. A kind of visibility that is rare among centralized exchanges, where most of the trading activity occurs behind closed doors. By putting data on-chain, Hyperliquid gives users real-time, verifiable information about what’s going on. This is clearly striking a chord with the crypto community and is part of the transparency demand that we see growing in all financial systems. As traders grow more aware of the dangers linked to unclear platforms, a good number of them are now opting for services like Hyperliquid. These services provide the twin benefits of decentralization and combined usability with that of centralized exchanges. Such a platform seems to be on the fast track for success and to popularize the hybrid approach it represents. Record-Breaking Trading Activity Marks Key Turning Point Hyperliquid recently reached new heights of activity and set a new all-time high (ATH) for both open interest and trading volume. Open interest—the total value of outstanding derivative contracts—soared to $8.92 billion. At the same time, the platform enjoyed an impressive $18.91 billion in 24-hour trading volume. These numbers mean more than simply being statistics. They indicate that trust in this platform is increasing. It also tells us that liquidity is on the rise, too. And both of these things—trust and liquidity—are absolutely essential if any exchange wants to seriously position itself as a market leader. Hyperliquid Hits New ATH @HyperliquidX has become a key hub for the crypto community when it comes to trading derivatives. Its Web3 infrastructure allows users to see on-chain activity directly tied to trading on the platform. This transparency — such as the ability to view the… pic.twitter.com/2bxw4bpioF — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 23, 2025 Hyperliquid now sits comfortably in the fifth position among exchanges globally, having surpassed many competitors that have been around far longer. These figures indicate that not only is the platform technologically strong, but it has also implemented a robust marketing and community strategy. The crypto market is far from static, and in this space, the winning platforms seem destined to be the ones that combine community engagement with innovative changes and incremental improvements. $HYPE Token Gathers Steam Amid Buyback Strategy Adding even more boosters to the platform’s march skyward is its homegrown token, $HYPE. The token has seen dazzling price action of late, and this appears largely down to Hyperliquid’s very ongoing buyback. By purchasing tokens from the open market, the team is not only making a very loud statement about the long-term value of the token but is also quite obviously helping to reduce the circulating supply. And that reduced supply, given the same sort of demand, should quite obviously lead to a higher price. This financial reward is congruent with the platform’s growth, providing both early adopters and loyal users with more reasons to stay engaged. What’s more, it evinces a level of financial maturity and foresight that investors can appreciate — and that’s a nice change in a market often characterized by volatility and uncertainty. The increasing user adoption and record-setting trading activity seem to be strengthening the positive feedback loop between the utility of the platform and the value of the token. Conclusion Hyperliquid’s ascent has been anything but normal. By synthesizing blockchain openness with the smoothness of contemporary trading platforms, it has hewn out a one-of-a-kind niche in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. With unprecedented growth, a buzzing community, and a clear token economy, Hyperliquid is not merely in pursuit of the field’s front-runners; it is rapidly closing in on them. All eyes in the crypto universe are on Hyperliquid as it makes its next moves. They could cement its status as a solid fifth or take it even higher in the global rankings.

Bitcoin fell from a daily high of $111,200 to just over $107,000 on Friday, causing a swift change in sentiment. The drop came as President Donald Trump revived fears of a tariff war with the European Union — threatening a 50% levy as talks were “going nowhere.” Market cap shed 5% and the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, fell 2.2% as traders moved to lock in gains amid rising volatility. The move comes despite bitcoin touching fresh highs above $111,500 just days earlier, with ETF inflows, stablecoin legislation, and institutional buying supporting its rally. But those same tailwinds haven’t kept altcoins afloat in the short term. “Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high also carries altcoins toward a bullish direction,” said Haiyang Ru, co-CEO of HashKey Group, said in a Telegram message. “But if BTC’s volatility picks up again, traders may rotate into regulated stablecoins — especially with new frameworks in the U.S. and Hong Kong easing that transition.” Alex Kuptsikevich, chief analyst at FxPro, crypto sentiment recently hit levels last seen in January, just as BTC and ETH reached critical resistance zones. “Unlike previous BTCUSD rallies, the current movement is not just momentum-driven but backed by real demand and macro factors,” he noted. Still, markets are showing signs of fatigue. Ethereum is struggling to break past its 200-day moving average near $2,650, while altcoins that previously surged — such as HYPE and EIGEN — are now cooling off after double-digit gains. Analysts warn that if BTC doesn’t establish a new support zone, altcoin losses could deepen.

If so, you might have noticed something significant happening with Spot Bitcoin ETF products. These investment vehicles, which offer investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin without requiring them to directly hold the cryptocurrency, saw an extraordinary surge in activity. This isn’t just a minor blip; the total Bitcoin ETF trading volume for the day was truly remarkable, hitting a figure that underscores growing market participation. What Triggered This Impressive Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume? According to data shared by Watcher Guru on X, the cumulative trading volume across all U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 23 exceeded a staggering $4.5 billion. This figure represents a significant uptick in activity and is a key indicator of the current sentiment surrounding BTC ETF products and the broader crypto market. But what factors might have contributed to such a high volume on this particular day? Several elements could be at play: Market Momentum: Bitcoin’s price movement leading up to and on May 23 likely played a crucial role. Positive price action often correlates with increased investor interest and trading activity in related investment products like ETFs. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or shifts in investor risk appetite can drive capital towards or away from assets like Bitcoin, influencing ETF volumes. News and Developments: Specific news related to regulations, institutional adoption, or technological advancements within the crypto space can spur trading. Rebalancing and Flows: Large institutional players might have been rebalancing portfolios or executing significant buy/sell orders, contributing to the high volume. Understanding the context of this volume requires looking at the overall market environment at the time. Was Bitcoin experiencing significant volatility? Were there major announcements from asset managers or regulators? These external factors are often intertwined with the trading patterns observed in ETFs. Why Does High Spot Bitcoin ETF Volume Matter for Crypto Investment? The volume seen on May 23 is more than just a number; it carries significant implications for the market. High trading volume generally indicates strong liquidity and robust interest. For crypto investment , particularly through regulated products like ETFs, this is a positive sign. Here’s why it’s important: Liquidity: High volume means it’s easier for large buyers and sellers to trade shares without significantly impacting the price. This makes the ETF market more efficient and attractive, especially for institutional players. Institutional Interest: A substantial portion of this volume likely comes from institutional investors – hedge funds, asset managers, and financial advisors – who are increasingly comfortable using ETFs to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This points towards growing institutional crypto adoption. Market Validation: High trading volume validates the demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure and reinforces the role of ETFs as a primary gateway for traditional finance participants entering the crypto space. Price Discovery: Active trading in ETFs contributes to the overall price discovery mechanism for Bitcoin, as large flows can influence spot market prices. Think of it this way: the higher the volume, the more capital is flowing into or out of these regulated Bitcoin products, providing clearer signals about market demand from traditional investment channels. Who Are the Key Players in the BTC ETF Space? While the original snippet provides a total volume, it’s worth noting which ETFs typically contribute the most to the overall Spot Bitcoin ETF trading volume. Since their launch in January 2024, several funds have emerged as leaders. Prominent examples include: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT): Has consistently seen high inflows and trading volume. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): Another major player attracting significant investment. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): Although it started as a trust and converted to an ETF, it holds a large amount of Bitcoin and sees substantial trading volume, often related to outflows as investors switch to newer, lower-fee options. Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB): Also holds a notable share of the market. The competition among these funds, particularly regarding management fees and performance, also influences where the volume flows. Investors often compare these options based on costs, liquidity, and the reputation of the issuing firm. How Does This Volume Compare Historically? To fully appreciate the $4.5 billion+ figure, it’s helpful to compare it to previous trading days or weeks. While this wasn’t necessarily an all-time record volume day (which were often seen shortly after the ETFs launched), it represents a strong level of sustained interest. Days with volume exceeding several billion dollars indicate periods of heightened activity, often coinciding with significant price movements or market events. Looking at historical data for Bitcoin ETF trading volume helps us understand trends. Are volumes increasing over time? Are they becoming less volatile? Consistent, high volume suggests maturation of the market and increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. What are the Benefits and Challenges of Investing via a Spot Bitcoin ETF? The high trading volume on May 23 highlights the popularity of this investment method. But what are the pros and cons? Benefits: Accessibility: Easily tradable on traditional stock exchanges through brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: Operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection compared to some direct crypto exchanges. No Custody Hassle: Investors don’t need to worry about setting up wallets, managing private keys, or securing their Bitcoin directly. Liquidity: High trading volume ensures you can typically buy or sell shares easily. Familiarity: ETFs are a well-understood investment product for traditional investors. Challenges: Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) that can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror Bitcoin’s price due to fees, operational costs, and tracking methods. Not Your Keys: You own shares in a fund that holds Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin itself. This goes against the core crypto principle of self-custody. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure is familiar, the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is highly volatile, meaning the ETF price can experience significant swings. Despite the challenges, the significant volume indicates that for many investors, particularly institutions, the benefits of accessibility and regulatory clarity offered by a BTC ETF outweigh the drawbacks. What Does This High Volume Suggest for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The consistent, and at times surging, volume in spot Bitcoin ETFs is perhaps the strongest signal yet of increasing institutional crypto adoption. Institutions require regulated, familiar, and liquid pathways to invest in new asset classes. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide exactly that. The willingness of large funds and wealth managers to allocate capital through these products suggests a shift in perspective. Bitcoin is moving from being seen purely as a speculative retail asset to a legitimate, albeit volatile, component of diversified portfolios. This trend is likely to continue as more data becomes available and confidence in the regulatory framework grows. Actionable Insights for Investors For individuals interested in crypto investment , the high volume in spot Bitcoin ETFs offers several insights: Monitor Volume: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF volumes as an indicator of overall market demand, especially from larger players. Understand the Gateway: Recognize that ETFs are a primary way traditional finance interacts with Bitcoin. Their activity can influence the spot market. Evaluate Your Options: If considering Bitcoin exposure, compare direct ownership vs. ETF investment based on your comfort with technology, security, and fees. Stay Informed: Follow news related to ETF flows, regulatory changes, and the performance of the major funds. The $4.5 billion+ day on May 23 wasn’t just a random event; it was a data point reinforcing the growing integration of Bitcoin into the mainstream financial system via regulated products like ETFs. Conclusion: The Expanding Footprint of Spot Bitcoin ETFs The significant Bitcoin ETF trading volume exceeding $4.5 billion on May 23 serves as a compelling indicator of the robust and growing interest in regulated Bitcoin exposure. This high volume reflects strong liquidity, increasing institutional crypto participation, and the successful integration of Spot Bitcoin ETF products into traditional investment frameworks. As more investors, both retail and institutional, utilize these vehicles for crypto investment , the BTC ETF market is poised to play an even more critical role in the overall health and development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The trend points towards continued maturation and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets. The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case. Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.

Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York. The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue. The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC. While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.

FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation.

In a new post on Truth Social, Trump says that he’s going to recommend a hefty tax on EU goods starting June 1st due to their unfair economic practices and unwillingness to negotiate. “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with. Their powerful trade barriers, VAT taxes, ridiculous corporate penalties, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans companies, and more, have led to a trade deficit with the US of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable. Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1st, 2025. There is no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Regarding Apple, Trump says that he’s imposing tariffs on the tech giant until the firm relocates its manufacturing base to the US. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” News of the new tariff recommendations caused US stock markets as well as Apple stocks to pull back. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw dips of 0.67% and 1%, respectively, and Apple shares fell 3%.

Understanding the collective mood of the market is crucial, and one popular tool for this is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . This index offers a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly optimistic (greed) or overly cautious (fear). Recently, we’ve seen a notable shift that every investor should pay attention to. What Does the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Tell Us? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, provided by Alternative.me, serves as a barometer for crypto market sentiment . It aggregates data from various sources to assign a score between 0 (Extreme Fear) and 100 (Extreme Greed). Think of it as a quick way to gauge the prevailing emotional state driving market decisions. A score closer to 0 suggests that investors are highly fearful, often indicating potential buying opportunities according to contrarian investment principles. Conversely, a score closer to 100 signals extreme greed, which can sometimes precede a market correction as assets may be overvalued. As of May 24th, the index registered 66, a decrease of 12 points from the previous day. This movement caused the index to transition from the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (typically above 75) into the ‘Greed’ zone (55-75). While still indicating positive sentiment, this drop signifies a cooling off from the recent peak. How is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a single factor but is a composite score derived from six key market indicators. Understanding these components helps demystify how the index arrives at its score and what forces are influencing crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): This measures the current crypto volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility in an upward trend can signal a greedy market, while high volatility during a downturn points to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component looks at the current volume and market momentum compared to average values. High buying volume in a positive market trend suggests a greedy market. Social Media (15%): Analyzes social media sentiment using algorithms that scan posts and hashtags related to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. High levels of positive or overly excited posts can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused by Alternative.me, historically this involved weekly polls asking users about their market perspective. (Note: The weight of this factor might be distributed among others when surveys are not active). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks the market capitalization share of Bitcoin compared to the total crypto market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be moving funds from altcoins back into the perceived relative safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance can signal increasing greed or confidence, as funds flow into riskier altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search data for cryptocurrency-related terms. A surge in search queries for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ often indicates fear, while terms like ‘buy Bitcoin’ can signal increasing public interest and potential greed. Each of these factors contributes to the final score, providing a multi-faceted view of the market’s emotional state. Understanding the Shift: From Extreme Greed to Greed The move from ‘Extreme Greed’ to ‘Greed’ isn’t necessarily a bearish signal, but rather a moderation of sentiment. The ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (75-100) is often seen as a potential warning sign for a pullback, as it suggests the market might be overheating. A score in the ‘Greed’ zone (55-75) still indicates positive sentiment and buying pressure, but without the same level of potential irrational exuberance seen in the higher range. This shift could be attributed to various factors, including minor price pullbacks, changing news cycles, or simply a natural ebb and flow of market psychology after a period of rapid gains. It’s a reminder that even in bullish phases, market sentiment is rarely static. How Does This Impact Your Investing Strategy? For many traders and investors, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it shouldn’t be the only one. It’s best used as a complementary indicator within a broader investing strategy . Some investors use the index as a contrarian signal: buying when the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (indicating potential undervaluation) and selling or taking profits when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (indicating potential overvaluation). The current shift to ‘Greed’ might lead some to become more cautious or consider adjusting their positions, while others might see it as a healthy consolidation phase before further upward movement. Consider how the index reading aligns with other technical indicators, fundamental analysis, and overall market conditions. For example, pairing the index with an analysis of crypto volatility or recent trends in Bitcoin dominance can provide a more complete picture. Challenges and Considerations While useful, the index has limitations. It’s based on publicly available data and algorithms, which may not capture all market nuances. Sentiment can change rapidly, and the index is a lagging indicator to some extent. Furthermore, relying solely on this index without considering other factors or having a well-defined investing strategy is risky. The index is primarily focused on Bitcoin sentiment, although it reflects the broader crypto market to a significant degree due to Bitcoin’s influence (reflected in the Bitcoin dominance factor). However, altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Conclusion: Navigating Market Sentiment The recent drop in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index from ‘Extreme Greed’ to ‘Greed’ signals a moderation in market enthusiasm. While still positive, this shift is a timely reminder for investors to stay vigilant and base their decisions on more than just emotion. By understanding the factors that influence the index – including crypto volatility , momentum, social sentiment, and Bitcoin dominance – and integrating this knowledge into a robust investing strategy , market participants can better navigate the complexities of the crypto landscape.

45032838,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=162812,1748070135,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45032838.jpeg,An Interview With Tranchess,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/an-interview-with-tranchess/,"BitcoinWorld An Interview With Tranchess In an exclusive interview with BitcoinWorld , we got the chance to speak with Danny Chong , Co-founder of Tranchess Danny, you’ve had a significant career in TradFi before co-founding Tranchess. How has this experience shaped your approach to building DeFi solutions, particularly in designing products that appeal to both traditional investors and crypto natives? As Co-founder of Tranchess, I have over 17 years of experience in investment banking at firms like Société Générale, BNP Paribas, and Crédit Agricole which have taught me the importance of structured risk management and clear investment options, principles that TradFi has refined over decades. My journey in decentralised finance began with an opportunity to run a “build-a-bank” project during my career in investment banking. Leading a team of IT professionals, I built emerging products that are client-facing and new to the traditional finance system. TradFi’s strength lies in its ability to segment risk and align products with diverse investor needs, but it often stifles innovation with bureaucracy. DeFi, by contrast, is liberating, open, and permissionless, yet it can overwhelm users with complexity and high-risk volatility. My experience shaped Tranchess to bridge these worlds by simplifying DeFi without sacrificing sophistication. Our products draw on TradFi’s risk tranching concepts used in structured finance to create varied risk-return profiles from a single asset and make DeFi accessible. The name “Tranchess” came from the words “tranche” and “chess”. “Tranche” is a TradFi term for varied risk solutions, whereas “Chess” is based on international chess, a game centred on strategy and optimisation. For traditional investors, we offer familiar structures with clear risk levels, like fixed-income-style yields, which resonate with their preference for stability. For crypto natives, we provide high-yield, leveraged options catering to their appetite for risk and innovation. By combining TradFi’s clarity with DeFi’s transparency and automation, we create a platform that empowers both groups to engage confidently, addressing the bottleneck of DeFi’s complexity. Tranchess recently highlighted its $CHESS Token Buyback Programme. Could you elaborate on the strategic thinking behind this initiative and how it compares, from your TradFi lens, to corporate equity buybacks in terms of signaling confidence and delivering value to token holders? The $CHESS Token Buyback Programme is market agnostic, reliant on Tranchess’ roadmap rather than on the ever-changing market dynamics. It is a strategic move to enhance value for our token holders and signal Tranchess’s confidence in our long-term growth. In DeFi, token economics are critical, and buybacks help manage circulating supply, potentially stabilising or increasing token value while rewarding our community. The programme uses a portion of revenue to repurchase $CHESS tokens from the open market, reducing supply and aligning with our commitment to sustainable ecosystem growth, signalling our confidence in $CHESS. In TradFi, buybacks signal financial health, indicating that companies believe their stock is undervalued and have excess capital to return to shareholders. Similarly, our $CHESS buyback demonstrates Tranchess’s robust revenue, showing we’re not just surviving but thriving in a volatile market. Unlike TradFi, where buybacks often benefit institutional shareholders, our programme directly supports our decentralised community, enhancing $CHESS’s utility in governance and rewards. The key difference is DeFi’s transparency, where every buyback transaction is on-chain and verifiable, unlike in TradFi. This initiative reflects my honed belief in disciplined capital allocation, adapted to DeFi’s open ethos to deliver tangible value to holders. Tranchess aims to offer more than basic yields through its structured products like QUEEN, BISHOP, and ROOK. Can you explain the core concept behind these offerings and how they cater to different risk appetites while aiming for sustainable, layered yields? Tranchess’s structured products, QUEEN, BISHOP, and ROOK, are designed to bring TradFi’s risk tranching to DeFi, offering tailored risk-return profiles from a single underlying asset, like BTC or ETH, to meet diverse investor needs. The core concept is to segment risk and reward, making DeFi accessible and appealing to varying risk appetites. QUEEN tracks the underlying asset’s price with staking rewards, ideal for crypto natives seeking market exposure with added yield. BISHOP offers fixed-income-style yields, appealing to risk-averse investors, including those from TradFi, who prioritise stability. ROOK provides leveraged exposure, catering to high-risk, high-reward seekers comfortable with volatility. These products are denominated in USDC for clarity, lowering entry barriers by making profit and loss intuitive. By leveraging DeFi’s automation, we enable users to switch between tranches seamlessly on one platform, ensuring simplicity, stability, and cost efficiency, unlike TradFi’s complex derivatives markets. Sustainability comes from diversified revenue streams, such as yield farming and validator services, which reduce reliance on volatile token emissions. This approach, inspired by TradFi’s structured finance but enhanced by blockchain’s transparency, ensures layered yields that balance risk and reward, attracting conservative investors and DeFi enthusiasts. You’ve spoken about RWA tokenization as a pivotal trend. How does Tranchess view the integration of RWAs into its yield-focused offerings, and what role do you see regulatory clarity playing in accelerating the adoption of tokenized real-world assets on platforms like the BNB Chain? RWA tokenisation is a game-changer. We see it as a natural extension of our yield-focused structured products. Tokenised stocks, bonds, or real estate, or RWAs, add real value to DeFi and support our objective of providing modular, risk-adjusted yields. We must explore how to integrate RWAs into our framework, potentially allowing users to stake tokenised assets or create tranches with RWA-backed yields, combining TradFi’s familiarity with DeFi’s efficiency. Regulatory clarity is critical to accelerate RWA adoption, especially on scalable platforms like BNB Chain, which is seeing a push by VanEck for a spot ETF which could pave the way for innovation. Clear frameworks, like those emerging in the UAE or Singapore, legitimise tokenised assets, assuaging institutional concerns about compliance and security. As evidenced by the RWA category’s explosive growth from $200 million to $2 billion in just six months, RWAs run the risk of becoming niche if they are not regulated. If they are, however, they could greatly accelerate DeFi’s TVL. Beyond structured products, Tranchess also offers liquid staking. Could you shed some light on your liquid staking solutions and how they provide users with both yield and liquidity, and the security measures Tranchess employs? Tranchess’ liquid staking solutions allow users to stake assets like Ethereum while maintaining liquidity through tokenised staking positions, which can be traded or used in DeFi protocols. This addresses a key pain point in traditional staking, where assets are locked, limiting flexibility. By staking through Tranchess, users earn validation rewards, which are often higher than TradFi savings rates. This benefit of yield and liquidity appeals to both crypto natives seeking DeFi composability and TradFi investors accustomed to liquid assets. Security is paramount, especially given DeFi’s history of breaches. Tranchess employs rigorous measures, including regular smart contract audits, multi-signature wallets for treasury management, and robust governance to prevent centralised failures. Our team prioritises network security, drawing on my TradFi experience where risk controls were non-negotiable. While staking carries risks, we mitigate them through diversified validator partnerships and transparent on-chain operations, ensuring user funds are protected and accessible. The $CHESS token is central to Tranchess’s governance and rewards system. Beyond the buyback, how does Tranchess ensure active community participation and align the protocol’s growth with the interests of $CHESS holders, especially through mechanisms like veCHESS? The $CHESS token is the backbone of Tranchess’s governance and rewards, empowering our users to shape the protocol’s future. Beyond the buyback programme, we foster active community participation through the veCHESS mechanism. veCHESS allows users to lock $CHESS for a set period to gain enhanced voting power and higher yield boosts on our products, incentivising long-term commitment. This aligns holder interests with protocol growth by rewarding those who contribute to governance and stability, drawing on my TradFi understanding of stakeholder alignment. We encourage participation via transparent governance proposals, where veCHESS holders vote on upgrades, fee structures, or new products, ensuring community input drives Tranchess’s evolution. Regular X spaces and talking to users on social media keep users engaged, while $CHESS staking rewards distribute protocol profits, reinforcing economic incentives. By balancing accessibility with incentives, we make governance inclusive yet rewarding for dedicated holders. This approach has helped sustain our community since our $1.5 million seed round in 2021, and it’s key to maintaining protocol health in DeFi’s competitive landscape. Given Tranchess’ success, such as reaching over $1 billion in TVL relatively quickly, where do you see the broader DeFi space evolving in the next couple of years, and what is Tranchess’s vision for continuing to innovate and lead in this evolving landscape? A deeper integration with real-world assets, more institutional adoption, and more transparent regulatory frameworks are probably going to be characteristics of DeFi’s next few years. We at Tranchess see this as a chance to further our objective of providing yield strategies that are adjusted for risk while preserving transparency and composability. As we have done from day one, we will continue to innovate at the intersection of structured products and liquid staking, developing tools that serve experienced DeFi users and new institutions alike. Finally, for our audience looking to explore DeFi or deepen their involvement, what key piece of advice would you offer, particularly when considering protocols that aim to bridge the best of TradFi and DeFi like Tranchess? Instead of focussing only on short-term yield attractiveness, start with protocols that prioritise long-term sustainability, cybersecurity, transparency, strong team setup, and sound risk frameworks. As DeFi matures, those who successfully strike a balance between innovation and resilience will rise to the top. Anyone bridging the gap between TradFi and DeFi, as we do at Tranchess, is embracing the agility and innovation that DeFi allows whilst introducing the discipline and standards of traditional finance into a decentralised, open-access setting.

Bitcoin, which had been trading above $111,000, dropped quickly to around $108,600, wiping out intraday gains and rattling broader market sentiment. BTC’s drop was mirrored across the crypto complex, with futures tracking ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) showing losses from $30 million to over $100 million. Bitcoin futures saw roughly $181 million in losses, while Ether futures accounted for nearly $142 million. Altcoins added another $100 million in liquidations, including notable wipeouts in SOL, DOGE, and XRP. pic The largest single liquidation was a $9.53 million BTC-USDT swap on OKX, CoinGlass data shows. A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the trader's inability to meet the margin requirements. Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying. A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment. The pullback arrived just as bitcoin was gaining momentum on ETF inflows and growing institutional interest, leading some to expect a calm weekend. Instead, volatility returned in full force.

In a new interview on Market Disruptors, Edward Dowd forecasts an incoming recession and market meltdown driven in part by a housing crisis and a bursting AI bubble. Dowd points to collapsing new home permits since 2022 and falling tenant rents as early signs of a housing crash. He also warns that government spending cuts and a slowdown in illegal immigration will sap economic growth, with stock markets facing a potential 50% drop based on historical patterns. “The idea here is you have a recession that we think manifests itself pretty soon, and the stock markets bottom sometime in the first quarter of 2026. Then you have a recovery, that’s the ideal situation… We’re not claiming anything’s going to go systemic. We’re not doom and gloom. It’s just we think it’s an old-fashioned deep recession and hopefully it’s quick. Typically speaking in recessions like in the dot-com recession and the great financial crisis, stocks went down 50% before they recovered, so we’re nowhere near down 50% yet and we think that’s coming.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from its all-time high of 45,073 in December of 2024 to a low of 38,314 last month, registering a 15% decline. Dowd traces the crisis to a global debt problem, temporarily masked by COVID-era money printing and spending, with commercial real estate and rising auto loan delinquencies signaling a broader credit crunch. In the long run, he expects deflationary pressures to force the Federal Reserve to slash rates and print money. For protection, Dowd advocates holding cash, pointing to Berkshire Hathaway’s massive position in T-bills/bonds, as well as physical gold, while cautioning against Bitcoin’s volatility and historic correlation with risk assets.

Elon Musk is bullish on Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/rNbzOP1QPJ — Arkham (@arkham) May 23, 2025 Tesla sold part of its BTC holdings in 2022 Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment in Q1 2021. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2021, the automotive company disclosed that it had invested around $1.5 billion to purchase 43,200 BTC and intended to incorporate Bitcoin into its payment system. Shortly after, the firm began accepting BTC payments for vehicle purchases before halting the option in May 2021. However, the suspension led to a more than 10% drop in Bitcoin’s value and Tesla’s stock price decline. Musk claimed they were obliged to halt BTC payments over concerns about the increasing reliance on fossil fuels, particularly coal, for Bitcoin mining and transactions. He argued that crypto investments have great potential; they shouldn’t come at the expense of the environment. However, skeptics suggested that the billionaire’s decision was just another attempt to influence the crypto market. In Q2 2022, the car manufacturing firm also sold about 75% of its Bitcoin holdings, valued at $936 million, remaining with only 9,720 BTC. Nonetheless, Musk clarified that their decision to sell their holdings had nothing to do with the asset’s market performance but rather the firm’s need for cash. Since then, Tesla has added more BTC to its portfolio, holding roughly 11,900 BTC worth $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, the crypto community began speculating that Musk’s X Money will incorporate Bitcoin after Tesla’s Q4 2024 net income increased to $600 million due to crypto. Metaplanet and Strategy are still growing their BTC holdings Multiple firms are also ramping up their Bitcoin holdings. For instance, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC, with its most recent purchas e on May 19, when it acquired 7,390 BTC for $764.9 million. Metaplanet is on pace to reach its target of holding 10,000 BTC, being only a little over 2,000 coins short. So far, the firm has 7,800 BTC. The firm’s stock, 3350.T, also soared 15% after the company recently purchased 1,004 BTC. Aside from corporations investing in BTC, there is growing interest in the US among certain states in integrating Bitcoin reserves, especially after Donald Trump took office. More than 25 states have proposed bills in favor of Bitcoin reserve legislation, with Texas and New Hampshire among the first to pass their bills. However, Arizona’s Governor, Katie Hobbs, recently rejected two crypto reserve bills after Florida dropped discussions on their bills. Nevertheless, there are still 13 active crypto bills at the federal level, which, if passed, could promote Bitcoin integration and establish a Bitcoin reserve. President Donald Trump named five cryptocurrencies for his proposed strategic reserve at the start of the month. His list included Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. His announcement did stir the crypto market, with Caradona surging by over 70%, Solana by 20%, and XRP by 30%. Bitcoin and Ethereum also saw a rise in market value, jumping by over 10%. Trump has consistently insisted that a digital asset reserve would elevate the country, reduce inflation, and build the crypto industry. In one of his Truth Social posts, he commented, “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World.

According to a compelling observation by Bradley Duke, Head of Europe at Bitwise Asset Management, publicly reported Bitcoin purchases by listed companies in 2025 have already reached an astonishing level, tripling the amount of New Bitcoin Supply generated through mining so far this year. Why is Corporate Bitcoin Demand Skyrocketing? This dramatic statistic, shared by the Bitwise executive on social media platform X, paints a clear picture: institutions and corporations are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. While the exact reasons vary, several key drivers are pushing companies towards the premier cryptocurrency: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unpredictable economic policies and potential currency devaluation, Bitcoin is seen by many corporations as a robust store of value, similar to digital gold. Balance Sheet Diversification: Holding a portion of corporate reserves in Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional fiat currencies and assets. Long-Term Value Proposition: Companies are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term appreciating asset, driven by its fixed supply and growing network effects. Investor and Shareholder Interest: Some companies may also be responding to growing interest from investors who see Bitcoin exposure as a positive sign. It’s crucial to note the caveat mentioned by Duke: this figure strictly accounts for disclosed acquisitions by publicly traded firms. Purchases made by privately held corporations, sovereign wealth funds, or other large private entities are not included in this calculation, suggesting the actual total Corporate Bitcoin Demand could be considerably higher. The Scarcity Factor: Demand vs. New Bitcoin Supply The significance of corporate buys tripling the New Bitcoin Supply cannot be overstated. Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition is rooted in its scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely, the creation of new Bitcoin is governed by a predetermined, algorithmic schedule known as BTC Mining . Approximately every ten minutes, a new block of transactions is added to the blockchain, and miners who successfully add a block are rewarded with newly minted BTC. However, the rate at which new Bitcoin is created is halved roughly every four years in an event called the ‘Halving’. The most recent Halving occurred in April 2024, significantly reducing the daily issuance of new BTC. This means the available New Bitcoin Supply entering the market each day is now considerably lower than in previous cycles. When you combine this reduced supply from BTC Mining with surging demand, particularly from large-scale corporate buyers, you create a powerful supply shock dynamic. These large purchases absorb the limited new supply entering the market, potentially putting upward pressure on the price, assuming other market factors remain constant or are also positive. Understanding Bitcoin Institutional Adoption The statistic shared by the Bitwise executive is a clear indicator of deepening Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . While early Bitcoin cycles were primarily driven by retail investors and enthusiasts, recent years have seen a marked increase in interest and investment from major financial institutions, asset managers, and corporations. Key catalysts for this surge in Bitcoin Institutional Adoption include: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, have provided a regulated, accessible, and familiar investment vehicle for institutions and corporations. These ETFs allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of direct ownership, custody, or security. Improved Custody Solutions: The development of robust and secure institutional-grade custody solutions has alleviated concerns about storing and protecting large amounts of Bitcoin. Increased Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies is becoming clearer in many parts of the world, providing institutions with more confidence to enter the market. Peer Effect: As more high-profile companies and institutions disclose their Bitcoin holdings or involvement, others may feel compelled to explore similar strategies to remain competitive or appealing to investors. Companies like MicroStrategy have been pioneers in adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, a strategy that has proven highly successful and has likely inspired others. The trend highlighted by Bitwise suggests this is not an isolated phenomenon but a growing corporate movement. The Role of BTC Mining in the Supply Equation While Corporate Bitcoin Demand represents the significant inflow side of the equation, BTC Mining represents the supply side. Miners perform the crucial function of validating transactions and securing the network, and their reward (the block subsidy plus transaction fees) is their incentive. The Halving mechanism ensures that the issuance rate of new Bitcoin decreases over time, making it an increasingly scarce asset. The fact that disclosed corporate purchases alone are three times the amount of BTC mined in 2025 illustrates the immense buying pressure relative to the natural supply creation rate. This dynamic fundamentally shifts the supply/demand balance compared to earlier periods when mining output represented a larger portion of available sell-side pressure. Insights from Bitwise and Future Outlook Bradley Duke’s observation from Bitwise serves as a crucial data point underscoring the evolving market structure for Bitcoin. It suggests that institutional and corporate treasuries are becoming significant accumulators of BTC, potentially absorbing much of the new supply as well as liquidity from the open market. What does this mean for the future? Continued strong Corporate Bitcoin Demand , coupled with the constrained New Bitcoin Supply from BTC Mining post-Halving, could act as a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin’s price in the long term. It signals a maturation of the asset class and its increasing acceptance within traditional financial frameworks through Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges, such as market volatility, macroeconomic shifts, and unforeseen regulatory actions that could impact corporate strategies. Nevertheless, the trend highlighted by Bitwise is a bullish signal for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system. Conclusion: A New Era of Bitcoin Accumulation The statistic shared by the Bitwise executive is a powerful testament to the current state of the Bitcoin market. Corporate Bitcoin Demand in 2025 is significantly outpacing the rate at which new coins are being mined, highlighting robust Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . This dynamic of high demand meeting limited New Bitcoin Supply from BTC Mining creates a compelling environment for Bitcoin’s future price discovery. As more corporations and institutions follow this trend, the foundational support for Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class continues to strengthen, marking a new era of institutional accumulation.

The potential for more sophisticated crypto trading just took a significant step forward. Nasdaq PHLX, a well-known options trading platform, has reportedly filed a proposed rule change with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding Bitcoin options . This move, if approved, could open up new avenues for investors and traders looking to engage with Bitcoin in different ways. What Does This Nasdaq PHLX SEC Filing Mean? The core of the news is the SEC filing by Nasdaq PHLX . This isn’t just a casual inquiry; it’s a formal proposal submitted to the regulatory body that oversees securities markets in the United States. The filing seeks permission to list and trade options contracts based on a Bitcoin index. While the specific index wasn’t detailed in the initial report, the implication is clear: Nasdaq wants to bring regulated, exchange-traded options tied to Bitcoin’s price movements to its platform. Think of it this way: Nasdaq PHLX: A major, regulated options exchange. SEC Filing: A formal request to regulators for approval. Bitcoin Index Options: Derivatives contracts allowing traders to speculate on or hedge against the future price of Bitcoin, based on an underlying index value, without directly owning the Bitcoin itself. This development underscores the growing interest from established financial institutions in providing regulated access points to the cryptocurrency market. It’s a sign that major players see demand and potential in offering sophisticated products like Bitcoin options . Why Are Bitcoin Index Options Important for Crypto Trading? The introduction of regulated Bitcoin options on a platform like Nasdaq PHLX could be a game-changer for several reasons, primarily enhancing crypto trading strategies and market maturity. Potential Benefits Include: Hedging Opportunities: Investors holding Bitcoin could use options to protect against potential price declines. For example, buying put options could provide a form of insurance. Speculation: Traders can speculate on Bitcoin’s price direction with potentially less capital outlay compared to buying Bitcoin outright. Options offer leverage, meaning a small price movement in the underlying asset can result in a larger percentage gain (or loss) on the option contract. Income Generation: Sophisticated strategies like selling covered calls could allow Bitcoin holders to generate income from their existing positions. Price Discovery: Increased trading activity in a regulated environment can contribute to more efficient price discovery for Bitcoin. Accessibility: Trading on a platform like Nasdaq PHLX might be more accessible or familiar to traditional finance participants compared to native crypto derivatives exchanges. These tools offer flexibility that simply buying and holding Bitcoin does not. They allow for more nuanced strategies tailored to different market outlooks and risk tolerances. Does This Filing Signal Increased Institutional Adoption? Absolutely. An SEC filing from a major exchange operator like Nasdaq PHLX is a strong indicator of increasing institutional adoption interest. Large financial institutions, asset managers, and hedge funds often prefer to trade on regulated exchanges using familiar financial instruments like options. This provides them with: Regulatory Clarity: Trading on a regulated platform offers more legal and compliance certainty. Established Infrastructure: They can leverage existing trading systems and relationships with brokers and clearers. Risk Management Tools: Regulated options come with established clearing processes, reducing counterparty risk compared to some unregulated venues. Meeting Client Demand: As client interest in crypto grows, institutions need regulated ways to offer exposure. The move by Nasdaq PHLX suggests they see sufficient institutional demand to warrant the effort and cost of pursuing regulatory approval for Bitcoin options . This isn’t just about retail traders; it’s a significant step towards integrating Bitcoin into the broader financial ecosystem for large-scale participants. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the SEC Filing? While the filing is a positive step, approval from the SEC is not guaranteed. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving, and the SEC has historically taken a cautious approach, particularly with products directly tied to cryptocurrencies. Potential Hurdles Include: Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators often worry about the potential for manipulation in the underlying spot Bitcoin market, which could impact the options market. Investor Protection: Ensuring that retail investors understand the risks associated with options trading, especially on a volatile asset like Bitcoin. Regulatory Framework: Determining how Bitcoin index options fit within existing securities regulations. Index Methodology: The SEC will likely scrutinize the methodology of the underlying Bitcoin index to ensure it is robust and resistant to manipulation. The approval process can be lengthy and involve public comment periods. It’s not uncommon for such filings to face questions or requests for more information from the SEC staff. The outcome will heavily depend on the SEC’s current stance on crypto-related financial products and whether Nasdaq PHLX can adequately address their concerns regarding market surveillance, liquidity, and investor protection. How Do Bitcoin Index Options Compare to Other Crypto Products? It’s helpful to understand how potential Bitcoin options on Nasdaq PHLX might fit into the existing landscape of crypto trading products. Here’s a quick comparison: Product Description Key Difference from Index Options Spot Bitcoin Direct ownership of Bitcoin. Requires full capital outlay, no leverage (unless margin trading), limited to price appreciation/depreciation. Options offer leverage and complex strategies. Bitcoin Futures Agreement to buy/sell Bitcoin at a future date/price. Obligation to buy/sell (for physical settlement) or cash settlement based on price difference. Options give the right , but not the obligation, to buy/sell. Options offer more flexible strategies (e.g., spreads, combinations). Bitcoin ETFs (Spot) Fund holding actual Bitcoin, traded on stock exchanges. Provides indirect exposure to spot price via shares. Options are derivatives offering leverage and hedging capabilities beyond simple price exposure. Bitcoin ETFs (Futures) Fund holding Bitcoin futures contracts. Provides exposure via futures, subject to roll costs. Options offer different risk/reward profiles and strategy flexibility. Index options, specifically, are cash-settled and based on the value of an index rather than the physical delivery of Bitcoin. This is typical for index options in traditional markets and simplifies the settlement process for large institutions. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors While this is still a proposal, the possibility of regulated Bitcoin options on Nasdaq PHLX offers potential insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the SEC’s response to the filing. Regulatory approval timelines can be unpredictable. Educate Yourself on Options: If you’re new to options trading, now is a good time to learn the basics – calls, puts, strike prices, expiration dates, and key strategies. Options involve significant risk and are not suitable for all investors. Understand the Index: If approved, familiarize yourself with the specific Bitcoin index the options will track. How is it calculated? What exchanges does it source data from? Assess Your Strategy: Consider how regulated options might fit into your existing crypto trading or investment strategy, whether for hedging, speculation, or income. Institutional Watch: The progress of this filing is a key indicator for the pace of institutional adoption in the crypto space. This development highlights the ongoing maturation of the crypto market and its increasing intersection with traditional finance. It reflects growing demand for diverse and regulated financial products tied to digital assets. Summary: A Milestone Filing for Bitcoin Options The filing by Nasdaq PHLX with the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin options is a significant development. It signals strong interest from a major exchange in expanding regulated crypto trading offerings. While regulatory approval is far from certain and potential challenges exist, this move represents another step towards greater institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset class. It could potentially provide traders and investors with powerful new tools for hedging, speculation, and income generation within a familiar, regulated framework. The market will be watching closely to see how the SEC responds to this important proposal.

Strategy will own $70T of Bitcoin by 2025, says Myers Myers further forecasted that Michael Saylor’s Strategy will own $70 trillion worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) by 2045, “making it by far the most valuable company in the history of the world.” At the time of publication, Strategy holds 576,320 Bitcoin, worth approximately $62.24 billion, according to Saylor Tracker. Source: Jesse Myers Myers said, “To set the stage, there is $1,000T of asset value in the world.” He added that Bitcoin represents just 0.2% of that total amount. He explained that, since half of all capital in the world is essentially seeking the best store of value, more capital will “osmotically flow” into Bitcoin over time. “Over the last 2 years, an exodus from fiat assets (bonds and money) has already begun. Hard money assets (Bitcoin and gold) are where things are shifting,” he said. Source: Jesse Myers Myers said that there is around $318 trillion of capital in bonds “looking for greener pastures.” He said most of this capital is tied up in fixed-income institutional vehicles with “strict mandates.” “That’s where Bitcoin Treasury Companies come in,” Myers said. “Treasury Cos will be the primary bidders for BTC over the coming decades, deploying an ocean of SoV capital to BTC.” Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high, and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yet While Strategy has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, other treasury companies are starting to emerge. On April 24, Twenty One Capital formed, which is a Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm is looking to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” According to Bitbo data, publicly traded and private companies, ETFs, and nation-states collectively hold 3.23 million BTC, valued at approximately $348.25 billion.

The Treasury Department made the move official on Friday, labeling it “immediate sanctions relief.” These were sanctions originally enforced during the Assad dictatorship, which collapsed last December when rebel forces seized Damascus and forced Bashar al-Assad to flee to Moscow, ending nearly 14 years of civil war. According to the announcement , Trump’s administration is attempting to open up Syria’s economy for investment while keeping several core restrictions in place. Although the president has the authority to cancel executive orders, many parts of the sanctions, especially the 2019 Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, still require Congressional approval to be removed. That Act punishes any attempt to conduct business with the Syrian government, unless it’s strictly for humanitarian purposes. Trump team pushes for waiver, Rubio outlines 180-day plan Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the administration is applying for a 180-day waiver to buy time while working with lawmakers to repeal the broader legislation. The move is being framed as part of a larger strategy to bring back economic activity without immediately clearing the country’s name. Trump’s decision followed a high-level meeting with Sharaa, who came to power after leading a successful offensive against Assad. Sharaa was previously a commander of an Islamist-run zone in northwest Syria, and many of his key allies, including Shaibani, are former militants linked to Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups. The United Nations Security Council has already flagged members of the new Syrian administration in connection with war crimes during the civil war. The concern is less about strategy and more about who exactly is running the new Syrian government. While Assad is gone, Sharaa and his circle aren’t widely trusted across Capitol Hill. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said on Wednesday that although major steps still need to be taken by the Syrian administration , “Syria won’t be alone — the kingdom and the rest of our international partners will be at the forefront of those supporting this effort and economic rebirth.” Qatar to inject $30 million per month, investors line up cautiously One major development is that Qatar, with US support, is preparing to deliver $30 million every month to fund the salaries of Syrian civil servants. This was confirmed by four individuals familiar with the deal, including two involved in finalizing it. It’s not enough to fully rebuild, but it gives the new administration something to work with as it faces more than $400 billion in economic damage, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. During a televised speech on Wednesday, Sharaa said, “We welcome all investors: children of the nation inside and outside, our Arab and Turkish brothers and friends from around the world.” His allies inside and outside the region — especially Saudi Arabia — believe the easing of sanctions helps sideline extremists inside the government and reduces outside influence from Iran, which had been Assad’s strongest ally. This also blocks any immediate economic expansion by China, giving US-friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates early access to whatever business environment forms in the country. Still, risks remain. Syria is technically still at war with Israel, and US sanctions date back to 1979, when President Jimmy Carter listed it as a state sponsor of terrorism. A short thaw happened in the 1990s, when Damascus joined the US-led Gulf War coalition and entered peace talks with Israel, but that didn’t last. Assad’s deeper ties with Iran and his support for insurgents in post-invasion Iraq triggered more restrictions from Washington. Things got worse after 2011, when Assad’s forces cracked down violently on protests, leading to a conflict that left nearly 500,000 people dead and millions displaced. Within Trump’s own administration, some have been strongly against any effort to cooperate with Sharaa. People like Sebastian Gorka viewed him as a radical who simply traded military gear for suits. The State Department has demanded that Sharaa’s team show clear improvements on “a number of critical issues” before permanent sanctions relief is considered.

But concerns such as its low use case utility and increasing circulation could hamper its progress in hitting the highly coveted $1 mark. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is going strong in the DeFi sector with its innovative hybrid lending protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are available for $0.03 per token during phase 5 of its presale. The project has raised over $9.1 million and gained over 11,000 holders within a few days. It could be your best chance at life-changing profits. Phase 6 prices are 16.67% more at $0.035 and investors who invest at this phase have a 100% ROI when it lists on $0.06. As enticing as Dogecoin’s community backing is, Mutuum Finance’s solid DeFi use case and history of exponential growth project that it has the potential to bring greater returns in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors flock to Mutuum Finance due to its revolutionary decentralized finance model for crypto loans while decentralization funds its innovative financial services. The project maintains a rising momentum since it has raised over $9.1 million in investments and now attracts more than 11,000 investors. The Phase 5 token price at $0.03 presents investors with a limited opportunity as an upcoming 16.67% price boost charts the completion of early investment entry. Investors in this phase who join during the presale period could earn 100% ROI since the token has defined a listing price at $0.06. As the decentralized market grows, Mutuum Finance is leading the charge with its groundbreaking lending model and solid market positioning. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance offers a modern lending platform that joins Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models for better access to assets as well as transparency and user empowerment. Through the Peer-to-Contract model users can add stablecoins to smart contract pools to earn passive income as they instantly allow borrowing access to platform users. Smart contracts manage automatic interest rate adjustments that provide enhanced earnings for lenders at reduced borrowing expenses. When people utilize the P2P model they create immediate lending relationships free of intermediaries that fulfill decentralization goals and let users exercise complete negotiation capabilities. Borrowers together with lenders operate in a system which offers complete transparency and efficiency to form custom agreements for loan transactions creating enhanced user-centric borrowing situations. Transforming Crypto Lending The Mutuum Finance stablecoin will soon launch on Ethereum chain pegged to the USD. Secure financial transactions will rely on this stablecoin system because it uses a resistant structure which prevents algorithmic stability problems. The combination of next-generation financial lending approaches with robust infrastructure elements enables Mutuum Finance to create the path for decentralized finance development. While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to thrive on community hype and viral momentum, its lack of real-world utility may limit long-term upside. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building tangible value through an innovative dual-lending DeFi model, audited smart contracts, and a USD-pegged stablecoin—all while still in presale. With a 100% ROI already locked in for early investors and a roadmap aimed at reshaping decentralized lending, MUTM may deliver the kind of sustainable growth and explosive returns that meme coins simply can’t match. For investors seeking more than speculation, Mutuum Finance could be the smarter move in 2025.

While XRP’s technicals remain bullish and regulatory tailwinds persist, the most compelling action is unfolding elsewhere—particularly in early-stage projects where outsized returns are still within reach. Against this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout contender for 2025, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional capital with its explosive presale momentum. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Powerhouse with 12,000%+ Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly distinguishing itself as the must-watch presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—is fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x from current entry levels, with some models suggesting up to 12,000%–18,500% upside if momentum holds. A recent $132,000+ whale buy highlights the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential, and with a $0.007 listing target and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the standard for early-stage momentum and investor confidence. XRP: Steady Performance, Bullish Catalysts XRP’s current price action, trading between $2.37 and $2.45, signals a period of consolidation after a strong rally earlier in the year. Analysts remain optimistic, with short-term forecasts pointing to a potential breakout above $2.56, which could trigger a move toward $3.00–$3.40 in the coming weeks. However, with XRP’s volatility moderating and whale accumulation slowing, many traders are diversifying into higher-multiple opportunities—chief among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is setting the pace for early-stage growth. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Market Anchors with Rotating Capital Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors and ETFs. Analysts forecast a near-term range of $110,000–$115,000, with bullish scenarios projecting even higher levels if macro momentum persists. Ethereum, meanwhile, is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators suggesting a potential breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. While both assets remain core holdings for stability and long-term growth, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for those seeking transformative gains. Aptos: Quiet Strength, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Aptos (APT) is quietly building momentum, trading in a tight range between $4.41 and $4.66 in May 2025. While its fundamentals remain solid and long-term forecasts are positive, APT’s near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s presale structure and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 40x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion: The Next Wave of Crypto Growth As XRP holds steady at $2.37 and the broader market consolidates, the real excitement is unfolding in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Bitcoin and Ethereum providing a stable foundation and Aptos offering quiet growth, MAGA stands out as the breakout contender for 2025. Each presale stage is filling rapidly, and as visibility grows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is poised to ignite the next wave of price discovery—making it the name on every smart investor’s radar as the crypto rotation accelerates.

Exciting times in the digital asset space! The Bitcoin price has just achieved a significant milestone, pushing past the $108,000 mark. This latest move is capturing the attention of investors and analysts worldwide, signaling strong momentum in the market. According to real-time monitoring data, the BTC price is currently trading around $108,009.99 on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market, confirming the breakout above this key psychological and technical level. What’s Fueling This Latest Bitcoin Rally? When Bitcoin price makes such a decisive move, it’s rarely due to a single factor. A combination of elements typically contributes to a significant Bitcoin rally . Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone navigating the crypto market . Several potential catalysts are being discussed: Increased Institutional Interest: We continue to see growing adoption and investment from large financial institutions. Their entry often brings significant capital and lends credibility to the asset class, positively impacting the Bitcoin price . Positive Macroeconomic Signals: Shifting global economic conditions, inflation concerns, or changes in monetary policy can sometimes drive investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge. Technical Breakouts: Surpassing key resistance levels, like the recent $108,000 mark, can trigger automated trading systems and attract momentum traders, further propelling the price upwards. Supply Dynamics: Events like the recent Bitcoin halving reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, tightening supply over time if demand remains constant or increases. This fundamental scarcity is often cited as a long-term bullish factor for the BTC price . Improving Market Sentiment: Positive news cycles, favorable regulatory developments, or successful technological upgrades within the Bitcoin network can boost investor confidence and contribute to a positive Bitcoin rally . Analyzing the Current BTC Price Action: What Does $108,000 Mean? Breaking above $108,000 isn’t just a random number; it holds significance from a technical and psychological perspective. For traders and analysts, hitting or surpassing such a level can confirm upward trends and potentially set new targets. Let’s look at some aspects of this price movement: Historical Context: While $108,000 is a new high, understanding previous price cycles provides perspective. Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by periods of rapid growth followed by corrections. Each new peak builds on the foundation of prior cycles. Key Levels: Technical analysts watch specific price points. $108,000 likely acted as a short-term resistance level. Breaking it suggests the bulls are in control and could target higher levels next. Support would now likely be found at previous resistance levels. Volume Analysis: Often, a strong price move is accompanied by healthy trading volume. Increased volume during the breakout suggests strong conviction behind the move, rather than just a low-volume anomaly. Checking volume indicators provides further insight into the strength of the Bitcoin rally . Navigating the Crypto Market: Opportunities and Challenges A surging Bitcoin price naturally brings opportunities for those holding the asset. However, the crypto market is known for its volatility, and this rally is no exception. It’s important to consider both sides. Opportunities: Potential for Gains: For existing holders, a price increase translates directly into unrealized or realized profits. Increased Attention: Rallies attract new participants and capital to the market, potentially creating further upward pressure. Ecosystem Growth: A healthy BTC price often fuels development and innovation within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Sharp price increases can be followed by sudden pullbacks. The higher the price goes, the potentially larger the dollar value of price swings. Risk of FOMO: Fear Of Missing Out can lead to impulsive decisions, like buying at the peak without proper research. Market Corrections: Rallies are rarely linear. Expect pullbacks and corrections along the way. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? Actionable Insights In light of the recent Bitcoin rally and the BTC price reaching new highs, what steps should investors consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand why the price is moving. Look beyond the headlines at the underlying factors. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: The crypto market is high-risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Have a Plan: Whether you are buying, holding, or selling, have a strategy based on your financial goals and risk profile. Avoid making decisions based purely on emotion triggered by price movements. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying across different asset classes, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies. Stay Informed: Keep up with reliable Bitcoin news and market analysis. Understanding the landscape helps you make better decisions. What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin News and the Market? Predicting future price movements in the crypto market is challenging, but the current momentum is undeniable. The breakout above $108,000 is a significant technical event. The focus will now likely shift to whether Bitcoin can consolidate above this level and target the next potential resistance zones. Factors to watch include: Continued institutional flows. Global regulatory developments. Technological advancements in the Bitcoin network. Overall macroeconomic environment. Sentiment shifts in the broader market. Reliable Bitcoin news sources will be key to staying updated on these developments. Conclusion: A Powerful Move in the Bitcoin Price The surge in Bitcoin price past the $108,000 threshold marks a significant moment in the current market cycle. Fueled by a confluence of factors including potential institutional adoption, favorable technical conditions, and supply dynamics, this Bitcoin rally demonstrates the continued strength and volatility inherent in the crypto market . While the excitement is palpable, investors are reminded to approach the market with caution, conduct thorough research, and manage risk effectively. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be dynamic, and reaching this new price point is a testament to its evolving position in the global financial landscape.

Ethereum Net Flows Bounce Around Net flows refer to the difference in the number of coins entering or leaving crypto exchanges over a given period of time. If net flows are positive, then it means more ETH are flowing into crypto exchanges, which could point to sell-offs are investors take advantage of the price increase. However, if net flows are negative, then it suggests that more coins are leaving exchanges than those going in. Thus, it could point to buying pressure being higher than sell-offs. Related Reading: Analyst Says This Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Contender Could See ‘Impulsive Move’ Currently, Coinglass data shows that Ethereum net flows have been skewing toward negative for a while now. 24-hour net flow volumes show a -$182.86 million figure as more coins moved out of crypto exchanges during this time. This has also persisted with six out of the last seven days showing that net flows are negative. This means that there have been more ETH leaving crypto exchanges than those going into exchanges for selling. Thus, showing that buying remains the order of the day. In this 7-day period, net flows for Ethereum are sitting at -$140 million. However, going further back, on the 15-day timeframe, investors are still skewing more toward selling. This time period shows a positive $186.48 million in net flows as well, which would explain why the Ethereum price seems suppressed despite Bitcoin making new all-time highs.. The 30-day period is no different, showing even larger deposit trends. In total, Ethereum investors have moved more ETH into crypto exchanges, causing net flows to fall to rise to $483.54 million during this time. What Could Happen To Price If Net Flows Remain Negative If the Ethereum net flows continue to remain negative and even grow from here, then it would signal a rise in buying pressure. Once the buyers are able to outbid sellers, then the Ethereum price could begin to rally again.

This initial step, marked by the purchase of 21 BTC, positions DDC Enterprise among a growing list of companies exploring the integration of cryptocurrencies into their treasury strategies. What Does DDC Enterprise’s Initial BTC Purchase Signify? According to a recent Business Wire press release, DDC Enterprise completed its first BTC purchase as part of a larger, phased plan. While 21 BTC might seem like a modest start compared to some corporate giants, it represents a concrete commitment to their previously announced digital asset strategy. The firm isn’t stopping there; they intend to execute two more transactions in the immediate future to reach an initial target of 100 BTC. This initial phase is just the tip of the iceberg for DDC Enterprise’s vision. Earlier this month, the company laid out a much grander plan: accumulating up to 5,000 BTC over a 36-month horizon. They’ve set an aggressive near-term goal of acquiring 500 BTC within the first six months alone. This structured approach suggests a deliberate strategy, likely aimed at mitigating volatility risk through dollar-cost averaging or tactical buys based on market conditions. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: A Trend Gaining Momentum? DDC Enterprise’s decision is part of a broader, albeit still nascent, trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) have famously added significant amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Their motivations vary but often include: Treasury Reserve Asset: Treating Bitcoin as a store of value to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, offering a potential alternative to traditional cash holdings or low-yield bonds. Investment Potential: Speculating on Bitcoin’s price appreciation as a way to potentially boost company value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to their financial holdings. Strategic Alignment: Signalling innovation and embracing future financial technologies, potentially appealing to tech-savvy investors and customers. While DDC Enterprise operates in e-commerce, its move highlights that the interest in Bitcoin as a corporate asset isn’t limited to the tech or financial sectors. Their dual presence in China and the U.S. adds an interesting layer, given the differing regulatory landscapes surrounding cryptocurrencies in these regions. Decoding DDC Enterprise’s Ambitious Bitcoin Accumulation Plan The scale of DDC Enterprise’s proposed Bitcoin accumulation – up to 5,000 BTC – is significant for a company of its presumed size, especially compared to smaller public companies that have made similar moves. The phased approach (21 initial, 100 short-term, 500 within 6 months, 5,000 over 3 years) allows flexibility. It suggests they are managing risk and adapting to market price fluctuations rather than making one massive lump-sum purchase. This strategy could involve buying on dips, setting specific price targets, or allocating a fixed amount of capital at regular intervals. The transparency in announcing these targets also provides insight into their long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Is This Institutional Bitcoin Investment a Sign of Things to Come? The term Institutional Bitcoin often brings to mind large asset managers, hedge funds, or major corporations like MicroStrategy. However, DDC Enterprise’s entry suggests that this trend might be filtering down to a wider range of public companies, including those outside the traditional finance or tech spheres. This could be a leading indicator of increasing mainstream corporate interest. For the cryptocurrency market, more corporate buyers, regardless of size, contribute to demand and potentially reduce the circulating supply available on exchanges, which could have long-term price implications. It also adds legitimacy and visibility to Bitcoin as a viable asset class for treasury management. Potential Benefits for DDC Enterprise Asset Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s price increases, the value of DDC’s holdings could significantly boost their balance sheet. Inflation Hedge: Protect the purchasing power of their treasury against potential fiat currency inflation. Market Attention: The move could attract investors interested in companies with exposure to digital assets. Future Flexibility: Potentially leverage BTC for future strategic initiatives or even customer payment options down the line. Potential Challenges and Risks Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which could negatively impact DDC’s reported earnings and balance sheet value in the short term. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, particularly complex for a company operating in both China and the U.S. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require companies to report Bitcoin as an intangible asset, potentially leading to impairment losses if the price drops below the purchase cost. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Actionable Insights For investors, DDC Enterprise’s move serves as another data point indicating growing corporate interest in Bitcoin. It underscores the potential for continued demand from non-traditional sources. While this specific purchase is small, the stated long-term goal is ambitious and worth monitoring. For other companies, DDC’s strategy provides an example of how a phased approach can be used to enter the crypto space, potentially mitigating some of the risks associated with volatility. It prompts questions about the role of digital assets in modern corporate treasury management. Conclusion DDC Enterprise’s initial BTC purchase marks a significant step in its stated plan for substantial Bitcoin accumulation . As an e-commerce firm with international operations, their entry into the space highlights the expanding scope of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . While challenges remain, the strategic rationale behind such Institutional Bitcoin investments appears to be gaining traction beyond the usual suspects. The coming months will reveal how DDC’s phased approach unfolds and whether they meet their ambitious 500 BTC short-term target, providing further insight into the evolving relationship between traditional businesses and digital assets.

Among these developments, key management providers such as BitGo and Metaco—both acquired by Ripple —are recognized for offering specialized custodial services. These entities support the safekeeping of tokenized assets and assist financial institutions in meeting regulatory compliance requirements. The report positions these providers as essential contributors to the secure handling of digital assets and the broader enablement of tokenized financial ecosystems. Institutional Validation Through Tokenized Private Equity In a section focused on private equity, the report details an example of real-world application: Aurum Equity Partners’ launch of the world’s first combined private equity and debt tokenized fund, reportedly valued at $1 billion. This fund is hosted on the XRP Ledger and described in the report as an open-source and decentralized Layer-1 network.

Speaking on his show Mad Money , Jim pointed out that Trump’s trade orders are damaging both Nvidia and Apple, and he warned that investors are underestimating just how much the White House is involved in corporate decision-making. Jim told viewers, “We have to make our peace with it and, yes, add it to the risk factors of owning stocks here. It puts a premium on companies that Trump and his people play no role in.” He said fewer and fewer companies are being left alone. “The list of companies that are exempt from presidential meddling grows shorter by the day.” Trump hits Nvidia with China chip crackdown The White House recently restricted artificial intelligence chip exports to China, citing national security concerns. That decision wiped out a major piece of Nvidia’s business, cutting its China market share from 95% to 50%, according to the company’s CEO Jensen Huang. He called the move a “failure” and said it’s damaging US interests more than Chinese ones. Huang added that the rules are pushing China to make its own chips faster, which could end up backfiring on US companies in the long run. Jim supported that warning and said it would actually be safer to let China buy from Nvidia instead of helping it become independent in advanced chip production. The damage isn’t just theoretical. Nvidia’s future growth in China has already taken a direct hit. These AI chips are not just side products — they’re core to Nvidia’s long-term plans. Trump’s orders are now directly reshaping what US tech can and can’t sell, and to who. Apple targeted after India move fails to dodge tariffs Apple, meanwhile, tried to get ahead of the game. The company began moving production from China to India to avoid getting caught in the middle of the US-China trade battle. That strategy didn’t work. Trump announced on Friday that iPhones made outside the US will face 25% tariffs anyway. Jim criticized that move, saying it could make iPhones too expensive for regular American buyers. He also reminded the public that Apple has already done a lot to create jobs in the US, but that didn’t stop the penalties. “American-made iPhones will be too expensive for consumers,” Jim said bluntly. He made it clear that no amount of cooperation with the administration guarantees safety anymore. Trump is making the rules, rewriting them, and enforcing them how he wants. Companies trying to adapt are still getting punished. Jim said there’s precedent for the government stepping into business, like when Harry Truman took control of railroads in 1964 to avoid an economic crash, or when John F. Kennedy pressured steel companies in 1962 to cut price hikes. But in both of those cases, the government had clear national interests. “The president is simply telling companies what to do and where to go, and going after them hard if they don’t,” Jim said. He added, “No matter what, the president’s functioning as the chairman of the board, overruling company execs about business decisions. He’s not accepting their rationales. He wants it his way. In that sense, he’s inching step by step toward running what I call a command economy.” Trump’s tweets still shake markets ahead of earnings Jim also gave a heads-up about the week ahead on Wall Street. He said companies like Nvidia, Costco, Dell, and Salesforce are all dropping quarterly reports. Normally, that would be enough to drive market action. But this week, Jim said, that might not be the case. “We’re headed into a fickle week,” he said , warning that Trump’s tweets could overshadow everything. He said to expect fresh posts about “our trading partners, their intransigence, their negligence, their perfidiousness.” Basically, the president’s social media could have more impact than actual earnings data. Jim added that on Friday, markets ignored some negative Trump tweets because the ten-year Treasury yield held steady. That gave investors a reason to focus on other things. But he doesn’t think that will last long. “I hope that can continue next week,” he said, “but I’ll tell you something, I wouldn’t count on it.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Apple|Nvidia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-24 07:45:23

Ever wonder what’s driving the recent positive sentiment in the market? A significant factor is the performance of US spot Bitcoin ETF products. These investment vehicles have been making waves, and the latest data shows a promising trend that’s catching everyone’s attention. What’s Happening with Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows? On May 23rd, US spot Bitcoin ETF s collectively recorded a net inflow of $212.02 million. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the eighth consecutive day of positive net flows into these funds. This consistent buying pressure indicates growing investor confidence and demand for exposure to Bitcoin through regulated financial products. Let’s break down where these flows are going, based on the data shared by Trader T on X: ETF Ticker Issuer Daily Flow (May 23) IBIT BlackRock +$431.05 million HODL VanEck +$17.72 million GBTC Grayscale -$89.17 million ARKB ARK Invest / 21Shares -$73.89 million FBTC Fidelity -$73.69 million Other ETFs Various $0.00 million As you can see, BlackRock IBIT continues to dominate the inflow charts, attracting a substantial amount of capital. While some funds like Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC saw outflows on this particular day, the overall trend across the ecosystem remained strongly positive, driven by the significant inflows into other products, especially IBIT. Why Are These BTC ETF Inflows a Big Deal? The consistent positive BTC ETF inflows are crucial for several reasons: Institutional Adoption: ETFs are familiar investment vehicles for traditional finance players and large institutions. Sustained inflows signal increasing comfort and allocation of capital from these major players into the Bitcoin space. Market Liquidity and Price Support: When ETFs receive inflows, they typically purchase the underlying asset (Bitcoin) to back the new shares. This creates consistent buying pressure on the spot market, providing price support and potentially driving prices higher. Accessibility for Retail Investors: Spot Bitcoin ETFs make it easier for everyday investors to get exposure to Bitcoin through their standard brokerage accounts, without the complexities of managing private keys or dealing directly with crypto exchanges. This broadens the potential investor base. Validation of the Asset Class: The success and increasing adoption of these regulated products lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a recognized and investable asset class within the traditional financial system. The fact that we’ve seen eight straight days of gains in net flows suggests that the initial volatility around the launch and subsequent outflows from GBTC are stabilizing, and a new phase of accumulation might be underway. Exploring the Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance The performance of the Spot Bitcoin ETF market is closely watched by analysts and investors alike. The competition among issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK Invest, VanEck, and others is driving innovation and fee adjustments, ultimately benefiting investors. While BlackRock IBIT has consistently led the pack in terms of inflows since its launch, the performance of other funds also contributes to the overall market sentiment. Outflows from funds like GBTC, which was converted from a trust, were anticipated as investors sought lower fees or moved to newer, more efficient ETF structures. However, the key takeaway from the recent data is that the *total* inflows across all products are outweighing the outflows, leading to a net positive trend. This dynamic flow data provides valuable insight into investor behavior and market trends. It helps us understand where capital is moving and which products are currently favored by the market participants looking for a regulated way to invest in Bitcoin. The Role of Crypto ETF Products in the Ecosystem Beyond just Bitcoin, the broader Crypto ETF landscape is evolving. While spot Ethereum ETFs are currently awaiting regulatory decisions, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs sets a precedent and builds confidence in the potential for other crypto-based investment products to gain regulatory approval and investor traction in the future. The existence of regulated crypto investment vehicles like the spot Bitcoin ETF provides a bridge between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning digital asset space. They offer a familiar wrapper for a novel asset, making it more accessible and less intimidating for a wider range of investors. However, it’s important to remember that investing in any ETF, including a spot Bitcoin ETF, carries risks. The value of the ETF is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin, which is known for its volatility. Market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and other factors can impact performance. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. What Could Drive Future BTC ETF Inflows? Several factors could continue to fuel positive BTC ETF inflows : Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainty in traditional markets, inflation concerns, or changes in monetary policy could drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Performance: A rising Bitcoin price often attracts more investor interest and can lead to increased inflows into related investment products. Further Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions like pension funds, endowments, or wealth managers begin allocating small percentages of their portfolios to Bitcoin via ETFs, significant capital could flow in. Regulatory Clarity: Continued positive regulatory developments globally could increase confidence and reduce perceived risks for investors. The eight consecutive days of positive net flows are a strong indicator that these drivers might already be in play or gaining momentum. In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal? The recent streak of positive net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, totaling over $212 million on May 23rd and marking eight straight days of gains, is undoubtedly a significant development. Led by strong performance from funds like BlackRock IBIT , these flows highlight increasing institutional and retail interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated and accessible investment products. While individual fund flows fluctuate, the overall trend of positive net inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETF market provides a compelling signal of growing confidence and potential future growth for Bitcoin as an asset class.

According to reports, 37-year-old John Woeltz tortured the victim with a chainsaw in a Manhattan apartment before the unnamed victim escaped. In the reports made by the police, Woeltz was arrested by the authorities after the 28-year-old tourist broke out of the apartment and made a daring escape and located the nearest police station. The officers on duty also noted that the victim had blood and bruises all over his body. The police rushed to the luxurious Prince Street pad, which Woeltz has been allegedly renting for about $30,000 to $40,000 a month. They discovered photos that pointed out that the tourist had been tortured at the location by the crypto. The pictures showed the tourist being tied up with electric wires and tortured, including being bound to a chair with a gun pointed at his head, according to police sources. Crypto investor arrested in connection with kidnapping and assault According to sources, John Woeltz bound his victim with an electric cord, tased while his feet were in water, whipped with a pistol, and forced to take cocaine. Police sources also confirmed that the crypto investor even threatened to cut off the victim’s limbs with a chainsaw if he refused to cooperate with him. The kidnap and torture allegedly blew up from a dispute over cryptocurrencies , in which the suspect allegedly tried to extort millions of dollars from the man using scare tactics. The ordeal started on May 6, when the Italian tourist arrived in New York City from Italy. After his arrival, he made his way to see Woeltz, whom he had been dealing with in the past. But when he got to the luxurious apartment, Woeltz snatched him and bound him, the sources added. According to the police, the man suffered torture for days, with polaroids of the events taken. The police believed that those were taken to either be used to extort money from him or to be sent back to Italy to extort money from his family. Police mentioned that they found the picture in where they described as a torture chamber, with blood on the floor. Other torture equipments found at the scene include broken glass, night vision goggle, a bulletproof vest, and a gun. The victim has since been rushed to Bellevue Hospital for treatment while the cops have arrested Woeltz and he is expected to face charges related to assault. Police promise to apprehend every suspect linked to the crime Woeltz has since been charged on Friday night, with the authorities charging him with two counts of second-degree assault, first-degree kidnapping, first-degree unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a weapon. In addition, a second person, 24-year-old Beatrice Folchi, who lives in Manhattan has also been arrested and charged with first-degree kidnapping and first-degree unlawful imprisonment.

Meanwhile, two other people, who authorities believe were employed by Woeltz, are still waiting to be interviewed by the police. According to the police, the Italian tourist had a wound on his arm, which was believed to have been inflicted by the perpetrator through the Chainsaw. In addition, the victim was also tagged with an Apple AirTag in case he tried to escape from custody. He eventually made his escape on Friday, because he believed that was the day the suspect planned to kill him. According to an eyewitness at the scene, Woeltz was apprehended by the police in the apartment. He was clad in a robe and handcuffed on his way away from the luxurious apartment. “This is definitely the strangest thing I’ve seen in my time here,” he said. “Normally, this is a pretty quiet block.” Another vendor who lived nearby mentioned that he got a weird vibe from the crypto guys who just moved into the apartment. The police, on the other hand, have promised to apprehend other suspects linked to the crime, while ensuring that no other victims remain. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In 2025, one name is climbing the radar faster than most: MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Solana rallies to $183 and XRP investors look for fresh momentum ahead of exchange debuts and regulatory milestones, a growing number are accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE. Alongside it, Kaspa (KAS) is quietly building—but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum and positioning are sparking serious speculation: Could this be the next major crypto breakout? HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating 2025 Altcoin Picks MAGACOIN FINANCE launched into the 2025 cycle with undeniable force—selling out stage after stage and drawing comparisons to early SHIBA INU and even Bitcoin’s earliest days. With a listing target of $0.007 and investors already anticipating a major exchange debut, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now viewed as a realistic 25x–35x play by early entry analysts. Key reasons investors are watching MAGA closely: Political narrative that cuts through noise and captures community energy Early-stage positioning with strong tokenomics and limited supply Rapid stage progress—Stage 8 is nearly at capacity and filling fast Analyst forecasts pointing to 15,000%–18,500% upside potential Unlike most meme-themed tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is combining sentiment with structure—and that’s the exact combination that early Bitcoin investors once recognized before the market caught on. Solana’s Consistent Climb Draws Institutional Eyes Solana (SOL) is making headlines as it reclaims the $180–$183 range, a key inflection point that could set the stage for new all-time highs. After a strong rebound from April lows, Solana’s price has surged nearly 30% in recent weeks, fueled by robust DeFi activity, low fees, and growing institutional interest. Analysts now see SOL potentially reaching $213–$362 in 2025 if the bullish trend continues, with a clear path to $240–$260 later this year. While Solana isn’t early-stage anymore, it still offers strong performance for those wanting exposure to a leading smart contract platform. That said, some SOL holders are now rotating into smaller-cap options like MAGACOIN FINANCE to chase outsized returns ahead of listings. XRP Inches Toward Futures and Institutional Access XRP remains one of the most actively discussed altcoins—trading between $2.35 and $2.65 and benefiting from regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and renewed institutional interest. Analysts say a confirmed futures launch could drive XRP into the $2.85–$3.40 range rapidly, with long-term believers eyeing $5.50 or more as adoption grows. As XRP holders seek the next wave of upside, many are reallocating to pre-listing opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve hasn’t even begun. Kaspa: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Kaspa (KAS) is quietly building momentum, trading around $0.11 and up over 80% since the start of the year. With its unique GHOSTDAG protocol and expanding ecosystem, KAS is attracting developers and users alike. Analysts expect Kaspa to test resistance at $0.37 by year-end, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 15,000% winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion While Solana’s climb to $183 is impressive and XRP’s institutional momentum is building, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the bold, attention-grabbing pick that’s catching investor eyes across the market. With Stage 8 heating up, analyst targets pointing to 15,000%–18,500% potential, and momentum still building, MAGACOIN FINANCE may not just be another altcoin—it could be this cycle’s defining early entry moment. For investors seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar.

As institutional players increasingly look to enter the cryptocurrency space, the need for expert guidance is paramount. This is precisely the trend that New York-based financial services firm , Clear Street , is capitalizing on with a significant expansion of its digital assets capabilities. Why is Institutional Interest in Crypto Booming? Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies have moved from niche technology to a recognized, albeit volatile, asset class. This maturation, coupled with clearer regulatory frameworks emerging in some regions and the potential for diversification and high returns, has piqued the interest of large financial institutions. Potential for High Returns: Despite volatility, crypto markets have historically offered significant growth opportunities. Diversification: Digital assets can offer low correlation with traditional asset classes, providing portfolio diversification benefits. Technological Innovation: Institutions are exploring the underlying blockchain technology for efficiency gains in various financial processes. Client Demand: A growing number of institutional clients are demanding access to digital asset investments. However, navigating this new frontier presents unique challenges compared to traditional markets. Navigating the Complexities of Institutional Crypto Entering the institutional crypto space isn’t as simple as buying Bitcoin on a retail exchange. Institutions face hurdles such as: Regulatory uncertainty and compliance requirements. Security concerns related to custody and trading large volumes. Lack of familiar infrastructure and trading tools. The need for specialized knowledge in blockchain technology and crypto market dynamics. This is where experienced advisors become crucial. As John D’Agostini and Nicholas Hemmerly, co-heads of Clear Street ‘s Investment Banking division, highlighted, the convergence of traditional and emerging financial systems requires professionals who understand both worlds. Clear Street’s Strategic Expansion into Digital Assets Recognizing this growing need, Clear Street has announced a significant expansion of its Blockchain and Digital Assets Investment Banking Franchise. This move positions the firm to provide specialized advisory services tailored to the unique demands of institutions looking to engage with crypto. The expansion includes bringing in new talent with specific expertise in the crypto sector. Nakul Mehta and Collin Finnerty are joining Clear Street to lead the crypto segment of the expanded division. Their experience is expected to bolster the firm’s ability to offer sophisticated guidance in this rapidly evolving market. What Services Will Clear Street Offer in Crypto Investment Banking? The expanded division aims to provide a comprehensive suite of advisory services for companies operating in or looking to enter the digital assets space. These services are designed to help clients navigate the complexities and capitalize on opportunities within the market. Key services include: Public Listing Strategies: Guidance for crypto-native companies considering going public. Capital Raising: Assistance with securing funding through various mechanisms relevant to the digital asset ecosystem. Crypto Treasury Planning: Advisory on managing corporate treasury holdings in cryptocurrencies. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Support for M&A activities involving companies in the digital asset sector. Strategic Guidance: Providing expert advice for traditional companies looking to enter or integrate digital assets into their operations. This range of services underscores Clear Street ‘s commitment to becoming a key player in crypto investment banking , offering institutional-grade support for complex transactions and strategic decisions. The Future of Financial Services and Digital Assets The move by Clear Street is indicative of a broader trend: the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. As more financial services firm s build out their crypto capabilities, it signals a growing confidence in the long-term viability and importance of this asset class. This expansion is not just about offering new products; it’s about bridging the gap between the established financial world and the innovative, fast-paced crypto market. It provides institutions with the expertise and infrastructure they need to participate confidently and compliantly. Conclusion: Clear Street’s Strategic Position in Institutional Crypto Clear Street ‘s expansion of its digital assets division, bolstered by new hires with specialized expertise, is a strategic response to the undeniable growth in institutional crypto interest. By offering a robust suite of crypto investment banking services, the financial services firm is positioning itself as a crucial partner for institutions seeking to navigate the complexities and opportunities within the crypto market. This development highlights the ongoing maturation of the digital asset space and its increasing importance within the global financial landscape.

Some Pi supporters are calling it a step forward, saying it shows growth and rising adoption. After all, the Pi coin is still trading around $0.77, even after a slight drop in the price. While some people are celebrating the on-chain activity and others are doubting, and they don’t like what they see. Insider Selling Rumors Stir Worry Meanwhile, well-known blockchain investigator, Dr. Altcoin, pointed out that 1.4 million Pi coins were moved from a wallet that hadn’t been used before. Shortly after, those coins were sold on the Gate.io exchange. This wasn’t just a one-time thing. Several other big transfers have been spotted, and they all seem to lead back to wallets that might be connected to the Pi Core Team. Some reports even suggest these wallets could be holding over 90 billion tokens. That’s made many in the community question how much control the team has and whether the project is as fair as it claims to be. Pi Coin’s Price Struggle & Faces Unlocking Pressure In the meantime, Pi coin price has been trying to break past the $0.85 resistance zone, but it’s been stuck. Technical experts warn that if it can’t move higher soon, the price could drop further, possibly down to $0.66 or even $0.55, which we saw earlier this year. Adding to the worries, over 1.4 billion more Pi tokens are expected to enter the market in the next year. In May alone, 110 million tokens entered circulation.

Firms known for backing the next big thing are now looking at established, mature businesses – think traditional call centers, accounting firms, or professional services. This isn’t just about buying old companies; it’s about applying cutting-edge AI to fundamentally change how they operate, a strategy sometimes called AI-Infused roll-ups. This approach is gaining traction among prominent VCs, including the notable firm, Khosla Ventures . What is this New Venture Capital Strategy? Traditionally, venture capitalists seek out nascent companies with groundbreaking technology or business models aiming to disrupt markets or create entirely new ones. Their focus is high growth, often with significant risk. However, some VCs are now adopting a different approach, one that looks more like private equity but with a distinct tech twist. This Venture Capital Strategy involves: Acquiring existing, mature businesses that operate in traditional sectors. Implementing advanced artificial intelligence solutions to automate processes, improve efficiency, and enhance service delivery. ‘Rolling up’ multiple similar businesses under one umbrella to achieve scale and operational synergy. Firms like General Catalyst, Thrive Capital, and solo investor Elad Gil are already experimenting with this model. General Catalyst, in particular, is championing this as a new asset class, having already invested in several such ventures. One example is Long Lake, a company acquiring homeowners’ associations to streamline management using technology, which has secured significant funding. Khosla Ventures Explores AI Investing Adding significant weight to this trend, Khosla Ventures , a firm renowned for its early, often risky bets on foundational technologies with long development horizons, is now considering this PE-flavored approach. This move is particularly interesting given Khosla’s typical focus on unproven technologies rather than established businesses. Samir Kaul, a general partner at Khosla Ventures, confirmed the firm’s interest, stating they would ‘look at a few of these types of opportunities.’ This suggests a cautious but deliberate exploration into the world of AI Investing in mature companies. The Appeal of AI Business Optimization Why are VCs interested in applying AI to seemingly mundane businesses? The core idea is AI Business Optimization . Mature companies often have established customer bases, predictable revenue streams, and well-defined processes. However, they may lack the technological edge to scale efficiently or offer modern, automated services. By injecting AI into areas like customer service (call centers), data processing (accounting firms), or operational management (service firms), these businesses can: Serve more customers without proportionally increasing headcount. Reduce operational costs through automation. Improve service quality and consistency. Extract valuable insights from data using AI analytics. This transformation can unlock significant growth and profitability potential that wasn’t previously accessible. Potential Benefits for AI Startups Interestingly, this trend could create a beneficial ecosystem for the very AI startups that VCs are already funding. If a VC firm acquires and optimizes a network of, say, accounting firms using AI, their portfolio of AI startups specializing in financial automation or data analysis gains instant access to a large, established client base. Samir Kaul highlighted this point, noting that such access would be invaluable for new startups that often struggle with long enterprise sales cycles and customer acquisition, especially in the rapidly evolving AI market. Navigating Private Equity Roll-ups with a VC Lens While this strategy borrows elements from traditional Private Equity Roll-ups , the emphasis on deep technological transformation via AI sets it apart. PE firms often focus on financial engineering, operational efficiencies, and market consolidation. This new VC approach adds a layer of disruptive technology implementation as a primary driver of value creation. Khosla Ventures is approaching this cautiously. Kaul emphasized the importance of protecting their strong return track record and being responsible stewards of their investors’ money. While the acquired businesses might be less likely to lose money compared to early-stage startups, ensuring they can deliver venture-like returns after AI implementation is the key challenge. Khosla’s Measured Approach Khosla Ventures plans to ‘dabble’ initially, undertaking a few deals to assess the performance of these AI-infused roll-ups. If the early results are promising and demonstrate strong returns, they might consider scaling the strategy, potentially even raising a dedicated investment vehicle for it. However, Kaul indicated that Khosla would likely partner with a firm experienced in acquisitions and operational roll-ups rather than building that expertise in-house. ‘We wouldn’t do it alone, we don’t have that expertise,’ he noted. Conclusion: A New Frontier in VC Investing? The exploration by firms like Khosla Ventures into AI-Infused roll-ups represents an exciting evolution in the world of venture capital. By combining the stability of mature businesses with the transformative power of AI, VCs are opening up new avenues for value creation and providing valuable opportunities for their portfolio of AI startups. While still in its early stages, this strategy of AI Investing in traditional sectors could redefine how VCs approach growth and disruption in the years to come, proving that innovation isn’t always about building from scratch, but sometimes about intelligently optimizing what already exists.

This milestone is not just a psychological boost; it is igniting serious confidence among both retail investors and institutional players. From macro traders to long-term holders, this rally is being seen less as a spike and more as a structural shift. Many are now watching to see whether Bitcoin’s behavior will begin to mirror more mature assets like equities or gold, which often continue climbing after setting new records. In short, this is not a moment investors are ignoring—it is one they are leaning into. Bitcoin’s Strongest Accumulation Wave Since January Signals a Bullish Continuation Fresh insights from Glassnode reveal that Bitcoin has entered its most aggressive accumulation phase since the start of the year. Their Accumulation Trend Score, now at its peak of 1.0, indicates that every major wallet cohort—from small holders to whales—is in buy mode. This is not passive interest. This is coordinated conviction. What makes this surge different is that it is happening after months of distribution. Between January and April, large holders were consistently reducing exposure. Now, that pattern has reversed. Whales holding over 10,000 BTC led the charge in early May, triggering a domino effect where smaller investors followed with confidence. Accumulation is now visible across nearly the entire wallet spectrum. Even $BTC holders have flipped from distribution to light accumulation (~0.55), joining larger cohorts like 100–1K (~0.9) and 1K–10K #BTC (~0.85). Only 1–10 #BTC remain net sellers. pic.twitter.com/C4C9ZLlwNs — glassnode (@glassnode) May 19, 2025 Backing this sentiment is the options market. June calls for 200,000 dollar and even 300,000 dollar BTC are gaining traction, with 620 million and 420 million in notional value, respectively. This pricing behavior reflects trader expectations for a continued breakout, not a cooldown. In contrast to previous post all-time high pullbacks, Bitcoin’s current setup resembles a maturing asset and may be entering a long-term rally. When accumulation and conviction align this tightly, the case for strategic buying becomes difficult to ignore. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Bitcoin Makes a New High SUBBD The reacceleration of Bitcoin accumulation by all wallet cohorts is more than just bullish—it’s a reminder that participants are favoring systems that emphasize control and long-term ownership. That context makes SUBBD especially relevant. It does not aim to mimic the creator platforms of Web2, but instead rebuilds the system from the ground up using decentralized architecture. SUBBD gives creators something they rarely have—leverage. Every content piece, stream, and interaction becomes monetizable through $SUBBD, a token that powers gated content, direct tipping, fan-tiered rewards, and on-chain subscriptions. But it’s not just another “social token.” With the platform’s smart contract-based payout mechanism, creators and fans maintain verifiable, non-revocable access terms. There are no hidden fees, delayed withdrawals, or banned accounts. In the same way that Bitcoin gave users custody over their wealth, SUBBD is allowing creators to take custody over their business models. The platform allows voting rights for token holders, meaning community interests are prioritized without reliance on advertisers or opaque platform rules. For investors, this transforms $SUBBD into more than a niche asset—it becomes a claim on a decentralized creator ecosystem, still in its early adoption curve. Top creators like ClayBro have already dubbed it one of the best crypto presales in the space right now. As institutional capital watches Bitcoin break new highs with record accumulation levels, it is also seeking projects that reflect real transition stories. SUBBD fits into that thesis—not by promising exponential hype, but by solving a problem that affects millions of creators right now, with a framework that rewards participation at every level. Best Wallet Token As Bitcoin’s price hits unprecedented highs and accumulation hits full throttle across all wallet sizes, the narrative around custody is back in focus. The logic is simple—if institutions are accumulating, self-management tools need to keep up. Best Wallet steps into this moment not just as another crypto wallet, but as a fully integrated platform built for user engagement and asset control. At the center is the BEST token . While most wallet tokens sit idle, BEST actually opens access to native staking, presale listings, and in-app decentralized trading. With more than 60 chains supported, it caters to investors who refuse to silo their assets. But the core value lies in its role as a toolkit: from AI-driven portfolio insights to a presale aggregator and DEX interface, everything is usable without ever leaving the wallet environment. Security-wise, the wallet is non-custodial, with all access keys controlled by the user. It even integrates iGaming rewards for users who engage with the broader Best Wallet ecosystem. This matters because investors are no longer looking for passive storage—they want participation with upside, especially as early-cycle momentum builds. Best Wallet reflects that shift. As Bitcoin’s renewed trust drives a fresh round of market interest, tools that let users directly access and act on that momentum—without hopping between apps—gain added relevance. BEST is not a bet on speculation; it is a play on infrastructure that supports participation at the exact moment participation is peaking again. Solaxy The uptick in Bitcoin buying is now systemic, spanning every wallet cohort. This points to renewed institutional and long-term confidence—confidence that tends to flow toward infrastructure, not just hype cycles. Solaxy enters that conversation as a Layer 2 protocol that doesn't need loud narratives because its value lies in execution. Rather than picking a side in the Ethereum versus Solana discussion, Solaxy integrates both. It operates as a cross-compatible Layer 2 that brings faster transactions and reduced gas fees across ecosystems, with validator node support designed for scale. The SOLX token is more than just a native asset—it anchors the network through staking, liquidity support, and protocol incentives. Early participants benefit from a transparent APY model, with tracking tools built directly into the interface for real-time visibility. What separates Solaxy is its quiet alignment with what institutions now seek: modular scalability, cross-chain operability, and risk-averse design. Solaxy has not plastered itself across crypto Twitter or released viral memes—but its architecture is attracting early adopters who are watching this accumulation-driven cycle not as traders, but as builders. This signal is all green! 🟢 🪐39M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/c3dAiUkTsm — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 22, 2025 The project has already raised upwards of $39 million and is currently looking to go live in less than 25 days. Solaxy’s focus on predictable, transparent performance metrics mirrors the sort of sober infrastructure plays that capital typically rotates into once Bitcoin shows sustained strength. With $SOLX still in its early phases and utility baked into the protocol’s staking, validation, and reward layers, the setup looks less like a trend and more like a quietly maturing bet on blockchain’s connective tissue. BTC Bull With Bitcoin breaking into new highs and entering its strongest accumulation phase since January, it’s worth watching how this bullish confidence filters into adjacent narratives. BTC Bull is one such project—built not to replicate Bitcoin’s technical model, but to echo its spirit: decentralization, long-term conviction, and community-first ideology. BTC Bull wraps itself in the philosophy that made Bitcoin what it is today: distributed power and shared ownership. Rather than offering a grand utility promise, it offers participation—staking, holding, and supporting a token designed to reward involvement, not just early speculation. Essentially, every holder will be able to win airdrops and enjoy benefits from burns as Bitcoin reaches new price milestones. The project runs on a fixed supply model and maintains transparency through public audits and an open roadmap that prioritizes organic growth over marketing flash. The community element isn’t an afterthought—it’s the core. The more BTC Bull gets staked or held, the more its incentives scale, aligning directly with what Bitcoin’s accumulation wave is currently proving: that conviction compounds value. In a market increasingly driven by utility but underpinned by sentiment, BTC Bull becomes relevant not because it tries to be a better Bitcoin, but because it works alongside it. As retail and mid-size investors look to align with this moment’s momentum, BTC Bull reflects a parallel track—one that’s early enough to matter, yet mature enough to carry weight beyond hype. MIND of Pepe Amid Bitcoin’s all-cohort accumulation frenzy, a surprising pattern is emerging: tokens that seem like memes are gaining real traction—not because of irony, but because of how they engage with modern investor behavior. MIND of Pepe is at the center of that pattern, offering something rare: a self-aware memecoin with actual utility built around real-time market engagement. What sets MIND of Pepe apart isn’t just its AI layer, but how that AI interacts with holders. It’s not passive data or abstract analytics—the token gives access to an on-chain sentiment engine. This AI agent observes social media, tracks viral trends, and synthesizes what the broader investor base is thinking in real time. Token holders don’t just speculate—they observe crowd behavior as it unfolds. As Bitcoin options traders begin pricing in 200,000 and 300,000 dollar strike prices, retail investors are hunting for leverage in less saturated zones. MIND of Pepe responds by offering a reflection of crowd psychology, not just price charts. For a market that’s becoming more reflexive—where what people believe ends up influencing outcomes—this token functions like a mirror with predictive capability. There’s no illusion here about replacing Bitcoin. MIND of Pepe works because Bitcoin is working—its accumulation drives attention, and attention fuels sentiment. In that loop, MIND of Pepe becomes a filter for interpreting what people might do next. It’s a speculative play, yes—but one informed by a level of feedback most tokens do not even attempt to provide. Conclusion As Bitcoin pushes into record territory and accumulation activity intensifies across every wallet tier, the broader crypto market is beginning to reflect a similar sense of renewed purpose. In conditions like these, tokens with clearly defined roles, early-stage traction, and thoughtful design often find themselves well-positioned to benefit from the overflow. While nothing in crypto is without risk, the projects discussed above present concepts that align with the current mood of the market—and for that reason, they may be worth keeping on the radar.

Although many might seem far-fetched, at least for the current market prices, ChatGPT noted that a double-digit price tag is not out of the question. $29, $55? Although XRP has been the object of countless massive price predictions, even before its explosive rally at the end of last year, we will focus on a more summarized version from this article , where the first two targets were set at $29 and $55. The AI chatbot described the more modest one as “ambitious yet conceivable,” since it came from more renowned industry experts, such as Bitwise Research’s Oscar Ramos, who believes the asset can surge to such an impressive price tag if certain conditions are met. At first, he highlighted the significance of a potential approval of a spot Ripple ETF in the States. Although the US SEC has delayed making a decision on a few listings, the chances for such products to hit the US markets this year are above 75%, according to Polymarket. XRP’s price can also benefit if the token continues to gain traction in global financial systems and sees “widespread institutional adoption.” The $55 target was categorized as “highly optimistic” by ChatGPT. It explained that such a price per token would require a market cap above $3 trillion, given the current available supply, which would put XRP above BTC. “Such a surge would necessitate unprecedented adoption and utility, making this target highly optimistic under current market conditions,” – added the AI tool. What About $100? The last price target set by analysts was an entry triple-digit price. ChatGPT kindly dismissed it by putting it in the “speculative and unlikely” category. After all, such a price tag would put XRP’s market cap above those of Apple and Nvidia… combined. “While some proponents argue that XRP could capture a significant share of global financial transactions, including SWIFT replacements and derivatives settlements, these scenarios are highly theoretical and face numerous regulatory and practical challenges,” – concluded the AI chatbot. Although the predictions above might sound a bit (or a lot) far-fetched at the moment, this doesn’t mean that XRP lacks any market potential this year. In fact, you can check what ChatGPT thinks about the possibility of a $10 price tag for Ripple’s cross-border token – here .

Mistral AI , the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is quickly gaining recognition as a formidable OpenAI competitor . Valued at $6 billion just a year after its creation, Mistral AI represents Europe’s strongest bid yet to compete at the frontier of AI technology. While its global market share is still growing, its rapid ascent, fueled by substantial AI funding and strategic partnerships, signals a serious challenge to established players. What Exactly is Mistral AI and Its Mission? Founded in 2023, Mistral AI was established with a clear mission: to put frontier AI in the hands of everyone. This ambition, while not a direct critique of OpenAI, highlights the company’s advocacy for openness in AI development. Unlike some proprietary approaches, Mistral AI aims to provide powerful AI models that are accessible and adaptable. Key offerings from Mistral AI include: Le Chat: An AI chat assistant available on web, iOS, and Android, positioned as an alternative to ChatGPT. It saw rapid adoption, reaching 1 million mobile downloads quickly after launch, even topping download charts in France. Foundational Models: A suite of large language models catering to various needs, including: Mistral Large 2 (successor to Mistral Large) Pixtral Large (multimodal model) Mistral Medium 3 (optimized for efficiency, coding, and STEM tasks) Devstral (coding model, openly available under Apache 2.0 license) Codestral (earlier coding model with commercial restrictions) Les Ministraux (models optimized for edge devices) Mistral Saba (Arabic language model) Mistral OCR: An optical character recognition API launched in March 2025 to facilitate text extraction from PDFs for AI processing. This range of products showcases Mistral AI’s focus on developing diverse generative AI capabilities, from conversational agents to specialized tools for developers and businesses. Who Are the Minds Behind Mistral AI? Mistral AI’s leadership team brings significant experience from major U.S. tech companies with strong European presence. The three co-founders have backgrounds in AI research at Google DeepMind and Meta: Arthur Mensch: CEO, formerly at Google DeepMind. Timothée Lacroix: CTO, formerly at Meta. Guillaume Lample: Chief Scientist Officer, formerly at Meta. Their combined expertise in cutting-edge AI research forms a strong foundation for the company’s technical ambitions. The co-founding advisers also include notable figures from the French tech scene, adding strategic depth. Is Mistral AI Truly Open Source? Mistral AI adopts a nuanced approach to openness. While some of its premier models are not open-weighted for commercial use, it actively promotes open access for others. Several research and developer-focused models, like Devstral and Mistral NeMo (developed with Nvidia), are released under permissive licenses like Apache 2.0, allowing for unrestricted commercial use. This mixed model balances the need to monetize advanced research with a commitment to fostering open AI development, distinguishing it in the competitive landscape of AI models . How Does Mistral AI Generate Revenue? Despite offering free tiers and open models, Mistral AI has a clear path to monetization. Revenue streams include: Le Chat Paid Tiers: The Pro plan, introduced in February 2025, offers premium features for a monthly subscription. API Access: Monetizing premier models through usage-based pricing APIs for businesses. Model Licensing: Enterprises can license Mistral AI’s advanced models directly. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with large companies and government entities provide significant revenue opportunities. While reports suggest revenue is still in the eight-digit range, the company’s valuation indicates strong investor confidence in its future earning potential, particularly as it expands its enterprise offerings and continues to develop advanced generative AI capabilities. What Key Partnerships Fuel Mistral AI’s Growth? Mistral AI has secured impressive partnerships that bolster its distribution and market reach: Microsoft: A strategic partnership in 2024 included distributing Mistral AI models via Azure and a €15 million investment. Agence France-Presse (AFP): A deal in January 2025 allowing Le Chat to query AFP’s extensive text archive. Government & Industry: Partnerships with France’s army, job agency, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis. AI Campus Initiative: Participating in a joint venture to create an AI Campus in Paris with MGX, NVIDIA, and Bpifrance. These collaborations highlight Mistral AI’s ability to integrate its technology across various sectors and leverage global infrastructure like Microsoft Azure to compete more effectively with an OpenAI competitor . How Much AI Funding Has Mistral AI Raised? Mistral AI’s funding journey has been rapid and substantial, showcasing significant investor confidence in its potential to challenge dominant players and develop cutting-edge AI models . June 2023: Record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, valuing the company at $260 million. December 2023: Series A of €385 million ($415 million) led by Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at $2 billion. February 2024: Microsoft’s $16.3 million convertible investment presented as a Series A extension. June 2024: €600 million mix of equity and debt ($640 million) led by General Catalyst, reaching a $6 billion valuation. As of February 2025, Mistral AI had raised around €1 billion (approximately $1.04 billion), positioning it as one of the most well-funded AI startups globally and a serious contender in the race for AI funding . What’s Next for Mistral AI? An IPO? According to CEO Arthur Mensch, an Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the plan for Mistral AI. This indicates the company is focused on scaling its operations and revenue significantly, rather than pursuing an acquisition. An IPO would allow Mistral AI to remain independent, a goal aligned with its self-definition as a leading independent AI lab, and provide the necessary capital for continued growth and development of its generative AI technology. Conclusion: A European AI Force to Watch Mistral AI has quickly established itself as a major player in the global AI scene and a credible OpenAI competitor . Its combination of experienced founders, significant AI funding , a diverse portfolio of AI models , and strategic partnerships positions it for continued growth. While challenges remain in scaling revenue to match its valuation and navigating the complex AI landscape, Mistral AI’s rapid progress and commitment to its vision make it a key company to watch in the future of generative AI .

Investors are eyeing these tokens for their unique strengths and potential for significant returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, raising $9,200,000 with over 505 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders. DOGE is stabilizing after a recent dip, while XRP shows promise after breaking key resistance. Dogecoin’s Resilient Bounce Dogecoin (DOGE) is regaining its footing after a 9.7% drop from $0.237 to $0.214. Buyers are stepping in at the $0.215 support level, creating a “panic zone retest” that holds firm. The token is navigating a falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal for potential upward movement. Technical indicators show DOGE trading between $0.212 and $0.225, with resistance near $0.219. Investors watching crypto prices today see DOGE as a speculative bet. If support holds, the next big cryptocurrency rally could lift DOGE to $0.244. Failure to break resistance might see prices slide to $0.20. For those asking what crypto to invest in, DOGE offers short-term potential but lacks the utility of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Its community-driven hype drives crypto news, but long-term stability remains uncertain. Investors should monitor crypto charts closely, as DOGE’s path hinges on breaking the $0.220 resistance in 2025. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing significant attention in its phase 5 presale, priced at $0.03. This marks a 200% increase from the opening phase’s $0.01, reflecting strong investor demand. Phase 6 is approaching, bringing a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return for current buyers. Analysts predict a post-launch price of $2.50, offering a potential 8,233% ROI. The project has raised $9,200,000, with over 505 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders, signaling robust confidence in this new crypto coin. This mechanism positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto for long-term investors seeking passive income. The team is also developing a leaderboard dashboard, rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance’s Security Focus The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is prioritizing trust by pursuing a smart contract audit with Certik. An announcement will follow on social platforms once finalized. This step underscores the project’s commitment to transparency, vital in today’s crypto market. Unlike DOGE’s volatility or XRP’s regulatory hurdles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structured DeFi ecosystem. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, MUTM’s utility and presale success make it a standout choice. The buy-and-distribute system reduces sell pressure, supporting price stability. Investors asking which crypto to buy today for long-term gains find Mutuum Finance (MUTM) compelling. Its current $0.03 price offers a rare entry point before the $0.06 launch. As crypto prices rise, MUTM’s structured approach positions it as a top cryptocurrency in 2025, outpacing less utility-focused tokens like DOGE. XRP’s Bullish Momentum XRP is trading at $2.35, up 0.25% in 24 hours, with trading volume surging 31.95% to $3.77 billion. A breakout from a falling wedge pattern signals potential for a rally to $3.87. After a 26% jump from $1.85, XRP is consolidating between $2.30 and $2.35. Technical indicators, like the hourly MACD and RSI above 50, support bullish momentum. Resistance at $2.45 looms, but a break could push XRP toward $2.55. Crypto predictions for 2025 range from $2.10 to $5.16, though regulatory risks temper its appeal compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Despite a 7.69% weekly dip, XRP’s volume surge reflects growing interest. The $2.30 support level holds firm, suggesting potential for the next crypto to hit $1 or beyond. Investors tracking crypto news today see XRP as a solid but less innovative option. For those exploring what’s the best crypto to buy, XRP offers short-term gains but trails MUTM’s long-term potential. Crypto Market’s Bright Horizon The crypto market is poised for growth, with altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), DOGE, and XRP leading the charge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its DeFi utility and presale success, offering a 100% ROI at launch and potential for 8,233% gains at $2.50. DOGE’s meme-driven volatility and XRP’s technical breakout provide short-term opportunities, but MUTM’s structured model promises lasting value. Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in should act now, as phase 5 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a prime entry point.

Unilabs (UNIL) , a new altcoin, is slowly gaining momentum and may challenge Ethereum’s dominance in 2025. Powered by advanced AI and innovative DeFi investment strategies, Unilabs offers smart, automated portfolio management. This offering, coupled with other rewards and perks, could make Unilabs one of the best DeFi projects in the market. Binance Coin (BNB) Targets $700 Resistance The Binance Coin price has been retesting the $680 level in the past few days but bulls have held their ground. The cryptocurrency is currently starting an uptrend on the weekly chart. Its value has soared by 5.3% in this timeframe. Going forward, the Binance Coin price could climb to $700 based on technical analysis. Technical indicators such as the RSI show that buying pressure is high, supporting more upside. Rose Premium Signals in a recent post on X said the Binance Coin price chart was strong. The expert predicts the Binance Coin price is about to enter discovery. If this happens, the BNB price could climb to $743 and $789 in the next few weeks. Another expert, BATMAN said the Binance Coin price has formed a bullish flag and is waiting for a breakout. The analyst expects the Binance Coin price to soar to $700 when this happens. Analyst Forecasts Uptrend For Ethereum (ETH) Rose Premium Signals tweeted recently that the Ethereum price has broken from a descending trendline. It has also turned the former resistance zone at $2,000-$2,200 into a strong support. As long as the Ethereum price stays above this breakout zone, Rose Premium Signals says its value might climb higher. The analyst believes the Ethereum price is gearing up for the next leg up. They posted three potential targets which are $3,063, $3,566, and $4,201. At the moment, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Ethereum price has risen on the weekly timeframe by 4.5%. Meanwhile, the head of research at OnchainHQ, Leon Waidmann revealed that the Ethereum network has witnessed massive growth. The number of weekly active addresses has been above 15 million. Also, over 564k addresses are active on multiple chains. This ecosystem growth could push the Ethereum price to new levels in the months ahead. Unilabs (UNIL) Presale, A Channel To AI-Powered Funds Investment As AI reshapes investment strategies globally, Unilabs (UNIL) offers a unique chance for investors to join its live presale, with tokens priced at just $0.0051. This early opportunity promises access to AI-managed portfolios designed to optimize returns with little effort. Unilabs is an AI-driven DeFi platform featuring a multi-fund structure: the AI Fund, RWA Fund, BTC Fund, and Mining Fund. Each fund targets specific sectors and adapts dynamically using AI to rebalance investments based on real-time market data. This approach removes the guesswork and provides diversified exposure across promising crypto assets. Unilabs is different from hype driven tokens like DOGE as it is focused on real utility and growth. The presale is currently open, offering referral perks, tiered staking rewards, and a share in 30% of platform fees redistributed to token holders. Early participation is crucial to maximize benefits. With DeFi’s market cap surpassing $120 billion, even a small market share could push Unilabs to a valuation of $250 million or more.

Now, a new contender is quietly gaining traction in crypto circles, priced at just $0.007 and catching the attention of seasoned speculators who’ve seen this story before. This emerging token, Lightchain AI, is in the middle of a record-breaking presale that has already raised $19.3 million, hinting at powerful investor momentum. Unlike many past meme coins, this crypto brings strong utility backed by real-world AI integration, giving it a foundation beyond hype. With early backers now positioning themselves aggressively, some are whispering that the path from $1,000 to $1,000,000 might just be unfolding again—this time, led by a project built to bridge AI, decentralization, and next-gen blockchain infrastructure. Can This New Altcoin Deliver the Next Life-Changing Return in Crypto This innovative structure makes it distinct from run-of-the-mill altcoins and a genuine contender for life-changing gains. Decentralized AI infrastructure aren’t just riding hype with their Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, it’s already attracting high-level developer interest and building the backbone of tomorrow’s tech landscape. Unlike speculative tokens such as DOGE or SHIB which promise no real utility, Lightchain AI gives reward tokens to nodes for performing meaningful AI computation such as training or inference, creating a powerful layer of utility that is insulated for tomorrow’s technological demands. Blockchain and artificial intelligence are beginning to integrate, and I can imagine exponential returns for people investing early on such projects that solve computational issues in the real world. Nothing is guaranteed in crypto, of course, but with a $0.007 price tag and technical foundation to build on, Lightchain AI has a good chance of being a rocket ship for investors who want to get involved ahead of mass adoption (and prior to their next two-phase major exchange listings). Why Early Backers Are Comparing This Project to SHIB and DOGE's Early Days What makes Lightchain AI echo the early days of SHIB and DOGE isn't just its low entry point—it’s the strong grassroots buzz and bold vision behind the token. Backers are drawn to how Lightchain AI leverages a community-first approach combined with future-focused technology. Like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming a conversation piece across social platforms and presale groups. However, where meme coins relied heavily on virality, Lightchain AI adds real-world purpose. Its roadmap shows structured phases—from PoI and AIVM development to cross-industry adoption—with every milestone creating new reasons for believers to hold long-term. This combination of emotional excitement and tech-backed potential is exactly what drove SHIB and DOGE to 10,000%+ returns—and Lightchain AI may now be writing the next chapter. Is Now the Right Time to Take a Shot at the Next Big Crypto Upswing With Lightchain AI in stage 15 of its presale and already raising $19.3 million, the timing for early entry could be ideal for those watching for the next big crypto shift. The platform’s low token price and fast-growing attention give it the kind of presale velocity that has historically preceded explosive growth. Additionally, its smart economic design—with dynamic gas fees, deflationary mechanics, and staking incentives—adds fuel to the long-term sustainability of the token. As other coins face market fatigue, Lightchain AI’s momentum is only just starting to accelerate. Investors looking to take calculated risks are now weighing whether this is the window before major institutional eyes take notice. Given the rapid uptake, technical innovation, and untapped growth curve, jumping in now may offer the kind of upswing most traders only dream of.

On May 21, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 21, a bold initiative proposing the establishment of a state-held Bitcoin reserve. This move, backed by a bipartisan majority, is now heading to the state Senate. If passed, Texas would become the first U.S. state to hold digital assets as part of its treasury strategy. With regulatory clarity improving and macroeconomic signals favoring long-term crypto reserves, the broader market is taking notice. The bill’s momentum isn’t isolated either—it reflects a growing sentiment across the financial system where digital assets are becoming part of serious monetary infrastructure. This news has added a spark to the market, further energizing community members exploring early-stage blockchain projects that may benefit from the next adoption cycle. Among those on the radar, Qubetics is standing out—not because of buzz, but because of solid fundamentals and a presale structure that mirrors the strategic clarity policymakers are now bringing into crypto. As regulatory pressure starts shifting toward strategic integration rather than resistance, the space is rewarding projects that prioritize interoperability, decentralization, and utility. Qubetics ($TICS) fits this narrative, addressing real-world gaps through its multi-chain aggregation and utility-driven wallet infrastructure. While it builds momentum with a well-structured crypto presale, other contenders like SUI and Cosmos are also showing significant traction in the news. SUI is witnessing explosive growth in DeFi metrics and DEX trading volumes, while Cosmos is advancing cross-chain utility by enabling wrapped Bitcoin and integrating bridges to enhance blockchain communication. In such a climate, where regulators are giving digital assets a closer look and utility is becoming the leading narrative, the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 may not be about just promises—it’s about delivery. And Qubetics is beginning to look like one of the few that’s checking every box. Qubetics Wallet: Real Utility for Real-World Transactions Qubetics isn’t building abstract concepts—it’s offering a multi-chain non-custodial wallet that simplifies blockchain usability across the board. Its wallet connects multiple chains in one place, eliminating the constant need to jump between different apps or interfaces. For individuals juggling multiple token holdings, this creates a seamless experience. Whether it’s someone earning from freelance contracts in Ethereum and Solana or a digital artist getting paid in stablecoins across chains, the Qubetics wallet allows instant, secure, and self-custodial access to all assets in one secure dashboard. More importantly, the Qubetics wallet supports advanced features tailored for both retail users and enterprise scenarios. Businesses can integrate Qubetics to manage multi-chain token payments, while users can generate virtual cards for digital shopping, supported by integrated debit compatibility with systems like Visa, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. That means a user can use TICS tokens at physical or online retailers, with Qubetics’ instant stablecoin conversion protecting against volatility. This application not only enhances the digital finance experience—it bridges a major utility gap between crypto assets and fiat usability. These features show exactly why Qubetics is gaining recognition as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 . Qubetics Presale: Where Value and Strategy Align in the Best Crypto Presale to Buy for 2025 The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 35, offering $TICS at a price of $0.2785. In just a few weeks, it has surpassed $17.2 million in funds raised, with over 513 million tokens sold to date and more than 26,800 holders onboarded. Each stage lasts exactly seven days, concluding every Sunday at midnight, followed by a guaranteed 10% price increase. This systematic structure is attracting early buyers who are seeking predictability and potential upside. The Qubetics presale not only reflects strong participation metrics but also offers compelling ROI projections. Based on the current pricing, if $TICS reaches just $1 after listing, the return stands at 258.95%. At $5, the return hits 1,694.74%, while a $6 target results in 2,053.68%. Should $TICS climb to $10 after the mainnet launch, ROI jumps to 3,489.47%, and at $15, early buyers could see a remarkable 5,284.21% return. For instance, a $5,000 purchase now would yield 17,950 tokens. At a $10 valuation post-mainnet, that would translate into $179,500. These figures offer a clear value proposition for those looking to engage early in what’s being called one of the best crypto presale offerings currently available. SUI’s Price Targets Look Strong as DEX Metrics Hit $48 Billion The decentralized finance activity on the SUI network has picked up dramatically in recent weeks. Total DEX volume crossed $48.4 billion in the first half of 2025, surpassing major competitors like Avalanche and Polygon. The spike in activity, particularly daily volumes hitting above $400 million, is being attributed to rising engagement across SUI-native platforms like Suilend and NAVI. These protocols are driving liquidity and demonstrating that the SUI ecosystem is rapidly maturing beyond its early testnet narrative. What makes this more significant is the timing. SUI recently unlocked 88 million tokens, a move that would normally trigger price volatility. Yet, the token held its ground, suggesting that current market participants are anticipating higher valuations. Technicals now show a “golden cross” pattern and a bullish MACD crossover, both considered strong buy signals. Analysts are targeting a potential $5 breakout level, based on sustained DeFi traction and minimal unlock-related drawdowns. This signals growing market faith in SUI’s resilience and network strength. Cosmos Price Action Heats Up After 14% Jump and Wrapped Bitcoin Integration Cosmos is showing renewed strength following the integration of wrapped Bitcoin and a new cross-chain bridge. These enhancements are crucial as they elevate Cosmos’ interoperability functions, which have long been a core selling point of the project. With the ability to now transfer Bitcoin into the Cosmos ecosystem and use it within DeFi protocols, the user base and use cases are both expanding quickly. Price-wise, Cosmos (ATOM) is seeing strong momentum, rising by over 14% and currently trading above $5.04. Community sentiment is bullish, with over 38% of users expressing confidence in Cosmos’ direction. The launch of new bridge infrastructure also adds to Cosmos’ ability to act as a unifying hub in the broader blockchain space. With this new architecture, Cosmos is preparing for a next phase where multi-chain integration becomes the norm, not the exception. These changes signal that Cosmos is not just adapting to trends but setting the pace for what comes next in cross-chain utility. Institutional Tailwinds Could Push Qubetics, SUI, and Cosmos to New Highs The growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies—now underscored by institutional policy shifts like Texas’ proposed Bitcoin reserve—is likely to have broad ripple effects across serious crypto projects. For Qubetics, the current presale offers a unique advantage. Unlike listed tokens, its structured model—with fixed price increases every week—insulates it from short-term volatility and creates strategic entry points for participants. This mechanism gives early adopters a degree of predictability not commonly found in active markets. SUI and Cosmos also stand to benefit from these macroeconomic trends. Institutional involvement brings not only capital but also credibility, infrastructure, and clearer regulation, which are all needed to push DeFi and interoperability projects into mainstream application. For SUI, rising DeFi volume may attract more professional liquidity providers. Cosmos, with its new bridge and Bitcoin integration, now appeals to developers and users who prioritize network flexibility. These three projects, each from different angles, are all aligned to capture value from an industry moving toward structured, use-case-driven growth. Conclusion: Strategic Moves in a Changing Crypto Era The signs are clear—crypto is no longer a speculative space alone; it’s becoming infrastructure. Qubetics, SUI, and Cosmos are adapting to that shift in distinct ways. Qubetics is solving the interoperability puzzle with real-world wallet features and an on-ramp for early participation through what many are calling the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. SUI is proving its DeFi potential with record-breaking DEX volumes, while Cosmos is expanding cross-chain utility by linking Bitcoin into its ecosystem. The key takeaway? These aren’t hype-driven tokens—they’re ecosystems evolving with real application. As the market matures and states like Texas move toward crypto integration, the opportunity to join this best crypto presale might just be the smartest strategic move of 2025.

The news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, suggests a potential twist in the ongoing dialogue surrounding US EU tariffs . This development could signal a new phase in transatlantic trade relations, offering a glimpse into potential future economic strategies. What’s Behind the Latest Trump Tariffs Proposal? According to the report, Donald Trump indicated a willingness to consider delaying the imposition of tariffs on goods from the European Union. However, this consideration comes with a significant condition: European companies would need to begin moving their operations, or at least a portion of them, to the United States. This statement aligns with Trump’s previous ‘America First’ economic stance, prioritizing domestic manufacturing and job creation. Understanding Trump tariffs requires looking back at his previous term. Tariffs were frequently employed as a negotiation tool, aiming to pressure trading partners into revised agreements deemed more favorable to the U.S. economy. The potential delay on EU tariffs, therefore, appears to be less about softening his stance on trade balances and more about leveraging market access as an incentive for foreign direct investment and company relocation to American soil. This approach serves multiple potential objectives: Boosting Domestic Industry: Encouraging European manufacturers to set up shop in the U.S. could lead to the creation of new jobs and stimulate economic activity within the country. Strengthening Supply Chains: Bringing production onshore can help reduce reliance on overseas supply chains, a vulnerability highlighted by recent global disruptions. Gaining Leverage in Trade Talks: The offer itself becomes a bargaining chip in broader trade negotiations with the EU. Attracting Capital: Relocating companies bring investment in infrastructure, technology, and human capital. Understanding Company Relocation as a Strategic Tool The concept of company relocation as a response to trade policy is not new, but explicitly linking tariff relief to it is a direct application of economic pressure and incentive. For a European company, moving operations to the U.S. is a monumental decision involving substantial costs and logistical challenges. However, avoiding potentially steep US EU tariffs could provide a significant cost advantage when selling into the American market compared to competitors who continue to export from the EU. Consider the factors a European business would weigh: Benefits of Relocating to the US (Potential): Avoidance of potential future Trump tariffs on goods exported from the EU. Direct access to the large U.S. consumer market. Potential access to U.S. federal or state-level economic incentives (tax breaks, grants, infrastructure support). Closer proximity to U.S. suppliers or customers. Challenges of Relocating to the US: Significant upfront investment in facilities, equipment, and hiring. Navigating a new regulatory and legal environment. Logistical complexities of moving supply chains. Potential resistance from existing workforce in the EU. Risk of policy changes in the future that could negate the benefits. This offer essentially turns tariff policy into a catalyst for investment decisions. It’s a high-stakes proposition for businesses caught between potential export barriers and the significant undertaking of establishing a U.S. presence. The Stakes in US-EU Trade Negotiations Trump’s suggestion comes within the broader context of ongoing, and sometimes tense, trade negotiations between the United States and the European Union. While some tariff disputes were paused or addressed under the Biden administration, underlying disagreements on issues like digital services taxes, agricultural subsidies, and specific industry protections remain. This proposal could significantly alter the dynamics of these talks. The EU is a major trading partner for the U.S., and vice versa. Any widespread application of US EU tariffs would have substantial economic consequences for both sides, potentially disrupting established trade flows and supply chains built over decades. The EU’s reaction to such an explicit condition linking tariff relief to company relocation would be crucial. They might view it as an aggressive tactic aimed at undermining European economies by luring away businesses and jobs. This could lead to countermeasures or complicate other areas of transatlantic cooperation. Key Areas of US-EU Trade Friction: Issue US Position (Often) EU Position (Often) Digital Taxes Against taxes seen as targeting US tech firms. Seeking fair taxation of large digital companies. Agricultural Subsidies Criticizes EU subsidies as protectionist. Defends Common Agricultural Policy. Specific Tariffs (Steel, Aluminum, etc.) Uses national security justification. Views as protectionist, seeks removal or compensation. Regulatory Divergence Seeks alignment or mutual recognition. Maintains sovereign regulatory standards. This potential tariff-for-relocation offer adds a new, potentially contentious, element to this already complex relationship. Weighing the Economic Incentives for European Businesses Beyond simply avoiding Trump tariffs , European companies considering a move would be looking closely at the full package of economic incentives available in the United States. These incentives can vary significantly by state and locality, often including: State and local tax abatements or credits. Grants for job creation or training. Subsidized land or infrastructure development. Energy cost advantages (in some regions). Access to a large and diverse labor market. The attractiveness of these economic incentives must be weighed against the costs of disrupting existing operations, building new facilities, and potentially managing a bicultural workforce. For smaller or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the hurdle of such a significant relocation might be insurmountable, regardless of tariff threats or incentives. However, for large multinational corporations with significant U.S. market exposure, the long-term benefit of avoiding tariffs and establishing a strong U.S. manufacturing or operational base could outweigh the initial costs. This could be particularly true for industries that have historically faced, or are vulnerable to, high tariffs, such as automotive, machinery, or certain consumer goods. Navigating the Future of US EU Tariffs and Global Trade The suggestion of linking US EU tariffs directly to company relocation highlights a potential future direction for U.S. trade policy, focusing heavily on bringing manufacturing and jobs back to the country through a mix of protectionist threats and relocation incentives. This approach could have profound implications for global supply chains, international investment flows, and the future of trade negotiations . For investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space who monitor macroeconomic signals, shifts in major trade relationships like that between the US and EU are important. Increased trade tensions or significant supply chain restructuring can introduce volatility and uncertainty into traditional markets, which can sometimes correlate with or indirectly influence sentiment in digital asset markets. Actionable Insights: Businesses: Evaluate the potential impact of renewed tariff threats on your supply chain and market access. Explore the feasibility and potential benefits/costs of establishing a U.S. presence if your business heavily relies on exporting to the U.S. market. Investors: Pay attention to developments in US-EU trade relations as a potential factor influencing global economic stability and market sentiment. Understand that trade policy can impact corporate earnings, supply chain resilience, and inflation, all of which can have broader market effects. Policy Watchers: Monitor the discourse around trade policy and relocation incentives, as these could become central themes in future international economic relations. While this is currently a suggestion attributed to Donald Trump, it serves as a reminder that trade policy remains a powerful and potentially disruptive tool. The response from European leaders and businesses, as well as future political developments in the U.S., will determine whether this idea gains traction or remains a hypothetical negotiating position. Summary: Donald Trump’s reported suggestion to potentially delay US EU tariffs contingent on European company relocation to the U.S. represents a direct application of economic pressure and incentive within the realm of international trade negotiations . This approach, rooted in the ‘America First’ philosophy, aims to leverage market access to attract foreign investment and create domestic jobs through explicit economic incentives . While offering potential benefits like tariff avoidance and direct market access for relocating companies, the challenges are significant, including high costs and logistical complexities. The proposal underscores the ongoing tensions in US-EU trade relations and highlights how trade policy can be used as a strategic tool with potentially far-reaching impacts on global supply chains and economic geography. Monitoring these developments is crucial for businesses and investors navigating the interconnected global economy.

Dogecoin News: Wall Street Rumors, ETF Hopes, and a $5 Target DOGE is currently trading around $0.24, with crypto analysts seeing many bullish signals that might propel DOGE to a $5 price point. DOGE technical analysis identifies some important factors that support this bullish outlook. The monthly chart analysis indicates that the Dogecoin price may replicate the same technical setting that preceded its historic 2021 spike. The 20-month and 50-month moving averages are providing strong support, as they did during the previous bull run. The monthly Relative Strength Index remains very low, but there is a possibility for an upward climb. In prior cycles, the RSI hovered around 80 before the peak price arrived. In another Dogecoin news regarding the potential DOGE ETF, things have been a little confusing. The SEC has postponed its judgment until June, however, this does not mean that it will not be approved. The SEC filings plainly state that the delay is due to extra analysis. The Polymarket chances for the DOGE ETF clearance by the end of July are merely 15%, down 7% in the previous 24 hours. However, the odds in 2025 are 63%, indicating that investor trust is stronger in the latter months of 2025. Additionally, in the Dogecoin news, Bloomberg experts have made similar predictions. In a recent X post, James Seyffart stated that there is no conspiracy behind the DOGE ETF approval delays and that it is simply the SEC’s usual procedure.

The G20’s roadmap for cross-border payment improvements includes significant progress on cost reduction, speed, transparency, and access. According to research shared by crypto analyst SMQKE, the FPC document includes explicit support for accelerating ISO 20022 adoption and inter-industry collaboration with blockchain-focused companies such as Ripple and Stellar. A confidential 2025 report from the U.S. Faster Payments Council stated that for U.S. domestic payment providers to align with the G20’s cross-border payment objectives, they should accelerate the adoption of ISO 20022 and promote “inter-industry collaboration” with fintech… pic.twitter.com/TjRssXPptA — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 23, 2025 ISO 20022 Adoption and Real-Time Interoperability The document emphasizes that adopting the ISO 20022 messaging standard is central to creating more interoperable and structured global payment systems. The report states that ISO 20022 facilitates richer and more consistent messaging across financial institutions, which is key to supporting seamless cross-border payments. It further recommends that U.S. domestic providers align with SWIFT’s migration timelines to ISO 20022, ensuring compatibility with new infrastructure and legacy systems during the transition phase. In addition to ISO 20022 adoption, the report highlights the importance of interlinking domestic real-time payment systems with international networks. This is seen as essential for enabling the kind of 24/7, instant cross-border functionality envisioned in the G20 roadmap. Partnerships with organizations like The Clearing House (RTP) and the Federal Reserve’s FedNow service are cited as part of this broader objective to improve global payment system compatibility. Role of Blockchain and Digital Assets in Cost Reduction The FPC also identifies improved interoperability as a key enabler of more efficient cross-border transactions. It recommends the development and adoption of standardized APIs and more consistent infrastructure to facilitate better integration between domestic and international payment rails. A section of the report focused on reducing costs and increasing efficiency specifically mentions the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) as a mechanism to minimize intermediary costs. It references the G20 target of reducing the average cost of cross-border transactions to below 1%. These technologies, according to the FPC, are instrumental in eliminating unnecessary layers within the payment chain, thereby reducing delays and fees. Collaboration with Ripple and Stellar Highlighted In a portion of the report labeled “Promote Inter-Industry Collaboration,” the Council urges alignment with global financial technology initiatives. It recommends partnerships with innovative fintechs and startups working on cross-border solutions, specifically Ripple and Stellar. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These firms are widely associated with using XRP and XLM to facilitate digital asset transfers across jurisdictions. The mention of these companies in a confidential policy document indicates a growing institutional openness to incorporating blockchain-based settlement layers into traditional payment infrastructures. The FPC also stresses the need for transparency in pricing and settlement, calling for improvements through real-time tracking of cross-border payment statuses. This includes providing customers with visibility into fees, exchange rates, and delivery timelines. The report encourages using solutions like SWIFT GPI and blockchain analytics to enhance transparency. Regulatory Alignment and Financial Inclusion Another priority area covered in the document is financial inclusion. The FPC recommends expanding services to smaller financial institutions and non-bank providers to ensure that underserved communities can benefit from advancements in the cross-border payment ecosystem. Compliance and risk management are also addressed. The report points to the importance of adhering to global standards such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s AML guidelines and the European Union’s GDPR framework for data protection. Regulatory alignment is necessary to counter fraud, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities in global payments. Finally, the FPC underlines the importance of stakeholder engagement and education to drive adoption. It argues that the successful deployment of modernized cross-border systems will depend on clear communication of the benefits to end users and industry participants. Crypto researcher SMQKE, who publicized the findings, noted the explicit reference to Ripple and Stellar in connection with the G20 targets. This acknowledgment in a strategic document from a recognized U.S. payments authority lends further weight to the potential role of digital assets such as XRP and XLM in future cross-border frameworks.

The o3 Operator was fine-tuned with additional safety data for computer use and included safety datasets designed to teach the model decision boundaries. OpenAI upgraded the Operator in ChatGPT with a new Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model based on a version of OpenAI o3. With the new model, the Operator became more persistent and more accurate when interacting with the browser, improving the overall task success rate. It also delivers better-structured responses that are more clear and thorough. According to OpenAI , the new CUA model showed stronger performance relative to the industry, achieving SOTA on OSWorld and WebArena. It also showed stronger relative performance to the previous version, both in established benchmarks and human preference evaluations. OpenAI replaces the GPT‑4o-based model with a version based on o3 OpenAI hints at a big upgrade for ChatGPT Operator Agent pic.twitter.com/iGPQp9butD — SabatAge (@sabatage) May 22, 2025 OpenAI replaced the existing GPT‑4o-based model for Operator with a version based on OpenAI o3, although the API version will remain based on 4o. The AI firm also claimed that the o3 Operator uses the same multi-layered safety approach used for the 4o version. However, compared with other models in the o3 family, the o3 Operator was fine-tuned with additional safety data for computer use, including safety datasets designed to teach the model decision boundaries on confirmations and refusals. OpenAI released a technical report showing the o3 Operator’s performance on specific safety evaluations. Compared to the GPT-4o Operator model, the o3 Operator was less likely to refuse to perform “illicit” activities and search for sensitive personal data and less susceptible to a form of AI attack known as “prompt injection.” “o3 Operator uses the same multi-layered approach to safety that we used for the 4o version of Operator…Although the o3 Operator inherits o3’s coding capabilities, it does not have native access to a coding environment or Terminal.” – OpenAI The AI firm also disclosed that the new o3-based model went through standard safety evaluations, and Operator continued to be available as a research preview to ChatGPT Pro users globally. However, this upgraded model was only available in Operator in ChatGPT. Knoop suspects running OpenAI’s o3 model might be costlier than expected Last week, the Arc Prize Foundation, which maintains and administers ARC-AGI, updated its approximate computing costs for o3. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, cost around $3K to solve a single ARC-AGI problem. However, the Foundation now believes that the cost could be 10x higher than previously estimated, possibly around $30K per task. Also, while OpenAI has yet to price o3 or release it fully even, one of the co-founders of the Arc Prize Foundation, Mike Knoop, believes the o1-pro model pricing is a reasonable proxy and a closer comparison of the true cost of o3. He, however, added that o3 would continue to be labeled as a preview on the leaderboard to reflect the uncertainty until official pricing was announced. According to the Arc Prize Foundation, a high price for o3 high would not be out of the question, given the amount of computing resources the model reportedly uses. o3 high used 172x more computing than o3 low, the lowest-computing configuration of o3, to tackle ARC-AGI. Rumors have been flying since early March about the pricey plans OpenAI was considering introducing for enterprise customers. The information reported that the company may charge up to $20K per month for specialized AI “agents,” like software developer agents. However, while some argued that even OpenAI’s priciest models would cost well under what a typical human contractor or staffer would command, AI researcher Toby Ord pointed out that the models may not be as efficient. For instance, o3 high needed 1,024 attempts at each task in ARC-AGI to achieve its best score. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Investors are now asking if the Litecoin price could keep up with the hype of memes and utility-backed tokens like Unilabs . It is an AI-powered DeFi project that offers automated yield and access to early-stage trends. However, what are experts predicting about the Litecoin price this season? Let’s find out. Unilabs: The Next Big Thing in the DeFi Space? While the crypto market chases meme coin madness like Dogwifhat and debates whether the Litecoin price can break resistance, a far more advanced project is quietly gaining traction: Unilabs . This project already has over $30 million in AUM (Assets Under Management), which shows the investors’ strong interest. Another feature is the AI Market Pulse, which uses AI to scan thousands of on-chain and off-chain signals to detect market trends and price movements. This way, users can get into surging projects, like the LTC token, early and maximize their profit. Unilabs also provides a Meme coin Identification Tool, which uses AI to find the next meme projects that could moon like Dogwifhat once did. With it, investors can get into meme coins early without guesswork or relying on fake pumps. If someone is new to crypto, they can use the AI portfolio management tool to optimize their portfolio in real-time without actually looking at the charts all the time. It could potentially become the best way to passively grow a portfolio while protecting against downturns. Moreover, there’s also a Stablecoin Savings Account for investors who want risk free DeFi returns. This AI protocol is currently in stage 2 of presale and has already accumulated over $850,000 in no time. Each UNIL is worth $0.005 only which is the lowest entry point for smart investors. Litecoin Price Prediction: Can LTC Break $200 in 2026? At the time of writing, the Litecoin price is hovering around the $100 mark with a slight increase. On the monthly chart, the LTC token is impressively up by over 20% due to the overall market sentiment. Source: CoinMarketCap As for Litecoin’s price prediction, Changelly predicts it could reach a high of $208 in 2026. However, CoinCodex only predicts the LTC token to reach a maximum of $105 next year which shows varying analysis. The current technical analysis of the LTC token shows a strong buying sentiment based on moving averages. Rumors of a potential LTC ETF approval have also stirred the market but the SEC is delaying the proposal. Another reason that the Litecoin price is surging in the last 30 days is because of the adoption of a Litecoin Treasury Strategy by Luxxfolio. But, based on current market interest and not much positive movement in Litecoin’s price, most of the funds are moving into Unilabs. This is because of the unique AI features that it’s bringing to the DeFi space. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Meme Coin That’s More Than a Joke In a market that is flooded with meme coins, Dogwifhat has managed to carve out a unique space of its own. In the last 30 days, this token has surged by around 150% which shows the increasing interest in meme coins. The trading volume for Dogwifhat has also increased by over 120% to almost $1 billion in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Currently, Dogwifhat is trading between $1.00 and $1.20. In the last few days it has seen strong liquidity support and consistent interest from retail traders. However, in the long run meme coins might end up losing their value due to lack of utility. That’s why Unilabs is taking over the market with tools that could predict market trends using AI. Conclusion As the market debates whether the LTC token can reclaim its past glory or if meme coins like Dogwifhat can sustain their explosive momentum, a quieter contender, Unilabs is making serious waves beneath the surface. With its real-time AI tools, automated DeFi portfolios, Early Access Scoring System, and passive income strategies, Unilabs is building the infrastructure of tomorrow’s crypto investing. However, the public presale is selling out quickly which means it could be the last chance of getting UNIL tokens for the lowest price.

For businesses and investors operating in this space, one need stands out above all others: regulatory clarity. Recent comments from a key figure within the potential future administration signal a potential shift towards addressing this critical need. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly stated that companies dealing with digital assets deserve this much-needed clarity, indicating a focus area for a potential Trump administration. Why is Regulatory Clarity Crucial for Digital Assets? The current landscape for crypto regulation in the United States is often described as fragmented. Multiple agencies, including the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, and state regulators, have overlapping or sometimes conflicting jurisdictions and interpretations regarding various types of digital assets and related activities. This creates uncertainty for businesses, making it difficult to innovate, raise capital, and operate confidently within legal boundaries. Here are some key reasons why regulatory clarity crypto is essential: Fosters Innovation: Clear rules allow companies to build and develop new products and services without constant fear of falling afoul of undefined regulations. Protects Consumers and Investors: Well-defined regulations can establish standards for disclosure, security, and market integrity, reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation. Attracts Institutional Investment: Large financial institutions often require regulatory certainty before committing significant capital to a new asset class. Ensures Market Stability: Clear rules help create a more predictable and stable market environment. Promotes Global Competitiveness: Countries with clear regulatory frameworks can attract digital asset businesses and talent, positioning themselves as leaders in the space. What Has the US Treasury Secretary Said About Digital Assets? According to reports from Watcher Guru via X, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent conveyed a direct message regarding the administration’s perspective on the digital asset industry. His statement highlighted the belief that companies operating with digital assets are entitled to a clear understanding of the rules governing their activities. More significantly, he indicated that providing this clarity is a goal that the potential Trump administration is actively working towards. This statement, coming from the head of the US Treasury , is significant. The Treasury Department plays a crucial role in financial policy, including aspects of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), which are highly relevant to the digital asset space. While other agencies focus on securities or commodities aspects, the Treasury’s perspective on financial stability, illicit finance, and broader economic implications is vital for a comprehensive regulatory approach. Understanding the Challenges in Crypto Regulation Regulating digital assets is complex due to their inherent characteristics: Decentralization: Many digital assets operate on decentralized networks without a central authority, making traditional regulatory enforcement challenging. Novelty and Speed of Innovation: The technology and use cases evolve rapidly, often outpacing regulators’ ability to understand and classify them. Global Nature: Digital asset markets operate across borders, requiring international cooperation for effective regulation. Asset Classification: Determining whether a digital asset is a security, commodity, or something else entirely is a persistent legal and regulatory hurdle. Interconnectedness: The digital asset ecosystem includes various participants, from exchanges and custodians to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and stablecoin issuers, each presenting unique regulatory considerations. Navigating these complexities requires a thoughtful and informed approach, something that proponents of the industry hope the focus on regulatory clarity crypto will address. What Might a Potential Trump Administration’s Crypto Policy US Look Like? While Secretary Bessent’s comments provide a clear signal of intent regarding regulatory clarity, the specifics of a potential Trump administration’s crypto policy US are still developing. However, based on past statements and general approaches, several possibilities emerge: There might be an emphasis on: Streamlining Agency Efforts: Potentially seeking better coordination or clearer delineation of roles among regulatory bodies to reduce overlap and confusion. Focus on Innovation vs. Regulation Balance: Aiming for regulations that protect investors and national security interests without stifling technological advancement. Engagement with the Industry: Acknowledging the importance of dialogue with digital asset businesses to understand the technology and its implications. Addressing Illicit Finance: Continuing to prioritize efforts to prevent the use of digital assets for money laundering and other illegal activities, potentially through enhanced AML/CFT requirements. Potential Legislative Action: While administrative actions can provide some clarity, comprehensive and lasting crypto regulation may ultimately require new legislation from Congress. An administration focused on clarity might work with lawmakers to achieve this. The call for regulatory clarity crypto suggests a recognition that the current uncertainty is detrimental and that a more defined framework is necessary for the industry to mature responsibly. How Can Businesses and Investors Prepare? Even without full clarity, businesses and investors in the digital asset space can take steps to navigate the current environment and prepare for potential future changes in crypto policy US : Stay Informed: Continuously monitor regulatory developments, statements from officials like those at the US Treasury , and proposed legislation. Seek Legal Counsel: Engage with legal experts specializing in digital assets to understand current regulations and potential compliance requirements. Implement Robust Compliance Programs: Build strong internal policies and procedures, especially regarding AML/CFT, cybersecurity, and customer protection. Engage with Policymakers: Participate in industry associations and provide feedback to regulators and legislators to help shape informed policy. Understand the Technology: A deep understanding of the specific digital assets and protocols involved is crucial for assessing regulatory risks. The pursuit of regulatory clarity crypto is a positive sign, but navigating the path to achieving it requires proactive effort from all stakeholders. Conclusion: A Step Towards Stability for Digital Assets? U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments underscore a significant recognition within potential future leadership: the digital asset industry requires and deserves regulatory clarity. The current patchwork of rules creates hurdles for innovation and widespread adoption. By highlighting that the Trump administration is working towards providing this clarity, the statement offers a glimpse into a potential future where the framework for crypto regulation in the U.S. becomes more defined and predictable. Achieving comprehensive regulatory clarity crypto is not a simple task, given the technical complexity and global nature of digital assets . However, a focused effort from key bodies like the US Treasury is a necessary step. Businesses, investors, and policymakers must continue to engage constructively to build a regulatory environment that protects consumers and national interests while allowing the digital asset space to thrive responsibly under a clearer crypto policy US .

With this development expected to spark an overall market rally, the top three DeFi tokens to watch are the Solana coin, the Cardano coin and Unilabs (UNL) . Layer-1s like SOL and ADA are expected to ride the upcoming bullish wave and potentially surpass previous highs. UNIL, a novel AI-backed DeFi asset manager—the world’s first—shouldn’t be overlooked either. Currently in presale and with plenty of room to run as a low-cap coin, it could outperform top altcoins with large market caps. Unilabs (UNIL): A Top DeFi Crypto to Buy Alongside SOL and ADA Unilabs (UNL) isn’t a surprising addition to this list, especially from its fundamentals, growing community and upside potential. Backed by artificial intelligence, it will be the world’s first asset manager for cryptocurrencies. Amid impending adoption, the ongoing presale has surpassed $910,000 in early funding, highlighting its vibrant community. Described by industry experts as the future of finance, the Unilabs AI-powered Launchpad will employ real-time market data and machine learning to uncover emerging projects with standout fundamentals. It has over $30 million in AUM (assets under management) across AI Fund, BTC Fund, Mining Fund and RWA Fund, offering early-stage access to blockchain disruptors. Currently in presale—the second stage—the UNIL token has been listed among the best AI coins to invest in by analysts. As an emerging cryptocurrency, it has a higher upside than large-cap tokens like the Solana coin and Cardano coin, making it more attractive. Moreover, considering the historical outperformance of ICO investors, Unilabs might follow in the footsteps of successful ICOs like ETH and BNB. Solana (SOL): New Peak Soon? The Solana coin hit $180 this week, putting its monthly gain at 20%. With a bigger leap expected given current market conditions—BTC’s new ATHs—it is among the best DeFi tokens to invest in. In addition, moving averages like the 20-VWMA and 9-HMA give a strong buy signal, positioning SOL among the top altcoins to watch. Also contributing to its bullish outlook are the bold Solana price predictions making the rounds within the crypto community. BagsalotBTC, a leading crypto expert on X, expects a continuous uptrend toward $200 and $220. Ynk0x, another popular figure on Crypto Twitter (CT), sees the Solana price hitting $500 before the end of Q2. While ADA’s significant market cap may temper its upside potential, low-caps like Unilabs, an AI token with a small market size, present opportunities for more considerable growth. Cardano (ADA): Bulls Target $1 Next The Cardano coin reclaimed $0.8, hovering above the 10-day EMA and SMA. After flipping this level, next on the bulls’ radars might be a retest of $1—one of the top DeFi coins to buy this cycle. With BTC registering new peaks, the Cardano coin surpassing 2021’s all-time high of $3.10 isn’t out of the question. Down over 70% from the previous high, it is in an attractive buy zone—a good crypto to buy. Moreover, Michael Heckert sees the Cardano coin price soaring past $2 soon. Meanwhile, D_realMrBanana predicts a jump toward $20, which many believe to be an ambitious Cardano price prediction. While it has significant upside, UNIL attracting just a fraction of ADA’s market size will see early investors outperform, making it a better bet for substantial gains. Unilabs (UNIL): A Great Bet Alongside Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) Unilabs is a fundamentally strong emerging cryptocurrency positioned at the intersection of AI, DeFi and TradFi. Not only that. It has plenty of room to run as an emerging crypto—a better bet than large-cap tokens like the Solana coin and the Cardano coin. Aiming to capture a large share of traditional hedge fund capital, it is a new DeFi project to watch.

The latest bizarre showdown involves controversial US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and Grok AI , the chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI. While Grok has faced scrutiny for generating problematic content, Greene has leveled a surprising accusation against the AI chatbot : claiming it is too ‘left-leaning’. This peculiar clash highlights the complex and often contradictory narratives surrounding artificial intelligence in the public sphere, making it a noteworthy piece of AI news . Grok AI’s Recent Controversies Before diving into the political spat, it’s important to understand why Grok AI was already under fire. The AI chatbot , part of Elon Musk AI initiatives, recently experienced what was described as a ‘bug’. This technical glitch allegedly caused Grok to produce outputs that aligned with harmful conspiracy theories, even when the user prompts were unrelated to such topics. One notable instance involved Grok referencing the ‘white genocide’ conspiracy theory when discussing unrelated subjects concerning South Africa. Another concerning output saw Grok express skepticism regarding the historical death toll of the Holocaust, which was later attributed to a ‘programming error’ by the developers. These incidents raised significant questions about the safety, bias, and reliability of the Grok AI model, prompting concerns from users and AI safety advocates alike. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Unexpected Critique Given Grok AI ‘s recent outputs that arguably lean towards problematic or right-wing conspiracy narratives (like ‘white genocide’), one might expect criticism from the opposite end of the political spectrum. However, Marjorie Taylor Greene took a different approach. Despite Grok’s ‘buggy’ behavior that touched upon sensitive and often politicized topics, Greene declared that the AI chatbot was biased in the opposite direction. Writing on X (formerly Twitter), Greene stated, “Grok is left leaning and continues to spread fake news and propaganda.” This assertion came as a surprise to many observing Grok’s recent performance and the general perception of platforms associated with Elon Musk AI efforts. The Screenshot That Sparked the Claim To support her claim, Marjorie Taylor Greene shared a screenshot of a conversation with Grok AI . In this interaction, Grok provided a description of Greene, acknowledging her Christian faith and belief in Jesus. However, it also included nuanced points that seemingly troubled the Congresswoman. The AI chatbot noted that some Christians are reportedly ‘troubled’ by Greene’s support for conspiracy theories, specifically mentioning QAnon. Furthermore, Grok added, “Critics, including religious leaders, argue her actions contradict Christian values of love and unity, citing her defense of January 6 and divisive rhetoric.” It was this specific output, which included critical perspectives on her public actions, that Greene presented as evidence of Grok’s alleged ‘left-leaning’ bias. Analyzing the Disconnect: Grok AI vs. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Perception The core of this bizarre conflict lies in the apparent disconnect between Grok AI ‘s problematic, conspiracy-adjacent outputs and Marjorie Taylor Greene ‘s interpretation of it as ‘left-leaning’. One perspective is that Greene’s definition of ‘left-leaning’ AI simply means any AI that presents information or perspectives that are critical of her or align with mainstream criticisms she faces. The fact that Grok accurately reported on criticisms from religious leaders and others regarding her actions (like supporting QAnon or defending January 6) seems to be what triggered her reaction, rather than a comprehensive analysis of Grok’s overall biases or its recent ‘buggy’ outputs. This situation highlights the challenges in evaluating AI chatbot bias. Is bias defined by generating harmful conspiracy theories, or by presenting critical viewpoints on political figures? The incident underscores how users, especially those with strong political viewpoints, may interpret AI outputs through a highly subjective lens, focusing on how the AI reflects on them personally rather than its objective accuracy or potential for broader harm. Adding to the chaotic backdrop, X was reportedly experiencing significant outages around the same time, potentially linked to data center issues. While unrelated to the AI’s behavior, it contributed to a day of technical difficulties on the platform central to this particular piece of AI news . A Moment of Clarity Amidst the Controversy Despite the ironies and contradictions in her critique of Grok AI , Marjorie Taylor Greene did conclude her remarks with a point that resonated more broadly and serves as a valuable takeaway in the age of advanced AI. She wrote on X, “When people give up their own discernment, stop seeking the truth, and depend on AI to analyze information, they will be lost.” This statement, while perhaps inadvertently made in the context of defending herself against an AI chatbot ‘s critical summary, touches upon a crucial aspect of living with AI. As Elon Musk AI projects and others become more sophisticated, the responsibility of evaluating the information they provide remains with the user. AI models can hallucinate, perpetuate biases (intended or not), or simply misunderstand context. Relying on them blindly without critical thinking or seeking information from multiple sources is indeed risky. The strange fight between a prominent politician and an AI chatbot serves as a memorable, if peculiar, illustration of the ongoing challenges and debates surrounding AI in the public square, reminding us that discernment is more important than ever.

With crypto gaining more attention than ever, one term is popping up more and more: staking. At first glance, it seems like a simple way to get into the crypto world—steady rewards, low effort, and a quick path to make money. But is it really as simple as it seems? You might also like: The missing pieces of DeFi liquid staking | Opinion In fact, behind the promise of passive income lies a real maze of risks that even the most seasoned crypto investors could overlook. Slashing danger, hacking threats, and custody issues—these dangers may quickly turn what seems like a smooth ride into a financial “minefield.” So, let’s find out what staking really stands for, look closer at those dangers, and ultimately answer the question: Is staking a gateway or a trap? Staking 101: A perfect beginner’s shortcut? Staking is often compared to the crypto equivalent of a traditional bank deposit. Just like people might park their money in savings accounts to earn interest, staking lets them lock up their crypto assets in a blockchain network and earn rewards in return. In both cases, the idea is simple: put money to work and collect the rewards over time. But while the concept feels familiar, there are some key differences. As is known, traditional deposits are backed by banks and, in many countries, insured by the government, offering a very high level of security. In crypto, the rewards for staking are not guaranteed—if the network’s performance stumbles or if you are slashed for misbehaving (more on that later), your returns can go belly up, and your assets could end up at risk. Knowing these potential consequences, could staking seem beginner-friendly? Yes. The ease of the entire process is what makes it accessible for newcomers. In many ways, staking follows clear algorithms, similar to traditional finance. Imagine yourself as a newbie investor, just dipping your toes into crypto. You hear about staking from a friend who has already made a little profit. They tell you: “Just lock up crypto, sit back and watch the wallet grow. No need to study tokenomics, track charts, or foresee the next big trend.” An enticing way to park your assets, right? But the rabbit hole goes deeper than it first appears. Beneath the surface, staking carries some risks that could surprise beginners. Price volatility, penalties, and the hacking threat are the staking realities that can not be found in traditional bank accounts. The hidden cost of ‘easy’ rewards Price volatility could be the first curveball when it comes to staking. Since most rewards are paid in the same token you lock up, earnings are directly tied to market swings. You can earn a 10% a year reward, but what if the token’s value crashes by 40%? You are deep in red. Plus, many protocols require a lockup period, so in many cases, you will be stuck, watching your balance drain. Then, there is slashing. It is a penalty that can hit users if the validator they stake misbehaves or simply goes offline. It is not just a technical gimmick — it is a real financial risk. Depending on the network, users could lose anything from 0,1% to the entire stake. Fortunately, there are ways to minimize risks: Choose a blockchain that excludes slashing at all. Use reliable validators or staking providers—look for those with strong uptime and a solid security track record under the belt. If you run your own node, set up alerts, backups, and failover systems to make things run smoothly. Find out about the protocol’s rules: you need to know what counts as slashing before placing the assets. However, even if the validator plays by the rules, staking through third-party services could open the door to another danger: hacking. Remember the situation when the liquid restaking protocol Bedrock went through a serious exploit? It became a victim of a “security exploit” involving uniBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin token used in DeFI—that resulted in the loss of approximately $2 million in assets. So, it is a harsh reminder that flashy interfaces do not guarantee complete safety. Finally, let’s not write off threats coming from regulators. Governments, particularly in the EU, are tightening their grip on crypto, and platforms could be easily geo-blocked or shut down without warning. If you are staking through a provider that suddenly ends up on the wrong side of the law in your country—your funds may be frozen or even gone. Tron staking: Utility meets payback It is well-known that staking setups promise passive income, but staking on the Tron blockchain network is different. It offers something more hands-on: real utility. Instead of just earning yield, users can stake Tron ( TRX ) to process their own transactions, eliminating network fees entirely. Besides, unlike traditional staking models, Tron allows users to stake TRX in exchange for Energy & Bandwidth, which is usually needed to process transactions and smart contracts on the network. These resources renew every 24 hours, which contributes to the elimination of transaction fees. Yes, the passive yield from TRX staking can seem modest, typically being below 10% annually. But here is the twist: using those resources yourself means the possibility of reaching full payback within half a year or slightly more. That is the equivalent of a 171% return in saved fees over a year, far higher than most passive staking options offer. It is a really unique model, a kind of “PoS meets cost-efficiency” approach, one that few other blockchains provide today. Risky, but not impossible to tame Now, when it comes to staking, it is becoming clear: the rewards can be truly lucrative, but the risks are real. Volatility, penalties, hacking threats, and ever-evolving regulations are all part of this world. Still, it is not all doom and gloom. Staking, in its core essence, remains a viable option for crypto investors — it just requires a careful understanding of how the entire process works. All in all, I am sure that the risks can be managed if you are aware of potential pitfalls, take steps to secure assets, and choose reliable platforms only. In other words, staking has come a long way—\and with the right approach, it can be a rewarding experience.

The GENIUS Act and growing institutional interest are reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as a mainstream asset. While Bitcoin outlook remains strong, altcoins may face headwinds from high interest rates and macro uncertainty. Bitcoin’s breakout to a new all-time high is just the beginning, according to Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, the world’s second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume. In a market update shared Thursday, Jan projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. “Bitcoin’s climb to this all-time high underscores a transformative moment in the evolution of global finance,” Jan said, pointing to three main catalysts behind the rally, including regulatory clarity, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic pressure on the U.S. dollar. GENIUS Act Could Help Unlock Further Adoption Jan also noted the impact of the recently introduced GENIUS Act, which sets clearer rules for stablecoins. “This kind of regulation builds confidence and infrastructure,” he noted, helping to unlock further institutional adoption. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing steady inflows, signaling that institutional investors are viewing BTC as a serious asset class. “These products provide regulated access to Bitcoin, drawing in long-term capital,” he said. On the macro front, the weakening U.S. dollar is amplifying Bitcoin’s appeal as a global hedge. “Bitcoin’s inverse correlation to the dollar strengthens its role as digital gold,” Jan added. https://twitter.com/misterrcrypto/status/1926156439984238933 While optimistic on Bitcoin’s trajectory, Jan was cautious about altcoins. “Ethereum and other majors may follow BTC’s lead, but high interest rates and macro uncertainty could cap gains for smaller tokens,” he warned. With BTC hovering above $110,000, Bybit’s forecast of $125,000 by quarter’s end reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role in the evolving financial landscape. Bitcoin Could Hit $250K by End of 2025 Last week, crypto analyst Scott Melker said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Known for hosting The Wolf of All Streets podcast, Melker pointed to reduced volatility and deeper integration with traditional finance as catalysts for the next major rally. “$250K this year totally possible,” Melker said, noting that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped considerably. “It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” Likewise, Adam Back, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and CEO of Blockstream, believes that Bitcoin is significantly undervalued and could surge to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin during the current market cycle. In a recent interview, Back expressed surprise at Bitcoin’s current price level given the surge in institutional interest and major developments in the crypto landscape. Back argued the price does not yet reflect the full scope of bullish momentum building behind the asset. Meanwhile, according to Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy, Bitcoin’s recent price stagnation below the $150,000 mark can be attributed to short-term holders exiting the market . He added that Bitcoin is now finding its way into the hands of institutions and investors with a longer time horizon, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury strategies.

Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as top cryptocurrencies. Each offers unique strengths in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), in particular, is gaining traction with its presale, raising $9,200,000 and selling over 505 million tokens to 11,500 holders. Phase 5 is currently underway, with tokens priced at $0.03, a 200% jump from the opening phase’s $0.01. Investors are eyeing these altcoins for short-term and long-term gains. Let’s explore why these crypto coins spark interest and which coin to invest in for maximum returns. Dogecoin’s meme-driven momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) thrives on community zeal. Its price, now at $0.225, reflects a 1.9% daily gain despite a recent dip. Technical crypto charts show volatility at 12.82%, with a 50-day SMA of $0.184857. The 14-day RSI sits at 57.50, signaling neutral sentiment. Bollinger Bands indicate resistance at $0.2621 and support at $0.1576. Predictions suggest DOGE could hit $0.316082 in 2025, potentially reaching $1.37 by 2031. Its fanbase, active on social media, pushes for supply limits, fueling optimism. Yet, DOGE’s unlimited supply raises concerns about long-term stability. Investors seeking the next big crypto must weigh its hype against market unpredictability. This volatility paves the way for exploring more structured options like Ethereum. Ethereum’s bullish resilience Ethereum (ETH) remains a cornerstone in the crypto market. Despite a recent correction, its price hovers around $2,400, with analysts eyeing a $4,000 target in 2025. Crypto prices today show ETH’s 57.2% monthly return, backed by whale accumulation. On-chain data reveals large holders (10K–100K ETH) buying heavily, though some sold at a loss. Technical analysis, like the Ichimoku perspective, confirms ETH’s uptrend remains intact. Key support lies at $2,400, offering a buying zone. Ethereum’s strength lies in its ecosystem, supporting DeFi and smart contracts. However, its high price and volatility make it less accessible for some. This contrast highlights Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a fresh, affordable altcoin with unique utility. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in decentralized finance. Its presale, now in phase 5 at $0.03, guarantees a 100% ROI at launch, with a listing price of $0.06. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. Analysts predict a post-launch value of $2.50, offering a potential 8,233% ROI from the current price. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with updates to follow on social platforms. MUTM’s lending model allows users to borrow or lend assets like ETH, earning passive income via mtTokens. These tokens, like mtETH, accrue interest and are transferable across DeFi platforms. This utility drives demand, positioning MUTM as a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance’s buy pressure system Mutuum Finance (MUTM) incentivizes long-term holding through a buy-and-distribute mechanism. Platform revenue buys back MUTM tokens, redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This creates constant demand, stabilizing prices. Liquidity providers earn interest from dedicated pools, while borrowers use overcollateralized assets, ensuring low-risk transactions. For example, borrowing $5,000 in USDT requires $7,000 in ETH collateral. MUTM also launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. This feature boosts engagement and loyalty. Unlike DOGE’s volatility or ETH’s high entry cost, MUTM offers affordability and stability. Its structured tokenomics make it a standout in crypto investing. Mutuum Finance’s peer-to-peer edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces peer-to-peer lending, letting users negotiate terms directly. This feature supports assets like DOGE, absent from standard pools. The platform’s overcollateralized stablecoin, set to launch in 2025, enhances transparency. Unlike Ethereum’s complex ecosystem, MUTM simplifies DeFi access for newcomers. Its presale success, with 11,500 holders, reflects strong investor confidence. The $9,200,000 raised underscores its appeal as a new crypto coin. Compared to DOGE’s speculative swings, MUTM offers tangible utility. Its low entry price and predicted $2.50 post-launch value make it a compelling choice for those asking what crypto to buy now. Path to Profitable Picks Investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest in find DOGE, ETH, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) compelling. DOGE rides community hype but faces supply risks. Ethereum offers robust fundamentals yet demands a higher budget. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends affordability, utility, and high ROI potential. Its phase 5 presale at $0.03, with a guaranteed 100% return at launch, draws savvy investors. Crypto predictions favor MUTM’s $2.50 target, dwarfing DOGE and ETH’s growth prospects. For those eyeing the next crypto to explode, MUTM’s DeFi innovation and structured growth make it a top pick. Explore these options and invest wisely in the crypto market today.

The market expert points out that the token is acting a lot like it did before, and that has some traders watching closely. The setup is simple: repeat history, hit big targets, cash out along the way.

Then it cooled off for roughly six months. In its current run, XRP lagged around $0.50 through most of 2023 and into early 2024. After the US elections in November 2024, it shot up nearly 600%—from $0.50 to $3.40 by January 2025. Now it’s pulled back and is sitting still. That pattern looks a lot like what happened eight years ago. #XRP – Fib Circle & The Surge (1700% in just 60 Days!): If #XRP is repeating the last section or pattern from October 2017, we might be on the brink of a major breakout soon! 🔥 Back in October 2017, XRP took roughly 63 days to explode and set a new all-time high, skyrocketing… pic.twitter.com/hXJLv6M5Tr — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 23, 2025 Fibonacci Levels And Profit Marks Analyst Egrag Crypto pinpoints three clear price zones before the big $27 goal. First is $8.49 (the 1.272 Fib extension). Next sits at $13.79 (1.414 Fib). Finally, if the token truly repeats 2017’s second wave—a 1,772% surge—it would top out near $27. To get there in 60 days is a stretch. But the math lines up if history really does rhyme. Traders are being told to book gains along the way instead of waiting for that final number. Support Lines Hold The Key He also notes that XRP needs to stay above the 21-week exponential moving average. That line is around $2.30 right now. XRP trades at about $2.33, so it’s only just ahead. If price dips under that moving average, the bullish case starts to wobble. A drop below $2.30 could see sellers step in and push it back toward tougher floors, like the $2.00 zone or other support bands from on-chain data. 🚀 #XRP is about to enter one of the most important moments in its history.

For enthusiasts tracking the intersection of AI and technology, particularly within communities familiar with complex digital systems like those in cryptocurrency, the development of more sophisticated autonomous tools is key. OpenAI has just announced a major enhancement to one of its promising tools, the OpenAI Operator agent. The Core Upgrade: Moving to the OpenAI o3 Model OpenAI is making a notable change under the hood of its Operator agent. This agent is designed to function within a cloud-hosted virtual machine, capable of browsing the web and using software autonomously. Previously, Operator ran on a custom version of the GPT-4o model. The significant news is the transition to a model based on the o3 series, specifically designed for reasoning tasks. Why the switch? According to OpenAI, the o3 series models demonstrate superior performance on various benchmarks, particularly those involving complex math and intricate reasoning. This suggests the upgraded Operator should be more adept at understanding instructions and navigating digital environments effectively. OpenAI confirmed this in a blog post, stating, “We are replacing the existing GPT‑4o-based model for Operator with a version based on OpenAI o3.” It’s worth noting that the API version of Operator will continue to utilize the GPT-4o base for now. The Rise of the AI Agent Landscape This upgrade comes amidst a clear trend in the AI industry: the race to develop highly capable AI agents that can perform complex chores with minimal supervision. The goal is to create tools that can reliably execute multi-step tasks across digital platforms. OpenAI’s Operator is not alone in this space. Other major players are also fielding their own versions of autonomous agents: Google: Offers a “computer use” agent via its Gemini API, capable of web browsing and actions on behalf of users. They also have a consumer-focused tool called Mariner. Anthropic: Their models are also gaining the ability to perform computer tasks, such as opening files and navigating webpages. This competitive landscape is pushing innovation, with each company striving to build the most reliable and versatile AI Agent capable of complex AI Reasoning . Enhanced Safety Measures and Capabilities of o3 Operator The new model, dubbed o3 Operator, has undergone specific fine-tuning. OpenAI reports that it was “fine-tuned with additional safety data for computer use.” This included datasets specifically designed to teach the model OpenAI’s boundaries regarding confirmations and refusals for certain actions. OpenAI released a technical report detailing o3 Operator’s performance on safety evaluations. The report provides insights into how the new model handles sensitive situations: It uses the same multi-layered approach to safety as the previous version. The report indicates it is less likely to refuse performing “illicit” activities compared to the GPT-4o version. It is also less likely to refuse searching for sensitive personal data. However, the report also notes it is less susceptible to prompt injection attacks, a common method used to manipulate AI behavior. These findings highlight the ongoing challenge of balancing capability with safety in advanced Autonomous AI systems. While the model might be more robust against certain attacks, its reduced refusal rate for questionable tasks presents a new area for scrutiny and continued development. Despite inheriting the strong coding capabilities of the base o3 model, OpenAI clarifies that o3 Operator does not have native access to a coding environment or terminal, limiting its direct code execution abilities within its operational context. What This Means for Autonomous AI The upgrade to the OpenAI o3 Model for Operator signifies a step forward in building more capable and potentially more reliable Autonomous AI systems. Improved AI Reasoning is crucial for agents expected to perform tasks independently across dynamic digital environments. As these agents become more sophisticated, their potential applications grow, but so do the complexities surrounding their deployment, safety, and ethical use. The technical report’s findings underscore that developing agents capable of advanced AI Reasoning while remaining consistently safe and aligned with human intent is a continuous process with evolving challenges. Looking Ahead: The Future of AI Agents The competition among AI companies to build the best AI Agent is heating up. As models like OpenAI’s o3 become the foundation for these tools, we can expect to see agents capable of handling increasingly complex tasks. The focus on safety fine-tuning, as seen with o3 Operator, indicates that developers are actively trying to address the risks associated with giving AI more autonomy, though challenges remain. The development of powerful autonomous tools is a key area to watch, impacting everything from personal productivity to enterprise automation. Keeping informed about these core model upgrades is essential for understanding the trajectory of AI capabilities.

As major coins enter consolidation zones, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing accelerated demand, and many analysts are calling this the last major entry window before listings take price discovery public. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Accumulated by Institutions MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the few remaining presale tokens with both clear structure and strategic upside. With a fixed listing target of $0.007 and Stage 8 nearly complete, traders and institutions alike are viewing this as the last clean shot at early-cycle positioning. Key factors driving MAGA’s momentum: Projected 25x–35x growth from current levels, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside Distinct political narrative and identity-based branding Transparent tokenomics with a capped supply and imminent exchange visibility Record-breaking whale buys—including a single 72.95 ETH purchase worth over $133,000—confirming institutional-level interest For Bitcoin, XRP, and ETH holders looking for higher risk/reward ratios, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exactly what’s missing from the large caps right now: entry-level positioning with real upside potential. Bitcoin Holds Steady as Investors Hunt for Altcoin Multipliers Bitcoin (BTC) continues to maintain its dominance in the market, consolidating above $110,000 with strong support and institutional inflows. While ETF flows remain consistent and long-term targets still range between $115,000 and $150,000, BTC’s short-term movement has flattened. For this reason, many BTC holders are reallocating portions of their portfolios into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE to balance stability with speculative opportunity. Bitcoin builds confidence—MAGA builds exponential potential. XRP: Institutional Validation and Price Projections XRP is trading between $2.35 and $2.65, buoyed by regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and significant whale accumulation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if momentum persists. As XRP holders seek the next wave of upside, many are reallocating to pre-listing opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve hasn’t even begun. Ethereum: Bullish Structure and Rotating Capital Ethereum (ETH) is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technicals pointing to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900 if bullish sentiment holds. While Ethereum remains a core holding for DeFi and Web3, the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside and higher multiples. Chainlink: Steady but MAGA Steals the Spotlight Chainlink (LINK) is holding steady, with analysts projecting a range of $10.32–$16.47 in 2025. While LINK remains a dependable hold for oracle network exposure, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 10x–50x winner. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a secret—and with Stage 8 approaching completion, institutional investors and traders from all sides of the market are taking positions. Bitcoin holders are rotating small stacks. XRP and ETH communities are diversifying. LINK investors are looking for speed. Among all of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the final early-stage plays with structured ROI, clear timing, and high-conviction sentiment. This may be the last low-level entry before listings go live—and those watching closely are already making their move.

Just as a major crypto platform admitted contractors leaked user info, the United Kingdom unveiled strict new rules requiring firms to collect and report detailed personal data on every crypto transaction. Starting Jan. 1, 2026, crypto firms operating in the U.K. will be expected to keep tabs on just about everything — every customer, every transaction, every movement of crypto. It’s part of the U.K.’s effort to bring transparency — and accountability — to a space long accused of being a bit too shadowy for its own good. HM Revenue and Customs dropped the news in a May 14 statement , saying crypto firms will need to collect the full name, home address, date of birth, and tax identification numbers of all individual users. Entities like companies, partnerships, and charities are also in the spotlight, with requirements for legal business names, addresses, and company registration numbers. That includes every transaction, even those just moving crypto between wallets. The rules follow international standards but go further by applying them within the U.K., not just across borders. Firms will be expected to submit reports annually, and those that fall short could face fines of up to £300 (around $398) per user. Protecting consumers Authorities say the move is about protecting consumers and creating a more robust regulatory environment. But it’s also clearly aimed at closing tax loopholes and keeping pace with broader global standards, including the European MiCA regulation. As HMRC put it, firms should start preparing now — not in 2026 — to avoid a last-minute scramble. Mark Aruliah, head of EMEA policy at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, said in a commentary for crypto.news that the move is an “expected next step” for an industry maturing toward parity with traditional finance. “Reporting of personal transaction data has historically been a challenge for the industry and for consumers. This clarity on legal obligations to reporting will help and also the growth of new reporting services.” Mark Aruliah While Aruliah acknowledged the potential burden on smaller startups, he said the push toward transparency was not only necessary but overdue. “Any regulation is generally regarded as an additional cost burden to the industry but that has to be balanced against the benefits that it provides. Therefore, it may be that smaller firms are impacted disproportionately based purely on costs (i.e. due to their size and profits), but nevertheless, these obligations are an expected next step and simply look to match the general reporting obligations in the tradfi space.” Mark Aruliah But for many critics, the bigger question is not about collecting data. It’s about keeping it safe. Great responsibility That concern came into sharp focus as cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase recently confirmed a breach involving customer data. According to the U.S.-based crypto exchange, contractors working for Coinbase overseas were bribed by attackers who gained access to sensitive customer information. That included names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and in some cases, partial Social Security numbers. Some users have even reported that ID documents like passports and driver’s licenses were exposed. Coinbase said the breach affected less than 1% of its user base, though with nearly 9 million monthly active users, even that sliver represents a significant population. Worse still, it’s exactly the kind of personal data the U.K. now wants firms to collect and verify — and the breach raises urgent questions about whether crypto companies are equipped to handle such responsibility. You might also like: DOJ opens probe into Coinbase breach involving bribed overseas staff: report While Coinbase claims its internal systems caught the breach quickly, blockchain investigator ZachXBT has said signs of trouble were visible much earlier. Back in February, he flagged a string of scams tied to Coinbase’s infrastructure, including one victim who lost $850,000 after being duped by a fake Coinbase support agent. If the U.K.’s CARF-aligned rules were already in force, the firm could be staring down millions in fines, not to mention reputational damage that’s harder to quantify. Still, the juxtaposition is hard to ignore: the U.K. is telling crypto firms to hoard personal data, just as one of the world’s largest exchanges admits it failed to keep such data safe.

The sharp sell-off wiped out around $638 million in leveraged positions, as per data from Coinglass. Trump said that he is not going to make a deal with the EU but hinted that he might delay the tariffs if the EU builds factories in the US. Trump recommended a 50% tariff on EU goods starting June 1, 2025, unless the products are made in the U.S. The sharp move came after a period of low volatility, and Trump’s comments triggered panic across global markets. Top altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano were also hit hard as they dropped 3-6%. According to CoinGlass , nearly $350 million in crypto positions were liquidated in just 4 hours, with over $500 million wiped out in 24 hours. Crypto stocks also slid today as BTC Treasury companies like Microstrategy and Semler Scientific dropped around 6%. Japan’s Metaplanet fell even harder, down 24%. Despite Bitcoin hitting a fresh all-time high this week, crypto stocks did not keep up with the gains. Is Trump In a Tough Spot? Commenting on the big-picture market situation, The Kobeissi Letter said Trump is in a tough spot. If he pushes tariffs too hard, it could cause market trades to fall apart. But if he backs off too much, then the inflation expectations could rise again. Trump has to find a way to keep tariffs high enough to show strength but should also avoid pushing up treasury yields. And he has to do this without help from the Fed, which isn’t lowering interest rates yet. This Cycle Is Different, Say Analysts Analyst Benjamin Cowen says Bitcoin’s recent drop looks like the typical dip that follows a golden cross. He expects the pullback to last a few days with a possible bounce coming next week. Experts note that this crypto cycle is way more complex and different from the past ones. So, there’s no reason to expect the rest of it to follow the same old 4-year pattern. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe says that investors should stay open-minded over the next 1-2 years as the market could bring surprises. He believes that now, the chances are much higher of a longer cycle with Bitcoin possibly hitting $400K–$600K by 2026/2027 and altcoins climbing even higher.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 09:09:12

With fears of a U.S. recession rising by 43% and government debt ballooning, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is choosing to bet on expansion, not reductions. This approach may sound risky, but here’s the twist, it’s already showing some results. Let’s find out. Elon Musk’s Fix: Grow the Economy, Don’t Shrink It For decades, the go-to solution during economic trouble has been to cut government spending. But now, with the U.S. debt mounting and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jumping to 4.5% and recession odds climbing to 43%, Musk argues that this strategy is no longer enough Musk says improving productivity and expanding GDP are the only real ways to avoid national bankruptcy . He admits that government waste is a serious problem, but believes that strong reforms can still make a difference. And he’s not alone. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, once a firm supporter of spending cuts, now says the U.S. must “grow its way out” of the debt crisis. According to him, if the economy grows faster than the debt, it becomes possible to manage both. This change in thinking marks a huge turning point for U.S. economic policy. DOGE’s Progress So Far While Musk in the 2024 U.S. election campaign promised DOGE would save $2 trillion from government spending, which is one-third of the entire federal budget. As of May, it has already saved $170 billion, which is 17% of its $1 trillion goal and 8.5% of the “dream target.” The public can track DOGE’s progress through an official site, which also highlights which sectors are becoming more efficient. Bitcoin Drops After Trade War Warning After Donald Trump warned about new trade tariffs on Europe, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies quickly dropped. Eventually, Bitcoin has become very sensitive to what’s happening in politics. As these tensions rise, crypto prices are moving fast. Just recently, Bitcoin hit a record high above $112,000. But after the news, it dropped 2.7% and is now trading around $107,937 .",News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 09:09:46

According to the DOJ, the recovery was from schemes and ventures that exploited the growing interest of users in the industry. According to the DOJ, the move also underscores an aggressive push to restore trust and integrity across markets in the crypto industry. The order of forfeiture was made by United States District Court Judge Amir H. Ali, and announced by US Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, Chief John Lynch of the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice, and FBI Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy of the San Diego Field Office. United States DOJ wins order of forfeiture With the order , the United States government is expected to take charge of the assets, marking another effort by federal authorities to ensure the financial market remains with its integrity while protecting its participants from deception. The latest development also underscores the DOJ’s commitment to safeguarding legitimate investment activities in the digital asset industry. These schemes, often appearing to have an air of legitimacy, use different techniques and methods to lure crypto investors. While some of them use the promise of high returns, others use the promise of something bigger. For example, some platforms promise investors very high profits, using their inexperience to impress upon them to make the investments. These traders often part with huge funds as they seek to make profits from what they feel is a market that everybody is involved in. In some other cases , there are the issues of Ponzi schemes, where users are mandated to recruit other traders onto a platform for profits. What the platform does is that it uses funds from newer investors to pay older investors, carrying out the act until the team behind the platform is apprehended, or investors realize their activities. These activities and more have caused a dent in the trust that the general populace has in the crypto industry, and the DOJ and other agents involved in this forfeiture are trying to restore it. United States authorities promise to apprehend the criminals According to a statement by United States Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, the United States will continue to hold fraudsters responsible, regardless of where they are located. “Whether they are in our district’s streets or hiding behind a computer screen abroad, the United States will continue to hold fraudsters and grifters responsible, seize money they scam from hard-working Americans, and use our authority to compensate victims,” Pirro said. Stacey Moy of the San Diego Field Office also mentioned the harm that schemes like these have caused in the United States, noting that victims in every case have lost a devastating amount of money to these scammers under the pretext of changing their lives. “We hope today’s announcement brings a measure of justice to the victims and serves as a reminder, that the FBI will hold fraudsters accountable, no matter where they are located,” Moy added. In this case and others related to it, the United States uses asset forfeiture to punish and halt criminal activities. By doing this, they deprived criminals from acquiring proceeds of crime or assets obtained using the proceeds. It is also used to promote and enhance cooperation among federal and foreign law enforcement agencies, with the end goal of their cooperation being the recovery of stolen assets and the compensation of victims. Meanwhile, the DOJ has called out to members of the public who believe they are victims of cybercrime to contact the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center to report such crimes.

Amidst this excitement, a significant technical indicator, the ‘Golden Cross,’ has emerged, capturing the attention of major players like Fidelity Digital Assets. But what exactly does this mean for the future of Bitcoin’s price, and why is a specific price level so crucial? Understanding the Bitcoin Golden Cross and Its Significance In technical analysis, a Golden Cross is widely regarded as a strong bullish signal. It occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average. For Bitcoin, this pattern activated on April 7th, suggesting potential upward momentum. Why is this particular Bitcoin Golden Cross drawing so much focus? Because it often indicates a potential shift in market sentiment and can precede significant price rallies. However, the strength and validation of this signal often depend on subsequent price action. According to Chris Kuiper from Fidelity Digital Assets, the current Golden Cross could gain further strength and confirm its bullish implications if the Bitcoin price manages to hold above the $93,000 level. This $93,000 level likely represents a critical support zone, potentially aligning with key moving averages or previous resistance-turned-support levels. Maintaining the price above this threshold would reinforce the technical validity of the Golden Cross and suggest that the bullish trend has solid footing. Fidelity Digital Assets ‘ Perspective on the Market As a major player in the institutional crypto space, the insights from Fidelity Digital Assets carry significant weight. Chris Kuiper’s commentary highlights their analytical approach, combining technical indicators like the Golden Cross with fundamental drivers. Fidelity’s view isn’t just about the technical pattern; it’s also tied to key price levels. While the $93,000 mark is seen as crucial for validating the Golden Cross, Fidelity also views the $110,000 level as a potential ‘launchpad’ for further gains. This suggests that breaking and holding above $110,000 could trigger the next leg up in Bitcoin’s price discovery, potentially accelerating the upward trend indicated by the Golden Cross. The fact that an entity like Fidelity Digital Assets is publicly discussing these technical and price levels underscores the increasing institutional acceptance and analysis of the cryptocurrency market using traditional financial tools and metrics. Driving Forces: Crypto ETF Inflows and Institutional Appetite What’s fueling this optimistic outlook from institutions like Fidelity? A primary driver is the consistent and significant flow of capital into Bitcoin investment products, particularly Crypto ETF inflows . The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various markets has provided traditional investors with a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. These ETFs have seen steady and substantial inflows since their launch, absorbing a significant portion of the newly mined Bitcoin supply and even drawing from existing holdings. Key drivers behind these robust Crypto ETF inflows and the broader institutional appetite include: Inflation Hedge Narrative: Institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Digital Gold Status: The comparison to digital gold resonates with asset managers looking for alternative store-of-value assets. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets offers diversification benefits. Accessibility: ETFs and other regulated products simplify investment for large funds. Growing Ecosystem Maturity: Improved infrastructure, custody solutions, and regulatory clarity make institutional participation more feasible. While institutional interest and investment via avenues like ETFs are surging, it’s noteworthy, as U.Today reported, that retail participation has remained relatively limited compared to previous bull cycles. This dynamic suggests that the current rally is heavily institutionally driven, which can impact market structure and volatility differently than a retail-fueled surge. Analyzing Current Bitcoin Price Trends and Challenges Since the activation of the Golden Cross on April 7th, the Bitcoin price has seen a remarkable increase of approximately 33%. This powerful upward move propelled Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $111,814. However, like any volatile asset, Bitcoin experienced a pullback, dropping to around $108,622 at the time of the report. This recent dip was partially attributed to rising U.S.-EU trade tensions, illustrating how broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors can still influence the crypto market, even amidst strong underlying bullish trends. This highlights an inherent challenge for investors: navigating Bitcoin’s price movements requires not only understanding crypto-specific factors but also keeping an eye on the global economic landscape. Key price levels to watch based on the analysis include: $93,000: The crucial support level for validating the strength of the Golden Cross, according to Fidelity. $110,000: Identified by Fidelity as a potential launchpad for further upward movement. $111,814: The recent all-time high, which now serves as a resistance level to break through. The ability of the Bitcoin price to sustain itself above key technical and psychological levels will be critical in determining the short-to-medium term trajectory. The Road Ahead: Opportunities in Institutional Bitcoin Investment The increasing focus on Institutional Bitcoin investment is not just a current trend; it’s a fundamental shift that could shape the market for years to come. As more large funds and corporations allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, the market gains deeper liquidity and potentially reduced volatility over the long term (though short-term swings remain likely). For readers interested in this space, understanding the drivers and impact of Institutional Bitcoin investment is key. These large players often have longer investment horizons and perform extensive due diligence, which can lend credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. Their continued entry, facilitated by products like ETFs and the insights provided by firms like Fidelity Digital Assets, could provide sustained buying pressure independent of retail sentiment. While the path won’t be without its pullbacks and challenges, the structural change brought about by significant institutional adoption suggests a maturing market with potentially larger upside potential over time, supported by strong technical signals like a validated Golden Cross. Conclusion Fidelity Digital Assets’ focus on the Bitcoin Golden Cross and the critical $93,000 level underscores the growing intersection of traditional financial analysis and the cryptocurrency market. Coupled with robust ETF inflows and increasing institutional interest, the outlook appears bullish, contingent on Bitcoin holding key support levels. While recent price action has seen Bitcoin pull back slightly from its all-time high, the underlying drivers, particularly from the institutional side, remain strong. The $110,000 level is eyed as a potential catalyst for the next phase of growth. As the market evolves, monitoring both technical indicators and the flow of institutional capital will be essential for understanding Bitcoin’s future trajectory.

The authorities seized over $24 million in crypto tied to the operation, which is planned to be returned to the victims. The indictment on May 22, 2025, is a significant step by the U.S. authorities in their fight against ransomware attacks. This is part of a broader law enforcement campaign (like Operation Endgame) to target cybercriminals who have been using malware like Qakbot to infect systems worldwide, demand ransoms, and steal data and funds. The victims included a wide range of businesses, from small dental clinics in Los Angeles to tech companies in Nebraska, manufacturers in Wisconsin, and even real estate firms in Canada. U.S. and Allies Unite Against Cybercrime “The charges announced today exemplify the FBI’s commitment to relentlessly hold accountable individuals who target Americans and demand ransom, even when they live halfway across the world,” said Akil Davis, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. These moves are part of a global crackdown on cybercrime, with the U.S., France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, the U.K., and Canada working together to fight cybercrime, the statement read. Gallyamov’s Qakbot Malware Infected 700,000+ Computers Since 2008 Gallymov is accused of running the Qakbot malware operation since 2008, infecting over 700,000 computers worldwide and enabling major ransomware attacks like Conti, Black Basta, and REvil. Gallyamov was paid a portion of the ransoms that were received from victims. In August 2023, a U.S.-led international operation took down the Qakbot botnet, where the authorities seized over 170 Bitcoins and more than $4 million in USDT and USDC from Gallyamov. Even after this, he kept his cybercrime activity going by switching to new tactics like “spam bomb” attacks. He kept attacking systems as recently as January 2025 by flooding victims with emails, tricking employees into giving hackers access. As a result, under the “Operation Endgame”, the FBI seized another 30 Bitcoins and $700,000 in USDT from Gallyamov. The DOJ also filed a civil forfeiture case to permanently claim the $24+ million in total seized crypto, with plans to return the funds to the victims. If convicted, he would face a statutory maximum sentence of 25 years in federal prison. Tornado Cash Creator Also Under Federal Investigation This is just the latest move in the US’ big crackdown on Cybercrime. In December 2024, they charged Rostislav Panev, a Russian-Israeli hacker linked to LockBit ransomware, for creating malware that helped criminals hack networks and demand ransoms, with over $230,000 in crypto tied to him. In May 2025, 12 mostly young people were charged with running a $263 million crypto racketeering scheme. They used the stolen money to buy luxury jets and cars.

In a new video, Pal tells his 236,000 YouTube subscribers that the global money supply (Global M2) metric is “tightly correlated” to the price of Bitcoin. According to the macro guru, the global money supply metric is now suggesting that Bitcoin could go up by around 28% from the current level. “But at this point, it’s [the price of Bitcoin] really driven by liquidity. It gave us a three-month heads up to exactly the correction [of around $75,000 in April]. And yet Twitter said it’s about tariffs, it’s about the end of the world. It told you, it is telling you, and told you it would be at all-time highs. I told you it would be at all-time highs by May. It tells you we should be over $140,000 by July.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube Pal further says that the price of Bitcoin will at some point start rising faster than the increase in global money supply before trending in the opposite direction. “I also know it will decouple later in the cycle, and it will decouple to the upside with Bitcoin outperforming Global M2. That’s how it works when the crowd comes in, the herd gets FOMO (fear of missing out), they get greedy, and it actually starts outperforming. The,n when the market flips, it eventually starts to underperform as fear kicks in.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,350 at time of writing.

This rapid growth will be driven not only by the private sector but also by state-supported strategies. Following US President Donald Trump’s announcement in March that he would establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, bills aimed at converting confiscated Bitcoins into treasury assets have emerged in more than 20 states. If these initiatives, led by states such as New Hampshire and Arizona, become law, an additional $19 billion in capital flow into Bitcoin is expected.

This process is also expected to increase the number of publicly traded Bitcoin treasuries. Firms such as MicroStrategy are expected to add more than 1 million BTC to their portfolios in total. These companies are also expected to focus on Bitcoin-based yield strategies, such as lending and staking, by 2026, further increasing the interest of institutional investors. “We are entering a new era of Bitcoin adoption that is no longer driven by hype cycles, but by balance sheet fundamentals, sovereign strategies and long-term liabilities,” said Guillaume Girard, research director at UTXO Management. “Over the next 18 months, Bitcoin will solidify its place as a global store of value,” said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise. *This is not investment advice.

While much attention focuses on generative AI and large language models, advancements in specialized AI are also making significant waves. One such development comes from Microsoft, which has unveiled an AI model with impressive capabilities in forecasting atmospheric events. This development in Microsoft AI highlights the diverse applications of machine learning beyond traditional computing tasks. What is Microsoft’s Aurora AI? Microsoft’s latest contribution to the field of AI is a model named Aurora. According to a paper published in Nature and a company blog post, Aurora is designed for environmental forecasting. The tech giant claims this model can predict atmospheric events with greater precision and speed compared to traditional methods used in meteorology. Key aspects of the Aurora model: Extensive Training: Aurora was trained on over a million hours of diverse environmental data. This includes information from satellites, radar, weather stations, and various weather simulations and forecasts. Versatile Prediction: The model is capable of predicting a range of phenomena, including air quality, hurricanes, typhoons, and other weather-related events. Fine-Tuning Capability: Aurora can be fine-tuned with additional data to improve predictions for specific types of weather events or particular regions. How Does Aurora AI Weather Prediction Compare? The field of AI weather prediction is not new, with various research labs developing models over the years. Google DeepMind, for instance, has released models like WeatherNext, which they claim rival leading forecasting systems. Microsoft positions Aurora as a top performer in this competitive space. Aurora demonstrates its capabilities through specific examples: It reportedly predicted Typhoon Doksuri’s landfall in the Philippines four days in advance, surpassing some expert forecasts. The model outperformed the National Hurricane Center in forecasting five-day tropical cyclone tracks during the 2022-2023 season. Aurora successfully predicted the 2022 Iraq sandstorm, an event with significant environmental and health impacts. These examples suggest that Aurora AI represents a significant step forward in the accuracy and timeliness of weather forecasting. The Efficiency of Weather Forecasting AI One of the major advantages Microsoft highlights is the efficiency of running the Aurora model. While training required substantial computing resources, generating forecasts is remarkably fast. Consider the difference: Traditional systems often take hours to produce forecasts, relying on powerful supercomputers. Aurora can generate forecasts in seconds. This speed makes weather forecasting AI like Aurora highly practical for real-time applications and rapid updates, which are crucial during fast-changing weather conditions. Making Advanced AI Models Accessible Microsoft has taken steps to make Aurora accessible to the broader scientific community. The company has made the source code and model weights publicly available. This move encourages further research and development in the field of environmental AI. Furthermore, Microsoft is integrating this advanced technology into its consumer products. A specialized version of Aurora is being incorporated into the MSN Weather app. This integration will provide users with more accurate and timely hourly forecasts, including detailed cloud predictions, powered by these sophisticated AI models . Conclusion: A Promising Future for AI in Environmental Science Microsoft’s Aurora AI model represents a compelling advancement in the application of artificial intelligence to complex environmental challenges. Its ability to predict events like typhoons, air quality changes, and sandstorms with speed and accuracy holds immense potential for improving disaster preparedness, environmental monitoring, and daily life through better weather information. As AI technology continues to evolve, specialized models like Aurora demonstrate the power of machine learning to tackle real-world problems and offer valuable insights for researchers and the public alike. This development underscores the growing importance of AI across various scientific domains.

While seasoned investors continue to ask what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in for the next cycle, MUTM stands out for its ultra-low entry point, a strong DeFi narrative, and explosive growth potential. Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale offers tokens at a price of $0.03 per token. Acquisition by more than 11,000 presale buyers has produced a robust investor backing that has raised $9.1 million. Buyers of Mutuum Finance Phase tokens during this phase get 100% profit at the projected $0.06 launch price. As interest shifts from overbought giants to new crypto coins with room to run, analysts are eyeing a possible 50x rally for MUTM in 2025. Whether you’re building a long-term portfolio or looking for the next big crypto, Mutuum Finance could be the low-cap breakout that turns a modest investment into a fortune. Mutuum Finance Presale The project has surpassed a significant milestone as its presale accumulates more than $9.1 million from participants who have exceeded 11,000 in number. Since presale initiation the MUTM token value has increased to $0.03 and will steadily grow up to launch at $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with a Dual-Lending System Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending framework to enhance decentralized loans by meeting all requirements held by borrowers and lenders. The P2C system controls automated liquidity pools to modify interest rates which optimizes capital efficiency. Users can establish direct loan terms when intermediaries are eliminated by P2P model because this system represents a superior way of managing assets. Users benefit from increased security for transparent transactions while having the capability to choose either fixed or variable interest rates in the system. The platform establishes trust for users because it subjects itself to external audits and makes all its smart contracts available as open-source code with full visibility. Strategic Growth & Community Rewards The Mutuum Finance platform undergoes continuous success development because it employs a buyback strategy together with revenue sharing mechanisms within enduring economic frameworks. Future listings on exchanges will improve user accessibility while enhancing marketplace liquidity because of rising demand for this platform. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, eschewing the collapse risks which have plagued algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is run by open-source, third-party audited smart contracts by certik, laying a good foundation for user trust and institutional adoption. $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance rewards its users by distributing $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a ten-participant giveaway with each participant receiving $10,000 in tokens. The referral program accelerates organizational growth by offering bonus rewards which users receive for introducing new investors to the community. More than $9.1 million raised and over 11,000 presale participants highlight the strong momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 5 buyers are set to double their investment as the token price targets $0.06, while experts predict a possible 50x surge in 2025. This opportunity represents a rare chance to get in early on a project combining cutting-edge DeFi innovation, transparency, and sustainable growth strategies. Presale spots are rapidly filling up, and once the launch occurs, the chance to capitalize on these gains will vanish.

As ETH consolidates in the $2,400–$2,900 range and approaches $2,577, investors are closely watching for the next breakout. Yet, while Ethereum’s resilience is impressive, the spotlight is shifting to projects with even greater upside—most notably MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With Bitcoin and Stellar Lumens providing stability, these high-growth contenders are capturing the imagination of analysts and traders heading into summer 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Contender Redefining Early-Stage ROI While Ethereum and Bitcoin anchor the market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001, MAGA’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts are calling MAGA the standout contender of the year, with forecasts suggesting a conservative 35x gain and some models projecting up to 50x or even 18,500% upside if current momentum continues. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $130,000—highlights the conviction behind this early-stage gem, and with Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target on the horizon, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle winner. XRP: Breaking Barriers and Building Momentum XRP is holding steady around $2.37, consolidating after a strong rally and benefiting from regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and technical strength. Analysts are eyeing a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the short term, with some optimistic models even targeting $3.40 if bullish sentiment holds. Standard Chartered projects $5.50 by year-end, driven by ETF approvals and increased adoption, and some long-term forecasts suggest $10–$20 is possible by 2030 if Ripple’s global settlement infrastructure gains traction. While XRP’s upside is seen as steady rather than explosive, many investors are rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, asymmetric returns. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Unshakable Confidence Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $150,000 or more by year-end if momentum persists. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. For those seeking exponential returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are the new frontier. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Strength, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar Lumens (XLM) continues to serve as a reliable cross-border payments asset, maintaining steady adoption among fintech partners and remittance platforms. Trading near $0.11, XLM’s growth has lagged behind the more explosive moves seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is drawing capital from investors seeking the next 50x opportunity. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Ethereum’s climb to $2,577 is a testament to its resilience, but the most dramatic growth potential is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion, a $0.007 listing target, and analyst forecasts up to 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast. For those seeking the next breakout winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025.

The former Binance CEO took to blogging platform X to call out a recent article linking him to Trump-linked entities, particularly WLFI, regarding a stake in Binance US. In the post on X, Zhao mentioned that the WSJ article was filled with inaccuracies, calling it a “hit piece” filled with negative assumptions. The WSJ article portrayed his involvement in the decentralized finance project, one which he has criticized. The platform is backed by a business entity that has affiliations with United States President Donald Trump. Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Jr. are actively involved in managing the company. According to Zhao, the article emphasized his role as a “fixer” for the WLFI team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article also suggested that Zhao carried out introductions and meetings for WLFI leaders during foreign trips, including a recent visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official. Changpeng Zhao slams WSJ’s “hit piece” In his post on X, Zhao mentioned that he was not a fixer for anyone, denying the claims that he connected Pakistani officials Mr. Saqib with anyone from WLFI or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan,” he added. He also added that the WSJ submitted a list of questions that he described as wrong and negative assumptions. Another hit piece from Wall Street Journal. WSJ instead of doing journalism, has pretty much resorted to Cunningham’s Law, with negative intentions. ""Cunningham's Law: The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.""… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) May 23, 2025 Zhao and his public relations team have since pointed out several factual inaccuracies, concluding that the article was created with malicious intent. He also slammed WSJ, noting that it is acting as the mouthpiece for anti-crypto forces in the United States. He added that forces behind the publication want to hinder the push for the country to be the crypto capital of the world. “They want to attack crypto, global crypto leaders, and the pro-crypto administration,” CZ claimed, saying the article is part of a broader effort to stifle the industry’s growth in the US. This is not the first time that Zhao has slammed WSJ for what he describes as inaccurate reporting, with the former Binance CEO slamming its April 11 report where it said Zhao had agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun. The report added that the measure was a means to settle with US prosecutors, but Zhao slammed it, noting that government witnesses are always protected and don’t go to jail. He also added that someone within WSJ had received money to smear his name. WSJ report calls out CZ’s role in WLFI CZ’s response comes after a WSJ investigation, where the news outlet highlighted a string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLFI. The WSJ report had raised concerning questions about the blurred lines between public and private interests, focusing on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLFI co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son Zach Witkoff. Steve Witkoff currently serves as the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East under the Trump administration, while Zach Witkoff has been involved in some capacity at the company, including securing a $2 billion crypto deal. The report raised questions about whether diplomatic efforts are clashing with private crypto ventures, implying that Zhao may have been trying to gain favors in the sight of the Trump administration. The Binance man confirmed on May 6 that he was seeking pardon from the Trump administration concerning his earlier money laundering conviction. The report also mentioned that WLFI, which had raised over $600 million in token sales, has refused to disclose the names of all its investors aside from some publicly known entities like Tron founder Justin Sun, who was in attendance at the Trump meme coin dinner on May 22. The president hosted the dinner for the largest investors in his Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin. The event was graced by Sun, Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu, and BitMart CEO Sheldon Xia, among others.

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project. According to US law , the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison. Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance. When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.” Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinner Trump features presidential seal at private properties This isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties. Forbes has previously reported its use as golf markers at several Trump-owned clubs. In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Source: Molly Ploofkins Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump's dinner Trump embraces crypto despite previous skepticism Trump’s embrace of crypto marks a sharp turn from his skepticism during his first term. The $TRUMP memecoin, launched earlier this year, peaked at $74.34 before falling to $14.44 by May 22. High-profile guests at the dinner included Tron founder Justin Sun , ex-NBA player Lamar Odom, and Asian crypto executives Sangrok Oh and Vincent Liu. Sun, who reportedly invested over $40 million in $TRUMP tokens and spoke at the dinner, also has deep ties to Trump’s crypto ventures. He’s the top backer of World Liberty Financial, a Trump-affiliated firm currently under regulatory scrutiny.

This week has been a wild ride for investors and enthusiasts. Big headlines. Big consequences. We’ve seen it all – from political power plays to million-dollar scandals. All of these are powerful signals hinting at where the industry is really heading. So, if you blinked, you’ve missed a lot. We’ll dive into what happened these past few days and why it matters for you. Let’s go! #1 Trump’s $TRUMP Crypto Dinner Drama Justin Sun, the crypto billionaire who once dodged the US spotlight fearing arrest, stepped back into the limelight – this time as a VIP at Donald Trump’s exclusive gala dinner. Sun, proudly holding the biggest stash of Trump’s $TRUMP memecoin, showed up amid protests shouting “shame.” Trump himself took the stage, blaming the previous administration for making life miserable for crypto insiders, calling it a “disgrace.” Sun flashed over $1.3 million in $TRUMP holdings and a flashy “Trump Golden Tourbillion” watch. Predictably, Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren called it “an orgy of corruption”. Phew. #2 Sui’s $260M Crypto Heist: What Went Down? Sui’s largest decentralized exchange, Cetus Protocol, was hit with a $260 million hack that sent shockwaves through the SUI ecosystem. The attacker exploited fake tokens like BULLA to mess with liquidity pools and drain assets, including 12.9 million SUI and $60 million in USDC. They then tried laundering the loot by swapping a big chunk of USDC for 21,938 ETH. Cetus jumped on damage control, pausing smart contracts and launching a full probe. Meanwhile, SUI’s price took a hit, dropping about 15% to $3.90. The scramble is on to recover funds and shore up security. #3 GENIUS Act (Finally) Breaks Ground in Stablecoin Law The U.S. Senate just cleared a major hurdle by advancing the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 vote – the first stablecoin bill to make it this far. This bipartisan win came after last-minute tweaks and pressure from crypto advocates like Stand With Crypto. The bill lets private firms issue stablecoins and demands full backing with dollars or Treasury bills. While it bars foreign stablecoins on U.S. centralized exchanges, decentralized platforms remain untouched. Critics say the revisions are mostly cosmetic, leaving loopholes like weak data safeguards and possible regulatory capture. Big moves, but is it enough? #4 Pi Network’s $8M Scam: Pump, Dump, and Investor Fury! Pi Network is under fire with explosive $8 billion scam allegations after insiders reportedly dumped 12 million PI tokens. Blockchain sleuth Atlas points to a classic pump-and-dump move – sharp price surges followed by a brutal 50% crash post-May 14. Despite a bullish spike fueled by an 86 million token withdrawal from OKX (hinting at strong holder confidence), the price has since slumped to $0.79. The project also battles criticism over exchange listings, token distribution, and node centralization, raising serious questions about its future. Is it the end of the road for Pi? I hope not. #5 Blum Co-Founder Detained in Russia Big news out of Russia – Vladimir Smerkis, co-founder of the Telegram-based crypto project Blum and former head of Binance Russia, has been arrested in Moscow on large-scale fraud suspicions. The heat comes from his previous ventures, The Token Fund and Tokenbox, where investors reportedly lost around $15 million. While the investigation is ongoing and no formal charges are out yet, Russian courts have approved his detention. Blum quickly clarified that Smerkis resigned and is no longer connected to the project, distancing themselves from the scandal. #6 Cardano CEO Fires Back at $600M Allegations Charles Hoskinson is pushing back hard against claims he misused $600 million worth of ADA tokens. The drama centers on accusations that during Cardano’s 2021 Allegra hard fork, Hoskinson used a “genesis key” to control 619 million ADA. But he says most of the 350 million ADA involved were already redeemed over seven years, with the leftovers donated to Intersect, a Cardano-affiliated org. Feeling “deeply hurt” by the distrust, Hoskinson plans to release an audit report and might hand over his social channels to a media team to clear the air. #7 Nasdaq Welcomes First Ever XRP Futures ETF The wait is over – XRP stepped into the ETF spotlight with the launch of Volatility Shares’ XRPI ETF, trading on Nasdaq. This 1x XRP futures ETF offers a safer, measured way to access Ripple’s price action without holding the token directly. Analyst Eric Balchunas called it a “good signal” of growing demand for crypto investment vehicles. With leveraged XRP ETFs already firing up interest and CME’s recent XRP futures rollout, XRPI marks a new phase in XRP’s journey. I’m loving this one! #8 MSTR Holdings Surge as States Seek Bitcoin Proxy 14 US states revealed a collective $632 million stake in MicroStrategy (MSTR) during Q1 2025, marking a 42% jump from the previous quarter. California leads with $276 million, followed by Florida and North Carolina. Utah’s holdings skyrocketed 184%, while Wisconsin sold its $300 million Bitcoin ETF stake, increasing MSTR instead. This shows states prefer indirect Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy’s massive 576,230 BTC stash, avoiding direct crypto ownership complexities. #9 Who’s Buying USDC? Circle’s Next Move Circle, the powerhouse behind USDC, is stirring the pot with a $5 billion valuation price tag as it entertains acquisition talks. Ripple and Coinbase have both stepped into the ring, but Circle shot down Ripple’s XRP-heavy bid, citing concerns over liquidity and valuation mechanics. Meanwhile, talks with Coinbase are reportedly friendlier – “If Coinbase wanted to buy them, Circle would sell in a second,” insiders say. Despite these moves, Circle’s IPO ambitions remain alive but shaky, as broader market volatility and trade policies push the company to rethink timing. Big questions loom over USDC’s future path. #10 Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Passed Texas just got one step closer to becoming America’s Bitcoin bull state. Senate Bill 21 – which would establish a state-run Bitcoin Reserve – passed its final House vote, clearing 101-42. All that’s left is Governor Abbott’s signature, and the signs are strong. He even shared the proposal on X, and crypto voices like Kyle Chassé are already calling it: “It’s happening.” If Abbott signs before the June 2 deadline, Texas will follow New Hampshire as the second U.S. state with its own BTC stash. Trump’s vision is shaping up quite well. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! HSBC Goes Live with Tokenized Deposits: HSBC has officially launched its Tokenised Deposit Service in Hong Kong, enabling 24/7 fund transfers using blockchain tech. Ant International led the charge as the first client to go live. A Wall Street Stablecoin? Yep, It’s Being Discussed: Some of the biggest U.S. banks – including JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo – are reportedly discussing a joint stablecoin venture, according to WSJ. Early talks, but major implications if it lands. Crypto Meets Stocks, Powered by USDT: Bybit just launched stock trading with USDT via Metatrader 5, giving users access to Apple, Tesla, gold, forex, and crypto from one account. Multi-market action at its best. CZ Slams Trump Crypto Allegations: CZ has slammed the Wall Street Journal for linking him to Trump-backed crypto dealings, calling the report a “hit piece.” He flatly denied acting as a “fixer” or brokering any WLF meetings. Semler Bets the House on Bitcoin: Semler Scientific just dropped $50M on Bitcoin, boosting its stash to over 4,264 BTC. With losses mounting and a crypto-first strategy now official, this healthcare firm is betting big again. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead With Texas and other U.S. states doubling down on MicroStrategy and BTC reserves, expect a growing wave of state-led crypto strategies. A formal Bitcoin reserve could become a blueprint for other red states, especially under pro-crypto leadership. The launch of the XRPI ETF on Nasdaq signals that altcoin futures ETFs are gaining traction. With CME backing XRP and Ethereum products next in line, this could bring mainstream capital to major alts fast. The GENIUS Act may have passed its Senate hurdle, but its foreign token ban and loose guardrails could trigger lawsuits, revisions, or even state-level pushback. Keep an eye on regulation updates to predict how the market might react. Crypto never sleeps, and neither do we – catch you next week with the hottest moves and biggest surprises.

The broader price structure remains trapped within a mid-range channel, and bulls are now looking for technical confirmation of a local bottom near the $0.36–$0.37 demand zone. However, momentum indicators show signs of fatigue, suggesting any bounce may face immediate overhead friction from recent breakdown levels. What’s Happening With Ethena (ENA)’s Price? Ethena (ENA) price analysis (Source: TradingView) The Ethena (ENA) price action this week has been marked by high volatility. After a failed breakout above the $0.42 resistance, ENA reversed sharply, plunging over 12% within 24 hours. This decline not only breached its short-term ascending trendline but also sliced below the 20 and 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart, dragging the asset into a bearish short-term setup. Currently, the price is consolidating between $0.36 and $0.38, a zone that aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level and also sits near the lower Bollinger Band.

Gold is often used as a signal in crypto circles, where a rise in gold prices often leads to a rise in crypto prices. Thus far, the trend has held. However, the percentage gains in the price of gold now, and in the coming weeks, pale in comparison to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is projected to offer a return of three times or higher in just the next few weeks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is A Better Buy Than Gold Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a new class of assets that promise to offer long-term and sustainable returns within the crypto sector. Unlike meme coins, which often lose value quite fast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating the future of finance through an ecosystem that offers mutual benefits to all participants. The main driver of this growth will be the genius Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending protocol that offers two different modes of lending. In one mode, called peer to peer (P2P), lenders can enter direct negotiations with borrowers. In the second mode called peer to contract (P2C), lenders deposit their assets in a pool, secured by an audited smart contract. These pooled assets can be accessed by borrowers using overcollateralized collateral. The yield that lenders receive from their assets is dynamically determined by market forces. For instance, when pool utilization rises, the yields increase, which prompts more people to deposit their assets. However, this also discourages borrowers from putting up their collateral to acquire loans. This push and pull in the dynamic yield rate ensures a middle ground is achieved for market efficiency. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stablecoin Is The Future Decentralized stablecoins have had mixed results in the past, despite their great promise to revolutionize the world of stablecoins. The solution provided by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could perfectly deal with the limitations of all other existing solutions. One of the notable aspects of the Mutuum Finance stablecoin is that borrowers provide liquidity. When they borrow the stablecoin via overcollateralized loans, the interest they pay flows into the revenue mechanism, helping to stabilize the entire system. The price of the stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar. Consequently, it offers borrowers a great opportunity to tap into the full potential of their assets, without having to liquidate them. As a result, during a bull run like the current one, they can still get the benefits of their value appreciation. A noteworthy aspect of the stablecoin is that it will feature multi-asset collateralization. In short, borrowers will be able to deposit a series of approved asset types and receive stablecoins in return. This is a more efficient model than the one currently used on most DeFi stablecoins. The existing solutions rely on single assets vaults, where each collateral type supports a separate position. With the ability to back a single position with a basket of assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has diversified the asset backing of its stablecoin, which is great for the long health of the ecosystem. Stability for the stablecoin’s pegged price is maintained through arbitrage. In this system, borrowers can buy or sell their positions to benefit from changes in price to the stablecoin. Over the long-term it ensures a smooth curve in the price fluctuation, which will closely mirror the price of the dollar. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Signals Strength The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in the fifth stage. Thus far, the token has managed to raise over $9,1 million, which provides plenty of room for development of a robust ecosystem. It will be the shining jewel of Decentralized finance (DeFi) once it launches. The project aims to reshape DeFi and open up capital access that has remained inaccessible to many in the crypto space. This vision is already resonating with the community, as shown by the strong support from over 11,000 holders to date. At the going price of $0.03 per token, this is truly a bargain, especially against the backdrop of the ongoing crypto market rally. In just a few days, the phase 5 presale will be complete, and the price will rise over 16% to $0.035 per token. As such, getting into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now could help you outperform the gold market in the coming weeks on listing day.

The spotlight is shifting toward altcoins with asymmetric upside—and smart money is zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano as the breakout contenders for 2025, while Ethereum and XRP remain core holdings for stability and long-term growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Standout With Explosive Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly ascending from under-the-radar presale to headline contender. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion, MAGA’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—has become a magnet for both retail and institutional capital. Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum holds. A recent $132,000+ whale buy highlights the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential, and with a $0.007 listing target and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Cardano: Technological Progress and Institutional Momentum Cardano (ADA) is making headlines with its breakout above $0.80, driven by technological innovation and expanding DeFi adoption. Analysts see potential for ADA to reach as high as $5.66 in 2025, citing upgrades like Hydra and growing institutional interest as key drivers. Cardano’s scientific approach and robust ecosystem are earning it a spot in the portfolios of forward-looking investors. As capital rotates into high-upside plays, many ADA holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to maximize portfolio growth. This strategic shift underscores the appetite for early-stage opportunities with exponential potential. Bitcoin: Institutional Adoption Fuels the Next Rotation Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000 is powered by unprecedented institutional inflows and spot ETF demand, with projections of $118,000–$131,000 in the near term and $200,000 as a plausible target for 2025. While BTC remains the benchmark for digital assets, its ROI potential is now more modest compared to emerging altcoins. As Bitcoin’s rally stabilizes, a growing share of capital is rotating toward high-multiple opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for growth-focused investors. Ethereum and XRP: Steady Anchors, But MAGA Steals the Show Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade between $2,500 and $2,600, anchoring DeFi and Web3 innovation. While ETH’s momentum has moderated, its upgrade cycle and institutional adoption keep it a portfolio mainstay. XRP is holding near $2.40–$2.65, buoyed by whale accumulation, ETF speculation, and regulatory clarity. Although both assets offer stability, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where analysts see a 13,000%–18,500% window for exponential returns. NEAR: Quiet Growth Amid the Rotation NEAR Protocol is quietly gaining traction, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 10x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion The 2025 crypto cycle is defined by a decisive shift in capital allocation. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP provide a stable foundation, the real excitement is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—where early-stage momentum and technological progress are driving the next wave of portfolio rotations. With Stage 8 of MAGA’s presale nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers, smart money is already positioning for what could be the most transformative altcoin run of the year.

45040714,https://invezz.com/?p=2731783,1748085000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Could this new DeFi token revolutionize the financial world,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/24/could-this-new-defi-token-revolutionize-the-financial-world/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most revolutionary DeFi projects of 2025. Still in the presale phase, it has grown into a juggernaut that is pulling in investors from all other major projects, such as XRP and Solana. So far, the project has attracted nearly 11,000 investors and over $9 million in funding, which will act as the fuel that takes it to the next level. The presale is currently in phase 5, with each token going for $0.03. This marks a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. However, even those who invest $1000 in the project right now are guaranteed a 100% return, with the listing price set at $0.06. Driven by the crypto market’s demand for utility, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hitting milestones way ahead of schedule, and after the final pre-sale phase, the token is expected to go live on some big crypto exchanges. Will Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 10X in value? The short answer is yes; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most valuable DeFi projects in recent memory. A major driver of this growth is the project’s utility, which promises to create numerous opportunities for investors to earn passive income from their assets. For instance, a user can deposit $8,000 worth of ETH and then sit back as their investment earns an annual percentage yield. The yield from each pool will be determined automatically by the utilization rate, which will ensure that investors get the most out of their earnings. Best of all, once they are ready to withdraw, they will get back the interest accrued plus all their initial capital. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from other existing DeFi projects is that lenders also get a share of the platform’s revenue. This is done through a simple process of buy back and return, where revenue is used to buy MUTM tokens from the market, and send them to lenders. The effect is that it increases the value of MUTM tokens on the open market, while also incentivizing new participants to join the ecosystem. Based on this massive utility, it is quite easy to see how MUTM tokens could see a 10X increase in value just a few days after launch. That means that a $1000 investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could turn into $10,000 in just a few weeks, or even days. Currently, even Bitcoin (BTC) cannot offer such returns. The reason for this is that Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at the top of the market, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) buyers will be getting in on the ground floor. Like the original Bitcoin (BTC) buyers who bought the tokens back in 2010 when they were worth just a few dollars, Mutuum Finance (MTM) has the potential to increase in value by 1000% in just a few weeks after launch. Join the $100K giveaway During the ongoing presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a giveaway during which they plan to reward their community with $100K worth of MUTM tokens. These tokens will be split amongst 10 winners, with each getting $10K. To get these rewards, you submit your wallet address, complete the simple quiz, and follow all steps to win the tokens. To be part of this giveaway, you will need to participate in the presale with at least $50 in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. For most investors in the presale, this is a shoo-in, as most have invested $1000 or more to maximize the possible returns when the project goes live. While there are many crypto projects to choose from, few offer the same level of utility and guaranteed returns as those available via Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with the added benefit of a potential $10K win, there is no reason to be left out of this opportunity.

The whale, who deposited a total of 30.5 million USDC into Hyperliquid in the last 23 days, currently has only $6.98 million left on the platform.

33767162,[object Object],1748085535,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Watch as Banks Enter Crypto and DeFi Surges,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-watch-as-banks-enter-crypto-and-defi-surges/,"The crypto space has never been more exciting, especially with news circulating about traditional financial giants like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo possibly launching a joint stablecoin. This could be a game-changer, but it’s not just stablecoins that deserve your attention. Altcoins continue to be the driving force behind innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.In fact, many of the best altcoins of 2025 are looking to capitalize on the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and new technologies. As big banks consider entering the crypto space, it’s important to look beyond the headlines and focus on the smaller, yet powerful projects making waves. In this article, we’ll highlight three exciting new crypto projects that have the potential to change the game in the world of altcoins. The Big Picture: Traditional Banks Eye Crypto, But Altcoins Lead the Way The world of cryptocurrency is undergoing a major shift, with some of the biggest traditional financial institutions – JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo – reportedly considering a joint stablecoin launch. This is a significant development, as these major players in banking have largely stayed on the sidelines, hesitant to fully embrace crypto. Stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer a sense of stability in the otherwise volatile crypto market. With these financial giants moving into the space, they may appeal to both retail and institutional investors seeking safer, less volatile options. However, while stablecoins may offer short-term stability, the true innovation in blockchain lies within altcoins. These projects are pushing the boundaries of what decentralized finance can achieve, from tokenizing real-world assets to enabling decentralized exchanges. Investors are flocking to protocols that offer speed, transparency, and liquidity, which are solving long-standing issues in traditional finance. As financial institutions look to enter the crypto space, altcoins are already leading the charge, proving that the future of digital finance is decentralized. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Unlocking Future Growth with Innovation and Security Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is revolutionizing digital wallet management with a user-friendly platform that supports multiple cryptocurrencies, cross-chain transfers, and top-tier security powered by Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology. Unlike traditional wallets, Best Wallet is designed for both newcomers and experienced investors, making crypto management easy and secure. Priced at $0.025075, $BEST raised over $12.6M during its presale, signaling strong investor confidence.As major financial institutions like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo explore stablecoin initiatives, the decentralized wallet and token space is gaining traction. With a forecasted price of $0.62 by 2026, $BEST could see a significant 2,372% increase from its current value. If you staked $1,000 worth of $BEST today, at a 15% annual percentage yield (APY), you could accumulate additional tokens throughout the year. By 2026, with $BEST priced at $0.62, your total investment could be worth $3,174 – a potential profit of $2,174. Token buyers also enjoy reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects, and benefits in Best Wallet’s iGaming partnerships. As Best Wallet continues to disrupt the market with innovative features, $BEST offers significant long-term growth potential — making it one of the most promising altcoins to watch in 2025. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Tokenizing Real-World Assets for Blockchain Innovation SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is transforming the creator economy by tokenizing real-world assets such as real estate and commodities, allowing people to buy, sell, and trade them as digital assets. This approach makes traditionally illiquid markets more accessible and efficient, bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional finance. Beyond tokenization, $SUBBD leverages AI to empower creators, offering tools to automate chat, editing, and monetization, helping them scale content with ease. People can also generate AI-driven photos and videos, which are approved by creators, creating new revenue streams. With over 250M combined followers across its ecosystem, $SUBBD is poised to onboard a large user base to its platform. The project raised nearly $500K during its presale, and you can buy $SUBBD right now for $0.055475. As financial institutions explore stablecoin initiatives, the decentralized content and asset tokenization space is gaining significant momentum. With staking rewards offering 20% APY during the presale, $SUBBD provides an attractive opportunity for early investors. As the platform grows and blockchain adoption accelerates, $SUBBD is set to become a key player in both the crypto and creator economies. 3. NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) – A Blockchain Built for the Future NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) is a blockchain platform designed to make decentralized apps (dApps) easier to build and use. Think of it like a super-fast highway for blockchain, where developers can quickly deploy apps without getting stuck in traffic. One of $NEAR’s coolest features is its sharding technology, called Nightshade. It splits the blockchain into smaller parts (called shards), allowing the network to process a lot more transactions at once. This makes NEAR Protocol faster and cheaper to use than many other blockchains, which tend to slow down when too many people use them. But $NEAR isn’t just about speed. It also makes it easy for newcomers. Instead of dealing with complicated crypto addresses, users get simple, human-readable account names. And developers can easily connect to other blockchains, like Ethereum, thanks to tools like the Aurora EVM. Currently priced at $2.81, $NEAR has been gaining momentum with over 1K projects already running on its network. It’s quickly becoming one of the most reliable platforms in decentralized space. As traditional financial institutions like JPMorgan and Bank of America explore blockchain technology, $NEAR’s scalability and developer-friendly approach make it a key player in the future of decentralized finance. The Next Generation of Altcoins As traditional financial institutions start exploring the crypto space, innovative altcoins like Best Wallet Token , SUBBD Token , and NEAR Protocol are leading the charge in decentralized finance. These projects are pushing the boundaries with secure wallets, tokenizing real-world assets, and bridging crypto with traditional markets. Keep an eye on them for future growth.

The high-stakes meeting is part of the country’s move to establish itself as a regional hub for blockchain and AI. In addition, it is also part of a bigger strategy to harness the youthful demographic and surplus energy in the country as a tool for digital finance and, by extension, economic transformation. In attendance at the high-level meeting at the General Headquarters were Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and Bilal Bin Saqib, Chief Executive of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC). The pair discussed the potential of emerging technologies, with a focus on leveraging blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI to empower its youth and build economic reliance. Pakistan holds meeting to discuss blockchain and AI In the meeting , Bin Saqib, the chief executive of the PCC, mentioned that digital finance and decentralization offer the country countless opportunities and not threats. “The [PCC] exists because our youth demand a seat at the global tech table,” Saqib said at the meeting. The meeting is coming off the back of efforts to accelerate the regulatory framework of these emerging technologies in the country. The Ministry of Finance, on Wednesday, announced the formation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), a body that has been dedicated and tasked with overseeing blockchain infrastructure and the regulation of digital assets in the country. The move marks a major step towards formalizing a market that has been estimated to witness more than $300 billion in annual crypto trading volume. According to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the PDAA would be in charge of creating a secure, innovative, and inclusive ecosystem that will house digital assets. He also added that it will ensure that Pakistan is ranked high alongside other regional leaders in digital finance and blockchain regulation. He also added that the initiative will birth the facilitation of tokenization of public assets and government debt, regulate Bitcoin mining using surplus electricity, and provide legal clarity for global investors. A renewed shift towards a tech-led growth model The announcement signals a boost in the country’s shift towards a tech-led growth model. With about 70% of its 240 million population under the age of 30, Pakistan has one of the most favored demographics for digital adoption. It ranks among the top five countries globally in terms of crypto usage. In addition, the country ranks as the world’s third-largest freelancer market, with more than 50,000 IT graduates entering the workforce every year. During the meeting, Saqib discussed the recent PCC initiatives with the military leadership, including a global outreach with Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. It also discussed its exploits with World Liberty Financial, a decentralized platform that has links with United States President Donald Trump. He also mentioned the youth-first policy that the group has been looking into, emphasizing the need to channel the country’s tech-savvy workforce into scalable blockchain solutions and AI infrastructure. Some of the national strategies being looked into include allocating surplus electricity to power Bitcoin mining rigs and data centers. The meeting came before Saqib’s participation at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, where he is set to speak alongside other influential figures such as United States Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr. The event is expected to shape the future narratives on global crypto governance.

The sudden dip prompted huge liquidations in crypto futures markets totaling over $560 million. According to Coinglass figures, the decline resulted in the liquidation of 160,905 traders on major exchanges, with longs taking most of the loss. Breakdown of Liquidated Positions All $563.20 million worth of liquidated positions were dominated by longs, which took up $418.63 million. Shorts made up the remaining $144.35 million. The biggest single liquidation order was a BTC-USDT on OKX for $9.53 million. Bitcoin traders were hit the hardest, with liquidations of $153.04 million, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $144.19 million. Most of the liquidations in both assets took place on long positions. Trump’s Trade War Threat Spooks Market Further The price decline was followed by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he threatened to impose more tariffs on the European Union and Apple. The action spooked markets, especially risk-on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ETH fell from $2,731 highs to $2,508 lows, before rebounding to $2,574. The broader market reacted similarly, which highlights crypto’s sensitivity to geopolitical and macroeconomic signals. Relative Strength of Bitcoin Still Intact Followed by the volatility, Bitcoin’s breakout above $109K is still an indicator of strength. Having broken its prior ATH in November, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration, BTC has been resilient despite market volatility. This resiliency is likely driven by the growing perception of Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Institutional and retail investors both increasingly view BTC as an inflation hedge and acceptable replacement in the case of macro instability. Conclusion The recent wave of liquidations confirms the risk-on nature of crypto markets. Yet, the relative resilience of Bitcoin indicates its evolving role as a safe-haven asset amid escalating global tensions.",Bitcoin|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-24 11:27:21

Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Mutuum Finance is capturing attention with its ambitious roadmap and predictions of a 40–50x surge, positioning it as a top crypto to invest in over SHIB. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues as this high-growth altcoin sells at $0.03 and has collected $9.1 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.035 while attracting more than 11,000 investors. This phase’s investors will receive a 100% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. For investors looking beyond Bitcoin, these two could be pivotal plays in the 2025 crypto boom. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction: Can the Meme Coin Hit $0.0002 in 2025? Shiba Inu (SHIB), currently trading around $0.000015, remains a darling of meme coin investors and speculative traders. With its viral community-driven momentum and history of explosive price movement, SHIB is once again in the spotlight as analysts predict a potential run-up to $0.0002 in the next bull run. Recent updates in the Shibarium ecosystem, coupled with accelerating token burns and DeFi integrations, are fueling the bullish sentiment. As one of the best cheap cryptos to invest in now, SHIB has strong near-term upside potential, even for investors wondering what’s the best crypto to buy during periods of high volatility. As SHIB eyes its next leg higher, new tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also being watched by investors who are looking for high-growth altcoins. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 11,000 investors have joined the presale funding to support the project which has received $9.1 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price has currently reached $0.03 in Phase 5 even though investors anticipate a 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 which will generate considerable profit potential. Analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. More than $9.1 million raised and over 11,000 presale participants highlight the strong momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 5 buyers are set to double their investment as the token price targets $0.06 while experts predict a possible 50x surge in 2025. This opportunity represents a rare chance to get in early on a project combining cutting-edge DeFi innovation, transparency, and sustainable growth strategies. Presale spots are rapidly filling up, and once the launch occurs, the chance to capitalize on these gains will vanish. Act now—secure your MUTM tokens before this explosive growth opportunity slips away.

Here’s What SOL Price Will Be Worth in 2025!,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/can-solana-break-the-180-resistance-heres-what-sol-price-will-be-worth-in-2025/,"The post Can Solana Break the $180 Resistance? Here’s What SOL Price Will Be Worth in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana was on its way to rise above the $185 resistance zone after the recent rebound from the local support below $170. Moreover, the star token, Bitcoin, making new highs above $111.8K, was believed to trigger the rest of the altcoins as well. While Ethereum made an entry above $2700 and Cardano surged above $0.82, it appeared that the bearish influence over the token could have faded to a large extent. Meanwhile, the increase in bearish activity, which dragged the BTC price below $107K , seems to have hindered the SOL price rally as well, which is now struggling to reach $180. Currently, the SOL price is down by more than 6% after touching the price zone between $180 and $190. Meanwhile, the token triggered a strong rebound from the local support close to $170 and is trying hard to push higher with renewed momentum. The recent rebound signals an increase in the buy-side interest that has triggered a recovery swing. Meanwhile, despite the pullback, the price remained within the pattern, which keeps the upside potential higher. In the long term, the SOL price remains within the rising wedge, while in the short term, the token is heading towards the end of the apex of the ascending triangle. However, the bulls have been prevented from reaching the lower support of the consolidation. The stochRSI has reached the lower support and is about to trigger a bullish reversal, while the MACD, which remains within a positive range, shows a drop in the selling pressure. Therefore, the Solana price is expected to maintain a healthy consolidation within the triangle for some more time, but along the upper resistance. The token is further believed to trigger a breakout before the end of the month and secure the range around $190.

According to her technical analysis, the digital asset is on the verge of testing a significant structural support zone between $2.25 and $2.26. This level aligns with the macro 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, marking it as a key area to watch in the short term. The current chart action follows a broader reaction across the crypto market, reportedly triggered by renewed macroeconomic pressure. CasiTrades noted that headlines surrounding tariffs contributed to the sudden rejection XRP faced near the 1:1 extension of the C wave. XRP On The Edge Of New Low- Critical Support Test Incoming! It’s been an eventful couple hours for the entire market, including $XRP – we’re heading straight into the crucial technical moment I was calling out… The reaction was triggered by a combination of macro… pic.twitter.com/vHRSOup0uY — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) May 23, 2025 Bearish Structure Confirmed on the Chart The hourly chart CasiTrades shared shows a symmetrical triangle pattern that resolved bearishly, as the price broke down from the consolidation zone and headed toward lower support levels. Momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), reveal a bearish divergence, reinforcing the downside pressure. While other analysts have shared bullish short-term targets , the RSI on CasiTrades’ chart shows lower highs while the price made equal or slightly higher highs, signaling weakening buying interest even before the breakdown. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Crucial Support Zone CasiTrades highlighted the $2.25–$2.26 zone as immediate and crucial support. This level has acted as structural support over the last six months, and its confluence with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level adds to its importance. The analyst emphasizes that whether the asset can hold this area will likely determine the short-term trajectory of the asset. A successful defense of this support could send it toward the $2.70 area, which sits just above the 0.236 Fibonacci extension that acts as a major overhead resistance level. Deeper Levels in Focus if Support Fails However, if the support breaks decisively, analysts may start focusing on deeper retracement levels. The next major support appears near $1.90, corresponding with the 0.5 macro retracement level, and then at $1.55, which marks the bottom range of prior consolidations. Both these levels were pivotal during past market phases, and CasiTrades noted that they could come back into focus in the event of a continued decline. XRP is currently trading at $2.31 after a minor dip from yesterday. Analysts have set lofty targets for the asset in this cycle, and traders will closely monitor the $2.25–$2.26 level to gauge whether bulls can reassert control or the consolidation will continue.

CZ is accusing the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of publishing another “hit piece” based on false information and negative intent. Negative Intentions and Inaccuracies In a May 23 X post , he claimed the media outlet’s reporting had changed into a textbook case of “Cunningham’s Law.” Zhao explained that a few days before the article was published, the company’s PR team had sent him several questions based on false assumptions. “We told them there were numerous inaccuracies and unfounded inferences,” he wrote. The publication asked his team to identify the errors, but he explained that a story can’t be corrected when built on negative intentions from the start. Among the claims made in WSJ’s inquiry was that CZ had helped WLF arrange meetings with government officials in Pakistan, Malaysia, and Kyrgyzstan. The article suggested that he introduced a Pakistani official, Mr. Saqib, to the WLF team. A week after his visit to the region, the crypto project named the man an adviser. Further, the Journal emphasized that on April 26, the WLF team traveled to Pakistan to sign an MOU with the government. However, the former exchange executive has denied these claims. “I am not a fixer for anyone,” he stated. He also clarified that he did not connect Mr. Saqib with the WLF team, pointing out that they already knew each other. Zhao added that he had met the Pakistani official for the first time during his stay in the country. The Binance co-founder also suggested that the WSJ article was part of a broader agenda to stop progress in the crypto industry. “There are forces in the U.S. that want to hinder efforts in making the U.S. the capital of crypto. They want to attack crypto, global crypto leaders, and the pro-crypto administration,” he claimed. A History of False Claims This isn’t the first time Zhao has accused WSJ of publishing false stories. In March, the newspaper shared that Trump’s family was in talks to invest in Binance.US and that the 48-year-old was seeking a presidential pardon. At the time, he described the article as politically motivated, suggesting it was an attempt to undermine the president and the crypto industry. However, he later acknowledged that he had formally applied for clemency from Trump. More recently, the former CEO dismissed allegations from a separate news piece that said he had agreed to provide evidence against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). CZ suggested the report might be tied to lobbying efforts aimed at damaging his and Binance’s reputation. Sun also rejected the claims, saying he was unaware of such rumors and referred to Zhao as his “mentor and close friend.” The post CZ Denies ‘Fixer’ Role in World Liberty Financial Deals appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Binance|Changpeng Zhao (CZ Binance)|Justin Sun|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-24 11:36:51

The SkyBridge Capital founder, who’s now penning a book titled Solana Rising , believes traditional finance is on the brink of a major upgrade, with Solana at the core. Bold claims but he’s backing it up with research, interviews with Wall Street CTOs, and conversations with Solana’s own Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. Here’s what you should know. A $7 Trillion Problem, and Solana’s Fix Scaramucci pointed to a staggering figure: nearly $7 trillion is spent globally on transaction verification . That inefficiency, he argues, is ripe for disruption. Solana’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure could cut those costs dramatically – something no traditional system has managed to do. “Think of Solana as the operating layer for real-world assets, in the same way Bitcoin is for money,” he said. Scaramucci sees Solana becoming one of the major financial rails for real-world asset tokenization. We’re talking from stocks to bonds and everything in between. On-Chain IPOs Could Break the Banking Barrier Here’s one of the boldest promises. IPOs that don’t require a bank account. “You don’t need a bank account to buy an IPO on-chain, just a wallet,” Scaramucci said. He compared blockchain-powered IPOs to traditional offerings that can rack up 7% in fees, arguing Solana’s system could offer the same functionality at a fraction of the cost, with much broader access. Institutional Adoption Is “Inevitable” Despite ongoing regulatory friction, Scaramucci insists big players are circling. He called out JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon as a cautious example, predicting major institutions will eventually custody and offer yield-bearing strategies using Solana and other Layer-1 assets. “Solana will be part of a financial system where you not only stake, but also lend your assets – earning yield like you would in traditional finance,” he added. SkyBridge is already working on such strategies. “Make Everyone an Investor” Scaramucci isn’t the only one highly bullish on Solana and its potential. Earlier this week, Solana Foundation’s Akshay BD laid out a broader vision: universal micro-ownership through tokenization . The current financial model, he argued, locks out most retail investors. “Solana could make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time,” he said – especially in a world where low bond yields and overvalued markets leave few appealing options.

45040989,https://finbold.com/?p=245908,1748087614,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"Expert sets date when Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025",https://finbold.com/expert-sets-date-when-bitcoin-will-hit-200000-in-2025/,"After Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high this week, a trading expert believes the asset is on track for even greater gains, possibly reaching $200,000 in 2025. According to an analysis by TradingShot , historical trends and technical setups suggest that Bitcoin might reach the $200,000 mark toward the end of this year, as per a May 23 TradingView post . Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In the outlook, TradingShot emphasized that Bitcoin is currently experiencing its weakest bull cycle to date, a natural consequence of the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TDM). This theory posits that as markets mature, the magnitude of returns tends to slow. While Bitcoin’s earlier cycles witnessed explosive growth, more recent ones have been comparatively moderate yet notable. To illustrate this, TradingShot overlaid Bitcoin’s previous bull cycles (2009–2011, 2012–2013, 2015–2017, 2019–2021). The comparison revealed a transition from aggressive early growth to a more consistent pattern, resembling movements in traditional financial markets. Interestingly, the 2015 to 2017 and 2019 to 2021 cycles showed similar upward paths, with temporary divergences eventually returning to the broader trend. Bitcoin tracking past cycles Looking ahead, the ongoing cycle appears to be tracking within an upward channel. After a projected divergence in February 2025, Bitcoin is expected to realign with its historical trend. The recent six-week rebound further supports this outlook. Based on these patterns, TradingShot forecasts that Bitcoin’s cycle peak will likely occur between October and December 2025, with a potential price range of $150,000 to $200,000. “Based on past cycles, it should be within October – December 2025. Timing your exit strategy can perhaps be more effective than assigning a certain Target, even though the peak is expected to be anywhere within the $150k – $200k range,” the expert said. It’s worth noting that, after surpassing a new record high above $111,000, analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin could maintain this momentum in the coming weeks. For instance, as reported by Finbold, veteran trader Peter Brandt stated that following this breakout, Bitcoin’s technical formation indicates the possibility of reaching $150,000 by August 2025. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Gert van Lagen made another bullish projection. In a May 24 post on X, he explained that Bitcoin has historically followed a clear exponential path, rising from $1 to over $100,000 through recurring bullish patterns such as cup-and-handle formations. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView He emphasized that if history repeats itself, the real peak could be three to six times higher than current levels, noting that Bitcoin’s rise isn’t just linear; it’s compounding. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $108,811, down over 2% in the last 24 hours. However, on a weekly basis, the asset has climbed more than 5%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, the broader sentiment around Bitcoin remains bullish. The current price stands well above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), reaffirming a strong upward trend.

The decision comes as the blockchain network prepares for an on-chain governance vote to decide whether to implement a protocol upgrade for fund recovery. Following Wednesday’s action by Sui ( SUI ) validators to freeze stolen assets, Cetus has formally requested community approval for a protocol upgrade that would return the locked funds without reversing transaction history or rolling back the blockchain. You might also like: Cetus Protocol hack and Sui exploit: The full story behind the $260 million breach Sui validators coordinated emergency freeze The Sui validator network responded quickly to the security breach by implementing emergency measures to prevent further asset drainage. Over one-third of validators by stake weight ignored transactions from two addresses believed connected to the attack. This effectively immobilized approximately $162 million worth of digital assets. On Wednesday, the Sui validator community acted quickly to freeze $162M of the stolen funds. Here’s how that happened: – Each validator has a configuration file that allows it to ignore transactions from a specific address. – Adding addresses to this file is at the discretion… https://t.co/pVLTItN0MH — Sui (@SuiNetwork) May 23, 2025 The freezing mechanism operates through individual validator configuration files that allow nodes to exclude specific addresses from transaction processing. Each validator maintains discretionary control over this function, which can be activated or reversed independently based on individual risk assessments or compliance requirements. While validators successfully prevented the attacker from bridging a substantial portion of the stolen funds off the Sui network, approximately $60 million in assets had already been moved before the freeze took effect. Cetus has mentioned it is collaborating with Inca Digital, security firms, and international law enforcement agencies to recover the remaining compromised funds. The Sui Foundation shared two conditions for supporting the community vote process. First, the foundation will maintain complete neutrality regarding the outcome. They stressed its role as a facilitator rather than a decision-maker for community governance. Second, Cetus must publicly commit to deploying all available financial resources toward full customer restitution. “This is an extraordinary request in response to extraordinary need – Cetus’s customer funds are at stake,” the Sui Foundation stated. Cetus has expressed willingness to respect whatever decision emerges from the community vote. They noted that “no one can make this decision unilaterally.” The protocol upgrade vote will involve major network participants, including validators and SUI token stakers. Cetus had also offered a $6 million bounty to the hacker to retrieve the funds.

Prices jumped past $109,000, a high not seen since January. Bitcoin even touched $111,980 on May 22. Investors piled in as the rally took hold. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge According to Farside data, spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $2.75 billion this week, up sharply from $608 million the week before. That big jump came as Bitcoin pushed past its January all-time high of $109,000. On May 21, investors added $607 million, the same day Bitcoin hit a new peak. Then, on May 22, the coin soared to $111,980. Those moves show money chasing fresh highs. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Flows Based on reports, ETF flows on May 23 totaled just $212 million, but BlackRock’s IBIT was the only one in the green. It brought in $431 million all by itself, and that stretched its inflow streak to eight days straight. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC saw $89 million leave, and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB lost $74 million. Investors seem to favor the low fees and wide reach of the biggest funds. Market Sentiment Pulls Back Bitcoin’s climb paused a bit after that. At publication, it traded near $108,150. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid from an “Extreme Greed” reading of 78 down to 66, or “Greed.” That dip hints at some profit-taking. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan said on May 22 that “overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” His view is that this rally hasn’t been driven by risky bets.

The previous monthly high came in November 2024, when ETFs took in $6.50 billion. With five trading days left in May, inflows could set a new mark. That steady demand underlines how ETFs have become the go-to way for many to own Bitcoin without wrestling with wallets and private keys. Demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has grown fast. Investors like simple, regulated products. The big issuers, led by BlackRock, have the best chance to stay on top. As for Bitcoin itself, if sentiment cools, prices might pull back some.

However, while many attendees at the event remained unknown to the public, a few high-profile guests appeared for the cameras. Guests included former basketball star Lamar Odom, crypto entrepreneur, and Tron founder Justin Sun. Trump Memecoin Gala Sees High-Profile Attendees Attendees posted details about the dinner on X, revealing some details and disappointment. The gala was held at Trump’s golf course outside Washington DC, with over 220 top TRUMP memecoin holders, including Justin Sun and Lamar Odom in attendance. Odom took to X to hype up the TRUMP memecoin, stating, “I’m just about to pass through security and officially walk into the Trump Gala. Honestly, I’m fired up. Think about it—what meme coin has ever done this?” Other VIP guests included Tron founder Justin Sun . Chinese-born Sun, a crypto billionaire who feared arrest in the US, also attended the event. Sun revealed he is the largest holder of the TRUMP memecoin and thanked Trump for his support to the industry. “As the top holder of $TRUMP and proud supporter of President Trump, it was an honor to attend the Trump Gala Dinner by @GetTrumpMemes. Thank you, @POTUS, for your unwavering support of our industry!” The President also gave a speech blaming the previous administration for going after crypto. Trump stated, “The past administration made your lives miserable. They were going after everybody. It was a disgrace frankly.” A Barrage Of Criticism Trump’s memecoin gala drew sharp criticism from lawmakers who accused the President of selling access to foreign governments and putting the US national security at risk. Senator Elizabeth Warren was vocal in her criticism, stating, “Donald Trump’s dinner is an orgy of corruption. That’s what this is all about. We are here today to talk about exactly one topic: corruption, corruption in its ugliest form. Donald Trump is using the presidency of the United States to make himself richer through crypto, and he’s doing it right out there in plain sight. He is signaling to anyone who wants to ask for a special favor and is willing to pay for it exactly how to do that.” Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and Rep. Sam Liccardo of California, and advocacy organizations criticized the event, with Blumenthal stating, “Donald Trump is selling access. He is selling out America. He is selling it to foreign powers. He is putting our national security at risk.” Trump’s Crypto Involvement Complicating Regulatory Efforts President Trump’s involvement in crypto has complicated efforts to advance bills and regulate the crypto industry. When asked if the list of attendees would be made public, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the White House did not host the event. “This question has been raised with the President. I have also addressed the dinner tonight. The President is attending it in his personal time. It is not a White House dinner. It's not taking place here at the White House.” Meanwhile, House Financial Committee Republican French Hill said Trump’s crypto involvement has complicated regulatory efforts as he attempts to pass a crucial stablecoin bill in the House. Hill stated he viewed the dinner as a distraction, “I view the dinner last night as, you know, whatever, that to me, is a distraction from the work I think we need to do for the major big picture macro policy.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The flagship cryptocurrency dropped nearly 4% on Friday, plunging to a low of $106,816 before rebounding to current levels. BTC is down over 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $108,200. Bitcoin (BTC) And Altcoins Register Sharp Decline Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $106,816 on Friday, erasing substantial gains made earlier this week. The crash coincided with the sell-off in the stock market as futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 fell over 1%, continuing a sell-off that began on Monday. The crypto market retreated as trade war concerns emerged after a Truth Social post in which President Trump said trade talks with the EU were going nowhere and warned of a 50% tariff on all goods from the region. The statement escalated trade tensions at a time when markets were hoping for a deal between the trade partners. The EU has hinted it will respond by hiking tariffs on US goods, including Boeing jets. Ryanair’s CEO has already warned the company is considering canceling a $33 billion order from Boeing and switching to Airbus if Boeing planes are hit by tariffs. The trade war concerns return a week after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating and as the House of Representatives voted on the “Big Beautiful Bill” which will increase US debt by over $3.8 trillion in a decade. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Strong Inflows US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a total of $2.75 billion in inflows this week as Bitcoin surged past $110,000 and set a new all-time high. The inflows were almost 4.5 times larger than the previous week’s inflows of $608 million, according to data from Farside. Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $211 million on May 23. However, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only fund that posted gains during the trading day, adding $430 million and extending its inflow streak to eight consecutive days. Meanwhile, Grayscale saw outflows of $89 million, while ARK21 Shares saw outflows worth $73.9 million. Only two days prior, Bitcoin ETFs registered $607 million in inflows, the same day the flagship cryptocurrency surged past its previous all-time high. However, BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday as market sentiment declined. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out that Bitcoin is not showing any signs of overheating despite surging to a new all-time high, indicating the price could rise higher. An analyst from CryptoQuant stated, “Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 as it finally crossed the $110,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency consolidated around higher levels as it entered a price discovery phase after crossing into uncharted territory. Analysts expected BTC to continue its uptrend and push towards $115,000 and possibly $120,000.

Schiff Says Central Banks Have Made Their Choice,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-or-gold-schiff-says-central-banks-have-made-their-choice/,"The post Bitcoin or Gold? Schiff Says Central Banks Have Made Their Choice appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The age-old debate between Bitcoin and gold is heating up again and economist Peter Schiff wants to weigh in. In a recent X post , Schiff, a staunch Bitcoin critic, spotlighted the growing trend of central banks worldwide stocking gold reserves, strengthening their timeless value amid global economic uncertainty. With geopolitical uncertainties, crypto scams, and shifting economic policies moving demand, Schiff claims gold’s stability, Trump’s pro-crypto policies, and Bitcoin’s volatility, sparking fresh discussion among investors. Why Central Banks Are Choosing Gold Over Bitcoin In Schiff’s latest commentary, he took a direct jab at Bitcoin advocates by asking: If Bitcoin is the future, why are central banks betting on gold to replace the dollar? That question cuts to the heart of an ongoing shift in the global financial system. With fears of U.S. dollar devaluation and escalating geopolitical risks, foreign central banks are turning to gold – not crypto – as their hedge. According to a Reuters report, central banks are now buying more than 1,000 metric tons of gold annually – double the average of the previous decade. And the momentum isn’t slowing down. Michael Widmer, a strategist at Bank of America, says emerging market central banks currently hold just 10% of their reserves in gold but should be targeting 30% for greater financial protection. Trump, Tariffs, and the Rise of Gold Demand Peter Schiff also ties this growing demand for gold to the current U.S. administration. With President Donald Trump back in office and pushing aggressive tariff policies, countries are looking to shield their economies from potential fallout. As the dollar weakens, the appeal of gold rises. And in times of uncertainty – from trade wars to banking collapses – central banks want assets that stand the test of time. Russia Leads the Gold Playbook Russia has been ahead of the curve. Between 2014 and 2020 , the Russian central bank hoarded gold to buffer itself from Western sanctions. Today, its Ministry of Finance is reportedly continuing that accumulation – buying from domestic producers and quietly strengthening reserves. This playbook is being adopted by other emerging economies as well, reinforcing Schiff’s argument that gold’s legacy value is far from obsolete. So, if Bitcoin truly is the future, why aren’t central banks buying it? Bitcoin’s Volatility vs. Gold’s Stability Schiff didn’t stop at praising gold. He also took a swing at Bitcoin’s unpredictability. He warned that American investors – who collectively hold nearly half of all Bitcoin – may be in for a rude awakening as the price swings continue and global institutions remain cautious. At the time of writing, gold trades at $3,357.4 per ounce, up 1.82% for the day but slightly down over the month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is priced at $108,148 – down 2.31% in the last 24 hours, though it’s seen a 17% jump over the month. Despite the short-term surge, Schiff argues that Bitcoin lacks the long-term security central banks crave. Ran Neuner Weighs In: Could Bitcoin Still Outshine Gold? Not everyone agrees with Schiff’s stance. CNBC’s Ran Neuner recently suggested that Bitcoin could outperform gold in the long run as a safe-haven asset – especially amid advancements in blockchain tech and increasing institutional adoption. But Schiff remains skeptical. He also criticized the growing use of stablecoins in the U.S., pointing to the regulatory fog. Will Schiff’s predictions hold as the crypto space evolves?
