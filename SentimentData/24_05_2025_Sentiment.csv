Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has pushed back reports linking him to World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Summer Mersinger suggested that crypto perpetual futures could soon be introduced in US markets. US House members call for investigation into Trump's memecoin dinner Members of the US House of Representatives called for the Justice Department to investigate Donald Trump’s May 22 dinner for his top memecoin investors, citing concerns about “foreign influence over US policy decisions” and “potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” The call for an investigation and a press conference asking Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner both occurred hours before the event, which was held at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. A group of protesters, joined by Senator Jeff Merkley, gathered outside the venue with signs stating “illegal crypto party” and “democracy is not for sale.” CZ refutes claims in latest WSJ article on Trump-linked crypto dealings Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pushed back against a report in The Wall Street Journal, calling it a “hit piece” filled with inaccuracies and negative assumptions. In an X post, Zhao criticized the publication’s portrayal of his alleged involvement with World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by a business entity affiliated with US President Donald Trump. Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company. Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official. “I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng Zhao Crypto perp futures coming “very soon” to US: CFTC’s Mersinger Outgoing Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Summer Mersinger said on May 22 that the regulator could greenlight crypto perpetual futures contracts “very soon.” “We’re seeing some applications, and I believe we’ll see some of those products trading live very soon,” she told Bloomberg TV, adding it would be “great to get that trading back onshore in the United States.” Summer Mersinger on Bloomberg TV. Source: YouTube Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate, often with high leverage, on the price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning it and can be held indefinitely. Mersinger, who will leave the CFTC at the end of May to join the crypto lobby group the Blockchain Association as CEO, said having crypto derivatives trading and regulated in the US would be a “really good thing for these markets and would be really beneficial to the industry broadly.”",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-23 22:18:11

Traders and whales from Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum communities are reallocating capital into high-momentum alternatives—most notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE. As the market transitions into Q3, the narrative is clear: smart capital is leaving overextended majors for early-stage projects with breakout setups, meme traction, and clear accumulation signals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of this strategic rotation. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Renewed Optimism XRP is holding firm around $2.35 after bouncing from recent lows, with bullish divergence emerging across multiple technical timeframes. Whale accumulation wallets have steadily increased, suggesting that larger players are quietly building positions. The conclusion of Ripple’s SEC case and improved on-chain metrics have made XRP a strong candidate for Q3 rotation flows. As developers continue to build financial tools on its fast, low-cost settlement network, sentiment is improving. While analysts are eyeing a push toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, many long-time XRP holders are now diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper upside as the altcoin cycle heats up. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to speculative play for traders rotating out of Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. What began as a niche meme coin is now dominating early-stage Telegram groups and discussion threads, thanks to its timely political branding and viral community-driven momentum. The project’s deflationary model, capped 100 billion supply, and alignment with election narratives have made MAGA a favorite for those chasing asymmetric upside. Whale activity is surging, with a recent 72.95 ETH buy ($133,743) marking the largest early-stage purchase of 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a true accumulation phase, and analysts now call it the last major 50x opportunity of the cycle. As retail and institutional capital flows in, MAGA is poised for breakout price discovery before listings hit the public charts. Solana, SUI, and Ethereum: Capital Rotation Underway Solana (SOL) remains resilient above $170, but faces near-term exhaustion as price action cools. Some traders are reallocating profits into more volatile tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is more attractive. SUI is gaining attention after recent network upgrades and rising developer interest, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a long-term accumulation target. ETH’s Layer-2 activity and validator growth keep it foundational, but for short-term explosive returns, many investors are now selectively rotating into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin: From All-Time Highs to Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000 has been fueled by institutional demand and bullish technicals, with analysts forecasting potential highs of $125,000–$150,000 in 2025. However, as BTC stabilizes, the options market and on-chain data show traders increasingly shifting focus to altcoins for higher multiples. This rotation is driving new volume and volatility into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now seen as the high-conviction play for those seeking exponential upside in the current cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The current market is witnessing a major rotation as Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum traders move capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. With whale accumulation at record highs, a $0.007 listing target, and the largest single early-stage buy of 2025 already on the books, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the breakout candidate for Q3. As the window for early entry closes, analysts agree: MAGA is set to lead the next wave of crypto gains, making it the top altcoin to watch as capital rotates out of overextended majors.

According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the market can expect several large deals to be announced in the coming weeks. This kind of statement from such a high-level official is significant and warrants attention, particularly for those navigating the complex waters of the financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Who is Scott Bessent and Why Does His Word Matter for Market Impact? Scott Bessent serves as the Secretary of the US Treasury , a pivotal role in the United States government. The Treasury Department is responsible for managing the nation’s finances, including tax collection, currency production, and managing government accounts and public debt. More broadly, the Treasury plays a crucial role in shaping economic policy, implementing sanctions, and overseeing financial regulations. Therefore, any forward-looking statements from the Treasury Secretary carry considerable weight and can provide insights into the government’s economic priorities and upcoming actions. When Secretary Bessent speaks of expecting “several large deals ,” he is likely referring to significant transactions or initiatives that could have broad economic implications. These might involve: Major mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that require regulatory review or government facilitation. Significant government contracts or infrastructure projects. International financial agreements or trade deals. Potential regulatory changes or enforcement actions impacting major industries. Large-scale bond issuances or debt management strategies. The specific nature of these deals remains undisclosed, adding an element of mystery and prompting speculation across various sectors. What Kind of Large Deals Could the US Treasury Be Signaling? While Secretary Bessent’s statement is concise, the term “large deals” from the perspective of the US Treasury can encompass a wide range of possibilities, each with distinct potential outcomes. Understanding the potential scope helps us gauge the possible market impact . Consider these possibilities: 1. Infrastructure and Public Works: The government often facilitates or funds massive infrastructure projects. Announcements here could involve billions in spending on roads, bridges, energy grids, or digital infrastructure. Such deals stimulate specific industries and can have a ripple effect on employment and economic growth. 2. Regulatory Actions and Policy Shifts: The Treasury is involved in financial regulation. A “large deal” might not be a transaction but a significant policy shift or a major enforcement action against a large financial institution or industry. These can reshape competitive landscapes and introduce new compliance burdens or opportunities. 3. International Financial Agreements: In a globalized economy, the US Treasury is constantly engaged in discussions and agreements with other nations regarding trade, currency stability, sanctions, and international debt. Major deals here could impact global markets, currency exchange rates, and international capital flows. 4. Strategic Industry Support or Divestiture: Occasionally, the government might be involved in supporting or divesting from strategically important industries or assets. This could involve anything from energy sector support to the sale of government-held stakes in certain entities. 5. Debt and Fiscal Management: While perhaps less a “deal” in the traditional sense, major announcements regarding US debt management, bond issuance strategies, or significant fiscal policy changes could be framed as large financial undertakings by the Treasury. The ambiguity allows for broad interpretation, which is why market participants are keenly awaiting further details. The timing, described as “coming weeks,” suggests these announcements are imminent rather than distant. How Could These US Treasury Announcements Create Market Impact, Especially for Crypto? At first glance, news about US Treasury deals might seem unrelated to the world of cryptocurrency. However, the traditional financial system and the crypto market are increasingly interconnected. Major macroeconomic events and significant developments in traditional finance inevitably have a ripple effect on digital assets. Here’s how Secretary Bessent’s anticipated announcements could create market impact for crypto: 1. Overall Market Sentiment: Large, positive economic deals (e.g., significant infrastructure spending, favorable international agreements) can boost overall market confidence and risk appetite. When traditional markets are bullish, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, announcements perceived negatively (e.g., regulatory crackdowns, unfavorable economic outlooks) could lead to a flight to safety, potentially causing sell-offs in crypto. 2. Liquidity and Capital Flows: Major deals often involve significant movements of capital. Increased economic activity or investment stemming from these deals could increase overall liquidity in the financial system. While not directly flowing into crypto, higher liquidity generally creates a more favorable environment for asset prices across the board. 3. Inflation and Economic Outlook: Depending on the nature of the deals, they could influence expectations about inflation, economic growth, or interest rates. For instance, large government spending could be seen as inflationary, which has historically been a narrative that benefits scarce assets like Bitcoin. Announcements signaling economic strength might reduce the appeal of safe havens but increase confidence in growth assets. 4. Regulatory Environment: If any of the “large deals” involve new financial regulations or the enforcement of existing ones, this could directly impact the cryptocurrency industry. Increased regulatory clarity (or uncertainty) is a major factor influencing institutional adoption and market stability for crypto. 5. US Dollar Strength: Treasury actions and major economic deals can influence the strength of the US dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes put pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in USD and seen by some as alternative stores of value. It’s crucial for those following crypto news to pay close attention to these developments from the US Treasury . While the connection might not always be direct, the macroeconomic environment shaped by these announcements is a powerful force influencing investment decisions globally. What Should Crypto Investors Do Ahead of These Large Deals? Given the potential for significant market impact stemming from the anticipated large deals announced by the US Treasury , how should crypto investors prepare? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on traditional financial news outlets and official US Treasury announcements in the coming weeks. Understand the details of the deals as they are revealed, not just the headlines. Assess Potential Implications: Once details emerge, try to analyze how the specific nature of the deals could affect the broader economy, inflation expectations, regulatory landscape, and overall market sentiment. Consider both positive and negative potential outcomes. Review Your Portfolio: Think about how different scenarios resulting from the announcements might affect your current crypto holdings. Are you heavily invested in assets sensitive to regulatory changes? Or perhaps assets seen as hedges against inflation? Manage Risk: Volatility can increase around major economic announcements. Ensure your portfolio is adequately diversified and that you are not overexposed to sudden market shifts. Consider setting stop-loss orders or taking other risk management measures if you trade actively. Avoid Panic Reactions: Initial market reactions can sometimes be overblown or based on incomplete information. Take time to understand the full picture before making significant changes to your investment strategy based solely on the immediate news reaction. The comments from Scott Bessent serve as a heads-up that significant financial news is on the horizon. Proactive preparation and informed analysis will be key to navigating the potential market movements that follow. Potential Benefits and Challenges for Crypto from Treasury Announcements Let’s quickly summarize the potential upside and downside for the crypto market based on the type and reaction to these anticipated large deals : Potential Benefit Scenarios Potential Challenge Scenarios Deals boost overall economic confidence and risk appetite. Deals signal tighter regulation impacting crypto directly or indirectly. Deals involve significant stimulus perceived as inflationary. Deals lead to a stronger USD, potentially pressuring crypto prices. Deals create new infrastructure or tech opportunities beneficial to blockchain. Deals reveal negative economic outlook or increased fiscal instability. Deals improve international financial stability. Market reacts negatively to the specifics of the announced deals. Increased liquidity flows broadly benefit asset markets. Capital flows are directed away from risk assets towards traditional safe havens. This table illustrates that the impact is not predetermined and will depend entirely on the specifics of what Scott Bessent and the US Treasury announce. Conclusion: Staying Alert in a Connected Financial World Scott Bessent ‘s statement about expecting several large deals in the coming weeks is a clear signal that significant economic activity is anticipated at the highest levels of the US Treasury . While the details remain under wraps, the potential for these announcements to create notable market impact across various sectors, including the increasingly integrated world of cryptocurrency, is undeniable. For anyone tracking crypto news , this serves as a reminder that macroeconomics plays a vital role in the performance of digital assets. Staying informed about these developments, understanding their potential implications, and managing risk are essential steps in navigating the markets during periods of significant government announcements. The coming weeks promise to be interesting, so keep your eyes peeled for news from the US Treasury .

Head of Pantera Capital Dan Morehead, in an interview, revealed that many crypto companies are preparing for public offerings. In the next few months, both Circle and Figure will prepare for their IPOs. This is a significant change for blockchain activity in the United States, as the rules surrounding the industry become friendlier rather than stricter. Morehead believes the change resulted from recent policy updates. The SEC’s decision to withdraw Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 is an example of this kind of change.

Casten, Smith Call for DOJ Inquiry Into Trump Gala In the letter from Casten and Smith, backed by 35 House Democrats, the lawmakers claim that the dinner for the top 220 $TRUMP investors held on Thursday “invites foreign influence over U.S. policy decisions and raises potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” https://twitter.com/Eleanor_Mueller/status/1925606223539269693 “It is just the latest example of President Trump disregarding ethics norms, introducing further conflicts of interest, and using his office for self-enrichment,” Casten and Smith said. In particular, the two representatives emphasized concerns over Chinese Tron founder Justin Sun’s recent announcement that he was the top investor of Trump’s namesake meme coin , exacerbating foreign influence concerns. Sun faced fraud charges from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission over his Tron blockchain, though those were recently dropped shortly after investing millions in the Trump-affiliated crypto platform, World Liberty Financial. “U.S. law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to U.S. political campaigns,” the lawmakers said. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” Democrats Question $TRUMP Dinner Ethics Hosted at Trump National Golf Club just outside of Washington, D.C., the $TRUMP gala dinner drew a wave of pushback from Democratic lawmakers who expressed issues over potential ethics concerns. On Thursday, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters (D-CA) introduced a new bill that would prohibit elected officials from owning a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. However, it is still unclear if Democrats hold enough sway to enact legislation against Trump’s crypto affairs.

For those plugged into the crypto and blockchain space, staying ahead of the curve on frontier tech like AI is crucial, as these innovations often shape future digital economies and investment opportunities. A major development just hit the wires: OpenAI Jony Ive are joining forces in a monumental deal that signals a bold new direction for AI. OpenAI Jony Ive: A $6.5 Billion Bet on the Future In a move that sent ripples through the tech industry, OpenAI has acquired io, the secretive device startup co-founded by legendary designer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This wasn’t a small cash purchase; it was a staggering $6.5 billion all-equity deal, representing OpenAI’s largest acquisition to date. The core of the deal brings Ive, the design genius behind iconic Apple products like the iPhone, iMac, and iPod, into the OpenAI fold. Through his creative firm, LoveFrom, Ive will now lead design and creative efforts for OpenAI. The clear objective behind this massive investment and high-profile partnership? To take AI beyond the screen and spearhead the creation of a new generation of AI consumer devices . This isn’t just about software anymore; it’s about building tangible products that integrate AI seamlessly into our daily lives, potentially creating entirely new markets and user experiences. Sam Altman OpenAI and the ‘AI iPhone’ Vision The narrative surrounding the Sam Altman OpenAI and Jony Ive partnership is unmistakable: OpenAI is positioning itself to replicate the kind of paradigm-shifting impact Apple had with the iPhone. Sam Altman is being framed as the visionary, akin to Steve Jobs, while Jony Ive is the design maestro tasked with making that vision a tangible, desirable reality. The staged photos of the duo circulating on social media only reinforced this carefully crafted message. The goal is clear: take the revolutionary impact of the iPhone launch and apply it to artificial intelligence, creating devices that redefine how we interact with technology. This focus on AI consumer devices highlights a strategic shift. While much of the AI conversation has centered on large language models, generative AI, and software applications, the next frontier is integrating this intelligence into hardware that users interact with directly, intuitively, and constantly. Think wearables, ambient computing, or entirely new form factors we haven’t even imagined yet. Ive’s expertise in human-centric design and creating beloved products is precisely what OpenAI needs to translate powerful AI models into accessible and appealing devices. Contrasting Strategies: OpenAI’s Bold Move vs. Google AI Strategy This aggressive push by OpenAI, securing a design legend and betting billions on hardware, starkly contrasts with how other tech giants are approaching the AI race, particularly the perceived Google AI strategy . While Google has been a pioneer in AI research and continues to integrate AI into its vast suite of services (as seen with their AI-powered search upgrades demonstrated at Google I/O), OpenAI’s move with Ive suggests a focus on creating disruptive, standalone AI hardware products from the ground up. This isn’t just about enhancing existing products; it’s about building entirely new ones. The recent Google I/O event, as discussed on Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast, showcased Google’s advancements, including the return of concepts like Google Glass (albeit in a different context) and developer reactions to AI search. However, OpenAI’s partnership with Ive positions them not just as a leader in AI models, but as a potential leader in the future of AI hardware design, directly challenging established players in the consumer device space. The Promise of AI Innovation Beyond the Screen The potential for AI innovation driven by this partnership is immense. Jony Ive’s design philosophy has always been about simplifying technology and making it feel intuitive and magical. Applying this approach to AI could result in devices that are not just smart, but truly enhance human capabilities and interactions without the need for traditional screens or interfaces. Imagine AI companions integrated into wearables that provide real-time information, context-aware assistance, or seamless control over your environment, all designed with the elegance and usability Ive is known for. The implications for the broader tech ecosystem, including areas relevant to cryptocurrency and Web3, are significant. As AI becomes more embedded in physical devices, it could drive new forms of data ownership, decentralized AI processing, or novel incentive structures that intersect with blockchain technology. The infrastructure required to support billions of AI-powered devices will also present opportunities and challenges for decentralized networks. Beyond the OpenAI and Google news, the Equity podcast also delved into other notable tech stories, including: Insights from Google I/O, touching upon developer sentiment regarding AI tools and the potential resurgence of concepts like Google Glass. Updates on Luminar, the lidar startup, navigating layoffs, CEO changes, and fundraising efforts. A look at 23andMe’s new direction and the potential uses of its vast DNA data repository under new ownership. These diverse topics highlight the dynamic and interconnected nature of the current technology landscape, where advancements in one area, like AI, can have ripple effects across multiple industries. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Devices The partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive is far more than just a high-profile acquisition; it’s a strategic declaration that OpenAI is serious about bringing AI into the physical world through thoughtfully designed consumer devices. By combining cutting-edge AI research with unparalleled design expertise, they are aiming for nothing less than creating the next foundational technology platform, much like the personal computer and the smartphone before it.

According to the release, this move aims to improve Alchemy’s smart wallet ecosystem. Although the acquisition was completed on April 30, the financial details are not public. Benefits of Alchemy Acquisition Meanwhile, integrating HeyMint’s team and technology is expected to significantly enhance Alchemy’s developer tools and increase user engagement. As part of the acquisition, the main teams from HeyMint and its related platform, HeyMint Quest, will join Alchemy. This collaboration will help Alchemy grow its smart wallet ecosystem. Notably, HeyMint is a user-friendly launchpad that helps artists, brands, and developers create NFT collections easily, without needing advanced coding skills. Its simple tools and focus on community support make it a standout choice in the busy NFT market. Integrating these tools will help Alchemy provide a better solution for Web3 developers. This move also emphasizes Alchemy’s goal of being a one-stop shop for creating, launching, and managing Web3 applications, focusing on tools that put users first. Alchemy Expands Web 3.0 Developers’ Education Recall that the blockchain startup acquired ChainShot , a Web 3.0 educational platform for prospective developers, in 2022. With the deal, more developers gained free access to Web 3.0 developer education. This also aligned with the everyday goal of the blockchain development company, which is to “bring Web3 to a billion people.” Before now, Alchemy had noticed a huge gap preventing individuals from hopping into Web3.0. This course gives aspiring developers enough knowledge to dive into the crypto industry unperturbed. It is worth noting that this is the first of Alchemy’s acquisitions. Smart Wallet Simplifies Crypto Trading Recall that last year, the Coinbase exchange launched a new smart wallet designed to tackle key challenges in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem. As reported by TheCoinRise, the smart wallet is in sync with eight other networks: Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Zora, and Avalanche. Others are Polygon, BNB , and Arbitrum. Intriguingly, Coinbase says the goal is to expand and incorporate other networks over time. The smart wallet features are designed to streamline the enrollment procedures for new users. Furthermore, the wallet simplifies all the hurdles in getting started with crypto. It is also user-friendly and allows new users to set up and use their wallet with little effort. These advantages position it for wider adoption.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Barak said corporate service providers and centralized servers are expected to become honeypots for AI-assisted hackers and malicious actors looking to steal valuable data, including private keys, financial metadata, medical records, and government documents. Hackers targeting centralized entities have a ""massive"" return on investment (ROI) and are incentivized to hack centralized targets that contain millions of valuable records, the CEO told Cointelegraph. Barak added that ZK-proofs, a way of verifying onchain data without revealing it, solve this problem: ""Blockchain is going to improve cybersecurity around the world, because, for a hacker to get to actual data, they need to hack individual wallets, but their ROI would be one record instead of millions — not worth it. They are going to go elsewhere."" Privacy solutions have become a major focus for many Web3 developers, as the need to shield metadata from AI algorithms grows and large institutions demand privacy tools to protect sensitive data as a prerequisite to bringing their business operations onchain.

While Solana and XRP are grabbing headlines with their surging price action, the real story is the strategic positioning of smart money into MAGA before its public debut. With Bitcoin’s momentum steady and whale activity at record highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the top early-stage altcoin on every analyst’s radar. Ethereum Whales Signal the Next Altcoin Season Recent on-chain data reveals a surge in Ethereum whale accumulation, a classic precursor to altcoin season. According to Crypto Rover, large ETH holders have been aggressively buying, with one wallet alone scooping up 5,000 ETH—worth over $13 million—in a single hour. This buying spree has historically triggered bullish momentum not just for Ethereum, but for the broader altcoin market. As ETH whales load up, many are also diversifying into high-upside presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is even more attractive. With ETH trading at $2,650 and whale wallets betting on a broad rally, MAGA is perfectly positioned to benefit from the next liquidity wave. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Buys and Institutional-Grade Conviction MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing record-breaking whale activity, with a single 72.95 ETH transaction—valued at $133,743—marking the largest early-stage crypto buy of 2025. This direct allocation is not opportunistic, but a calculated institutional-style move that cements MAGA as a high-confidence project. With over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting both retail and strategic capital before its $0.007 listing. Analysts are forecasting returns of 25x–200x, and with whales moving in before CoinMarketCap tracking even begins, the opportunity for outsized gains is clear. Early adopters are locking in their positions now, knowing that the biggest returns come before the public even sees the chart. Solana and XRP: Price Action Heats Up Solana (SOL) continues its steady climb, trading in the $170–$180 range and maintaining its position as a DeFi and developer favorite. Meanwhile, XRP is experiencing renewed whale accumulation and robust trading volumes, currently priced between $2.39 and $2.60. With regulatory clarity and the prospect of an XRP ETF, analysts are targeting $2.85–$3.40 in the near term, and $5.50–$15 by year-end if adoption accelerates. While both SOL and XRP are attracting smart capital, the most aggressive investors are also rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for a shot at exponential early-stage upside. Bitcoin and the Broader Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s anchor, recently surging past $109,500 and drawing renewed institutional and retail interest. Yet, as BTC stabilizes and capital rotates, the spotlight is shifting to altcoins with higher-multiple potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral narrative, capped supply, and record-setting presale momentum, is now the frontrunner for those seeking the next 100x opportunity in the current cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Ethereum whales are quietly loading MAGACOIN FINANCE as Solana and XRP heat up, signaling a pivotal shift in smart capital allocation for 2025. With the largest single whale buy of the year, over $8 million raised, and Stage 8 nearly full, MAGA is setting the standard for early-stage ROI. As the window for entry narrows, analysts agree: the real breakout for MAGACOIN FINANCE is just beginning.

45019010,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=162689,1748040046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45019010.jpeg,Stablecorp Funding Boosts QCAD Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Expansion,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecorp-qcad-stablecoin-funding/,"BitcoinWorld Stablecorp Funding Boosts QCAD Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Expansion In a significant move for the Canadian cryptocurrency landscape, Toronto-based Stablecorp has successfully closed a funding round, securing $1.8 million USD. This investment is specifically earmarked to accelerate the growth and capabilities of QCAD , the company’s pioneering stablecoin pegged directly to the value of the Canadian dollar. Why is This Stablecoin Funding Important? The successful completion of this stablecoin funding round highlights growing investor confidence in the potential of regulated, fiat-backed digital currencies, particularly within specific national markets like Canada. For Stablecorp and its QCAD project, this capital infusion is not just about expansion; it’s about building robust, transparent, and accessible financial infrastructure on the blockchain. The funding round saw participation from notable names in the crypto and venture capital space, including support from Coinbase Ventures . The involvement of a major player like Coinbase Ventures signals a strategic interest in the development of regulated stablecoins that can bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning world of decentralized applications and digital payments. What Does This Mean for QCAD and the Canadian Dollar Stablecoin Market? QCAD stands out as one of the prominent stablecoins designed specifically for the Canadian market, aiming to provide a digital representation of the Canadian dollar that can be easily transacted on blockchain networks. This funding is set to bolster several key areas: Enhanced FX Integrations: Improving the ability to seamlessly convert between QCAD and other currencies, facilitating international transactions and broader adoption. Payment Rail Development: Expanding the use of QCAD for everyday transactions and business payments, making it easier for individuals and companies to use the stablecoin for transferring value. New Trust Structure: Implementing a more robust and transparent structure for holding the reserves that back QCAD . This is crucial for building user trust and ensuring the stablecoin maintains its peg to the Canadian dollar stablecoin value reliably. Transparency around reserves is a critical factor for stablecoin credibility. The focus on these areas indicates Stablecorp’s commitment to making QCAD a practical and trustworthy digital asset for the Canadian economy. By improving infrastructure and transparency, they aim to address some of the common concerns surrounding stablecoins and encourage wider adoption among consumers, businesses, and financial institutions. Who is Stablecorp and What is QCAD? Stablecorp is a Canadian financial technology company focused on building infrastructure for digital assets. Their flagship product, QCAD , was launched to provide a stable, reliable digital asset equivalent to the Canadian dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, QCAD is designed to maintain a stable value, making it suitable for transactions, savings, and acting as a safe haven within the crypto ecosystem during market volatility. The operation of a stablecoin like QCAD typically involves holding reserves (in this case, Canadian dollars or highly liquid, Canadian dollar-denominated assets) equivalent to the amount of QCAD in circulation. The new trust structure aims to provide clearer oversight and verification of these reserves, aligning with best practices for stablecoin issuance and potentially paving the way for increased regulatory acceptance. The Context: Coinbase Ventures and Market Dynamics The news of Stablecorp’s funding round, reported by Betakit, came at a time when one of its investors, Coinbase, was navigating its own set of challenges, including a significant cyberattack and ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite these broader market and company-specific headwinds, the investment from Coinbase Ventures into Stablecorp underscores a strategic long-term view on the importance of stablecoins and the potential for growth in regulated markets like Canada. Coinbase Ventures’ investment portfolio often reflects Coinbase’s strategic priorities, which include fostering the growth of the crypto ecosystem through infrastructure development, expanding global reach, and supporting projects that enhance the utility and accessibility of digital assets. Investing in a Canadian dollar stablecoin aligns with these goals, potentially opening up new corridors for Canadian users on platforms like Coinbase in the future, or simply supporting the broader adoption of stable assets globally. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for QCAD? Benefits: Stability: Offers Canadian users a digital asset without the price volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies. Efficiency: Enables faster, cheaper transactions compared to traditional banking methods, especially for cross-border payments within Canada or internationally. Accessibility: Provides easier access to the crypto ecosystem for Canadians, acting as a stable on-ramp and off-ramp. Transparency: The planned new trust structure aims to increase confidence in the reserve backing. Innovation: Supports the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain use cases denominated in Canadian dollars. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: While Canada has made strides in crypto regulation, the specific framework for stablecoins continues to evolve. Adoption: Widespread adoption by consumers and businesses requires significant education and integration into existing financial systems. Competition: While QCAD is a leading Canadian dollar stablecoin, it faces potential competition from other stablecoin issuers or future digital currencies, including potentially a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the Bank of Canada. Operational Risks: Ensuring the security and reliability of the underlying technology and reserve management is paramount. Actionable Insights: What Should You Know? For individuals and businesses in Canada interested in digital assets: Keep an eye on QCAD’s integration into more platforms and services as a result of this stablecoin funding . Understand the difference between volatile cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like QCAD and how they can serve different purposes in a digital asset portfolio or for transactions. Pay attention to announcements regarding the new trust structure for reserves, as this is key to the stablecoin’s credibility. If you use platforms supported by Coinbase Ventures , this investment might signal future interoperability or support for QCAD . Summary: A Boost for the Canadian Digital Economy Stablecorp’s successful $1.8 million stablecoin funding round, bolstered by participation from investors like Coinbase Ventures , marks a significant step forward for the development and adoption of the Canadian dollar stablecoin , QCAD . By focusing on critical areas like FX integrations, payment rails, and reserve transparency through a new trust structure, Stablecorp is laying the groundwork for QCAD to become a more widely used and trusted digital representation of the Canadian dollar. While challenges remain, particularly regarding regulation and widespread adoption, this investment provides the resources needed to navigate these hurdles and push the Canadian digital asset space forward. The support from prominent investors like Coinbase Ventures underscores the global recognition of the potential for well-regulated, national currency-pegged stablecoins.

45019310,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=162688,1748040643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45019310.jpeg,Trump Memecoin Event: Potential Federal Law Violation Sparks Controversy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-memecoin-law-violation/,"BitcoinWorld Trump Memecoin Event: Potential Federal Law Violation Sparks Controversy The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency continues to generate headlines, and a recent event involving former U.S. President Donald Trump and a specific digital asset has ignited significant debate. According to a report by Forbes, a dinner event held for holders of the Trump Memecoin – often referred to simply as $TRUMP or TRUMP Coin – may have inadvertently crossed a legal line, potentially constituting a Federal Law Violation . What Happened at the Controversial Trump Memecoin Dinner? Picture this: a private dinner gathering specifically for individuals who hold a particular cryptocurrency named after a prominent political figure. This isn’t a campaign rally or an official government function. It’s an event celebrating and engaging with a specific, highly speculative digital asset – the Trump Memecoin . During this dinner, held recently, former President Trump reportedly appeared on a podium. The detail that caught the attention of observers, and subsequently Forbes, was the decoration on that podium: the unmistakable presidential seal. While appearing at an event is one thing, the use of official government symbols in specific contexts is governed by strict regulations in the United States. The event itself highlighted the growing trend of political figures interacting with the crypto space, particularly the phenomenon of memecoins tied to their personas or political movements. For holders of the TRUMP Coin , having the former President attend their dinner was undoubtedly a significant moment, potentially boosting morale and visibility for the digital asset. However, the presence of the presidential seal has raised serious questions about compliance with federal statutes designed to prevent the misuse of such powerful symbols. Decoding the Federal Law Violation Claim At the heart of the Forbes report is the assertion that the use of the presidential seal at this specific, private event linked to a financial asset could constitute a Federal Law Violation . This isn’t a minor technicality; it involves a specific statute designed to protect the integrity and non-partisanship of the symbols representing the highest office in the nation. The core argument is that placing the presidential seal on a podium used by a former President at an event for holders of a coin named after him could create a misleading impression. The law aims to prevent the public from believing that a private activity, organization, or product has official government approval, sponsorship, or endorsement when it does not. In the context of the Trump Memecoin dinner, the concern is that the presence of the seal might suggest that the event, or even the TRUMP Coin itself, somehow carries the imprimatur or approval of the U.S. government or the office of the President, even if it’s a former President using the seal. Understanding the Presidential Seal Law: Rules and Restrictions So, what exactly does the law say about using the presidential seal? The relevant statute is 18 U.S. Code § 713. This federal law explicitly prohibits the knowing display of the presidential seal, or any facsimile thereof, in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the false impression that such use is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the U U.S. government or any department, agency, or official thereof. The purpose of the Presidential Seal Law is clear: to safeguard the dignity and authority of the symbols of the presidency and prevent their exploitation for private, commercial, or partisan purposes. It ensures that when the presidential seal is displayed, it genuinely represents the official capacity and authority of the U.S. government, not a private venture or personal endorsement. Key aspects of the Presidential Seal Law include: Prohibition: It is illegal to use the seal in a way that falsely suggests government approval or authorization. Intent: The law focuses on whether the use is “reasonably calculated to convey the false impression,” meaning the likely perception by an observer is key. Scope: It applies to the seal itself and any representation so similar as to be easily mistaken for it. Penalties: Violators can face significant consequences, including fines and imprisonment for up to six months. While there are specific instances where the seal’s use is permitted (like official government documents, military use, or certain historical/educational contexts), its use in connection with private events, especially those tied to financial assets like the TRUMP Coin , falls into a legally sensitive area. The TRUMP Coin Phenomenon and Political Endorsements The rise of the TRUMP Coin is part of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market: political memecoins. These tokens are created, often on decentralized networks, and gain value primarily through speculation, community hype, and their association with a political figure or movement. The TRUMP Coin ($TRUMP on exchanges) is arguably the most prominent example of a memecoin directly tied to a former President. Holders and proponents often view these coins as a way to support or signal allegiance to the associated figure. However, they are highly volatile, lack underlying fundamentals, and are often susceptible to significant price swings based on news, social media trends, or activities of the associated person. The event where the presidential seal was displayed was, from one perspective, an engagement with this community and, from another, an implicit interaction with a specific financial asset tied to the former President’s name. The question of political endorsements in the crypto space is complex. While individuals are free to express support, using official symbols, especially those protected by law like the presidential seal, in a context that could be perceived as endorsing a private financial product, blurs the lines between personal political activity and the authority of public office. This is precisely the scenario the Presidential Seal Law is designed to prevent. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Political Events The dinner event for Trump Memecoin holders isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of an increasing trend of political figures wading into the crypto world, attending conferences, accepting donations in crypto, or having memecoins created in their likeness. These Crypto Political Events highlight the growing influence and financial power of the crypto community, making it an attractive demographic for politicians. However, this interaction comes with significant risks, both for the politicians and the public. For politicians, there are legal and ethical considerations, particularly regarding endorsements, financial regulations, and the use of official symbols. For the public and crypto investors, these events can be misleading, potentially giving undue credibility to speculative assets like memecoins based on perceived political backing. Understanding the nature of Crypto Political Events requires recognizing that they often operate in a regulatory grey area. Memecoins, in particular, are often difficult to classify and regulate. When combined with the strict rules governing political conduct and the use of official symbols, events like the one involving the Trump Memecoin and the presidential seal underscore the need for caution and clarity. What This Means: Potential Consequences and Future Scrutiny So, what are the potential repercussions of this alleged Federal Law Violation ? While Forbes reported the potential violation, whether any action will be taken remains uncertain. Enforcement of laws like the Presidential Seal Law can depend on various factors, including the specific circumstances, the perceived intent, and the discretion of relevant authorities like the Department of Justice. Potential consequences could range from no action being taken to an investigation, and in theory, the penalties outlined in the statute (fines or imprisonment) could apply if a violation is found and prosecuted. Beyond the legal realm, the event highlights the potential for negative optics and increased scrutiny on how political figures engage with the crypto market, especially with assets as volatile and speculative as memecoins like the TRUMP Coin . This incident could also prompt further discussion and potentially regulatory attention on the phenomenon of Crypto Political Events and the creation and promotion of politically themed tokens. It serves as a stark reminder that even in the fast-paced, often unconventional world of cryptocurrency, established laws regarding the use of official government symbols still apply and can have significant implications. Key Takeaways for Investors and Observers For anyone involved in the crypto space, particularly those interested in political tokens, the situation surrounding the Trump Memecoin dinner offers valuable lessons: Official Symbols Matter: Be highly skeptical of any private event or financial product that prominently features official government symbols like the presidential seal. This is legally restricted for a reason. Distinguish Personal from Official: A political figure’s personal interest or attendance at an event is different from an official government endorsement or approval. The Presidential Seal Law helps reinforce this distinction. Political Memecoins are High-Risk: Tokens like the TRUMP Coin are driven by sentiment and speculation, not fundamentals. Their value can be heavily influenced by political events, statements, and potentially misleading associations. Legal Grey Areas Exist: The intersection of crypto and politics is new and evolving, leading to potential legal ambiguities and risks that participants should be aware of. Due Diligence is Crucial: Always research the legitimacy of events, endorsements, and the assets themselves, regardless of who is involved. This event underscores the importance of understanding not just the technology and market dynamics of crypto, but also the legal and regulatory environment, especially when it overlaps with established political norms and laws. In conclusion, the Forbes report raising the possibility of a Federal Law Violation at a Trump Memecoin event due to the use of the presidential seal serves as a critical reminder of the legal boundaries surrounding the use of official symbols. While the ultimate legal outcome remains to be seen, the incident highlights the complex and sometimes fraught relationship between politics, speculative digital assets like the TRUMP Coin , and the laws designed to protect the integrity of government symbols. As Crypto Political Events become more common, vigilance and a clear understanding of applicable regulations will be essential for all involved.

One recent anecdote making waves in the memecoin news circuit involves a high-profile Trump memecoin dinner and a rather unimpressed crypto influencer . The High Cost of a Crypto Dinner Experience Imagine paying a staggering amount of money – not in traditional currency, but in volatile digital assets – for a single dinner event. That’s precisely what happened recently, according to a report by Fortune. Nicholas Pinto, a 25-year-old social media influencer, reportedly shelled out a hefty sum equivalent to $360,000 at the time, paid entirely in TRUMP token s (specifically, the MVPD token ticker). The event in question was a dinner associated with the Trump memecoin , an asset class that has seen significant attention and volatility, particularly in political cycles. Attendees were presumably hoping for an exclusive experience, networking opportunities, and perhaps close proximity to the former president himself. Crypto Influencer Nicholas Pinto’s Blunt Assessment However, the reality of the event, at least according to Pinto, fell far short of expectations. His candid remarks quickly became a talking point, highlighting a significant disconnect between the perceived value and the actual experience. The Food: Pinto’s description of the culinary offerings was anything but glowing. He bluntly labeled the food as “trash.” For a dinner costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto value, one would expect a gourmet experience, not something warranting such a harsh review. The Speech: Beyond the meal, the substance of the event also seemed to disappoint. Pinto described Donald Trump’s speech as “pretty much like bullshit.” This suggests a lack of meaningful content or engagement, further diminishing the perceived value of the high-priced ticket. The Access: A key draw for such events is often the opportunity to interact with the central figure. Pinto claimed that attendees didn’t even come into close contact with Trump. This lack of access, despite the enormous cost, appears to be a major point of contention for the influencer. Pinto’s experience underscores a critical challenge in the world of high-ticket events funded by volatile assets: expectations versus reality. The hype surrounding a political figure and a popular Trump memecoin might build immense anticipation, but the execution of the event itself might not live up to the monetary or symbolic investment. Understanding the TRUMP Token and Political Memecoins The fact that the payment was made in TRUMP token s adds another layer of complexity to this story. Unlike traditional payments, paying with a volatile asset like a memecoin carries inherent risks and implications. What exactly is the TRUMP token (MVPD)? It’s one of several cryptocurrencies that have emerged, often capitalizing on the political landscape. These tokens are typically highly speculative, driven by community sentiment, social media trends, and political developments rather than underlying fundamentals or utility. Their value can skyrocket or plummet based on news cycles, endorsements, or even simple online chatter. Paying $360,000 worth of a volatile asset means that the actual dollar value of the payment could have fluctuated significantly before and after the transaction. It’s a high-stakes gamble for both the payer and potentially the recipient, depending on how quickly the tokens are converted or managed. This event shines a spotlight on the broader phenomenon of political memecoins. They represent a unique, albeit often controversial, intersection of finance, technology, and political fandom. While some see them as a way to engage supporters and potentially raise funds, others view them as purely speculative gambles or even potential scams. What This Memecoin News Tells Us About the Market The story of Pinto’s disappointing crypto dinner provides valuable insights into several aspects of the current crypto landscape: The Power of Hype: The willingness to spend $360,000 worth of tokens on a dinner speaks volumes about the power of hype and perceived exclusivity within certain crypto circles, especially those tied to specific personalities or movements. Volatility Risks: Paying for goods or services with highly volatile assets like memecoins is inherently risky. The value of the payment can change dramatically in a short period. Expectation Management: High-profile events, particularly those linked to charismatic figures or trending assets, can generate unrealistic expectations. Attendees might anticipate unparalleled access or value that isn’t actually delivered. Influencer Economy: This event highlights the significant capital circulating among some crypto influencer s and their willingness to spend it on experiences they believe will offer unique value or networking opportunities. The rapid spread of this story through memecoin news outlets and social media also demonstrates the intense interest and scrutiny surrounding these novel assets and the figures associated with them. Beyond the Plate: Why Attend a Crypto Dinner Like This? Given the reported disappointment, one might wonder about the motivations for attending such an event, especially at such a high cost in TRUMP token s. Several factors could be at play: Networking: Events like this can attract individuals with significant wealth or influence in the crypto or political spheres. Networking opportunities could be a primary driver. Publicity/Content: For a crypto influencer , attending and reporting on such a unique event generates content and publicity, which is valuable in their line of work. The controversy or exclusivity itself can be part of the appeal. Belief in the Asset/Figure: Attendees might be strong believers in the political figure or the associated Trump memecoin , viewing the expense as an investment in a community or movement. Exclusivity: The high price tag creates an aura of exclusivity, appealing to those who wish to be part of an elite group. However, Pinto’s experience serves as a cautionary tale that even with a massive investment, the tangible benefits and overall satisfaction are not guaranteed. The Influence Game: What Does This Mean for Crypto Influencer s? Nicholas Pinto’s willingness to share his negative experience is notable. It adds a layer of perceived authenticity in a space often criticized for hype and shilling. His candor, while potentially burning bridges, could also build trust with his audience by demonstrating a willingness to speak truth to power, or at least, truth to expensive dinners. The incident also raises questions about the role and responsibility of crypto influencer s. Their actions, investments, and public statements can impact their followers’ perceptions and decisions. Paying a massive sum in a specific token for an event inherently ties the influencer to that token and the associated figure, for better or worse. It highlights the pressures and incentives influencers face, navigating the line between creating engaging content, pursuing opportunities, and potentially promoting assets or events that might not deliver value. Challenges and Actionable Insights The story of the disappointing Trump memecoin dinner brings several challenges to the forefront: Challenge: Volatility Risk. Paying or being paid in volatile assets means the value is constantly in flux. Challenge: Hype vs. Reality. High-profile events can be overhyped, leading to significant disappointment. Challenge: Access and Value. Expensive tickets do not always guarantee meaningful access or a high-quality experience. Challenge: Influencer Credibility. Influencers need to balance opportunity with maintaining trust with their audience. Based on these challenges, here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insight: Do Your Own Research (DYOR). Before investing in tokens like the TRUMP token or spending large sums on related events, thoroughly research the asset, the event organizers, and what is actually being offered. Actionable Insight: Manage Expectations. Be realistic about what you will gain from high-cost, high-hype events. Exclusive access or guaranteed returns are rarely part of the deal. Actionable Insight: Be Wary of Hype. Don’t let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or the perceived status of an event dictate your financial decisions, especially in the volatile memecoin market. Actionable Insight: Consider Payment Method. Understand the risks involved when paying for goods or services using volatile cryptocurrencies. Summary: A Costly Lesson in the World of Political Memecoins and Crypto Events The tale of the crypto influencer who paid $360,000 worth of TRUMP token s for a disappointing dinner is more than just a quirky anecdote. It’s a potent illustration of the dynamics at play in the current crypto landscape: the intense interest in political memecoins, the significant capital wielded by some figures, the risks associated with volatile assets, and the potential for high-profile events to fall short of lofty expectations. As the memecoin news cycle continues to churn out stories, this incident serves as a vivid reminder for investors and enthusiasts alike to approach hype-driven opportunities and exclusive events with a healthy dose of skepticism and rigorous due diligence. Not every expensive seat at the table guarantees a satisfying meal or meaningful access.

If so, you’ve likely noticed the persistent strength of TRON (TRX). Recent analysis suggests that the TRX bullish momentum is far from over, presenting an interesting scenario for traders and investors. Decoding the Persistent TRX Bullish Momentum The current performance of TRX has caught the eye of many market observers. Unlike typical scenarios where extended upward trends show signs of fatigue, TRX continues to push forward. This resilience is a key factor driving the current optimistic sentiment around the cryptocurrency. Several factors contribute to this sustained momentum: Network Activity: The TRON network maintains high levels of transaction volume and user engagement, driven by its focus on dApps, stablecoins, and a low-fee structure. Stablecoin Integration: TRON is a significant player in the stablecoin market, particularly with USDT, which drives utility and demand for TRX for transaction fees. Ecosystem Growth: Continued development and adoption within the TRON ecosystem contribute to the underlying value proposition of TRX . What Does CryptoQuant Data Reveal? Insights from on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant are crucial for understanding market dynamics beyond simple price charts. According to a recent observation shared by CryptoQuant on X (formerly Twitter), TRX exhibits high buying pressure. Typically, a sustained period of high buying pressure can sometimes signal an impending price top. This is because intense buying can exhaust available supply at certain price levels, leading to a potential reversal as demand wanes or profit-taking begins. However, the notable point highlighted by analysts, including Joao Wedson, Founder & CEO of Alphractal, is that despite this significant buying pressure, TRX has not shown the expected signs of peaking. This divergence from the usual pattern suggests that the demand absorbing this pressure is substantial and persistent, indicating potential for further price appreciation. Expert Price Prediction : Is Further Upside Likely? The observation from CryptoQuant and analysts like Joao Wedson feeds into the current price prediction narrative for TRX . The lack of a top signal, even amidst high buying pressure, suggests that the market believes there is still room for growth. What could this mean for the future TRX price prediction ? Continued Ascents: If buying pressure remains strong and is met with continued demand without significant sell-offs, the price could continue its upward trajectory. Target Levels: Analysts often look at historical resistance levels and Fibonacci extensions to identify potential next targets. A persistent bullish trend suggests these higher levels are becoming increasingly probable. Market Sentiment: The positive sentiment generated by this analysis can itself become a self-fulfilling prophecy, attracting more buyers. It’s important to remember that while current data is positive, the crypto market is inherently volatile, and predictions are not guarantees. How Does TRX Fit into Broader Crypto Market Trends? Understanding the performance of TRX requires context within the broader crypto market . While Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead market cycles, altcoins like TRX can exhibit unique trends driven by their specific ecosystems and use cases. Currently, the overall crypto market sentiment is influenced by various factors, including: Macroeconomic conditions Regulatory developments Institutional adoption trends Technological advancements TRX’s ability to maintain bullish momentum despite potential market fluctuations or sector-specific rotations highlights its relative strength or unique market positioning, possibly due to its utility-driven demand and stablecoin infrastructure. Actionable Insights for TRX Holders and Potential Investors Given the current analysis indicating sustained TRX bullish momentum , what should you consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange flows, active addresses, and transaction volume on platforms like CryptoQuant for early signs of trend changes. Set Price Alerts: If you’re looking to enter or exit a position, setting price alerts can help you act quickly on market movements. Risk Management: Always employ sound risk management strategies. The absence of a top signal doesn’t eliminate the possibility of a sudden reversal. Use stop-loss orders if trading. Stay Informed: Follow updates from the TRON foundation, news related to the crypto market , and analyses from reputable sources. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This article provides insights based on available data and analysis, but it is not financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. The observation that high buying pressure isn’t currently leading to a peak is a significant point for the TRX price prediction . It suggests underlying strength that could propel the price higher. Conclusion: The Unfolding Story of TRX ‘s Ascent The narrative for TRX remains compelling. The persistent bullish momentum , validated by on-chain data from sources like CryptoQuant , indicates a market dynamic where strong demand is continuously absorbing buying pressure without the typical signs of exhaustion. While no price prediction is guaranteed in the volatile crypto market , the current technical and on-chain signals point towards potential for further upside for TRX . Keeping a close watch on market developments and managing risk are essential as this story unfolds.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.” Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.” He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets. Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: Cointelegraph Akshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?” He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.

Zooming out, the S&P 500’s average valuation has been gradually rising for decades, driven by factors such as low interest rates, growing corporate gains, and investor optimism about technology. However, high valuations have also coincided with periods of market corrections, like the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. S&P 500 P/E ratio since inception. Source: Multipl According to Akshay, a way to combat this overheating is to open up certain markets to retail investors, a lofty goal that some sectors of crypto, like RWA tokenization , aim to facilitate. Akshay noted that some entrepreneurs had tried this before, but the available technology didn’t support this view. “[Crypto] starts with the game, and very quickly becomes profound.” “What it gives you is the ability for you to financialize all the productive assets in an economy, so you can have anybody who participates in that economy be an owner of that economy,” he said.

Market Turns Green as Bitcoin Charges Past $111K—Here’s What That Means for Qubetics, XRP, and NEAR",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-buy-right-now-market-turns-green-as-bitcoin/,"Is the market flashing green for a reason or is it just another temporary push? Bitcoin’s breakout past $111,861 has reignited bullish momentum across the board, pushing the crypto market back into price discovery territory. As reported today, this surge isn’t isolated—it’s spilling into the broader market with Ethereum, Solana, and several other altcoins bouncing back as confidence returns. This shift is backed by a clear uptick in trading activity and liquidity as macro sentiment stabilizes and crypto-specific narratives take center stage. In moments like this, coins with a strong foundational thesis and ongoing development cycles typically outperform—making timing, narrative, and utility more crucial than ever. Qubetics , currently in its structured presale stage, stands out for exactly those reasons: its strong ecosystem utility and clear roadmap offer a different kind of value play in a momentum-driven market. While many crypto projects are still catching up to real-world integration, Qubetics ($TICS) is already solving long-standing issues that past tokens couldn’t fully address. By offering a decentralized VPN built directly into its ecosystem, Qubetics answers growing concerns around online privacy, data monopolies, and censorship. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining traction as major wallet holders are increasingly aligning with global payment firms, and Near Protocol is being rated “very bullish” by nearly half of its user base. These signs of activity across the board point to a market where fundamentals are beginning to matter again. In this context, understanding how Qubetics compares alongside XRP and Near offers a clear perspective on identifying the best crypto to buy right now—not just for short-term surges but for long-term functionality and adaptability. The Real-World Case for Qubetics: How Its dVPN Is Solving Privacy Issues at Scale Qubetics is going beyond speculative tokenomics to address practical internet problems—starting with online privacy. Its decentralized VPN (dVPN) operates through a peer-to-peer blockchain protocol that doesn’t rely on centralized data routing. Unlike traditional VPN services that may log user data or be forced to comply with government surveillance demands, Qubetics’ dVPN offers censorship-resistant connectivity with no single point of failure. This makes it especially beneficial for journalists in high-censorship regions, remote professionals needing secure cross-border access, or even enterprise firms looking to decentralize their cybersecurity frameworks. By rewarding bandwidth providers through $TICS tokens, Qubetics also builds an incentive structure that naturally supports service stability and reach—without relying on centralized vendors. For example, a freelance researcher in a politically restricted country could use Qubetics’ dVPN to bypass firewalls without fear of being traced, as traffic routing is anonymized and encrypted. Similarly, a U.S.-based startup dealing with confidential IP could ensure its data remains outside third-party access points. What sets Qubetics apart is the added benefit of multi-hop routing and complete encryption—both user identity and usage logs are protected from all forms of tracing. And since the protocol is open and self-sustaining, it aligns with broader Web3 goals of sovereignty and user ownership. This makes Qubetics not just a speculative presale—it’s an application-driven network that’s actually shaping how privacy-first internet infrastructure could look. That’s why it continues to gain momentum in a market now leaning heavily toward utility-driven tokens—and it positions Qubetics as the best crypto to buy right now for users seeking more than just market exposure. Qubetics Presale Hits Stage 35 with $17.2M Raised and 513M Tokens Sold—Next Price Hike in 7 Days The Qubetics presale isn’t just another crypto campaign—it’s a fully structured rollout with predictable progression and real-world integration. Currently in Stage 35, Qubetics tokens are priced at $0.2785. With over 513 million $TICS sold, more than $17.2 million raised, and over 26,800 holders onboard, this presale reflects more than speculative excitement—it reflects community trust. Each presale stage lasts exactly 7 days, and prices increase by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM, ensuring that early adopters are consistently rewarded for their timing. With the mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, this phase offers a timely opportunity to buy before exchange listings and utility unlocks begin. For those calculating returns, the upside is substantial. At current prices, an investment of $5,000 translates into 17,950 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s $17,950 back—already a 258.95% ROI. At a $5 price point, the same bag delivers $89,750 (1,694.74% ROI), and if it reaches $15 post-mainnet, the same investment becomes $269,250, marking a 5,284.21% ROI. These projections aren’t random guesses—they’re based on actual sales structure and historical returns from tokens with utility-focused launches. This structured system, coupled with the growing interest in privacy solutions, makes Qubetics presale a standout among many offerings right now. That’s why it holds weight in the conversation around the best crypto to buy right now , especially for those exploring utility-based early-stage entries in the best crypto presale space. XRP Whale Activity Heats Up as PayFi Pushes Toward Global Remittance Integration XRP has captured fresh attention after a series of whale moves aligned with emerging payment infrastructure. According to a May 22 update, multiple top XRP holders are now becoming affiliated with Remittix, a fintech platform aiming to power cross-border transactions through the blockchain. Simultaneously, PayFi—a separate payments entity—has started using XRP’s ledger to explore frictionless global settlements. These are not minor partnerships; both platforms are considered to be at the forefront of transforming international value transfer, a space that Ripple Labs has long aimed to dominate. This activity follows a sustained effort by Ripple to rebuild after regulatory headwinds. Now that legal battles have subsided and institutions are warming back up to Ripple’s offerings, the use of XRP for real-world remittances may be on track to expand faster than expected. Such partnerships suggest a higher transaction volume and more consistent liquidity in the months to come, which is particularly relevant for those watching XRP’s role beyond speculation. The move also points to a shift in strategy—from platform-level integrations to user-level adoption—putting XRP in an increasingly relevant position within the global payments infrastructure. Near Protocol Scores “Very Bullish” Sentiment as Price Forecast Shows Steady Rebound Near Protocol is showing signs of resilience despite broader market volatility. As of May 21, the token is trading around $2.83, with a +0.78% daily gain—small but meaningful during this kind of rebound phase. What’s more important is the platform’s long-term forecast: user-submitted projections suggest a potential 5% growth in the short term, with a steady upward trajectory through 2030. The current sentiment score reveals that 49.12% of participants rated NEAR as “Very Bullish,” supported by consistent engagement across Near’s application ecosystem and its scalable tech stack. This sentiment trend is notable considering the market had recently experienced stagnation among mid-cap tokens. NEAR, however, has continued to show upward price momentum and strong community trust. This level of consistent bullish sentiment often precedes heavier institutional interest, particularly in protocols offering both developer tooling and end-user simplicity. The combination of organic adoption, positive user perception, and realistic growth expectations places NEAR in a strong category of layer-1 tokens that aren’t driven solely by temporary market surges. As Bitcoin Surges, Market Stability Improves—But Long-Term Picks Still Matter Today’s crypto market trend—Bitcoin’s clean break above $111,861—is more than just a price headline. It’s the kind of event that resets sentiment and pulls liquidity into both majors and altcoins. With broader green candles appearing across charts, it’s clear this shift is breathing new life into previously sluggish portfolios. For XRP, it adds a tailwind to institutional remittance adoption. For NEAR, it reinforces community confidence, which is already trending high. And for Qubetics—which is currently in presale—this macro movement validates its long-term thesis. Unlike many tokens tied to hype cycles, Qubetics offers structural stability due to its fixed weekly 10% price jumps, giving early buyers a predictable growth runway. Conclusion: Why Now’s the Moment to Watch These Three From XRP’s strategic positioning in global payments to Near Protocol’s steady bullish sentiment and Qubetics’ utility-backed growth path, each of these projects presents a timely opportunity in the current bullish cycle. What separates them from short-term plays is the presence of real integrations, measured adoption, and clear incentive structures. XRP is finally seeing strategic traction post-litigation, NEAR is riding high on trust and consistent performance forecasts, and Qubetics is building an infrastructure layer for digital privacy—something the crypto space needs now more than ever. For those watching the charts while evaluating substance, these three deserve a deeper look. For those eyeing early-phase utility projects with proven ROI systems and ecosystem potential, this is the right time to join this best crypto presale and experience what may soon be one of the best crypto to buy right now.

While Bitcoin and Litecoin continue to anchor the market, all eyes are now on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum—each presenting compelling reasons to believe that a staggering 10,000% return could be within reach for early adopters. Among these, MAGACOIN PRESALE’s presale is rapidly becoming the focal point for those seeking the next crypto phenomenon. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Sensation With Monumental Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is electrifying the crypto sphere as its presale approaches a critical juncture, having already surpassed $8 million in contributions. With each stage filling faster than the last and the entry price still under $0.001, market forecasters are signaling a potential windfall of 10,000% or more for those who position themselves early. The project’s limited supply of 100 billion tokens, combined with rigorous security audits and a politically charged narrative, is sparking a frenzy of both retail and institutional interest. As the countdown to the $0.007 listing ticks on, MAGA is emerging as a once-in-a-cycle chance for exponential returns—a prospect that is drawing comparisons to the meteoric rises of other viral tokens, but with enhanced transparency and strategic tokenomics. XRP: Surging Confidence and Institutional Tailwinds XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism, currently priced above $2.30 and bolstered by regulatory victories and the introduction of CME futures. Market strategists anticipate a climb toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bold outlooks even eyeing $4.50 if current trends persist. The resolution of Ripple’s legal battles and the green light for institutional participation have cleared the path for broader adoption. While XRP’s trajectory is undeniably positive, the allure of early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—where the runway for explosive gains remains wide open—is proving irresistible to forward-thinking investors. Ethereum: Robust Tech and Expanding Horizons Ethereum continues to stand as a pillar of innovation, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 amidst ongoing network enhancements and growing institutional engagement. Despite market fluctuations, ETH’s technical foundation remains sound, with analysts projecting a move toward $3,000 and potentially beyond as upgrades and adoption accelerate. Some visionary forecasts even hint at a five-figure future, though such a leap would require a seismic shift in market dynamics. While Ethereum offers a stable and proven platform, the most ambitious capital is gravitating toward high-growth presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the promise of outsized returns is impossible to ignore. Bitcoin and Litecoin: Steady Hands in a Volatile Market Bitcoin maintains its dominance, trading above $100,000 and attracting unprecedented institutional inflows. Analysts suggest that a push toward $120,000 or higher is plausible if bullish sentiment endures. Litecoin, meanwhile, remains a reliable presence, offering stability and liquidity in a market often defined by turbulence. Yet, as savvy investors pivot toward higher-reward opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is emerging as the destination of choice for those aiming to ride the next wave of crypto wealth creation. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Closing Thoughts Analysts are unanimous in highlighting the extraordinary potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum as the market gears up for a possible 10,000% rally. With MAGA’s presale nearing its final stages, a fixed $0.007 listing price, and a community growing by the day, the project is commanding attention as the standout early-stage play of 2025. For those seeking to capitalize on the next major crypto breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the clear frontrunner.

If this trend continues, BTC may see further price appreciation in the near term. Buyers Regain Control Of Bitcoin Spot Market According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by crypto analyst ibrahimcosar, buyers appear to be dominating the BTC spot market. The analyst observed that the Bitcoin Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has shifted back into green territory. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD measures the difference between taker buy and taker sell volumes on spot exchanges over time. A rising Spot Taker CVD indicates that aggressive buyers are dominating the market, signalling potential bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market – New ATH Soon? BTC Spot Taker CVD turning green is signficant. Most notably, it means buy orders have regained dominance after an extended period in which sell orders led the market. A higher volume of buy orders over time suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum may persist. As shown in the chart shared by ibrahimcosar, the CVD remained mostly red for the majority of Q1 2025 – indicating strong selling pressure. This selling behavior aligned with BTC’s price action, which saw the asset fall from its previous ATH in January to a low of around $76,000 in April. The fact that BTC’s Spot Taker CVD has turned green while the asset is setting fresh ATHs makes this trend especially noteworthy. It indicates that buyers are willing to accumulate BTC even at historically high prices, likely in anticipation of continued upside. That said, recent price action might temporarily interrupt BTC’s momentum. In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that BTC could soon break down from its current range of $110,400 to $111,100. A Different Kind Of Rally Typically, BTC hitting a new ATH is usually met with wider market euphoria, leading to a sharp price decline that catches most investors off-guard. However, experts opine that the current rally is different from previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk suggests that new and short-term BTC investors are sitting on substantial unrealized profits, and not showing any signs of panic selling amid the cryptocurrency’s price surge to new highs. Similarly, whale reaction to BTC’s bullish price trajectory has been mixed. While new whales have been taking major profits during the ongoing rally, old whales have resisted selling their holdings, showing minimal selling activity. Finally, the neutral funding rates in the BTC futures market reinforce the idea that the current rally is more organic and less driven by speculation than those in the past. At press time, BTC trades at $108,553, down 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

While BTC’s ascent captures headlines, savvy investors are increasingly directing attention toward altcoins with explosive growth potential—notably MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana. With XRP and Ethereum also posting strong technicals, the stage is set for a dynamic period of gains across the digital asset landscape. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon With 25x–35x Potential While Bitcoin’s trajectory is impressive, the most aggressive capital is flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly establishing itself as 2025’s leading presale opportunity. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion, analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum persists. The project’s capped supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation by both retail and institutional investors. As each stage fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGA is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with enhanced transparency and scarcity-driven tokenomics. Bitcoin: The Macro Beacon With Unprecedented Momentum Bitcoin has recently shattered records, trading above $111,000 amid a wave of institutional inflows, corporate adoption, and robust ETF demand. Analysts now suggest that a sustained rally could propel BTC to $200,000 by year-end, driven by a combination of macroeconomic tailwinds, reduced supply post-halving, and global liquidity expansion. The options market reflects this bullish outlook, with traders placing bets on BTC reaching $300,000 by June. As Bitcoin solidifies its role as digital gold, the market’s risk appetite is broadening—opening the door for high-upside altcoin plays. Solana: Technical Breakout and Ecosystem Growth Solana is another standout, with its price consolidating between $158 and $175 as it builds momentum for the next leg higher. Analysts are eyeing a breakout above $175, which could open the door to a retest of $183 and beyond. Long-term forecasts suggest SOL could reach $240–$270 later in 2025, supported by robust DeFi activity, developer engagement, and whale accumulation. As Solana’s ecosystem matures, the network is attracting both institutional attention and speculative capital, making it a top pick for those seeking significant gains alongside Bitcoin. XRP and Ethereum: Strong Fundamentals and Upside Catalysts XRP is trading above $2.30, buoyed by legal clarity, the launch of CME futures, and ongoing ETF speculation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85–$3.40 in the near term, with some optimistic scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if bullish momentum persists. Ethereum, meanwhile, remains the backbone of DeFi and Web3, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades. Some analysts project ETH could reach $6,700 by year-end if institutional adoption and network improvements continue to accelerate. While both XRP and ETH offer stability and long-term value, the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. Near Protocol: Building Momentum for the Next Cycle Near Protocol (NEAR) is quietly building momentum, trading near $2.93 and showing strong technicals and developer activity. Analysts expect NEAR to stabilize at current levels before pushing higher in 2026, with long-term forecasts suggesting significant growth as the network’s scalability and ecosystem attract more users. While NEAR is a dependable hold, the most dramatic returns are currently being sought in presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin’s journey toward $200,000 is igniting market-wide confidence, but the real action is unfolding in high-upside altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are positioned for significant gains, with MAGA’s presale momentum and Solana’s technical strength drawing both retail and institutional capital. XRP and Ethereum remain core holdings, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender of 2025. As Bitcoin leads the charge, the window for early entry into the next crypto supercycle is closing fast.

This strategic focus on functionality and community engagement is attracting significant whale interest, signaling a shift towards more utility-driven meme coins. INPEPE’s Origins Uncovered: A Forgotten Founder Returns to Reclaim the Meme Throne Insiders suggest that a co-founder of the original Pepe coin, who was sidelined before its meteoric rise, is now leading the INPEPE project.

The Math Doesn’t Lie: INPEPE’s 100x Path Looks Realer by the Day With a current price of $0.0000002051 per token, INPEPE presents a compelling opportunity for early investors. The project’s presale has already raised over $150,000 out of a $505,881 goal, indicating strong market interest. Analysts suggest that if INPEPE reaches price levels comparable to established memecoins like PEPE, investors could realize returns exceeding 60 times their initial investment. Additionally, INPEPE offers a staking reward of up to 4754% APY, incentivizing long-term holding and contributing to supply scarcity. Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is rapidly emerging as a next-generation memecoin, strategically placed at the crossroads of Web3 innovation and the thriving $25+ billion influencer economy. Unlike conventional meme coins, INPEPE is designed to serve as the primary currency for influencer transactions.

Legacy tokens like Polkadot and Polygon are starting to face hesitation, weighed down by technical hurdles and market uncertainty. Amid this shift, Unstaked ($UNSD) is emerging with a fresh narrative. Backed by artificial intelligence, DeFi-based incentives, and over $6.8 million in presale funding, it is capturing the attention of both retail participants and large wallet holders. Its platform rewards smart engagement and outlines a roadmap focused on long-term Web3 utility. With a current presale stage 14 price of $0.009545 and a projected launch value of $0.1819, Unstaked offers ROIs of up to 27x for early holders. As Polkadot and Polygon struggle to regain momentum, Unstaked is quickly gaining ground in the race for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Polkadot Struggles to Hold Gains Ahead of ETF Rulings Polkadot saw a 30% surge that lifted DOT above $5.30, but the momentum quickly faded as the price fell back to around $4.82. This move came just ahead of critical ETF decisions from the U.S. SEC, with Grayscale’s verdict expected on June 11 and 21Shares following on June 24. These decisions could serve as a spark or further suppress the current drift. Technically, DOT is trading below the Ichimoku Cloud, suggesting bearish sentiment. RSI has slipped below the neutral zone, and support at $4.45 is now under pressure. With capital inflows slowing, traders are approaching DOT with increased caution while exploring new high-upside alternatives. Polygon’s zkEVM Upgrade Could Shape POL’s Long-Term Value Polygon is progressing with its zkEVM rollout, a key step in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap aimed at improving scalability and reducing gas fees. This upgrade positions the network as a powerful Layer 2 solution for Ethereum and supports its transition from MATIC to the newly launched POL token, which is trading near $0.258. Price forecasts vary across platforms. CoinCodex expects a small climb to $0.27, while Coinpedia predicts $0.47 over the next year. DigitalCoinPrice offers the boldest target at $3.91 by late 2025. As adoption of the Agglayer Breakout Program expands, real-world traction will be the deciding factor for POL’s growth. New AI Coin Unstaked Goes Viral with 27x ROI & $1M Giveaway Unstaked is making waves in a market dominated by legacy networks chasing ETF approvals and technical upgrades. With $6.8 million raised and a presale price of $0.009545 in stage 14, the project stands out by offering a clear path to a $0.1819 launch value. That scenario presents ROIs of up to 27x, giving early participants a compelling reason to pay attention. The platform operates on a Proof of Intelligence model, which shifts rewards away from passive holding and toward informed, quality-driven participation. Users earn based on decisions and engagement, creating a system that feels more like an evolving ecosystem than a typical crypto launch. This intelligent structure adds long-term credibility to Unstaked’s model. The roadmap outlines future integration with utility-driven dApps, access to DeFi tools, and a strong emphasis on liquidity protection. These features are designed to reduce manipulation and encourage steady growth. Looking ahead, Unstaked also plans to scale into core Web3 functions such as decentralized identity, secure data exchange, and governance systems. Driving community energy is a $1,000,000 giveaway. Twenty winners will each receive $50,000 in $UNSD, with entry based on completing tasks, referrals, and a $100 contribution. Unstaked is quickly becoming a serious entry in the best crypto to buy 2025 conversation, powered by real structure and smart engagement. The Future of Crypto Polkadot’s ETF potential and Polygon’s zkEVM rollout may dominate headlines, but neither offers the immediate clarity or user-centric design that Unstaked brings. DOT is showing signs of slowing, and POL’s future depends heavily on broader adoption, which remains uncertain in the near term. Unstaked, on the other hand, is gaining real traction with over $6.8 million raised, a 27x return projection, and a Web3 roadmap that prioritizes utility and intelligence. For those exploring the best crypto to buy in 2025, Unstaked is no longer just an early-stage contender. It is building the foundation for something far more impactful.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Are Leading the Political Crypto Surge",https://thecoinrise.com/500-to-1m-magacoin-finance-bitcoin-and-xrp-are-leading-the-political-crypto-surge/,"A new era is dawning in the crypto world, where political narratives and market momentum are converging to create extraordinary opportunities. While Bitcoin remains the bedrock of digital finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are surging ahead as the vanguard of a political crypto movement. With Solana and Aptos also in the mix, early investors are positioning for what could be the most lucrative cycle yet—where a modest $500 investment might just pave the way to a million-dollar windfall. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Meme Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just another meme token; it’s a cultural force driving the 2025 political memecoin boom. Unlike fleeting trends that fade as quickly as they rise, MAGA stands out by combining a compelling political identity with real market traction and community engagement. The project’s presale has already attracted thousands of buyers and raised millions, with analysts projecting 25x–35x returns for those who enter before the $0.007 listing. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to sustain attention and volume—turning viral energy into lasting momentum. Built-in upside mechanics, a scarcity-focused supply, and a grassroots-driven community are fueling organic demand and real transaction activity. As traders migrate from established coins like XRP and SHIBA, MAGA is rapidly becoming the go-to destination for those seeking the next crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin: The Foundation of the Crypto Revolution Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, trading above $100,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors and ETFs. Analysts forecast a possible run to $116,000–$137,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. As Bitcoin solidifies its role as digital gold, its strength provides a stable backdrop for the explosive growth of political and narrative-driven altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum XRP is riding a wave of optimism, buoyed by regulatory breakthroughs, ETF speculation, and strong technical momentum. Currently trading above $2.30, XRP has surged more than 300% since late 2024 and is now poised for further gains. Analysts project a move to $2.80–$3.40 by June, with some scenarios even eyeing $5.50 by year-end if adoption accelerates. With pending ETF proposals and growing institutional interest, XRP is positioned for a supply shock that could drive prices to new highs. The combination of regulatory clarity, real-world utility, and political tailwinds makes XRP a core holding for those betting on the next phase of crypto adoption. Solana and Aptos: Technical Strength in a Shifting Market Solana remains a top Layer-1 contender, with robust DeFi activity and developer engagement supporting its price near $170. Aptos, meanwhile, is gaining traction with network upgrades and expanding partnerships. Both tokens offer strong fundamentals, but for investors seeking the highest upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is where the real action lies.

The space is seeing renewed interest with investors pouring into coins that blend hype with community rewards. Web3 ai is grabbing headlines with a $777K giveaway, open to anyone holding a minimum of $100 worth of $WAI in its ongoing presale. Dogecoin holds its position as a meme giant, Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 launch is gaining traction, and Pepe keeps returning to the spotlight with its surprise market movements. Each of these projects is driving serious buzz. Among them, Web3 ai stands tall by mixing viral appeal with long-term use cases. Together, these four are shaping what many consider the top cryptos to buy now. Web3 ai ($WAI): $100 Qualifies for $777K Prize Pool and 1,747% ROI Web3 ai is changing how crypto presales are perceived. With a huge $777,000 giveaway and a low entry of at least $100, the project is turning heads among both new buyers and experienced traders. This low-barrier format gives regular users a chance to enter something that feels exclusive, like a jackpot. This model triggers viral appeal, similar to lottery mechanics, but with more than just luck involved. Unlike random prizes, entering the giveaway means becoming a $WAI holder, and that comes with genuine potential. Priced at $0.000383 in stage 6, it targets a listing at $0.005242, which equals an ROI of up to 1747%. So far, it has brought in nearly $5 million in presale funding. With only a $100 purchase needed to qualify and 10 winners sharing the giveaway, the excitement is spreading quickly. Web3 ai shows that success doesn’t require billion-dollar support, just the right mix of tools, timing, and vision. Dogecoin (DOGE): Community-Driven Meme Coin Dogecoin’s name remains strong thanks to its loyal fan base and unmatched popularity. While it started as a joke, DOGE now has a real place in the crypto world, with notable mentions from Elon Musk and speculation about possible integration with X. In 2025, meme coin excitement is back, and DOGE is once again gaining attention. For many, its brand power and community size make it one of the top cryptos to buy now. Though its wild 100x days might be over, it still has the strength to climb during retail-driven bull waves. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Real Ecosystem With Growing Features Shiba Inu’s growth story is no longer just about memes. It has launched Shibarium, a Layer 2 chain, and is now adding staking, governance features, and virtual world components. The “ShibArmy” continues to push for more adoption and development. In the search for top cryptos to buy now, SHIB is evolving into a serious Web3 player. With Ethereum’s high gas fees, Shibarium could draw more users. At its still-low price, SHIB offers potential for those seeking affordable entry into a growing platform. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Energy Still Turning Heads in 2025 Pepe came into the spotlight with its wild moves in 2023, and it’s not done yet. Its strength lies in its pure meme energy and unpredictable price action, earning listings on major exchanges. Pepe’s link to internet culture sets it apart. While risky, that very nature makes it one of the top cryptos to buy now. The coin’s price jumps catch many off guard, rewarding those who act fast. For those who thrive on volatility, Pepe may be both the wildest and most profitable play. Final Thoughts The strongest contenders in 2025 aren’t winning just by building tech, they’re gaining by standing out, exciting users, and offering real incentives. Web3 ai is drawing attention through its $777K giveaway and user-first design, showing how presales can build momentum by appealing to everyday buyers. Meanwhile, Dogecoin enjoys legacy status and loyalty, Shiba Inu is turning into a real DeFi project with Shibarium, and Pepe taps meme culture to fuel surprise runs. These projects prove that the top cryptos to buy now are those that connect with people, deliver excitement, and reward early support.

A lot of analysts and crypto fans believe it’s coming, but some are also convinced that when it does arrive, it will be the biggest one yet. One of those is Dan Krupka, head of Coin Bureau Research. He shared a video on Coin Bureau Trading’s YouTube channel, sharing his thoughts and expertise on why this altcoin season just might explode (in a good way). For starters, Krupka outlines spot Ethereum ETF approvals and rate cuts by the Fed, which are expected to come late this year. Additionally, crypto-friendly sentiment is increasing, especially in the US, adding fuel to the possibility of an altcoin season. Plus, the potential ETF applications for Solana, Layer-2 innovations, and growing user bases on new chains could all play an important role in a possibly huge altcoin season.

Neither avenue is supportive of employment growth.” The economists say that reshoring manufacturing jobs would likely take “many years and come at high cost.” “US labor costs are a hurdle. Labor cost differentials with the rest of the world require US manufacturing firms to be highly capital-intensive to compete in a global marketplace. Thus, an expansion in manufacturing employment would require significant capital investment. In order for manufacturing employment to return to its historic peak, we estimate at a minimum $2.9 trillion in net new capital investment is required. While sizable, we view this estimate as a lower-bound. The build out of new of capacity would likely unfold over multiple years, with further increases in capital intensity and inflation requiring a higher amount.” The Wells Fargo analysts also note that lower fertility rates and a recent reduction in immigration could negatively impact working-age population growth.

While ETH’s technicals and upgrades are drawing institutional eyes, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are already surging ahead—capturing both speculative capital and analyst acclaim. With Bitcoin anchoring the market and Kaspa quietly building, the stage is set for a summer of high-stakes gains and strategic positioning. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Frontrunner With Unrivaled Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the rules for early-stage crypto projects, commanding attention with a presale that has already surpassed $8 million and continues to shatter expectations. Analysts are not just bullish—they’re calling MAGA the breakout contender of 2025, with forecasts of up to 18,500% returns and a possible $1 valuation by year-end. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are driving a groundswell of demand from both retail and institutional investors. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing looms, MAGA is rapidly becoming the definitive early-stage play for those seeking life-changing upside. Solana: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Expansion Solana is not just holding its ground—it’s accelerating, with price action consolidating between $158 and $175 and technicals hinting at a breakout above $175 to retest $183. Analysts are eyeing a summer run toward $200 and beyond, fueled by robust DeFi activity, developer traction, and whale accumulation. The network’s speed, low fees, and expanding ecosystem make it a magnet for both speculative and long-term capital. As Solana’s momentum builds, it’s clear that the smartest traders are already positioned for the next leg up. Ethereum: On the Brink of a Major Milestone Ethereum is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators and bullish sentiment pointing to a potential surge past $3,000 in the coming weeks. The 50-day EMA, rising RSI, and recent bounce from key support levels all signal a robust uptrend. Analysts project that a sustained move above $2,700 could open the door to $2,900 and beyond, with some forecasts even targeting $3,200 by late summer. As Ethereum’s upgrades and institutional adoption continue to unfold, ETH remains a cornerstone for both stability and growth. Bitcoin and Kaspa: Steady Anchors in a Dynamic Market Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto universe, trading above $100,000 and drawing unprecedented institutional inflows. Forecasts suggest a possible run to $120,000 and beyond in the near term, with BTC’s strength providing a stable backdrop for altcoin surges. Kaspa, meanwhile, is quietly building momentum, with bullish technicals and a growing community of supporters. While KAS may not match the explosive presale potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, its steady progress and scalability make it a reliable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Ethereum’s bid for $3,000 is capturing headlines, but the real action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana—where early-stage momentum and analyst optimism are already delivering outsized gains. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion and Solana’s technicals pointing higher, the window for transformative returns is wide open.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days. May 30 Bitcoin options open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.ch The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry. Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels. Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.ch Among the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price. Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price decline If Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches. The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions . Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions. Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust. Ultimately, bears’ main hope lies in a weaker macroeconomic environment, which could increase risk aversion and reduce demand for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin bulls aim for $110,000 by May 30 Below are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies. Between $102k and $105k: $2.75 billion in calls (buy) vs. $900 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $1.85 billion. Between $105k and $107k: $3.3 billion calls vs. $650 million puts, favoring calls by $2.65 billion. Between $107k and $110k: $3.7 billion calls vs. $350 million puts, favoring calls by $3.35 billion. Between $110k and $114k: $4.8 billion calls vs. $120 million puts, favoring calls by $4.7 billion. Bulls can maximize their gains by driving BTC above $110,000, which could help set a new all-time high. However, the ongoing bullish momentum depends on developments in the ongoing tariff war, which has been a key focus in recent weeks.

While Bitcoin remains the bedrock of digital finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are rapidly emerging as favored destinations for smart capital. With XRP and TRON also seeing notable inflows, the current cycle is defined by a flight to quality and momentum, as investors position for the next wave of outsized returns. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Magnet Drawing Major Whales MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the standout presale of 2025, with whale wallets quietly amassing large positions ahead of the project’s public debut. The presale has already surpassed $8 million, and analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation—both from retail and institutional investors. Notably, even holders of XRP and Aptos are rotating profits into MAGA, eager to capitalize on what could be the most explosive early-stage opportunity of the year. As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as a rare ground-floor entry for those seeking transformative gains. Bitcoin: Whales Double Down as Retail Exits Bitcoin is experiencing a dramatic redistribution of holdings, with whales and institutions quietly accumulating while retail investors take profits. Between mid-April and mid-May, large holders increased their BTC positions by over 83,000 coins, signaling robust confidence in the market’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin’s price currently hovers above $100,000, and analysts forecast a possible surge toward $115,000–$140,000 in the near term. The options market is even more bullish, with bets on BTC reaching $200,000 by year-end. This silent accumulation by whales and institutions underscores Bitcoin’s enduring appeal as a core holding, while also highlighting the growing appetite for high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana: Whale Buys Signal Unshakable Confidence Solana is another top target for whale accumulation, with large investors withdrawing over 145,000 SOL (worth $21.8 million) from exchanges in recent weeks. On-chain data reveals that two wallets—likely controlled by the same entity—have scooped up more than 250,000 SOL (valued at $60 million) in the past month. This aggressive buying is a clear vote of confidence in Solana’s technical strength, DeFi ecosystem, and long-term growth prospects. Analysts are targeting the $200 level as a near-term milestone, with forecasts suggesting further upside as institutional adoption accelerates. Solana’s robust fundamentals and expanding developer activity make it a standout among Layer-1 platforms, drawing both speculative and long-term capital. XRP and TRON: Steady Accumulation, But MAGA Steals the Show XRP continues to attract whale attention, with over 880 million tokens accumulated in May alone as regulatory clarity and institutional adoption fuel optimism. Analysts project a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if sentiment remains strong. TRON, meanwhile, is seeing steady accumulation and remains a reliable hold for those seeking stable returns. However, neither XRP nor TRON can match the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly becoming the go-to allocation for whales seeking the next crypto supercycle. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Whale accumulation is intensifying across the crypto market, with MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and Solana emerging as the top targets for smart capital. MAGA’s presale is drawing unprecedented interest, Bitcoin’s macro strength is unshaken, and Solana’s technicals are signaling further upside. As the window for early entry narrows, these tokens are setting the tone for the next phase of crypto growth—offering investors a rare chance to ride the wave of outsized returns.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale, with a token price of $0.03 and a confirmed launch price of $0.06. That means early backers are already positioned for 100% upside even before the token reaches public exchanges. But the price itself isn’t the headline — it’s what’s being built behind the scenes. With over $9,1 million raised and more than 11,000 holders already participating, the presale reflects growing belief in the project’s design, roadmap, and future token performance. As more investors search for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, the MUTM presale is gaining traction not from buzz — but from a clear path to utility. Lending and Borrowing With Real Yield Potential At the heart of Mutuum’s protocol is a decentralized system for lending and borrowing digital assets. Here’s how it works: Lenders deposit supported assets into smart contract pools and receive mtTokens — digital tokens that represent their deposits and grow in value as borrowers pay interest. Borrowers provide collateral and access liquidity without selling their original assets. The protocol uses a Loan-to-Value (LTV) model to calculate how much can be borrowed, helping protect lenders and balance the system. For example, a user could deposit stablecoins to earn passive income through interest-bearing returns, while another user borrows against their crypto holdings to fund short-term opportunities — all on-chain, without intermediaries. This model brings utility to the token ecosystem and gives real function to MUTM beyond trading — a critical factor in long-term crypto investing. Utilities That Will Drive Future Demand Mutuum isn’t stopping at lending. The team is also developing a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin — one that will be backed entirely by assets held within the protocol. This stablecoin will be algorithmically controlled, ensuring stability and transparency while generating revenue through borrowing activity. That revenue becomes part of a broader buy-and-redistribute system. As revenue is generated through interest and user activity on the platform, a designated share will be allocated toward acquiring MUTM tokens directly from public markets. These tokens are then redistributed to mtToken holders — creating a system that rewards long-term participation and increases token demand organically. It’s a self-sustaining model that supports price growth through platform activity. And with each new feature planned for post-launch, the value proposition for MUTM continues to expand. With a beta platform set to launch alongside the token, early users will be able to interact with key lending and borrowing features from the beginning — a rare advantage for presale participants. This immediate access puts MUTM in a different category from many new tokens that launch first, then build. The upside isn’t theoretical. As more investors look beyond high-cap coins and into top crypto coins under $1, tokens like MUTM offer something critical: real structure with future earnings potential. And with infrastructure like Layer-2 scaling being built in, Mutuum Finance is addressing both cost-efficiency and user experience from the start. Many early investors from ecosystems like Solana and Tron have already joined the Mutuum presale — not because of hype, but because of vision. With its protocol design, stablecoin integration, and planned token rewards, the project is assembling a complete DeFi structure while the token remains accessible. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now before the next market breakout, MUTM is proving that you don’t need to chase trending coins to find long-term value — you just need to look where the structure is being built.

While popular names still lead charts, the latest shift shows strong gains from both meme projects and fresh Layer 1 networks. Utility, global access, and exchange support are setting the pace this year. In this article, we cover four standout names: BlockDAG (BDAG), Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE). From presale strength to whale buying and bullish chart setups, each one is catching serious traction. Whether you’re eyeing a quick flip or long-term upside, these are the altcoins to watch right now. BlockDAG: $0.0020 Frozen Price Before GO LIVE on June 13 BlockDAG is making headlines as one of the altcoins to watch for 2025. Its presale has already pulled in over $264 million, with more than 21 billion BDAG coins sold. Buyers still have access to the fixed $0.0020 entry until June 13, offering a potential 2,400% profit with the launch price set at $0.05. This isn’t just another presale. BlockDAG is fully EVM-compatible, meaning developers can easily port or launch Ethereum dApps on its fast, low-cost Layer 1 setup. That opens the door to major dApp migration and adoption. And with a strong focus on infrastructure, this project has legs beyond market hype. The June 13 GO LIVE reveal will confirm 15 new exchange listings, in addition to MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com already onboard. The testnet is active, the X1 Miner App has over 1 million users, and 17,000+ ASIC miners have been distributed. With serious development, accessibility, and exchange support, BlockDAG stands apart from hype-driven names. It’s not just another trend. It’s one of the altcoins to watch with real substance and massive upside. Pepe (PEPE): Price Action and Utility Fuel New Growth Pepe is proving it belongs on the list of altcoins to watch this May. It’s trading near $0.00001277 and showing a 13% gain in the last seven days. Analysts expect a potential jump to $0.000030 based on bullish chart patterns. Its upcoming Ethereum-based AI token, MIND of Pepe, has stirred more interest. Though it’s down from its December high of $0.00002824, PEPE is still nearly 5x up year-over-year. With strong community support and a growing development team, Pepe is evolving beyond its meme origins. If the current momentum continues, Pepe could remain one of the altcoins to watch throughout Q2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Whale Accumulation Sends a Signal Shiba Inu continues to gain traction, making it a strong candidate among altcoins to watch. It currently trades around $0.00001558, with May bringing a 16% increase. Analysts are closely watching after whales picked up more than 530 trillion SHIB. This activity points to a possible supply crunch that could lift prices toward $0.000025. While some drop-off has been seen on the Shibarium network, overall outlook remains positive. SHIB may finally break out of its extended consolidation. Those tracking altcoins to watch are monitoring this closely. If SHIB clears its resistance levels, it might unlock the upside that’s been building for months. Dogecoin (DOGE): Bullish Chart Sets Up Possible Rally Dogecoin is flashing bullish signals and stands out among altcoins to watch. The coin trades near $0.2462, with technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout. A bull pennant and a strong RSI reading suggest DOGE may climb toward the $0.45 range. Despite recent whale sell-offs totaling $40 million, trading volumes are rising. This could signal renewed confidence in DOGE’s price movement. Memecoins tend to thrive in waves, and Dogecoin’s large following gives it an edge when retail buyers return. Its liquidity, brand recognition, and new use cases keep it relevant. As the charts align, DOGE is holding its place as one of the altcoins to watch this season. Final Thought Altcoins to watch in 2025 come in different forms. Pepe brings AI and price momentum. SHIB has sparked attention through whale accumulation. DOGE shows clear bullish patterns. Each coin offers a different strength, from community backing to chart appeal. But BlockDAG is more than momentum. It offers tech, adoption readiness, and a solid roadmap. With $264 million raised and over 21 billion coins sold, its $0.0020 price remains frozen until June 13. With a $0.05 launch price and the GO LIVE reveal set to unveil 15 more exchange listings, the timing could not be better. If you’re narrowing down the altcoins to watch right now, this mix of memecoins and a Layer 1 project gives both fun and function. From here, the next breakout could come fast, so staying early matters.

The altcoin has not only broken resistance levels but is currently maintaining a stronghold above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). BNB Price Set To Catapult To $1,000 With momentum building, Binance Coin (BNB) could be gearing up for a significant price move to $1,000, taking it well above all-time high levels. This forecast, published in an analysis report by TradingView crypto expert Unichartz, notes that the BNB price action has broken above a long-standing descending resistance line, indicated by the red line in the chart. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Releases Next Potential Targets For Cardano, Is $1 ADA Still Possible? The breakout from this downtrend signals the end of a multi-month consolidation phase and a potentially imminent trend reversal. More notably, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed a historical support-resistance zone marked in the shaded gray area around the $460 – $535 range, which previously acted as a ”battleground for bulls and bears.” This key level is now serving as a potential launchpad for further gains, reinforcing the BNB chart’s bullish structure. Moving forward, the 50 EMA, highlighted by the orange line in the chart, has repeatedly acted as a dynamic support for the BNB price during pullbacks. The TradingView analyst has revealed that on multiple occasions, BNB bounced off this moving average, confirming it as a reliable foundation for a potential rally. As long as the price continues to trade above this 50 EMA and within the reclaimed zone, Unichartz’s outlook for BNB remains optimistic. With sustained bullish momentum, a retest of the all-time high zone around $793 is likely. A successful breakout above this level could trigger a 45.99% climb toward the psychological $1,000 mark. BNB Bulls In Control As Price Aims For Fresh Breakout Market analyst Wise Crypto has issued a bullish forecast for the BNB price, anticipating a massive breakout that could see the altcoin surge above $700 soon. According to the analyst, several technical indicators and bullish developments are aligning in favor of this projected price surge. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says “Altseason Is Dawning” As Bitcoin Dominance Reaches HTF Resistance, What To Expect On the technical side, Wise Crypto pointed to indicators like the EMA, DMI, and Ichimoku Clouds flashing bullish. Fundamentally, the analyst emphasized Binance Coin’s growing Decentralized Exchange (DEX) volume. Notably, BNB’s DEX volume has skyrocketed by an impressive 85.66% increase within one week. The DEX trading volume saw a rise of about $34.85 billion, placing it well above its major competitors, Ethereum and Solana. Moreover, Wise Crypto has declared that BNB bulls have finally taken control, with the market trend demonstrating strength. Supported by positive technical indicators and growing DEX volume, the BNB price is expected to climb approximately 2.21% from its current price of $684.85 to reach $700 in the near term.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout performer, leveraging its political meme appeal and presale momentum to attract both retail and institutional capital. Meanwhile, XRP and Ethereum are experiencing renewed interest as investors seek refuge in projects with strong fundamentals and upside potential. With Bitcoin and Solana providing stability, the stage is set for a dynamic period of growth and strategic positioning. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Meme Powerhouse Defying Uncertainty MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as the leading political-themed token of 2025, with its presale already surpassing $8 million and a price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Unlike generic memecoins that rely on fleeting hype, MAGA taps into deep-rooted political energy and American identity, building a community-driven movement that transcends typical crypto cycles. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and scarcity-driven model are fueling a surge in early-stage accumulation, with analysts projecting returns of 25x–35x or more by launch. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to maintain momentum even as broader markets react to political turbulence. The project’s grassroots support and strategic marketing have created a sense of urgency among investors, many of whom are rotating out of established altcoins to secure early entry before listings. As each presale stage fills, MAGA is solidifying its reputation as a breakout contender in an otherwise unpredictable landscape. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism, buoyed by regulatory clarity and the prospect of an ETF. Analysts forecast a move to $2.65–$2.85 in the near term, with some bullish scenarios targeting $3.40 or higher if sentiment remains strong. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the appointment of a crypto-friendly SEC chair have removed longstanding uncertainties, making XRP a more attractive hold for both retail and institutional investors. Despite recent market volatility, XRP’s technicals and fundamental outlook remain robust. The launch of CME futures and ongoing ETF speculation are driving increased liquidity and visibility, positioning XRP for further gains as the political and regulatory environment evolves. Ethereum: Steady Growth and Institutional Adoption Ethereum continues to anchor the smart contract ecosystem, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 as of May 2025. Analysts expect ETH to target $2,800–$2,900 in the near term, with long-term forecasts suggesting even greater upside if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. Ethereum’s recent upgrades and the anticipation of spot ETFs have bolstered investor confidence, making it a core holding for those seeking both stability and growth. While ETH’s price action is more measured compared to early-stage presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, its resilience and institutional support make it a reliable choice in uncertain times. Bitcoin and Solana: Market Anchors in a Volatile Landscape Bitcoin remains the bedrock of the crypto market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $115,000 or higher if current momentum holds, with the $100,000 level acting as critical support. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, even as political and economic uncertainty persists. Solana is also holding firm, with price action consolidating between $158 and $175 and technicals hinting at a breakout above $175 to retest $183. Analysts are targeting $180–$190 in the near term, with further upside possible as DeFi activity and developer engagement continue to expand. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Strength Amid the Fray Stellar Lumens (XLM) is quietly building momentum, trading near $0.28 and benefiting from its role in cross-border payments and DeFi applications. Analysts project a range of $0.24–$0.64 by year-end, with some optimistic forecasts even suggesting $0.80 or higher if adoption accelerates. While XLM may not match the explosive presale potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, its steady growth and real-world utility make it a dependable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Conclusion As political uncertainty drives market volatility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is surging ahead with strong presale momentum and a unique political narrative. XRP and Ethereum are also attracting renewed attention, offering investors a blend of regulatory clarity, institutional support, and upside potential. With Bitcoin and Solana providing stability, the crypto market is poised for a dynamic period of growth—making MAGACOIN FINANCE the breakout contender to watch in 2025.

Yet, amid the excitement around established tokens, a quiet revolution is unfolding: MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the dark horse of 2025, with analysts projecting returns that could dwarf even the most bullish XRP forecasts. While Hedera and Bitcoin round out the picture with steady gains, it’s MAGA’s presale momentum and scarcity-driven model that are capturing the imagination of forward-thinking investors. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Contender That’s Redefining Early-Stage ROI While XRP is making headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly stealing the show. With over $8 million raised and a presale price still under $0.001, analysts are calling MAGA the breakout contender of 2025. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. What sets MAGA apart is its potential for outsized returns: forecasts suggest a conservative 35x gain, with some models projecting up to 50x or more if current momentum continues. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $130,000—highlights the conviction behind this early-stage gem. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing target nears, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle. XRP: Breaking Barriers and Building Momentum XRP’s recent surge to $2.45 marks a significant milestone, driven by a confluence of regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and technical strength. Analysts are eyeing a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the short term, with some optimistic models even targeting $3.40 if bullish sentiment holds. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the launch of CME futures have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional adoption and ecosystem expansion. Despite these bullish signals, XRP’s upside is seen as steady rather than explosive—making it a core holding for those seeking stability, but not necessarily the next crypto moonshot. Hedera: Quiet Strength and Consolidation Hedera (HBAR) is holding steady near $0.21, consolidating after a strong rally earlier in May. While HBAR’s technicals remain bullish, its near-term upside is more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts project a range of $0.19–$0.78 for 2025, with steady growth expected as the network expands its real-world use cases. For investors seeking stability, HBAR is a dependable hold—but for those chasing the next 50x, MAGA is the clear standout. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Unshakable Confidence Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. For those seeking exponential returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are the new frontier. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP’s climb to $2.45 is a testament to its resilience and institutional appeal, but the real action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With analysts projecting up to 50x returns and a presale that’s drawing unprecedented demand, MAGA is quickly becoming the breakout contender of 2025.

On Monday, the Senate advanced an industry-supported regulatory bill called the Genius Act. Meanwhile, the House Financial Services Committee has approved its stablecoin legislation , though the full House has not yet passed it. According to Paolo Ardoino, chief executive officer of Tether Holdings SA , they need to see how the Genius Act distinguishes between foreign and domestic issuers. He notes that their main interest will remain outside of the US. Genius Act could reshape oversight for foreign issuers Tether’s USDT stablecoin, based in El Salvador , represents over 60% of the stablecoin market and serves 420 million users across emerging markets. Despite facing conflicts with state and federal regulators over the years, the company has grown more active in the US, encouraged by a more crypto-friendly regulatory climate under President Donald Trump’s administration. Ardoino made his first trip to the US in March, stopping in Washington during Trump’s inaugural digital-asset summit. He noted that they are looking at the Genius Act in a way that will allow them to be compliant. He continued to say they could comply while focusing strongly on foreign markets. The stablecoin bills currently under consideration in the House and Senate mandate that these tokens—typically pegged to the dollar or another currency—be fully backed by cash and “safe assets” like short-term Treasuries. They also require issuers to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering regulations. Additionally, both bills would permit regulators to approve foreign issuers like Tether if they are governed by “comparable” regulations abroad. However, uncertainty remains regarding how strictly the law will enforce compliance for those who fail to meet the requirements. Ardoino said that stablecoins are important in the United States, but there are tons of ways to pay each other, such as Zelle, PayPal, debit cards, credit cards, and cash. Although Tether does not currently serve US customers, most of the private company’s reserves consist of assets that would comply with the proposed US legislation. Tether eyes compliance while targeting the unbanked However, the firm also backs its token with assets not permitted under the rules, such as Bitcoin and secured loans. Given its size, Tether would fall under federal regulation if it sought a US license under these regulations. In 2021, Tether settled with US authorities over accusations that it misrepresented its reserves. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., formerly led by Howard Lutnick, who served as Trump’s Secretary of Commerce, manages those reserves. Ardoino has indicated that the company may issue a new stablecoin designed to meet these regulatory requirements, potentially making it more appealing to institutional investors. The more supportive regulatory climate in the US has also motivated Tether to move closer to obtaining a full audit of its reserves by a Big Four accounting firm, which Ardoino said is still under discussion. Currently, Tether provides quarterly attestations certified by BDO Italia SpA. “They are going through a phase of adjustment, but a full audit is our priority,” Ardoino said. Stablecoins have become crucial to the functioning of crypto markets, with about $243 billion of them in circulation in May 2025. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a consortium of major banks, including JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, are exploring whether to issue a stablecoin jointly. Ardoino expressed confidence that competition from traditional banking giants would have minimal impact on Tether’s core business. While major U.S. banks are considering launching their own stablecoin, Tether remains focused on underserved global markets. According to Ardoino, these banks are likely to concentrate on Western economies, whereas Tether continues to target the roughly 3 billion unbanked individuals worldwide who remain outside the traditional financial system.

He is stepping down from the Polygon Foundation board and ending his role at the main development studio, Polygon Labs. Bjelic shared an X post stating, “After much thought and reflection, I’ve decided to step down from the board of the Polygon Foundation and wind down my day-to-day involvement with Polygon Labs.” This makes him the third founder to leave the team. He joins co-founders Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun, who had also stepped away from their active roles in the blockchain project. Kanani left the company in October 2023, while Arjun stepped down in March 2023 to concentrate on his modular blockchain project, Avail. Bjelic claims he can no longer give his best to Polygon Bjelic has played a pivotal role in taking Polygon to greater heights. In 2017, he co-founded the well-known Ethereum Layer 2, originally named Matic Network , along with Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun. Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions provide many advantages for the Ethereum network. These benefits include faster transaction times, lower fees, and better scalability. As a Layer 2 solution, Polygon uses these features to boost its own performance and improve the experience for its users. In support of this, it is evident that the firm has made significant contributions to blockchain research and development, particularly in zero-knowledge and proof-of-stake technologies. Polygon introduced MATIC for POL-on a one-to-one basis in late 2024 and initiated a token migration as a part of its 2.0 plan. This change was to drive more usage of the network’s main token for gas fees, staking, and infrastructure such as AggLayer. Following Polygon’s success, Bjelic’s 10+ years of experience as an IT engineer building technology products and platforms were greatly honored. However, on Friday, May 23, Bjelic shared an X post stating that he could no longer give his best to Polygon. Based on his explanation, as projects developed and evolved, it was natural for ideas to shift and sometimes become divided up. Afterward, Bjelic mentioned that Polygon leaders seemed sincerely dedicated to seeing the project prosper. He then offered support to them from the sideline and for whatever he could do to assist. Following his resignation, Nailwal praised Bjelic in an X post , stating he was not only a co-founder but also a brother to him. He added, “From the earliest days — whiteboards full of ideas, endless whitepapers, governance frameworks, strategy calls deep into the night — you have been a force behind so much of what makes Polygon.” Bjelic reveals himself as a strong crypto believer Bjelic revealed that he first learned about cryptocurrency in 2013. By 2017, he was really diving into it, excited by the idea of creating a worldwide, inclusive economy. Since then, he has dedicated himself to making that amazing vision a reality. This is evident since Polygon’s launch in 2019, as Bjelic and his colleagues have made great progress. According to reliable sources, they have achieved important advancements in zero-knowledge technology and brought on some of the biggest brands in the world, moving closer to that big dream. By undertaking this great journey, Bjelic initially highlighted taking pride in this and felt lucky to collaborate with many skilled individuals. Concerning his resignation, he mentioned that he still felt just as enthusiastic about the potential of cryptocurrency to change systems, empower people, and build a fairer world. Therefore, he added that this belief continues to motivate him, and as a result, he will probably be seen around. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

His resignation drew reactions across Polygon and the wider crypto community, with several seeing it as a loss for Polygon, which has been tied to several major developments in recent months. Bjelic winds down ‘day-to-day involvement’ “After much thought and reflection, I’ve decided to step down from the board of the Polygon Foundation and wind down my day-to-day involvement with Polygon Labs,” Bjelic said in a May 23 X post. “I’ll always be cheering from the sidelines and supporting however and whenever I can,” Bjelic added. “As projects evolve and mature, it is natural for visions to evolve, and sometimes diverge. With this in mind, I can no longer contribute to Polygon to the best of my abilities.” Fellow Polygon co-founder, Sandeep Nailwal, commended Bjelic’s contributions over the years, adding that Bjelic has always been “a force behind so much of what makes Polygon what it is today.” Source: Sandeep Nailwal Bjelic said that he remains “as passionate as ever” about crypto, and suggested he will stay active in the crypto industry. “You will likely still see me around,” Bjelic said. Aave-chan Initiative founder Marc Zella said it was a “Big L for Polygon.” Polygon’s head of marketing Leon Stern said the company is going to miss Bjelic. “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Polygon, and best of luck,” Stern said. Meanwhile, Skale Network CEO Jack O’Holleran said Bjelic should “be very proud” of all he has accomplished at Polygon and is excited to see what he does next. Source: Maggie Love Over the past two years, two of Polygon Labs’ early founders, Jaynti Kanani and Anurag Arjun, also stepped away from the company. Arjun’s departure coincided with the Polygon spin-off Avail, a Web3 data availability and consensus layer, becoming an independent entity, with Arjun taking the lead. Bjelic has yet to reveal his next plans. Related: Crypto market cycle permanently shifted — Polygon founder Bjelic’s resignation follows several major announcements tied to Polygon this year. On March 25, Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform DigiShares announced it would bring tokenized real estate trading to Polygo n with the launch of RealEstate.Exchange, also known as REX. Just two months before, on Jan. 16, Jio Platforms, an Indian mobile network operator owned by Asia’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani, partnered with Polygon Labs to upgrade some of its existing offerings with Web3 and blockchain capabilities.

Yet, while XRP’s ascent captures headlines, savvy investors are turning their gaze toward MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—two projects where early-stage positioning and structural catalysts could unlock even higher returns. With Ethereum and Cosmos also in the mix, the stage is set for a summer of strategic portfolio shifts and explosive growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon With 35x–50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts are projecting returns of 35x–50x, with some models even suggesting a $1 valuation by year-end—a move that would eclipse the gains of most established altcoins. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $133,000—marks the largest single early-stage crypto investment of the year, underscoring the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking outsized returns before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. XRP: Bullish Breakout and Institutional Catalyst XRP is trading near $2.45, riding a wave of positive sentiment fueled by regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and growing adoption in cross-border payments. Technical indicators show a strong breakout setup, with analysts forecasting a move toward $2.85–$3.40 in the near term and some optimistic models even targeting $5 by year-end if bullish momentum persists.The recent resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the launch of CME futures have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional inflows and price appreciation. Despite these bullish signals, XRP’s upside potential is seen as steady rather than transformative—making it a core holding for those seeking stability, but not necessarily the next crypto moonshot. Cardano: Technical Strength and Growth Forecast Cardano is quietly building momentum, with analysts pointing to a potential rise toward $0.90 in the near term and a bullish target of $1.88 by year-end if key support levels hold. The project’s double bottom pattern and rising on-balance volume signal strong accumulation and growing investor confidence. While Cardano’s price action is less dramatic than MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale surge, its robust fundamentals and ecosystem expansion make it a compelling choice for those seeking steady, long-term growth. However, for investors chasing the highest multiples, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage entry and explosive upside potential are hard to ignore. Ethereum and Cosmos: Steady Performers in a Dynamic Market Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades. Analysts expect ETH to target $2,800–$2,900 in the near term, with long-term forecasts suggesting even greater upside if institutional adoption and Layer 2 growth persist. While Ethereum offers stability and proven value, its upside may be more measured compared to the explosive potential of early-stage presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cosmos (ATOM) is also gaining traction, with its focus on interoperability and developer engagement attracting a loyal following. While ATOM’s price action is subdued compared to MAGA’s presale momentum, its steady growth and real-world utility make it a dependable hold in a volatile market. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP’s momentum is building, but the real excitement is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—where early-stage positioning and structural catalysts could unlock even higher returns. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion and a $0.007 listing target, the window for outsized gains is closing fast. For those seeking the next crypto supercycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender of 2025.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Shot Up Recently The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the sentiment held by the average trader in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The metric uses a numerical scale running from 0-100 in order to represent the sentiment. All values above 53 represent greed among the investors, while those below 47 indicate fear. The index lying between these two cutoffs implies a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals Besides these three main zones, there are also two ‘extreme’ regions called the extreme greed (above 75) and extreme fear (below 25). At present, the market sentiment is inside the former of the two, according to the latest value of the Fear & Greed Index. Historically, the extreme sentiments have held much significance for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as they have been where major tops and bottoms have tended to form. The relationship has been an inverse one, however, meaning that an overly bullish atmosphere makes tops likely and an excess of despair bottoms. Some traders exploit this fact in order to time their buy and sell moves. This trading technique is popularly known as contrarian investing. Warren Buffet’s famous quote sums up the core idea: “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” With the Bitcoin sentiment now making a return into the extreme greed region, it’s possible that followers of this philosophy may be starting to look toward the exit. That said, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of ‘just’ 78 at the moment. For comparison, the December top occurred at around 87 and the January one at 84. Earlier in the rally, the metric even hit a much higher peak of 94 in November. As such, it’s possible that the current market may not be quite that overheated in terms of sentiment just yet, assuming demand from the investors doesn’t let off. It only remains to be seen, though, how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would evolve under this extreme greed. Speaking of demand, whales have just made a significant amount of withdrawals from the Binance platform, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Exchange Netflow,” which tells us about the net amount of Bitcoin that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with a centralized exchange, which, in this case, is Binance. Clearly, the Binance Exchange Netflow has observed a large negative value, implying that the investors have shifted a notable amount of coins out of the exchange. More specifically, net outflows for the platform have stood at 2,190 BTC or about $237 million. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target?

Yet, as established giants like Bitcoin, XRP, and Polkadot trade in tighter ranges, the spotlight is shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose momentum and upside projections are eclipsing even the most established names. As Q3 2025 approaches, smart money is increasingly positioning for the next breakout, and MAGA is emerging as the top candidate for exponential gains. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, But Capital Is Rotating Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold its ground above $110,000, with institutional inflows and ETF adoption providing a strong foundation for further growth. Analysts forecast a potential surge to $116,000–$137,000 in the coming weeks, but as BTC’s momentum steadies, capital is rotating into altcoins with higher-multiple potential. Early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now drawing aggressive capital rotation, as investors look to maximize returns in the next phase of the bull cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Powerhouse With 12,000%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing the competition, with Stage 8 now live and over $8 million raised. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—has made it the #1 altcoin entry for ROI-focused buyers in 2025. Analysts are projecting up to 40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting a path to 12,000%–18,500% upside if momentum continues. A recent $132,000+ whale buy marks the largest single early-stage investment of the year, underscoring the conviction behind MAGA’s explosive setup. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next supercycle winner. Each stage is filling rapidly, and as visibility grows, MAGA is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. XRP: Bullish Momentum, But Limited Multiples XRP is trading between $2.36 and $2.65, having surged over 300% since late 2024 on the back of regulatory clarity and institutional partnerships. While technicals and ecosystem developments remain bullish, short-term momentum has slowed as XRP consolidates below recent highs. Analysts now project a breakout above $3.40 could push XRP toward $4.50–$7.50 by summer, but for now, the asset is in a holding pattern as the market awaits the next catalyst. Many traders seeking sharper upside are now looking to early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for more dramatic returns. Polkadot: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Polkadot (DOT) is holding steady around $7.50, with ongoing development and ecosystem expansion. While DOT remains a dependable hold for long-term investors, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 40x winner. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Solana’s approach to $190 is a testament to its resilience and institutional appeal, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 12,000%–18,500% upside are keeping it firmly in the spotlight. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery.

Key US regulatory shifts (GAAP, SAB 121) are now unlocking Bitcoin adoption by major corporations and banks. Major US banks like Chase and Citibank are actively planning Bitcoin access, signaling a structural market shift. Bitcoin (BTC) is stepping into what many observers are calling a new era; one that could fundamentally defy past expectations and reshape its very role within the global financial system. While skeptics often point to its notorious price volatility, a quieter, more profound revolution is taking place beneath the surface. Key political changes, pivotal regulatory shifts in the U.S., and surging institutional interest are all now aligning to drive Bitcoin towards genuine mainstream adoption. Investors who are only watching the day-to-day price swings might just be missing the bigger picture: Bitcoin is steadily embedding itself into the fabric of the global economy. As crypto investor James Lavish put it, what happens next for Bitcoin won’t just be another price rally, it could very well be a deep “ structural transformation .” … The post James Lavish Drops Truth Bomb: Bitcoin’s Future Path Will Shock Those Stuck In Old Cycle Thinking appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-05-24 03:03:28

While past epochs saw triple-digit rallies, a new story may be unfolding: one of rising maturity, deeper adoption, and network resilience.” The tweet landed minutes after the firm released “2024 Bitcoin Halving: One Year Later,” authored by senior analyst Daniel Gray, who contends that the apparent lull in price action masks “a strengthening foundation.” Fidelity Flags Bitcoin’s Silent Surge “Bitcoin presents a nuanced narrative a year after its fourth halving, with signs pointing toward consolidation, network resilience, and growing institutional adoption,” Gray writes, adding that structural indicators “suggest a strengthening foundation.” While previous cycles delivered triple- and even quadruple-digit percentage gains by this stage, Gray argues the softer trajectory signals maturation: “History suggests that we would be well into the bull run at this point in the fifth epoch — but this cycle may be unfolding more cautiously.” From a market-share perspective the data are unequivocal. “Bitcoin’s market dominance excluding stablecoins has risen to just over 72.4% as of 11 May, a new eight-year high,” Gray notes, pointing out that Ether and Solana have surrendered ground even as “fragmentation on the long tail of assets has failed to produce a clear alternative leader.” Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals On-chain security metrics tell a similar story: “Bitcoin’s daily hash-rate rose above one zetta hash per second twice in April, reflecting continued investment in mining infrastructure despite a 60 percent collapse in hash price since the halving,” he observes. Spot-market behaviour has begun to echo those fundamentals. Bitcoin printed a record intraday high of $109,486 on 21 May before extending above $111,000 on so-called Pizza Day, holding near $110,600 at press time. The move has been underwritten by renewed demand from US spot ETFs, which drew $934.8 million of net subscriptions yesterday, May 22— the heaviest single-day haul in almost four weeks. Derivatives activity mirrors the trend: aggregate futures open interest reached a record $80 billion on May 23, up roughly 30% since the start of the month, according to CoinGlass data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Blasts To $111,867 All-Time High—Here’s What’s Driving The Surge Meanwhile, funding rates in most crypto exchanges are at the baseline or below it. “This is the least euphoric new all-time highs in the history of Bitcoin,” crypto analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) wrote via X. Gray cautions that investors should focus less on headline returns and more on the architecture taking shape beneath them. “Although returns have been more measured compared to previous cycles, structural metrics suggest a strengthening foundation. Overall, it appears Bitcoin is potentially maturing—something investors may find more notable than short-term price movement,” he writes. His closing assessment is blunt: “One year post-halving, Bitcoin’s price performance may seem muted, but its fundamentals appear stronger than ever … this may be a cycle that redefines Bitcoin’s role in a modern portfolio.” In other words, Fidelity’s message for would-be spectators is as clear as its headline: do not blink. At press time, BTC traded at $109,563.

By glossing over this problem, we risk allowing governments and corporations to control the global conversation. Both AI technology and industry have gone parabolic. Its censorship potential becomes greater every day. Every one to two years since 2010, the computational power of training AI systems has increased by a factor of 10, making the threat of censorship and control of public discourse more real than ever. Corporations worldwide ranked privacy and data governance as their top AI risks, while censorship didn’t register on their radar. AI – which can process millions of data points in seconds – can censor through various means, including content moderation and control of information. LLMs (large language models) and content recommendations can filter, suppress or mass share information at scale. In 2023, Freedom House highlighted that AI is enhancing state-led censorship. In China, the CAC (Cyberspace Administration) has incorporated censorship strategy into generative AI tools, requiring chatbots to support “core socialist values” and block content the communist party wants to censor. Chinese AI models, such as DeepSeek’s R1, already censor topics like the Tiananmen Square massacre, in order to spread state narratives. “To protect the free and open internet, democratic policymakers – working side by side with civil society experts from around the world – should establish strong human rights–based standards for both state and non-state actors that develop or deploy AI tools,” concludes Freedom House. In 2021, UC San Diego found that AI algorithms trained on censored datasets, such as China’s Baidu Baike, which associates the keyword ‘democracy’ with ‘chaos.’ Models trained on uncensored sources associated ‘democracy’ with ‘stability.’ In 2023, Freedom House’s ‘Freedom on the Net’ report found that global internet freedom fell for the 13th consecutive year. It attributed a large part of the decline to AI. Twenty-two countries have laws in place requiring social media companies to employ automated systems for content moderation, which could be used to suppress debate and demonstrations. Myanmar’s military junta, for instance, used AI to monitor Telegram groups and detain dissidents and carry out death sentences based on their posts. The same happened in Iran. Additionally, in Belarus and Nicaragua, governments sentenced individuals to draconian prison terms for their online speech. Freedom House found that no fewer than 47 governments used comments to sway online conversations towards their preferred narratives. It found that in the past year, new technology was used in at least 16 countries to sow the seeds of doubt, smear opponents or influence public debate. At least 21 countries require digital platforms to use machine learning to delete political, social and religious speech. A 2023 Reuters report warned that AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation could “undermine public trust in democratic processes,” empowering regimes that seek to tighten control over information. In the 2024 US presidential elections, AI-generated images falsely implying Taylor Swift endorsed Donald Trump demonstrated that AI is already manipulating public opinion. China offers the most prominent example of AI-driven censorship. A leaked dataset analyzed by TechCrunch in 2025 revealed a sophisticated AI system designed to censor topics like pollution scandals, labor disputes and Taiwan political issues. Unlike traditional keyword-based filtering, this system uses LLMs to evaluate context and flag political satire. Researcher Xiao Qiang noted that such systems “significantly improve the efficiency and granularity of state-led information control.” A 2024 House Judiciary Committee report accused the NSF (National Science Foundation) of funding AI tools to combat ‘misinformation’ on Covid-19 and the 2020 election. The report found that the NSF funded AI-based censorship and propaganda tools. “In the name of combating alleged misinformation regarding Covid-19 and the 2020 election, NSF has been issuing multi-million-dollar grants to university and non-profit research teams,” reads the report. “The purpose of these taxpayer-funded projects is to develop AI-powered censorship and propaganda tools that can be used by governments and Big Tech to shape public opinion by restricting certain viewpoints or promoting others.” A 2025 WIRED report discovered that DeepSeek’s R1 model includes censorship filters at both the application and training levels, resulting in blocks on sensitive topics. In 2025, a Pew Research Center survey found that 83% of US adults were concerned about AI-driven misinformation, with many showing concerns about its free speech implications. Pew interviewed AI experts, who said that AI training data can unintentionally reinforce existing power structures. Addressing AI-driven censorship A 2025 HKS Misinformation Review called for better reporting to reduce fear-driven calls for censorship. The survey found that 38.8% of Americans are somewhat concerned, and 44.6% are highly concerned, about AI’s role in spreading misinformation during the 2024 US presidential election, while 9.5% held no concerns, and 7.1% were unaware of the issue altogether. Creating an open-source AI ecosystem is of the utmost importance. This means companies disclose training dataset sources and biases. Governments should create AI regulatory frameworks prioritizing free expression. If we want a human future, instead of an AI-managed technocratic dystopia, the AI industry and consumers need to build up the courage to tackle censorship.

Cardano’s surge and Bitcoin’s stability are drawing headlines, but the real buzz is around MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin that’s outpacing even the most established names. With Solana, XRP, and SUI consolidating, analysts are calling MAGA the leading early-stage play as Q3 approaches. Cardano: Academic Partnerships Fuel a Bullish Run Cardano (ADA) has broken past $0.82, powered by a series of global academic collaborations and real-world blockchain integrations. The network’s commitment to research and education is paying off, with analysts forecasting ADA could reach $0.90–$1.00 by early summer. While Cardano’s fundamentals and ecosystem expansion are earning it long-term credibility, some investors are looking to amplify returns by rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Presale and 35x Upside Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the 2025 presale cycle, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—capped at 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, and audited by HashEx—are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code MAGA50X , MAGA is being positioned as the rare ground-floor opportunity before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Unlike fleeting meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding a wave of real investor confidence, strategic rollout, and viral political energy—making it the top allocation for smart money heading into Q3. Bitcoin: Macro Strength and Capital Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s anchor, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. While Bitcoin’s macro strength is unshaken, its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. As retail investors take profits, smart capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early-stage entry points offer the kind of asymmetric potential that built fortunes in previous cycles. Solana, XRP, and SUI: Solid, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is consolidating near $170, with technicals hinting at a breakout above $175. XRP is trading between $2.36 and $2.65, holding steady after a 300% rally since late 2024. SUI is gaining traction with network upgrades and developer activity, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates out of consolidating assets and into high-upside plays, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next breakout. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s academic partnerships and Bitcoin’s resilience are impressive, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 35x are making it the breakout coin to watch for Q3 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar.

Yet, while Solana’s performance remains impressive, the spotlight is quickly shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose momentum and potential upside are dominating analyst conversations. With XRP, SEI, and Cardano also drawing attention, the race for the next major breakout is heating up, and MAGA is rapidly emerging as the must-watch contender. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 40x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage altcoins in 2025, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—has fueled a surge in demand from both retail and institutional buyers. Analysts are projecting 35x–50x returns as a conservative estimate, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if current momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using the promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGA is quickly becoming the primary entry point for those seeking exponential gains before listings reshape the market. Solana: Bullish Structure and Institutional Confidence Solana (SOL) continues to impress, trading in a tight range around $170 and supported by bullish momentum across all timeframes. Technical analysis points to a possible breakout above $175, which could pave the way for a retest of $183 and beyond. Experts predict that, with continued ecosystem growth and institutional adoption, SOL could revisit the $240–$260 range later this year. While Solana’s upward movement is now more gradual, its strong fundamentals and rising spot volumes keep it a top pick for long-term growth alongside explosive early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Bullish Structure and ETF Tailwinds XRP is showing renewed strength, trading near $2.50 and maintaining a bullish structure supported by multiple moving averages. After bouncing from the $2.10 range and breaking past key resistances, XRP is consolidating above $2.30. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate, with some stretch targets as high as $15. While XRP remains a core institutional asset, many long-time holders are now diversifying into early-stage assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper upside before the next leg up. SEI and Cardano: Quiet Accumulation, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight SEI and Cardano (ADA) are both quietly attracting smart capital, with ADA’s development ecosystem and staking rewards making it a favorite among long-term holders. However, neither SEI nor ADA offers the early-stage entry or explosive upside that MAGACOIN FINANCE brings to the table. As traders seek breakout returns, MAGA’s structured presale and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation heading into Q3. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion While Solana’s bullish trend continues and XRP maintains institutional momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a locked-in $0.007 listing price, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA stands out as the breakout altcoin to watch. For those seeking 40x–50x growth potential before listings go live, the window for early entry is closing fast.

History shows that early participation is where the real gains are made, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to more recent wins like Solana and Avalanche. Even Monero, once dismissed by many, eventually delivered major returns to those who held on. Today, all eyes are starting to turn toward Qubetics ($TICS), a rising project gaining traction for its practical tech, strong token dynamics, and growing support from early adopters. Qubetics has sparked substantial interest due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. As of May 2025, its presale is actively progressing, and the stage-based pricing model is already rewarding early adopters. With its strategic allocation for early investors, a cutting-edge technological framework, and a mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, Qubetics offers far more than speculative appeal — it offers timing, technology, and traction. For those still seeking one of the top altcoins to buy, Qubetics may be that overdue shot at a transformative ROI. Qubetics: One of the Top Altcoins to Buy Before This Presale Ends Missing out on Qubetics ’ earliest phase — where $TICS was available for just $0.01 during its quiet September 2024 rollout — is something many investors already regret. Multiple presale stages have already passed, each bringing a 10% price increase, and now the token is at Stage 35, priced at $0.2785. More than $17.3 million has been raised, over 513 million $TICS tokens sold, and more than 26,900 investors are now holders. Yet despite this traction, the door is still open. This top crypto presale is not out of reach yet. With each stage lasting only seven days and a 10% discount incentive on current pricing, Qubetics still qualifies among the top altcoins to buy. Backed by its upcoming Q2 2025 mainnet launch, Qubetics is built for sustainability. The project allocated 12.85% of the total token supply for early adopters — demonstrating a long-term commitment to community-driven growth. ROI projections remain exceptionally promising. At the current $0.2785 price, an investor could see a 258.95% ROI if $TICS hits $1 after launch. If it reaches $5, that return spikes to 1,694.74%, and at $6, the ROI rises to 2,053.68%. More ambitious scenarios show a 3,489.47% ROI at $10 and a staggering 5,284.21% ROI at $15. For example, a $2,000 investment now could yield up to $107,700 at a $6 valuation or as high as $179,500 at $10 — all while remaining below major cap thresholds. This ROI trajectory places Qubetics firmly among the top altcoins to buy for high-upside market plays. Qubetics stands apart because it solves a fundamental pain point in blockchain: interoperability. In the fragmented Web3 ecosystem, users and enterprises face siloed blockchains that don’t communicate natively. Qubetics bridges this gap. Whether you’re a supply chain company needing cross-chain transaction verification between Ethereum and Solana, or a Web3 developer building on Bitcoin but needing real-time access to Ethereum’s liquidity pools, Qubetics offers seamless asset transfer and protocol compatibility. Enterprises benefit through cost efficiency and reduced integration overhead, while individual users gain frictionless access to decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 dApps from multiple chains — through one unified, interoperable chain. Monero’s Story: The Silent Riser in the Privacy Coin Arena Monero (XMR), known for its robust privacy protocol, is a perfect example of a crypto that eventually delivered but only after years of waiting. It launched in 2014 with an ICO price under $1 and was largely ignored in its early stages. The project’s focus on fungibility and anonymity didn’t immediately translate into mass investor interest, as competitors like Ethereum were capturing the spotlight. Yet, Monero steadily built a core user base that valued its unique privacy advantages — and when privacy coins gained popularity, XMR skyrocketed. Its all-time high came years later, rewarding early believers with life-changing gains. Throughout its development, Monero has maintained a niche but loyal presence in the crypto space. Its Proof-of-Work model, RingCT technology, and fungibility features give it unmatched privacy capabilities. However, Monero’s slow climb and long dormancy periods meant that many only joined after the major growth occurred. While XMR still holds relevance, it highlights the importance of getting in early on crypto projects that offer real, differentiating use cases. The Monero narrative reflects why identifying top altcoins to buy before the masses catch on is a critical factor in building substantial ROI. Conclusion: The Next Wave Is Here — Will You Ride It? Cryptocurrency history repeats itself — and not always kindly for latecomers. Whether it was Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Monero, the highest gains have always gone to those who acted early with conviction. Today, Qubetics represents one of those rare moments of opportunity. Its ongoing presale structure, ambitious interoperability framework, and clear market utility all point to significant post-launch potential. If you’re still looking for top altcoins to buy, Qubetics checks every box — from ROI forecasts to real-world utility. The truth is, you still have time to join this top crypto presale before the final stages drive prices further. Qubetics is still accessible and poised for a breakout in 2025. For those tired of looking back with regret, this may be your moment to participate in what could become one of the top altcoins to buy for the upcoming expansion cycle.

With the SEC’s friendlier stance and ETF approvals in the spotlight, ETH’s resurgence is emboldening investors to explore new opportunities. In this climate, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP have become focal points for those seeking both early-stage momentum and institutional-grade upside. Avalanche and Bitcoin remain foundational, but the most aggressive capital is now chasing the next breakout in MAGA and XRP. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum and Whale Accumulation MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the early-stage landscape, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling a wave of demand from both retail and institutional buyers. Analysts are forecasting 25x–40x returns for those who enter before listings, with some models even suggesting a $1 target by year-end if momentum holds. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts underscore the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential, while a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code MAGA50X is amplifying demand. As each presale stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the go-to allocation for those seeking the next 10x–40x winner in Q3 2025. Ethereum: Regulatory Wins and Renewed Bullishness Ethereum’s 2025 narrative has shifted from uncertainty to resurgence, with a 90% rally off its April lows and bullish technicals now pointing toward a possible $3,950 breakout. The SEC’s friendlier approach and ETF approvals have removed longstanding barriers, giving ETH a clear path for institutional adoption and price appreciation. As regulatory clarity returns, Ethereum is once again viewed as a stable springboard for capital—enabling investors to confidently rotate into higher-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Institutional Momentum and ETF Speculation XRP is consolidating above $2.30, buoyed by legal victories, ETF buzz, and its growing role as a global settlement asset. The SEC’s resolution of its lawsuit against Ripple and the appointment of a pro-crypto chairman have eliminated years of uncertainty, making XRP a magnet for both retail and institutional capital. Analysts forecast a move to $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some models targeting $5.50–$15 by year-end if ETF approval and institutional inflows accelerate. While XRP’s upside is robust, the window for exponential returns is now shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the entry price and risk/reward profile are even more compelling. Avalanche and Bitcoin: Steady Growth, but MAGA Steals the Show Avalanche (AVAX) is trading between $18.50 and $22.06, with analysts seeing a modest recovery for 2025. While AVAX and BTC remain dependable core holdings, their near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the surge potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates out of sideways-trading assets, early-stage opportunities like MAGA are capturing the attention of traders looking for outsized returns before listings go live. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s regulatory clarity is revitalizing confidence across the crypto market, but the biggest opportunities are now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With whale accumulation, a scarcity-driven model, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA stands out as the most promising early-stage play of 2025. For those seeking to maximize returns before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout altcoin to watch as Q3 approaches.

The platform ends yield-generating services, opting for a 1:1 bitcoin custody system to reduce client risk. The change responds to rising BTC loan demand and regulatory pressure, distancing from altcoins and risky lending. On May 23, 2025, crypto lender Ledn confirmed it will stop supporting Ethereum (ETH) and shift entirely to a bitcoin-only lending model. The move takes effect on July 1, 2025, and comes as part of a broader strategy to simplify services and minimize risk. Ledn stated that it will no longer use client assets to generate yield. Instead, it will adopt a full custody model. This approach means users’ bitcoin will either remain in direct custody or with trusted custody partners, removing intermediaries and lending loops from the process. The decision reflects Ledn’s response to rising competition in the BTC-backed loan sector. It also signals the company’s commitment to reduce client exposure to lending risks that led to past collapses in the crypto lending space.

He pointed to the fact that XRP sits at about $2.35 right now. That price is low compared with where he thinks it will go. He told followers to pick up as much as they can while the chance is there. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight XRP Trading Below $3 XRP has climbed about 350% over the past year. That beat gains in some of the top altcoins in the market today. Yet many still see the move as slow. At $2.39 per coin, that view is easy to understand. Even so, BarriC calls anything under $3 a bargain. Predictions For A Rally Based on examination from his Twitter thread, BarriC expects XRP to hit $10 first. He then sees it pushing to $20 in the months ahead. Those moves would set a new high during what he calls the next alt season. If those figures come true, buyers who got in under $3 would see roughly a seven-fold gain at the $20 mark. $XRP will become very expensive to buy in the next few months and the next few years Right now, you can accumulate $XRP below $3 And somehow that’s considered a failure When $XRP skyrockets over the next few months and hits $10-$20 per #XRP That’s the new all time high… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 17, 2025 … But Possible Correction Ahead BarriC also warned of a pullback after a big rise. He thinks XRP could drop by about 50% once it reaches $20. That would put it back in the $5–$10 range. He sees that dip as a fresh chance to buy in. Even then, $5 is still higher than today’s $2.39. Long Term Vision For XRP Looking past the next cycle, BarriC outlined a bold scenario. He believes banks and big payment firms will use XRP for daily money transfers. In that case, demand could send the price all the way to $1,000 within 10 years. When banks start using $XRP We will know because of the insane price per $XRP We will see prices like $100, $500, $1,000 Per #XRP The fact that we can still accumulate $XRP at approx $2 means that banks aren’t utilising $XRP …. YET Once that day comes Once banks and… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 3, 2025 To reach that level, XRP’s market cap would top $58 trillion. That would put it on par with major pieces of the global money system. Technical Signals And Short-Term Outlook Technical indicators point to a possible drop to around $2.21 by June 22, 2025, which would be a -9.20% change from now. The current sentiment gauge reads Bullish, but the Fear & Greed Index sits at 0. Over the past 30 days, XRP had 13 out of 30 green days and showed about 5.10% price swings. Those numbers hint at mixed views. Some traders see room to run. Others expect more choppy action before the next big move.

If those start to speed up, we could see more buzz around XRP’s real-world uses. Until then, buying under $3 could look smart—or it could stay quiet for a while. Either way, investors will have to decide how much risk they want for the chance at a big payout in the years to come.

While ADA’s academic partnerships and technical progress are fueling its climb, the real excitement is building around early-stage tokens and blue-chip giants poised for even greater gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral presale momentum, and Ethereum, backed by robust fundamentals, are quickly becoming the top picks for investors seeking outperformance as summer 2025 approaches. Cardano: Bullish Surge and Real-World Progress Cardano (ADA) has rallied impressively, recently pushing above $0.82 and attracting fresh capital on the back of bullish technicals and expanding academic collaborations. Analysts predict that if ADA can sustain momentum above key support levels, it could test the $0.90–$1.00 range by the end of May, with further upside possible if the broader market remains favorable. While Cardano’s commitment to education and real-world adoption is earning it long-term credibility, its near-term price action is still influenced by overall market sentiment and Bitcoin’s performance. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Breakout Presale With Explosive Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing the competition as 2025’s most-watched presale, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—a capped 100 billion supply, 45% allocated to presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next 100x opportunity before listings go live. As the broader market consolidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the watchlists of traders and analysts alike, with some even suggesting a $1 target by year-end—a move that would eclipse the gains of most established altcoins. Ethereum: Bullish Structure and Institutional Confidence Ethereum (ETH) is quietly building momentum, trading between $2,400 and $2,900 as of May 2025 3 . Technical indicators point to a possible breakout toward $2,800–$2,900, with the Ichimoku Cloud and MACD both signaling a continuation of the uptrend. Analysts expect that sustained momentum above $2,650 could see ETH retest $3,000 as summer trading heats up. With institutional adoption, Layer 2 expansion, and the prospect of spot ETFs on the horizon, Ethereum remains a core holding for those seeking both stability and significant upside in the next cycle. Solana, XRP, and HBAR: Solid, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $158 and $175, with forecasts calling for a move to $180–$210 if macro conditions stay favorable. XRP is holding steady at $2.35, with analysts targeting $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks and $5.50–$15 by year-end if momentum persists. Hedera (HBAR) continues to build quietly, with price predictions for May 2025 averaging around $0.25. While each of these tokens offers solid fundamentals and growth prospects, none currently match the explosive presale momentum and upside potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Cardano’s surge past $0.82 is a testament to its progress and growing ecosystem, but the most aggressive capital is now flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion, a $0.007 listing target, and analysts forecasting up to 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast. For those seeking the next breakout winner as the market heats up, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum are the names on every smart investor’s radar.

This makes Cardano (ADA) a top cryptocurrency for investors seeking the next big crypto. Binance leads ADA trading volume at $2.19 million, with Bybit showing strong inflows. This activity suggests growing confidence in Cardano (ADA). Investors are locking up tokens, reducing available supply. Such moves often precede sharp price spikes.

A 500% surge seems plausible, but sustained momentum is key. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now enters the spotlight, offering a different kind of opportunity.

Analysts see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hitting $2.50 in 2025, yielding an 8,233% return from the current price. This positions it as a top crypto to buy for investors chasing high returns. The project’s focus on decentralized lending sets it apart in the altcoin space. Mutuum Finance’s lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers real utility through its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system lets users deposit assets like USDT into smart contract pools, earning interest based on pool demand. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model allows direct lending, ideal for niche assets like meme coins. Overcollateralized loans, like $7,000 in ETH for $5,000 in USDT, ensure stability. The platform’s mtTokens, such as mtETH, grow in value as interest accrues, offering passive income. These tokens are transferable, boosting flexibility across DeFi platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto for those seeking practical crypto investment options. The team is securing investor trust with a Certik audit of its smart contracts. Once finalized, results will appear on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s social channels. A leaderboard dashboard rewards the top 50 token holders with bonus tokens, encouraging long-term commitment. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates steady demand, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a best cryptocurrency to invest in. Its $100,000 giveaway for early investors adds excitement, drawing more into this new crypto coin. As phase 5 progresses, the window for low-price entry narrows. Mutuum Finance’s growth engine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fuels growth with dynamic interest rates, adjusting to market conditions. Lenders earn competitive APYs, while borrowers choose fixed or variable rates for flexibility. The upcoming stablecoin, backed by user collateral, enhances ecosystem trust.

Over 11,500 holders signal Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a crypto to buy now. Its structured approach positions it among the best cryptos to invest in for 2025, outpacing less utility-focused altcoins like Cardano (ADA). Pathway to crypto wealth Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer distinct routes to crypto riches. Cardano (ADA) banks on technical strength and whale accumulation, aiming for $10. Its market activity makes it a top crypto to buy for long-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its lending utility and presale momentum, promises a 100% ROI at launch and potentially 8,233% by hitting $2.50 in 2025.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor the market, analysts are increasingly highlighting the explosive potential of early-stage altcoins—especially MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With capital rotation intensifying and bullish sentiment building, these tokens are now at the center of the conversation for those seeking outsized gains in 2025. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Acceleration and 15,000% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% returns, with some forecasting a $1 target by year-end if current momentum continues. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation and early-stage investor enthusiasm. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with more transparency and a scarcity-driven model. Even a modest $500 stake could multiply many times over if projections hold true, making MAGA the breakout bet for the next supercycle. Ethereum: Technical Structure and Breakout Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators pointing to a possible surge toward $2,800–$2,900 if momentum holds. Analysts note that ETH is trading above its 50-day EMA and forming a bullish flag, with the RSI rebounding and volume poised to increase as summer approaches. A decisive move above $2,800 could trigger a multi-month rally, with some forecasts calling for a climb toward $4,500 by late 2025. As Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem expands and institutional adoption grows, ETH remains a cornerstone for both stability and upside in the evolving crypto landscape. XRP: Bullish Structure and Renewed Accumulation XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts closely watching as futures and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Whale accumulation has surged, historically a precursor to major rallies. Technicals show XRP forming higher lows and breaking above resistance, with projections of $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. While XRP’s legal clarity and infrastructure are positives, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. HBAR and Bitcoin: Steady Growth, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight HBAR continues to build through enterprise integrations and real-world use cases, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding above $103,000, with price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. Yet, as capital rotates for higher multiples, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the attention of those seeking the next 10x–100x opportunity. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s consolidation phase is fueling analyst interest in breakout altcoins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP now leading the charge for potential 15,000% gains in 2025. With MAGA’s presale nearly complete, a $0.007 listing target, and projections as high as 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast.

The company says investors deserve clear and timely decisions instead of silence without explanation. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel shared a post on X showing frustration with the SEC for delaying the company’s CBOE’s 19b-4 filing without explanations. SEC again delays ruling on CBOE’s 19b-4 to list options on VanEck $HODL ETF. We find the lack of explanation confounding & frustrating. Investors deserve transparency and timely action. @HesterPeirce — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) May 23, 2025 VanEck asks for answers after the SEC delays a decision on Bitcoin ETF options The SEC has again delayed a decision on whether to approve options trading for VanEck’s spot Bitcoin ETF trading under the ticker symbol $HODL. This delay further frustrated other crypto asset managers waiting for the SEC to decide on their applications. VanEck also awaits approval on a similar request to include in-kind creations and redemptions for the same Bitcoin ETF. Still, the SEC has not moved forward on that either. The feature would allow investors to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares and vice versa directly. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Matthew Sigel, posted on X claiming that the SEC does not explain why it keeps pushing back these decisions. He added that the lack of feedback makes the process more confusing and makes it difficult for applicants to understand what they need to fix or improve. Matthew described the SEC’s silence as “confounding and frustrating” because it makes the process feel unfair and unpredictable for companies trying to follow all the rules. He also tagged SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, expecting her Crypto Task Force to step in, provide answers, and show some leadership on an issue affecting many crypto players. The repeated delays without clear reasoning hurt investor confidence and slow growth and innovation as people feel uncertain about whether the SEC will ever make firm decisions or continue stalling indefinitely. The SEC keeps delaying crypto ETF decisions while new filings keep coming in The SEC has again delayed a decision on a major crypto ETF proposal affecting CoinShares’ application for a spot XRP ETF, which would be exposed to XRP through a regulated product. The SEC pushed back the decision from May 26 to Aug. 24 and sought public comments and rebuttals to the proposal rather than approving or rejecting it. This delay is one more instance in a trend where the SEC takes longer than usual without providing any explanation for the delay, leaving the applicants and the entire market wondering. The agency also stalled Fidelity’s proposals for in-kind redemptions in its spot Bitcoin ETF and a similar Ethereum-based product. The in-kind redemption is more efficient and tax-friendly because investors can swap actual crypto for ETF shares rather than using cash. The pace of new ETF applications is accelerating despite these repeated roadblocks because asset managers believe the rewards of being first to market with new crypto ETF products outweigh the frustrations of dealing with regulatory restraints. Firms have filed for ETFs based on a range of altcoins, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and XRP for the past few weeks. These products allow investors to access blockchain ecosystems and technologies outside the Bitcoin-Ethereum duopoly. Canary Capital recently filed to launch a staked Tron ETF that would track the price of the Tron token (TRX) and pass on staking rewards to investors. The SEC acknowledged this application, which shows that it might be warming up to innovative structures, even if it is not ready to approve them yet. Similarly, companies won’t stop applying because they believe the Trump administration favors crypto more than its predecessor. Industry leaders have also pointed to leadership changes and evolving political sentiment as signs that the regulatory climate may become more supportive or, at the very least, more predictable. The SEC has not released new crypto-specific guidance, but it continues to accept and publish new applications through its formal processes, which gives some hope that the agency may be preparing for a new phase of regulatory clarity KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-24 05:00:51

The price is continuing to form higher lows and higher highs on the daily chart — a positive sign for traders and investors. Current Support and Resistance Levels At the moment, XRP is finding strong support around $2.30 to $2.34. As long as the price stays above $2.30, the bullish trend remains intact. However, if XRP falls below this level with a confirmed daily candle close, there’s a chance it could drop further toward the $2.10–$2.15 zone. On the upside, there’s significant resistance at the golden pocket area between $2.55 to $2.62. A clean breakout above this zone could open the doors for a strong upward move. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Might Be the Next Crypto to Surge? , What’s Next for XRP? According to market patterns, XRP is currently following a local uptrend, though without strong momentum just yet. Analysts are watching for a potential five-wave upward move, which could confirm either a short-term rally or the start of a bigger bullish wave. There are two possible scenarios: Orange Scenario (Most Bullish): XRP needs to form five consecutive waves upward. After the first five waves, a higher low (called Wave 2) would need to hold above the May 19 swing low. If that happens, we could see further upside in Waves 3, 4, and 5, targeting $2.52, $2.58, and possibly up to $2.61. Blue Scenario (Still Bullish): This outlook allows for a slightly deeper pullback but remains positive as long as the price stays above the $2.15 support area. Even if a bigger correction happens, the market could recover strongly after. While XRP’s short-term momentum has cooled slightly, the overall trend is still bullish. As long as the key support at $2.30 holds, the market looks set for a potential climb towards $2.60 and beyond . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Currently in Stage 1 of its presale , Mantix is tipped to surge 100x in 2025 and investors are taking notice. As established platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX fight to maintain dominance, Mantix enters the scene with bold innovation, lightning-fast cross-chain trading and up to 1000x leverage. With momentum building fast, Mantix is setting the pace for the next era of DeFi trading. HYPE token climbs to global top 20 as momentum builds Hyperliquid has quietly become a serious force in crypto derivatives trading. As of May 21, 2025, it boasts a total value locked of $443 million, backed by nearly $147 million in daily volume and a staggering $7.92 billion in perpetuals trading. Unlike many of its peers, Hyperliquid hasn’t relied on aggressive VC funding or over-the-top incentive programs to draw attention. Its growth has been mostly organic, led by real traders who value performance over hype. This authenticity is reflected in its HYPE token, currently priced at around $35.28 with a market cap of $8.77 billion, ranking it among the top 20 globally. Price forecasts suggest an average of $45 this year, with possible highs near $70. Even with the usual market dips, longer-term predictions paint a bullish picture, with expectations stretching as high as $250 by 2030. DYDX news: Platform commits 25% of fees to monthly token buybacks dYdX is taking bold steps to reposition itself in a market that’s getting more competitive by the day. In an effort to reinforce token utility and strengthen network security, the platform recently rolled out a strategic buyback initiative. Announced on March 24, this program allocates 25% of dYdX’s monthly net fees to purchase tokens from the open market, which are then staked to support the protocol. If successful, that figure could scale up to 100% of platform revenue, an ambitious move designed to inject new confidence into the dYdX ecosystem. This development comes at a time when over 85% of dYdX tokens are already unlocked and actively circulating. The initiative sent the token price climbing nearly 8.5% to $0.6581 , offering a brief respite from a tough year that’s seen it drop more than 78%. New DEX Mantix targets gaps left by Hyperliquid and dYdX As platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX fight to defend their positions in the decentralized trading scene, a new contender is stepping in with serious firepower. Mantix is here to outperform. This new DEX offers everything traders want: cross-chain swaps, ultra-deep liquidity, instant settlement and leverage up to 1000x. But what truly sets it apart is its reward-driven ecosystem powered by the $MTX token. Holders get a slice of platform revenue without even needing to provide liquidity directly. Think of staking rewards but smarter. Mantix is built on transparency, speed and real ownership. No centralized gatekeepers. No silent whales making decisions in the dark. With decentralized governance, token holders shape the platform’s future. And thanks to its buyback and burn mechanism, MTX is deflationary by design. With its presale now live, Mantix is gearing up to go viral, because the market is ready for something better. Investors can pick up their MTX tokens for just $0.02, the lowest price it will ever be, as analysts project 100x gains by mid-2026.

Ethereum Ethereum (ETH) has seen significant price changes recently. In the past month, its price surged by 69.04%. Over the last week, it increased by 2.31%. However, over the past six months, the price decreased by 19.77%. This suggests a recovery from earlier losses. Currently, Ethereum’s price ranges between $2303.83 and $2715.19. The nearest resistance level is $2932; if the price breaks this, it could reach the next resistance at $3343. The nearest support level is $2109, with a secondary support at $1698. Breaking above the first resistance could lead to an 8% increase. Falling below the support may result in a 9% decrease. Technical indicators show possible future movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 68.30, close to the overbought level of 70. This may suggest a price correction soon. The Stochastic indicator is at 88.60, also indicating overbought conditions. The MACD level is 28.7005, pointing to bullish momentum. The 10-day simple moving average is $2608.14, above the 100-day average of $2509.58, which is a positive sign. Binance coin Binance coin (BNB) has been on a consistent rise. In the past week, its price went up by 4.86%. Over the last month, it increased by 14.53%, and in six months, it climbed 8.05%. The current price ranges between $626.63 and $684.83, showing a steady upward trend. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $680.39, above the 100-day SMA of $652.46, indicating short-term bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index is at 69.47, nearing overbought levels, but suggests potential for further growth. The Stochastic oscillator reads 70.41, pointing to a bullish sentiment. BNB is approaching its nearest resistance at $717. Breaking this could lead to the next resistance at $776, representing potential gains of around 5% and 13% from current prices. Support levels are at $601.47 and $543.27, which could limit downside risks. Traders are watching these levels as BNB’s upward movement continues. Conclusion Just as ETH and BNB rose quietly to the top, XYZVerse now stands poised to lead the 2025 bull run with its unique sports-focused ecosystem.

This rare feat, as highlighted by Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, marks the first time IBIT has outpaced every other ETF in daily net flows including the ever-dominant VOO, which took an unusual backseat.

Will BTC Price Go Down to $100K?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-bitcoin-price-dropping-now-will-btc-price-go-down-to-100k/,"The post Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Now? Will BTC Price Go Down to $100K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price faced a notable pullback after a failed attempt to sustain itself above the gained levels. The BTC price dropped below $107K while Ethereum and the other altcoins also witnessed a similar pullback. The ongoing crypto crash occurred at times when the stock market has also been facing a sell-off. The BTC price recovered despite the Moody’s shockwaves in the financial market by downgrading the US credit rating . Regardless of the upward pressure, Bitcoin displays huge upward potential of marking a fresh ATH in the coming days. While the institutions are piling up Bitcoin , the retailers do not seem to have entered the space. The Google search trends show retail interest is still only half of what it was in November 2024, which suggests smart money is buying while retail stays silent. This can be considered a huge bullish signal, as there was no hype, no frenzy, despite the BTC price forming new highs. On the other hand, funding rates are neutral, which hints that the leverage is under control. While there are no signs of overexposure in futures, a healthy structure is expected to continue. With the BTC price holding up above $100K, the trade setup hints at more upside ahead. Will Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Rise to $120K or Drop to $100K? Bitcoin saw a sharp and aggressive drop following Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a 50% tariff on EU imports . The sudden macro triggered broad risk-off flows, with BTC quickly selling off from local highs near $111.3K and tapping into a key fair value gap around $107.5K. Although the price witnessed a short-term bounce since the low, it failed to be validated as a bullish reversal. Currently, the momentum remains fragile, and the overall structure still favors caution as Bitcoin trades within a compression zone. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Run Could Last Until 2027, Says Top Crypto Analyst , The BTC price is trapped between two major fair value gaps, which are currently the threshold for the upcoming market direction. If the bulls reclaim the $109K to $110K area, the bulls could gain strength and push the levels towards the higher resistance beyond $112K. These levels line up with a larger supply zone and could become a key-magnet zone. On the flip side, if the BTC fails to hold the lower FVG and breaks below $107,000, it may enter the liquidity pool around $106K, which could be supported by price inefficiency and unmitigated demand just below. The current trade setup hints towards a major compression, and hence it is important that the Bitcoin (BTC) price does not get trapped in the middle range. Therefore, it would be important to witness which FVG will be filled ahead of the monthly close. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Donald Trump’s tariff announcements historically trigger “risk-off” sentiment, leading to Bitcoin and altcoin sell-offs as investors move away from speculative assets amid global economic uncertainty. How does the downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s impact Bitcoin’s price? A US credit rating downgrade can sometimes positively affect Bitcoin long-term by shaking confidence in traditional finance, prompting investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin as a hedge.

Bitcoin is rising. Institutions are joining. And yet, the market doesn’t feel like it used to. Popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe recently shared a bold thought, this market cycle is unlike the one we’ve seen before. In fact, he believes it could be longer, more powerful, and very different from the classic four-year pattern everyone’s been expecting. Despite this, he believes Bitcoin could hit $400,000 to $600,000 by 2026 or 2027. Here’s why! Forget the Old 4-Year Rule Bitcoin, the biggest player in the crypto world, continues to hit new highs of $112k and claim a larger share of the overall market. Usually, Bitcoin goes on a big run, then altcoins catch up, and eventually, everything dips before starting over. But this time? The whole rhythm seems off. In the last 18 months, Bitcoin has been taking center stage—breaking highs and growing stronger while everything else follows. It’s now holding about 60% of the total crypto market cap, a number we haven’t seen in a while. That kind of dominance usually signals that Bitcoin might slow down soon. But this time, it’s not just retail traders behind the push—it’s big players too. Institutions Are Here—and They’re Changing the Game From spot Bitcoin ETFs to interest from government leaders, the stage is being set for something much bigger. Institutions now see crypto not just as risky bets, but as real investments with long-term potential. As Matthew Kimmell from CoinShares explains , Bitcoin usually gains strength in early recoveries, then cools off when traders chase riskier coins. But today, things feel more stable. That’s why van de Poppe says we need to open our minds, maybe this cycle won’t peak in 2025. Perhaps we’re looking at 2026 or even 2027. And yes, he even sees Bitcoin reaching $400K to $600K , with altcoins flying even higher. Bigger Game for Altcoins And it’s not just about Bitcoin. If this extended cycle plays out, altcoins could see even greater growth. With more real-world use cases, better infrastructure, and rising investor interest, coins beyond BTC might finally have their breakout moment. This isn’t just speculation—it’s a shift in thinking. Van de Poppe urges investors to approach the market with an open mind.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 05:41:44

The altcoins have also bled out on a daily scale, with more than $100 billion leaving the space within this timeframe. BTC Pushed Below $107K In general, it was a very good, some would say historic, week for the primary cryptocurrency. It started on a volatile foot as it pumped from $104,000 to $107,000 on a couple of occasions on Sunday and Monday but was stopped in its tracks and driven south hard. However, the bulls kept the pressure on, and that upper boundary finally gave in on Wednesday. Moreover, bitcoin rocketed past its January all-time high of $109,100 and set a new one at almost $110,000. It was met with immediate resistance there and a drop to $106,500, but that was short-lived. Bitcoin began another, even more impressive leg up in the following hours and tapped a fresh peak at $112,000 on Pizza Day. It retraced slightly to $111,000 on Friday but remained at around that level until the POTUS recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU to start from June 1. In minutes, BTC’s price tumbled below $107,500, bounced off, and then slipped again to under $107,000. It has recovered some ground now and sits above $108,000, but it’s still over 2% down on the day. Its market cap has plunged to $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Red The altcoins have followed BTC on the way south, with substantial losses of up to 10% from the likes of DOGE, ADA, SUI, SHIB, LINK, and AVAX. Ethereum has slipped by over 5% and is now down to $2,550. XRP has dropped to just over $2.3 after a 4.4% daily decline. Even more painful price drops are evident from ENA, WIF, TIA, S, IP, and PEPE as all of them have plunged by double digits.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For Second ‘Price Discovery Uptrend’ Following $109,000 Breakout – What’s Ahead For BTC? Litecoin Attempting Key Breakout Litecoin has seen a remarkable 63% rally from April’s lows over the past month and a half, surging above crucial levels in the past few weeks. Just this month, the cryptocurrency has recovered the $80 and $90 support levels and attempted to reclaim the $100 barrier again. Fueled by the market recovery and Bitcoin’s rally past the $100,000 mark, LTC hit a two-month high of $107 nearly two weeks ago. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to hold the $100 mark. However, analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show recently suggested that Litecoin “is about to pump.” The analyst highlighted a bullish pattern on LTC’s chart, which could see the cryptocurrency rise 20% toward the $117.5 mark for the first time since early March. According to Runefelt’s chart, the cryptocurrency formed a bullish flag pattern after hitting its two-month high. Since then, LTC has hovered between the upper and lower boundary, bouncing once before from the support line toward the pattern’s resistance line. Earlier this week, Litecoin bounced again from the support after touching the $92 level, which led the analyst to suggest it has “every chance to break out of this bullish flag to the upside.” On Friday, the altcoin jumped 11% from the pattern lows, briefly breaking out and hitting the $102 mark before retracing to the $96 mark. The cryptocurrency now hovers between the $98-$99 levels, just 1% below the pattern’s upper boundary. A surge above this level to confirm the breakout could set the stage for the pattern’s $117.5 target and mark a significant push toward a key horizontal level. LTC Preparing For Rally To $150? Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Litecoin needs a Monthly Close above its key resistance level to target the $150 mark and above. He highlighted the $110-$125 horizontal level, explaining that LTC “spends most of its time below it and very little time comparatively beyond it.” The analyst noted that since 2019, the rejection from this resistance level has been getting “progressively weaker over time to the point where only a couple of months ago, LTC tried to retest this region as support” during the early 2025 rally. Despite failing to reclaim this level, this could suggest that the resistance is “struggling to hold price down,” which is why the next breakout above this area could signal that “the chances of a successful retest are high.” Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? Moreover, the weakening of the resistance could be partly attributed to its multi-year Marco Higher Low, as Litecoin has bounced from the ascending trendline toward this resistance each time it has been retested. Based on this, the analyst considers that a Monthly Close above the key horizontal level, followed by a retest to confirm the breakout, would give the necessary strength for a 30% rally above the $150 mark for the first time since 2021. As of this writing, Litecoin trades at $98.60, a 2.7% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Yet, as Cardano’s ecosystem expands, the political meme coin sector is capturing the imagination of both traders and analysts. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its explosive presale momentum and viral narrative, is emerging as the breakout contender—offering a unique blend of political relevance and early-stage upside that’s hard to ignore. Cardano: Cutting-Edge Tech and Real-World Integration In 2025, Cardano is leading blockchain development with a suite of technological breakthroughs. Its Plutus smart contract language and Layer 2 scaling solution, Hydra, are enabling more efficient, secure, and automated business processes. Cardano’s smart contracts now power everything from instant supply chain payments to decentralized finance, while the network’s focus on interoperability is breaking down barriers between blockchains and fostering seamless asset transfers. Academic partnerships, such as the Cardano Foundation’s collaboration with PUC-Rio, are fueling research in blockchain economics, DeFi, and DAO governance, further cementing Cardano’s role as a research-driven blockchain leader. These advancements are not only attracting enterprise adoption but also inspiring new business models and decentralized applications that could reshape industries. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Momentum in the Political Crypto Arena While Cardano’s technological progress is impressive, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the playbook for political meme coins. Unlike fleeting trends, MAGA leverages a scarcity-driven model—capped at 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, and audited by HashEx—to create a foundation for exponential growth. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% ROI, with a $1 target by year-end seen as plausible if current momentum holds. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to channel political sentiment into tangible market traction. The coin’s presale has already raised over $8 million, with whale allocations and rapid sellouts highlighting strong conviction among early backers. MAGA’s blend of grassroots energy, viral marketing, and structured tokenomics is positioning it as the political crypto to watch as the 2025 election cycle heats up. Why the Market Is Watching MAGA Political meme coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are doing more than just riding election headlines—they’re building communities around shared identity and purpose. This emotional and financial engagement is driving unprecedented capital inflows, making MAGA not only a symbol of political culture but also a high-conviction investment for those seeking outsized returns before exchange listings. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering a rare ground-floor opportunity as the next wave of political and meme-driven crypto gains takes shape. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Cardano’s technological advancements are pushing blockchain into new territory, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s viral rise in the political crypto arena is redefining what’s possible for early-stage investors.

Table of Contents A step forward for Solaxy…But questions remain The next Pepe that will spread everywhere: PEPETO The untold origin story that crypto can’t stop talking about: PEPE…TO ? Behind PEPETO, there’s real tech and real plans Currently at $0.000000130, Tier 1 listing could hit any moment For those who have invested in Solaxy or are thinking about it, here’s something worth seriously considering. Solaxy markets itself as the first Layer 2 built on Solana, and while that sounds bold, ask: does Solana even need it? Layer 2 solutions make a big impact on Ethereum, where high gas fees and slow transaction speeds hold back usability. But Solana is already known for lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low fees. Adding another layer to an already efficient system might not bring the same level of improvement. Solaxy could still see short-term gains on hype alone, maybe even a 5x, but when it comes to long-term value, it’s not clear how this tech fills a real need. That raises a bigger question: without solving a clear problem, can Solaxy stay relevant? You might also like: Pepe climbs 60%: Which memecoin will be the next 100x this bull run, Pepe or Pepeto? A step forward for Solaxy…But questions remain Everyone’s watching what Solaxy does next , but is it building something people will remember? Recently, the team teamed up with Hyperlane to launch a testnet bridge. This lets users send SOL quickly and safely on a trial version of the network. They’re building a system that could later connect Solana to Ethereum, making it easier to move assets between blockchains. It’s a solid step forward. But let’s be honest, a testnet is just that: a test. It doesn’t prove long-term impact yet. It’s progress, yes, but it doesn’t have the kind of viral energy that turns a memecoin into a breakout star. Solaxy still doesn’t have a strong story. And in today’s crypto world, story matters just as much as technology. Solaxy is good, but good alone doesn’t guarantee staying power once the spotlight moves on. The next Pepe that will spread everywhere: PEPETO While others are still finding their footing, Pepeto is gaining serious momentum. Early buyers are stacking in before the noise hits, and this might be the memecoin everyone regrets missing in 2025. Let’s see why it checks every box for the next x 100 memecoin: The untold origin story that crypto can’t stop talking about: PEPE…TO ? Born from what many say was the original Pepe blueprint, Pepeto steps in with something the market hasn’t seen: purpose . While Pepe went viral, Pepeto brings back what was left behind — a full identity built on P recision, E nergy, P ower, and E fficiency… and the two missing pieces that change everything : Technology and Optimization . That’s what makes this more than a meme. It’s a comeback. Behind PEPETO, there’s real tech and real plans Most memecoins stop at community and jokes. Pepeto, aka God of frogs doesn’t. With its own multi-chain swap (PepetoSwap) being built, a staking system that rewards loyalty, and plans to support real movement between chains like Ethereum and Solana, it’s giving holders more than hope, it’s giving them tools. Here’s what sets Pepeto apart: Cross-chain PepetoSwap in development Early staking rewards to reward long-term holding A real story with viral potential Active community rooted in more than memes A meme coin that’s actually building something useful Currently at $0.000000130, Tier 1 listing could hit any moment Crypto whispers are getting louder: a Tier 1 exchange listing could be next for Pepeto. And yet, the token is still priced at just $0.00000013 . That’s the kind of number that made early Pepe (same market supply as PEPETO) and Shiba buyers millions. The difference? This time, you’re early. The price is low, the story is strong, and listing rumors are gaining traction. For those curious, take a look at the website and see what’s being built , this might be an early window before the spotlight arrives. How to buy Pepeto: Go to pepeto.io , connect MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and pay with ETH, USDT , or BNB. It’s fast. It’s simple. It’s right now. (With 288% staking rewards).

33767162,[object Object],1748066455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating The $1.1 Billion Slice Of Crypto History,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-the-1-1-billion-slice-of-crypto-history/,"May 22, 2025, marked another Bitcoin Pizza Day . It began with a simple trade back in 2010. A Florida programmer offered 10,000 bitcoins for two large pizzas. Those pizzas cost about $41 then. Now, those same coins are worth over $1.1 billion. That shift highlights how much has changed in just 15 years. First Real Bitcoin Purchase According to BitcoinTalk forum records, on May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz posted a request to swap 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. A 19-year-old user known as “jercos” agreed. He bought two pies from Papa John’s for roughly $25 and had them sent to Hanyecz’s door. That moment became the first time Bitcoin was used to buy a physical item. It was simple and almost accidental. Few saw it as the start of something big. Value Surge Over Time Based on reports from market data sites, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,056 on May 23, 2025, up 0.25% in 24 hours. A single coin now tops six figures. Those 10,000 BTC would today buy about 70 million pizzas at the same price. The global crypto market cap sits near $3.50 trillion. This rise shows how early bets on crypto have paid off, though not without big swings along the way. Community Celebrations Worldwide From Berlin to Manila , local communities celebrate the day with meetups and speeches. In the Philippines, fans organize booths and panels to educate neophytes. They offer advice on wallets, security, and reading blockchain information. In Europe, small restaurants even accept crypto payments for slices. It’s a mix of party atmosphere and beginner lessons. People share stories of their first trades or near-missed gains. What This Means For Users For others, Bitcoin Pizza Day is not just nostalgia. It illustrates the risks and rewards of early technology wagers. It reminds consumers how quickly markets shift. Retail investors observe that small decisions in 2010 can equal gigantic amounts today. But it also cautions against wild volatility. Prices increase or decrease by thousands within a matter of hours. Figuring out how to cope with that is now part of rudimentary crypto literacy. Bitcoin Over The Years Over 15 years, Bitcoin has gone from underground code to a mainstream asset, exchanges now offer futures, ETFs and custody services, some governments even talk of holding it as a reserve, and US President Donald Trump has called for clear crypto rules. As wallets and apps get friendlier, people are using Bitcoin for everyday buys and building on-chain payment tools. Before long, grabbing coffee with Bitcoin could feel as normal as swiping a card, an idea that started in 2010 when 10,000 coins bought two pizzas.

45031345,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=733848,1748066566,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45031345.jpeg,America is ‘going big’ on crypto after years of industry starvation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/besset-says-america-is-going-big-on-crypto/,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent affirmed that the administration is committed to positioning the country as the global leader in digital assets. Bessent, speaking to Bloomberg, said the government is “going big” on crypto, a striking contrast with the previous administration, which took a restrictive approach that left many companies struggling to survive. In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bessent said that, instead, the White House plans to tighten up anti-money laundering (AML) standards for digital assets, especially stablecoins. He said the administration will pursue strong compliance while encouraging innovation, stating, “Digital asset companies deserve regulatory clarity, and that’s exactly what we are working toward.” Bessent also highlighted one of his key projections that stablecoins will generate $2 trillion in demand for U.S. Treasuries and bills in the near term, far more than the current $300 billion. According to the Treasury Secretary, this shift will inject a lot of liquidity into traditional markets without weakening oversight. Legislative momentum is also building in Washington. A bipartisan stablecoin bill that recently cleared a procedural roadblock in the U.S. Senate could soon become a reality. The measure had been stalled by a filibuster, which the Senate voted to end 66–32 earlier this month, allowing debate on the floor. Key changes to the bill brokered by crypto-supporting Democrats led by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks brought the breakthrough. They also dropped demands for a ban on former President Donald Trump profiting from his family’s crypto investments. The legislation marks a pivotal step, but even though a final vote might not take place until after the Memorial Day recess, industry insiders say. If it passes, it will create a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, ending years of legal limbo and inviting more institutional participation to the industry. Bessent eyes relief for the Treasury market Bessent hinted at heavily transforming the traditional financial system beyond digital assets. He said U.S. regulators are nearing the end of a process that will remove the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) requirement on banks that trade Treasuries. As a post-2008 crisis safeguard, the SLR currently requires banks to hold more capital against holding trading Treasuries in their reserves. Bessent said that removal could increase liquidity in the $29 trillion market and lower Treasury yields by a few basis points. The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC are in discussions. This would represent a significant regulatory change and may help digital asset markets. Trump’s crypto dinner stirs debate Meanwhile, President Trump is seizing the opportunity to brand himself as crypto’s political champion. In a recent Truth Social post, he said the U.S. is ‘dominating in crypto, bitcoin, etc.,’ vowing to ‘keep it that way.’ The top 220 holders of Trump’s TRUMP meme coin were invited to a high-profile crypto dinner at Trump’s Virginia golf club. Legislators raised concerns about the VIP event’s transparency and its ethical implications. It was reported to have raised $148 million. They questioned the concentration among Trump-linked entities and the risk of foreign influence. Despite the criticism, attendees viewed the dinner as indicative of just how politically relevant crypto is becoming. The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the president was there in his personal time and that no official guest list will be released. Several guests attended with the intent of changing Trump’s stance on crypto regulation, the New York Times later reported.

45031245,https://timestabloid.com/?p=68277,1748066710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Shows that Banks Are Eyeing XRP to Run Entire Digital Ecosystems,https://timestabloid.com/expert-shows-that-banks-are-eyeing-xrp-to-run-entire-digital-ecosystems/,"A recent post by crypto commentator All Things XRP presents a comprehensive argument that XRP’s utility is moving far beyond its well-known role in cross-border payments. The commentator outlines a broad vision where XRP, along with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s infrastructure, becomes an essential component in the digital transformation of global financial systems. According to this analysis, banks are preparing to leverage XRP for payments and a foundation for CBDCs, asset tokenization, digital custody, DeFi, and liquidity services. The post asserts that XRP is already integrated into significant financial systems. Over 100 financial institutions are reportedly utilizing RippleNet for cross-border payments. However, the commentary emphasizes that Ripple’s strategic direction is evolving. The original focus on remittances and international transfers is now being complemented by ambitions to embed Ripple’s technology deeper into the core operations of banking infrastructure. WILD TAKE: XRP won’t just power payments. Banks are eyeing it to run entire digital ecosystems — from CBDCs to custody to asset tokenization. This isn't just speculation. Let me show you why. pic.twitter.com/kOm9iQrQiA — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 21, 2025 CBDCs and XRP as Multi-Function Infrastructure The commentator points to the partnership between Ripple and Colombia’s central bank , which tests central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) using Ripple’s platform. This initiative is described as more than a pilot. The tweet suggests XRP could serve as the transmission layer, the storage system, and the transaction coordinator for CBDCs. If adopted broadly, banks could generate revenue through the distribution, settlement, and custody of these digital currencies. Further, the commentary addresses the XRP Ledger’s capacity for real-world asset tokenization . This includes tokenizing assets such as real estate, bonds, and commodities. The post proposes that banks could use these features to mint and manage tokenized versions of physical assets. According to the author, the potential mirrors traditional asset managers like BlackRock, but with blockchain-native mechanisms that streamline trading and management. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Digital Custody, DeFi, and Institutional Growth The analysis also focuses on digital custody . As institutional involvement in cryptocurrency grows, secure storage of digital assets becomes critical. The post claims that Ripple’s infrastructure could position banks to take on this custodial role, storing XRP and other crypto assets on behalf of clients. This service could provide banks with recurring revenue through custody fees, a model aligned with how traditional finance handles securities and vault services. DeFi, though still in an early stage within the XRP ecosystem, is identified as another area for growth. With emerging smart contract capabilities on XRPL, banks may one day offer services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming directly on-chain. According to the tweet, Ripple is preparing for this possibility now, setting the groundwork for a broader rollout once regulatory conditions are clarified. Liquidity Services and the Role of Regulation Liquidity provision is another proposed use case. Banks could supply XRP liquidity for foreign exchange (FX) markets, profiting from spread differentials, lending, and market-making activities. The author emphasizes the benefits of speed and scale, suggesting that XRP-based liquidity could eliminate the need for intermediaries and allow banks to handle volume with greater efficiency. The commentary acknowledges that many of these applications are still in development and not mainstream. However, the author insists the infrastructure is already in place, and interest from financial institutions is increasing. As regulatory clarity improves, particularly in the United States following the high-profile SEC lawsuit against Ripple, banks are becoming more confident in exploring XRP for a wider range of functions. In closing, All Things XRP proposes that the financial sector’s interest in XRP is not limited to accelerating payments. Rather, banks may be preparing to use XRP and Ripple technology to construct a new layer of global financial infrastructure. The message is clear: XRP is not just a tool for transactions but potentially a foundational component of future banking systems.

Despite the buzz surrounding this major exchange debut, PI’s price has fallen 3.5% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $0.7821, highlighting growing concerns about its volatility and centralization. Kraken Offers 20x Leverage for U.S. Traders With the new perpetual futures contracts, users on Kraken Pro can now go long or short on Pi with up to 20x leverage. The contract supports over 360 markets and accepts more than 40 different collateral options. This move makes it easier than ever for U.S. traders to access Pi futures without additional regulatory or platform hurdles. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts do not expire, allowing traders to hold their positions indefinitely—though funding fees may apply based on market conditions. This listing is seen as a potential signal of growing institutional interest in Pi, despite its absence from top-tier exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Centralization and Privacy Issues Raise Red Flags Despite development efforts, Pi Network continues to face criticism over its token distribution and privacy practices. Currently, about 60% of the total PI supply is still controlled by the core team. Dr. Altcoin, a prominent supporter of the project, has voiced serious concerns about the lack of transparency from the Pi Core Team, particularly regarding how user data is collected and used. He warns that this data could potentially be used for: AI training Identity theft Tracking users’ real-world movements Without proper disclosure, he believes user trust and data privacy remain at serious risk. New Ecosystem Updates from Pi Network Amid these controversies, Pi Network has introduced several ecosystem improvements, including: Five new community apps integrated into the Pi Mainnet Ecosystem Interface A simplified account recovery process, aimed at boosting accessibility and user participation These updates reflect ongoing efforts to enhance Pi’s utility and ecosystem engagement, though questions remain about transparency and market readiness. Final Thoughts Pi Network’s listing on Kraken’s futures platform marks a major milestone, giving the project more visibility and market tools for traders. However, the price slump, transparency concerns, and centralized token holdings may continue to weigh on sentiment. As institutional attention increases, the Pi Core Team’s next moves—especially regarding communication and decentralization—will be closely watched.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ZRX|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-24 06:08:22

What It Means for XRP Price and XRP News appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Crypto Market Is Heating Up , And XRP Is in the Spotlight Bitcoin has surged past $110K, while XRP is making waves again with bullish price forecasts and rising interest. But outside the usual headlines, two lesser-known coins , Solaxy and Pepeto , are quietly building momentum. One leans on technical development, the other on community firepower and viral storytelling. The difference? One might trend , the other might take over. Solaxy’s Bold Claim , Is Solana’s Layer 2 Necessary? Solaxy is attracting attention by branding itself as the first Layer 2 project built on Solana. But Solana already processes transactions quickly and cheaply. Unlike Ethereum, it doesn’t struggle with speed or gas fees. So what value does a Layer 2 really add? Solaxy might still generate some early excitement and short-term returns, but it’s unclear if this tech delivers something game-changing in the long term. Building Behind the Scenes , But Not Breaking Out Yet Solaxy recently teamed up with Hyperlane to launch a testnet bridge, which lets users send native SOL in a secure test environment. The goal is to eventually support transfers between Solana and Ethereum. It’s a positive step, but testnets are still early-stage. They don’t typically create hype. Without a compelling story behind the product, even solid development can fly under the radar. Solaxy is progressing, but it hasn’t captured the spotlight , yet. Pepeto Steps Up , The Meme With a Mission Then there’s Pepeto. Not just a meme coin , it’s a mission coin. Backed by a fiery origin story and growing support, Pepeto has become the talk of meme circles. Some believe it revives the true roots of Pepe, but adds depth and structure. Its name says it all: P recision, E nergy, P ower, E fficiency, Technology, Optimization . That’s not just branding , that’s a blueprint for going viral in 2025.

While established players like SUI and Dogecoin capture headlines with impressive price movements, a revolutionary newcomer is quietly building momentum that could reshape the entire gaming and DeFi landscape. BitLemons ($BLEM) isn’t just another token riding market waves—it’s a revenue-generating powerhouse that’s already proven its mettle with over $2 million raised and a fully operational crypto casino disrupting the $450 billion traditional gaming market. Smart money is flowing toward projects with real utility and sustainable tokenomics, and BitLemons delivers on both fronts with its groundbreaking 30% Gross Gaming Revenue allocation model. While SUI tests new highs and DOGE attempts crucial breakouts, seasoned investors are recognizing that BitLemons represents something far more valuable: a chance to get in early on a protocol that generates revenue 24/7, burns tokens systematically, and rewards holders through high-yield staking—all while being backed by dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof. Is SUI’s Momentum Sustainable at Current Levels? SUI has been commanding attention with its impressive surge to $3.86, driven by expanding adoption across the DeFi ecosystem and growing institutional confidence. The blockchain’s unique approach to parallel transaction processing has attracted developers and users alike, creating a virtuous cycle of growth that’s reflected in both price action and network activity. Technical analysis reveals SUI has maintained strong bullish momentum over the past seven days, with trading volume surging approximately 23% as the token broke through key resistance levels. The $3.80-$3.90 range has emerged as critical support, while bulls are eyeing the psychological $4.00 barrier. RSI readings suggest the token isn’t yet overbought, leaving room for continued upward movement if broader market conditions remain favorable. Can DOGE Finally Break the $0.40 Ceiling That’s Held for Months? Dogecoin is staging what could be its most significant breakout attempt in recent months, currently trading at $0.2451 while building pressure against the stubborn $0.40 resistance level. The meme coin’s community-driven momentum has intensified, with social media engagement and whale accumulation patterns suggesting renewed institutional interest in the original meme cryptocurrency. The past week has seen DOGE consolidate within a tight $0.23-$0.25 range, with volume increasing by roughly 18% as traders position for the anticipated breakout. Technical indicators show the 50-day moving average providing solid support around $0.22, while the $0.40 resistance remains the key level to watch. If DOGE can finally pierce this ceiling, analysts project a potential rally toward $0.48, representing nearly 100% upside from current levels. Why Are Savvy Investors Calling BitLemons the “Stealth Rocket” of 2025? While market participants debate whether SUI can maintain its momentum and DOGE can break its ceiling, BitLemons ($BLEM) is quietly executing a strategy that traditional crypto projects can only dream of achieving. This isn’t just another speculative token—it’s a fully operational crypto casino generating real revenue from over 8,000 games provided by industry giants like Evolution and Pragmatic Play. What sets BitLemons apart is its revolutionary tokenomics model that allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue directly to token holders through a dual mechanism: 15% funds systematic token buybacks and burns, creating deflationary pressure, while the remaining 15% flows to stakers as high-yield rewards. With dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof—validation that competitors simply cannot match—BitLemons has established itself as the institutional-grade choice in the GambleFi space. The numbers tell an incredible story of momentum and demand. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, Stage 2 has completely sold out, and Stage 3 is already 11.23% filled with tokens currently priced at $0.03. Having raised over $2 million including $1 million in seed funding, BitLemons is methodically advancing through its 13-stage presale structure, with each stage increasing the token price by $0.01. Industry insiders continue to whisper about potential listing prices between $0.17 and $0.18, representing extraordinary upside for current participants. BitLemons operates in a league of its own because it never sleeps—the platform generates revenue 24/7 while systematically reducing token supply and rewarding loyal holders. This creates a perfect storm of deflationary mechanics, passive income generation, and exposure to the massive $450 billion traditional casino market that’s ripe for blockchain disruption. Are you ready to position yourself ahead of the institutions who are quietly accumulating positions in the next generation of revenue-generating crypto protocols? While others chase momentum plays and hope for breakouts, BitLemons offers something far more valuable: a fundamentally sound investment backed by real revenue, audited security, and tokenomics designed to reward early believers. The window for seed-round pricing won’t remain open forever. With each presale stage bringing higher prices and growing investor demand, the opportunity to secure allocation at current levels represents a rare chance to participate in what could become the defining success story of the 2025 crypto cycle. Don’t let this incredible seed entry opportunity slip through your fingers while you’re watching others chase yesterday’s winners.
