Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough For months, the cryptocurrency has been on a downward trajectory; however, it is currently exhibiting significant signs of recovery. The next significant level for LINK is $17, and investors and experts are closely monitoring the stock. Chainlink has begun to draw the attention of both institutional and retail investors after breaking out of a falling channel and passing key exponential moving averages. This technical breakout could pave the way for even larger gains. Whale Activity Increases Confidence Activity from whales has been one of the prime movers for the upward momentum currently being seen in LINK. As IntoTheBlock would have it, large LINK transactions have jumped 8.56% in the last 24 hours. The spike suggests that large players are very bullish, and it is not something that has gone unnoticed. Retail interest is also increasing, with a 2.10% increase in new addresses and a 1.09% gain in daily active users. Chainlink is trending on social media, according to Santiment’s research, with its sentiment and weight metrics showing a 0.28% jump. Investors are talking, and the chatter is fueling LINK’s upward march. LINK Price Action Presently, at a price of $16.94, Chainlink is up by 11% in the last 24 hours, getting ready to take the next leap and break above the $17.12 resistance barrier. Analysts believe that if this surpasses the specified barrier, the path to $30 will become more likely. Some predict that continued momentum may facilitate a retest of LINK’s all-time high of $52.88, achieved in May 2021. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is experiencing a bullish November, with Bitcoin remaining above $98,000. This broader confidence is boosting Chainlink’s potential, but it still needs to catch up to prior highs. #Chainlink🔗 is attempting to break the multi-year resistance.

Additionally exploding open interest in LINK will help to support the positive story. Although technical indicators and market mood forecast future, reaching a new all-time high would need constant market confidence and suitable conditions.

In particular, the altcoins have responded quite positively to the election of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump as the next US President. Related Reading: Wyckoff Cycle Shows Where We Are In The Market And When Altcoin Season Will Begin XRP, ADA, TON, Others Stand Out Amidst Bullish Altcoins Performance In its weekly report on November 22, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant reported that several altcoins have experienced large price spikes after the US Presidential election on November 5. The analytics firm reports that daily spot trading volume in the altcoin market reached $18 billion on November 11, the highest since early August, indicating an increased market interest in these tokens. CryptoQuant explains that these positive developments in the altcoin market hinges on general expectations of a friendly regulatory approach by US President-elect Donald Trump who continuously declared intentions to support the digital asset industry during his electoral campaign. In particular, CryptoQuant highlights XRP as one of the best-performing assets since the US Presidential elections. The sixth largest cryptocurrency has risen by 154% to $1.45 in the past two weeks, which has coincided with a record-high DEX volume of $3.5 million on the XRPL network. Aside from XRP, Tron (TRX) has also grabbed market attention reaching a new all-time high of 10 million daily transaction count as USDT supply on the blockchain network moved above the $60 billion mark. TRX has gained by 25% since November 5 rising to $0.20. Furthermore, Toncoin (TON) has experienced a market rebound rising by 27% since the elections to reach a local peak of $5.75. Importantly, Toncoin maintains a high network activity as evidenced by its 1 million daily active addresses compared to the 60,000 recorded at the start of 2024. Other altcoins in CryptoQuant’s report include Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) which have gained by 62.42% and 206.06%, respectively since Donald Trump’s electoral victory.

This surge has reignited bullish sentiment among analysts and investors, who are now closely monitoring AVAX’s potential to reach the key $50 mark in the coming days. The breakout signals a shift in market dynamics, with rising demand and growing optimism fueling the price action. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour Prominent analyst and crypto investor Kaleo shared a detailed technical analysis on X, suggesting that once AVAX surpasses the $50 level, it could trigger a massive rally. He highlighted the importance of this psychological and technical level as a gateway to exponential price growth, potentially attracting more momentum-driven buyers. Avalanche’s recent performance reflects the broader strength of the crypto market, as key altcoins experience renewed interest amid a bullish cycle. With market conditions aligning favorably, AVAX could continue its upward trajectory if it holds above its current levels. However, traders are also cautious and aware of potential profit-taking or resistance near the $50 threshold. Avalanche Prepares For A Rally Avalanche is on the verge of a massive rally, closely following a pattern reminiscent of its last bullish cycle. The price has surged above key supply levels with impressive strength and is now less than 15% away from the critical $50 mark. This level has captured the attention of both traders and analysts, as a breakout above it could signal the start of an aggressive bullish phase. Kaleo recently shared a technical analysis on X, emphasizing the importance of the $50 level. According to Kaleo, breaking this psychological and technical barrier could trigger a powerful rally, potentially doubling AVAX’s value in a short period. He also highlighted the AVAXBTC chart, which shows a similar breakout pattern, confirming the bullish sentiment surrounding Avalanche. Kaleo predicts that AVAX could reach $100 quickly if the momentum continues. Despite the optimism, the potential for a market-wide correction introduces a degree of caution. With Bitcoin showing signs of possible retracement to consolidate and gather momentum, AVAX may face temporary pullbacks. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTHs Start Taking Profits – Metrics Reveal Whales Are Actively Spending However, such corrections could present buying opportunities for those eyeing long-term gains. As Avalanche approaches this pivotal stage, investors are eager to see if it can break above the $50 level and deliver the explosive rally analysts have forecasted. AVAX Testing Fresh Supply Levels Avalanche is trading at $43.6, marking its highest price level since April following a strong breakout above key resistance around $35. This impressive price action has reignited optimism among investors and analysts, with AVAX showing resilience as it pushes toward fresh supply levels. Currently, AVAX appears poised to challenge the critical $50 mark, a psychological and technical level that could determine the next phase of its rally. However, there is a possibility that the token may consolidate below this level in the coming days. Consolidation would allow the market to absorb recent gains and build momentum for a stronger push higher. On the downside, if AVAX struggles to reclaim $50, it could trigger a retrace to lower demand zones, providing the necessary support to fuel its next leg up. Such a pullback would not signal a bearish trend but rather a healthy correction that could strengthen AVAX’s trajectory toward sustained growth.

Amidst this bearish warning, the coin’s price’s continued upward movement towards the elusive $100,000 mark has become the center of attention in the crypto community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2017 Pattern, Is The Top Only 2 Weeks Away After Hitting $100,000? $100,000 Bitcoin Price As A Psychological Resistance Crypto analyst Gert van Lagen recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce to his 108,000 followers that the Bitcoin price is approaching the $100,000 all time high. The analyst has suggested that its climb to $100,000 would be like hitting major price levels of $10, $100, and $10,000 for the first time. According to Lagen, the $100,000 milestone is set to present a psychological resistance for Bitcoin, potentially leading to short-term price volatility. Based on the analyst’s statements, this psychological resistance could temporarily stall the crypto’s rally above $100,000. While sharing this bearish warning, Lagen also issued a bullish forecast for Bitcoin, highlighting that a surge to the target zone of $220,000 to $320,000 was likely before the global recession set in. While this prediction could be well received by BTC if it continues on its bullish momentum, the analyst has asserted that the timeline to reach these heights may be limited. In preparation for the projected Bitcoin psychological barrier, Lagen has advised crypto investors to short their BTC at the $100,000 mark. Traders who leverage this strategy will have to bet on the possibility of a price correction in Bitcoin before it experiences any significant breakout to the upside. With Bitcoin approaching the $100,000 price level, the stakes are getting higher, as analysts believe that this key milestone could serve as a launch pad to propel the cryptocurrency to a price top. For now, the price is trading at $98,560, marking a 7.63% increase in the last seven days as bullish sentiment and momentum continue to grow. Massive Liquidation To Follow If BTC Hits $100,000 Although the crypto market is anticipating Bitcoin’s price rise to $100,000, a prominent analyst has revealed that massive liquidation could be triggered once BTC reaches this fundamental level. According to Ali Martinez, $1.89 billion is set to be liquidated if Bitcoin jumps to the $100,625 level. Based on the analyst’s chart, this Bitcoin liquidation represents its “cumulative short liquidation leverage.” This analysis follows reports of a large-scale Bitcoin liquidation, as Martinez recently revealed that a whopping 65,000 BTC, valued at $6.37 billion, was withdrawn from exchanges. Related Reading: Chinese Court Declares Personal Crypto Ownership Legal In Mainland China Martinez has also revealed that Bitcoin’s TD Sequential is flashing a sell signal on its 4-hour chart. Given this, the analyst has predicted a significant correction to the $97,085 mark. On the flip side, the analyst has disclosed that if Bitcoin can hold a candlestick above $100,470, it would invalidate the bearish formation and potentially propel its price towards $102,656 or $104,343.

Related Reading: Upbit Listing Sends BONK Skyrocketing 67% For A Fresh ATH In Memecoin Mania XRP’s price has reached $1.43, marking a monumental 25% increase in the past day alone, bringing its weekly gains to a solid 50%. For investors and traders, the question isn’t if the altcoin will break its ATH but when. Prominent crypto analyst CrediBULL has shared an audacious forecast on X (formerly Twitter): XRP will surpass its ATH much more quickly than most anticipate. I think $XRP is probably going to make new ATH a lot quicker than most are expecting- and I think it’s going to vastly outperform both $BTC and $ETH from current levels while doing it. XRP/ETH just reclaimed and retested a 4 year long range, with the first target being ~250%… pic.twitter.com/fLYlH2GEYB — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) November 21, 2024 Surpassing Bitcoin And Ethereum The most recent performance of XRP has been nothing short of remarkable. The coin has experienced a 90% increase in value over the past 90 days, surpassing Bitcoin (up 51%) and Ethereum (up 20%). The two market leaders are expected to be outperformed by XRP, as this short-term dominance indicates a change in market dynamics. Still, there’s an issue. Bitcoin is nearing its ATH of about $99K while Ethereum is just 30% below its peak. By contrast, the crypto asset stays 60% below its six-year-old ATH. This discrepancy highlights the difficult climb XRP must do to reclaim its prior dominance even while it shows promise for development. The XRP/ETH trading pair has left a four-year range, which suggests a possible 240% increase and has added to the optimism, CrediBULL pointed out. The next major XRP advancement could be spurred on by this breakthrough. Upbeat Technical Indicators Technically, XRP is showing strong bullish signals. While important indices, such the Relative Strength Index (RSI), show reduced selling pressure, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) provides strong support for the present price trend. Over the next three months, analysts predict its price will rise by 7.3%; following six months, they expect an 80.96% rise, data from CoinCheckup shows. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough The ability of XRP to consistently surpass resistance levels is the driving force behind these forecasts. The path to $2—and beyond—may be closer than skeptics believe if it maintains this momentum. A Market-Defining Moment The recent price fluctuations of XRP are a part of a larger narrative unfolding in the cryptocurrency market. As institutional adoption and regulation continue to expand, XRP is asserting itself as a top contender in the next wave of crypto expansion. Its current price of $1.54 reflects both a resurgence in investor confidence and a recovery from recent volatility. Meanwhile, XRP holders are on high alert watching the charts. The sentiment for XRP is undoubtedly bullish, even if the market cannot settle on anything yet. It could be the start of a greater rally if the stars align right into a new ATH.

According to a crypto analyst, this pattern, known as the ‘Bullish Megaphone‘, could signal a possible price rise to $10,000 for ETH. Related Reading: Chinese Court Declares Personal Crypto Ownership Legal In Mainland China Bullish Megaphone Sets Stage For Ethereum Price Rise To $10,000 A Blockchain and crypto technical analyst, identified as ‘EtherNasyonal,’ on X (formerly Twitter), has predicted that the Ethereum price could soon surpass $10,000. According to the analyst, Ethereum‘s price action currently showcases a historical chart pattern, the Bullish Megaphone, observed during the 2016 to 2017 bull market. The Bullish Megaphone pattern is a technical indicator consisting of two higher highs and two lower lows, often indicating a potential uptrend continuation for a cryptocurrency. This technical pattern is considered bullish when a cryptocurrency’s price breaks above the trend line with increasing volume. Looking at the analyst’s Ethereum price chart from 2016 to 2017 and another for 2024 to 2025, the Bullish megaphone pattern has formed in both bull cycles. Moreover, at the end of the key technical pattern in 2017, the Ethereum price skyrocketed to new price levels, surpassing the $1,200 mark by 2018. EtherNasyonal has suggested that as Ethereum repeats this pattern in the current bull market, it could signal a similar massive price surge, with a potential rally above $10,000. As of writing, CoinMarketCap reveals that the price of Ethereum is trading at $3,353, marking a 7.24% surge in the last seven days. At its current price, a rally to the $10,000 mark would represent a 198% increase for Ethereum, highlighting a substantial surge in value. The analyst has also noted that altcoins will likely follow Ethereum’s bullish momentum and experience a similar uptrend. This price rally in ETH could further impact the future trajectory of altcoins in the crypto market this bullish cycle. Is The Altcoin Season Here? Historically, Ethereum has been a significant catalyst or determining factor to the start of the highly anticipated altcoin season. While Bitcoin’s dominance tends to decline significantly around this period after experiencing a remarkable bull run, altcoins typically follow this bullish trajectory, with Ethereum taking the lead as it trails behind Bitcoin’s price rally. MikyBull Crypto, a prominent analyst on X, declared that the altcoin season for this current bull cycle has officially begun. For clarity, the altcoin season is after Bitcoin’s consolidation phase, which follows a rally, where smaller-cap cryptocurrencies begin a strong market rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2017 Pattern, Is The Top Only 2 Weeks Away After Hitting $100,000? MikyBull Crypto has optimistically revealed that from late December 2024 to March 2025, investors and the broader crypto market may witness “the real fun” of the altcoin season. This suggests that the altcoin market is expected to embark on a significant rally, with numerous small-cap cryptocurrencies experiencing varying price increases.

After showing signs of resilience, the digital asset is on an upward trajectory, with strong positive traction setting the stage for further gains. As WIF continues to gain ground, the digital asset is positioning itself for continued growth, pushing past key resistance levels. This article aims to analyze WIF’s current strength, which is propelling the asset toward higher price levels. The goal of examining the key drivers behind this surge, including market sentiment, and technical indicators, is to understand how the meme coin is positioning itself for sustained upward movement. It will also explore the potential for the asset to break through significant resistance points and set new highs while assessing the durability of the rally. WIF’s Bullish Traction: Analyzing The Path Forward WIF has demonstrated renewed positive strength after rebounding from the $2.89 support level, steadily advancing toward the $3.58 resistance level. This recovery indicates a significant shift in sentiment, with buying pressure triggering more price growth. Also, the cryptocurrency is trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, which reinforces the bullish trend and a strong foundation for further gains if WIF successfully breaks above the $3.89 resistance. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the RSI has climbed back above the 50% threshold after experiencing a decline to 40% signaling a resurgence in buying pressure, reflecting renewed bullish momentum in the market. A persistent climb would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price growth. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Set To Skyrocket 2,500%, Predicts Renowned Economist Also, the daily chart highlights WIF’s strong upward momentum, evidenced by the formation of a bullish candlestick as the price rebounds from the $2.89 level. Its position above the SMA further solidifies the positive trend, signaling consistent strength. As WIF continues its ascent, it inspires growing market confidence and paves the way for an extended price increase. Lastly, the daily chart’s RSI has recently surged to 57%, reflecting a strong wave of optimistic sentiment as it maintains a position above the critical 50% threshold. This rebound comes after a temporary dip to 51%, demonstrating the re-emergence of buyers in the market. Resistance Levels To Watch: Can WIF Break Through? As WIF continues its upward trajectory, key resistance levels will play a pivotal role in determining its next move. The immediate challenge lies near the $3.58 mark, a critical threshold that could either pave the way for additional gains or temporarily halt the rally. A successful break above this level could set WIF on course toward new highs, reinforcing its bullish trend. Related Reading: WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential However, if WIF fails to surpass the $3.89 resistance, it may face consolidation or a pullback toward the $2.89 support level. A breach below this key support could trigger a more significant decline, possibly extending toward the $2.2 level and below.

Despite briefly testing the level, BTC has yet to break through, leaving investors and analysts eagerly anticipating the next move. With demand remaining robust, the stage appears set for Bitcoin to push past this key barrier in the coming days. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume Hits $1.683B In One Hour Recent data from CryptoQuant highlights a significant factor driving this rally: the Coinbase Premium Gap, which currently sits at $224. This metric, representing the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other global exchanges, signals strong buying activity from US Coinbase investors. The relentless upward momentum has further solidified Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market, with many viewing the $100,000 level as a critical supply zone. While the price has yet to break through, the ongoing rally reflects a growing belief that Bitcoin’s parabolic bull phase is far from over. As the market approaches this pivotal moment, all eyes remain on BTC’s ability to sustain its momentum and claim new highs, setting the tone for the weeks ahead. Bitcoin Price Action Remains Strong Bitcoin has been in an “only up” phase since November 5, showing no signs of weakness as it consistently climbs to new heights. Even after failing to break above the $100,000 mark yesterday, price action remains incredibly strong. Bulls are firmly in control, and if Bitcoin holds above critical demand levels, the long-anticipated $100,000 milestone could be breached within hours. CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn revealed that robust demand from US investors is a key driving force behind this rally. According to his data, the Coinbase Premium Gap—a metric that tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other global exchanges—stands at $224. This positive premium underscores US-based buying activity as a significant factor in the current bullish momentum. A high premium often suggests that investors on Coinbase are willing to pay a higher price than others, a strong indicator of heightened demand. Related Reading: Polkadot Holds Key Demand Level – DOT Could Hit $11 In Coming Weeks As the market watches closely, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its upward trajectory hinges on staying above vital support levels. The psychological resistance at $100,000 remains formidable, but the unyielding appetite from US investors points to continued strength in the days ahead. With such solid fundamentals, many analysts believe Bitcoin is poised for another explosive rally once the $100,000 barrier is decisively cleared. BTC Rally Is Only Starting Bitcoin is trading at $98,800 after a failed breakout above the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. Despite this temporary setback, price action remains firmly bullish as BTC continues to hold above key demand levels, showing resilience and strength in the current market. The failure to retrace to lower prices indicates that bullish momentum is still intact, keeping investors optimistic about a potential breakthrough. If BTC maintains its position above the critical $95,000 support level, the likelihood of a surge past the $100,000 psychological barrier increases significantly. Holding above this level would signal strong buyer interest and the potential for further upside, paving the way for Bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Charts Signal Potential Breakout However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above $95,000, a retrace to lower demand zones would confirm a short-term correction. Such a pullback could provide the necessary fuel for the next rally, as it would allow the market to consolidate before making another attempt at breaking the $100,000 mark. For now, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s ability to defend its key support levels as the market anticipates the next major move in this historic rally.

Analyst Issues 2-Day Price Forecast,https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-ath-incoming-analyst-issues-2-day-price-forecast/,"Crypto analyst Master Kenobi has made a bold two-day prediction for the Dogecoin price, stating that it will hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the next two days. The analyst highlighted Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which he suggested is very bullish for the meme coin at the moment. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough Dogecoin Price To Reach ATH In Two Days In an X post, Master Kenobi predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach a new ATH in two days. The analyst stated that Dogecoin’s 4-hour RSI chart appears to confirm his fractal setup. Based on this, he remarked that the leg up could potentially reach $0.85 by November 25th, marking a new ATH for the foremost meme coin. Master Kenobi added that some might even identify a potential bullish divergence within the RSI chart. Such a pattern also presents a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, indicating that the meme coin is set to witness a bullish reversal to the upside. This bullish reversal is already happening, as DOGE has successfully broken above $0.4. It is worth mentioning that crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted a bullish divergence on the 4-hour RSI chart. The analyst noted that this signal indicates an uptrend continuation in the Dogecoin price movement. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach $0.7 on its next leg up. This will bring the meme coin close to its ATH of $0.73. Meanwhile, even if the Dogecoin price doesn’t hit a new ATH by November 25, another of Master Kebobi’s analyses shows that it could happen by December 2. The analyst had previously highlighted a 91-day sequence, which he said Dogecoin is about to complete and suggested would lead to a price rally to $1 by December 2. The Next Resistance Level To Watch Out For With the Dogecoin price successfully breaking above $0.4, crypto analyst Kevin Capital has provided insights into the next resistance level to watch out for. In an X post, he noted that Dogecoin is breaking out of the macro .786 Fib level. He added that the next resistance is $0.54, followed by the meme coin’s current ATH at $0.73. Crypto analyst Javon Marks also confirmed that a rally to the current ATH for the Dogecoin price was in sight. In an X post, he said Dogecoin was surging towards $0.6533 and could break out of that level once it reached the target. He added that this 52.2% price surge to $0.6533 could happen quickly and that a rally to $1.25 comes into play once that happens.

However, investors appear to be undeterred by the sluggish price action of the premier cryptocurrency in the past few days. Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Is Rising — Impact On Price In a November 23 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that traders have taken to loading their bags with Bitcoin in recent days. This on-chain observation is based on the “taker buy/sell ratio,” which tracks the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a specific cryptocurrency. A greater-than-one value of the taker buy/sell ratio suggests that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. This is usually considered a bullish signal, which suggests the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this case). Related Reading: Altcoins Continue To Surge Following Trump’s Victory – More Gains Ahead? In contrast, when the metric’s value is less than 1, it means that more sellers are willing to sell their assets at a lower price. Typically, this indicates a bearish sentiment amongst investors, as the selling pressure is overshadowing the buying pressure in the specific market. Martinez highlighted in his post on X that the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio across major trading platforms, including Binance, OKX, HTX, and Bybit, has witnessed a significant surge in the past day. As shown in the chart below, the metric spiked to a value of over 28 on Binance, the world’s largest exchange. Similarly, the Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio climbed well above the 1 threshold, showing the mounting buying pressure in the open market. This level of intense buying activity could ensure that the premier cryptocurrency continues its rally toward the $100,000 milestone. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $97,800, reflecting a 1.1% decline in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, the flagship cryptocurrency’s performance on the weekly timeframe is still impressive. According to CoinGecko data, BTC is up by nearly 8% in the past week. Who Is Buying? In another post on the X platform, Martinez revealed that a notable cohort of large investors (also known as whales) have been active in the Bitcoin market in the past few days. This class of whales involved here are those holding between 100 and 1,000 coins. According to data from Santiment, whales have purchased more than 40,000 BTC (equivalent to around $3.96 billion) in the past four days. Considering their influence on market dynamics, this buying activity from the Bitcoin whales could be bullish for price.
