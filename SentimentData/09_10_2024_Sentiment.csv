This trend was underlined by recent insights from market expert Miles Deutscher, who highlighted a presentation by memecoin analyst Murad at the TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore. Memecoins Challenge Traditional Cryptocurrencies According to Murad, only 43 tokens have surpassed Bitcoin’s performance in 2024, with 13 of those being memecoins. Notably, eight of the top ten performers in the market this year are also memecoins. Murad emphasized that this cycle is distinct from previous ones, asserting, “The memecoin cycle is not a prediction; it has already begun—memecoins are dominating by virtually every metric.” Related Reading: TON Recovery Stalls: Another Price Decline Hinders Bullish Efforts The rise of memecoins can be attributed to several factors, particularly their ability to resonate with retail investors seeking community, identity, and excitement, rather than merely potential financial gains. As Murad puts it, “Memecoins are a superior version of altcoins.” The appeal of memecoins extends beyond speculation; it is alleged that they have cultivated a culture that fosters community and “emotional connection” among investors. Murad noted that these tokens enable users to engage in a shared experience, bringing real value through stories that “create trends and spark movements”. Success stories of significant gains—such as those seen with tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepecoin (PEPE)—propagate quickly, fueling interest and excitement in the memecoin space over the past year. According to Deutscher, the most successful cryptocurrencies have developed strong communities, often resembling “cult-like followings.” Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin have thrived on this dynamic, and memecoins are fully embracing it. SPX And GIGA Capture Retail Attention Murad further explained that the recent performance of altcoins on platforms like Binance has further fueled the memecoin narrative. Almost every altcoin listed this year is trading below its listing price, with only two exceptions: WIF, a memecoin, and JUP, which facilitates memecoin trading. Murad further alleges that retail investors prioritize making money (70%), having fun (20%), and feeling a sense of belonging (10%). Murad argues that memecoins embody this speculative nature, akin to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom of 2017, but in a new form. Instead of initial coin offerings, Murad sees that memecoins are allowing early-stage investments at lower valuations, which contrasts sharply with altcoins, where most upside is captured in private markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Turns Green In October Once Again, Is The Bull Run Here? Deutscher also praised that as the memecoin phenomenon continues to grow, Murad’s insights have already influenced market dynamics, sparking one of the strongest memecoin rallies of the year. Tokens dubbed “Murad coins,” such as SPX and GIGA, have seen substantial gains, resonating with retail investors who are drawn to the excitement of potential profits. At the time of writing, the SPX is trading at $0.575, up a remarkable 35% in the 24 hour time frame, showing the impact of Murad’s participation in the TOKEN2049 in early September this year.

Following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates, many investors and traders anticipated a full-blown rally throughout October. However, it appears that the expected surge may not materialize just yet. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt has shared his insights on the current situation, emphasizing the significance of the $64,000 resistance. Breaking past this crucial level is critical for Bitcoin to regain bullish momentum and fuel a rally into Q4 2024. Bitcoin could struggle to sustain upward momentum without this breakout, leaving the market vulnerable to further downside. The next few days will be critical for Bitcoin’s price action as traders and analysts closely watch how the market responds. With Q4 underway, Bitcoin’s performance could set the tone for the broader crypto market. As investors brace for the market’s next move, the outcome of Bitcoin’s battle with the $64,000 level will likely determine whether the rally continues or stalls. Bitcoin Analyst Predicts Sub-$60K Dip After Bitcoin’s recent failed breakout attempt, the cryptocurrency is trading at a critical juncture at around $62,000. This level will likely determine whether BTC can reclaim momentum and push past local highs of $66,000 or drop further to $60,000 or even lower. Analysts and investors are growing increasingly uncertain as the bullish sentiment that dominated the past few weeks is beginning to fade. Now, fear and hesitation are creeping back into the market. Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting the precarious situation Bitcoin finds itself in. According to Runefelt, Bitcoin’s price structure has become fragile after two failed attempts to break through the key resistance level. He notes that BTC’s price dropped below important support levels after each failure, which could lead to further downsides. In his analysis, Runefelt sets a price target of $60,000, marking a 5% dip from current levels if Bitcoin cannot reclaim its previous momentum. He warns that if Bitcoin fails to hold critical support at $60,000, it could signal the beginning of a deeper correction.

Investors are watching closely, preparing for the market’s next move. BTC Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $62,421 after failing to break above the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $63,538. The price recently surged 25%, only to experience a sharp 10% dip, putting BTC at a critical juncture. Bitcoin faces serious risk in the coming weeks if it does not break past local supply levels around $66,000. The daily 200 MA has been a critical resistance level, and without reclaiming it soon, bearish momentum could take hold. If Bitcoin cannot recover and break through this level, analysts expect a deeper correction down to $57,500. This area is considered a crucial demand zone that could provide support, but a failure to hold above current levels would signal a more significant retracement.

While INJ, the native currency of the protocol, is under pressure, cooling off after rallying to as high as $52 early this year, the recent development is a huge confidence boost. Looking at trends may signal that more users are flowing to Injective, a net positive for INJ in the coming sessions. Injective Generates More Revenue Than The BNB Chain, Avalanche According to CryptoRank data, Injective Protocol generated $4 million in revenue derived from gas fees. Every transfer or smart contract deployment attracts a gas fee like every other public ledger like Bitcoin or Solana. This fee is distributed to the winning validator or miner as an incentive to operate a node. With $4 million in revenue, Injective created more than the BNB Chain, one of the largest blockchains by market cap, and Avalanche, a network in the top 20, according to CoinMarketCap. These platforms generated $3.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4 At this level, Injective also surpassed what some of the top Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Blast generated over this period. For comparison, Arbitrum, despite being the largest and managing over $13.2 billion, according to L2Beat. Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and Base churned more revenue than Injective. Ethereum funneled $159 million to its validators from July through September, while Tron and Solana cumulatively moved over $200 million. The expansion of revenue, mostly from Tron, a scalable platform, is due to the meme coin activity on its network following the launch of SunPump in August. At the same time, Solana also benefited from meme coins and an uptick in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume over this period. Will INJ Rise To $50? It remains to be seen whether the recovery of DeFi activities while boosting Injective and its total value locked (TVL). As of October 8, the protocol manages over $40 million, looking at DeFiLlama data. At the same time, the platform has processed over 1 billion onchain transactions. Related Reading: Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Panic Sell: Here’s Why It Might Be Great News For BTC In early October, Injective announced the launch of Injective 3.0. This upgrade allows the protocol to change its tokenomics and make INJ deflationary. With this activation, a portion of INJ will be removed from circulation, making it more scarce. Presently, INJ is inside a descending channel, finding support at $15. While buyers of Q1 2024 are still in the picture, the token is down 60% from March highs. A break above this descending channel could see the coin soar to 2024 highs of around $52.

Notably, a crypto analyst has forecasted that Cardano, which is currently trading below the $1 mark, is on the brink of a major breakout, with the potential to skyrocket to $5. Expert Sees Cardano Hitting $5 Soon Popular crypto analyst, Dan Gambardello took to X (formerly Twitter) on October 6 to share his bullish projections for Cardano, highlighting past bull cycles and market trends. Gambardello told his 262,900 followers that Cardano could quickly rise above $1 between now and December. Related Reading: Optimism, Aptos, And Taiko Face $169.66 Million In Token Unlocks, Should You Buy Or Sell? In a detailed video outlining the rationale behind his bullish prediction, Gambardello noted that if Cardano can follow the market trends established during the previous bull cycle, its price could easily skyrocket to $1. During the last bull market in 2021, Cardano had been among the top altcoins, experiencing significant gains that propelled its price to new all-time highs. Although it surged to an all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021, Cardano has since plummeted by 88.43% and is currently trading at $0.35. CoinMarketCap’s data also reveals that ADA’s price has fallen by 8.41% over the past week, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s bearish momentum. Despite the sluggish price growth, Gambardello has forecasted that ADA could potentially exceed all time highs to reach $5. The analyst emphasized that Cardano is even more well positioned for a bull rally than last cycle, highlighting positive signs in key metrics such as the altcoin’s Relative Index Strength (RSI) and higher low action. To be more precise, Gamberdello projects that Cardank could reach $1 before the end of 2024, and then soar to new price levels between $5 and $10. The analyst has expressed confidence in this bullish outlook, emphasizing that a $5 price increase was a realistic target. For Cardano to reach new all-time highs of $5, Gambardello has disclosed that the 50-week and 20-week Moving Average (MA) are crucial levels to watch. He stressed that ADA must first break above $0.38, and then move to $0.42 before it can experience a potential breakout to the upside. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year Bullish Forecast For Cardano Continues To Grow Sharing a similar sentiment with Gambardello, a popular crypto analyst, identified as ‘Sssebi’ on X has predicted that ADA could potentially skyrocket to $10 by 2025. The analyst notes that the cryptocurrency could experience a sharp breakout to the upside, first surging to $0.5 before hitting the coveted $1 price mark. After this, Sssebi predicts that ADA will rise to $3, surprising the broader cryptocurrency market with its massive growth. He believes that following a potential price surge to $10, investors will begin “FOMOing” hard as they recognize the immense potential of Cardano.

Analyst Dan Gambardello recently expressed a bullish prognosis, asserting that Cardano is now 10 times more robust than it was in previous cycles. The long-term prospects appear promising, however, the short-term market sentiment indicates that a cautious approach is preferable. Related Reading: Analyst Foresees 90% Cardano Price Drop in Next 6 Months Gambardello said that the move to a fully decentralized, community-owned blockchain is one of the most important changes that makes him more optimistic. This important change happened after the Chang Upgrade went live on September 1. Gambardello said that the update has strengthened Cardano’s base, making it a more stable and independent network. However, this is only one part of the story. Cardano: 10x Stronger Than Last Cycle At This Moment. 🌐 Owned By Community ❌ IOG Burned Keys ⚡ Hydra Scaling 📈 Higher Market Cap Position 🤝 Massive Partnerships 🛡️ Unmatched L1 Security 💰 DeFi Ecosystem 🐻 Survived The Bear As Top 10 — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) October 6, 2024 Cardano’s Most Recent Advancements One of the major steps that Cardano took to signify its full shift into community administration was the termination of its genesis keys. Leading this milestone adds another level of security and decentralization to the blockchain, thanks to the efforts of Input Output Global (IOG). According to Gambardello, these elements make Cardano’s network far more robust than it was in earlier cycles. Furthermore, Cardano’s Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, extends the network’s appeal. Hydra’s objective is to enhance transaction throughput while simultaneously preserving high levels of security and decentralization. This solution could provide Cardano with a competitive advantage, particularly in its pursuit of dominating the competition with other top networks such as Ethereum, as scalability is a significant obstacle for many blockchains. ADA Market Position Cardano has also experienced a substantial increase in its market position. ADA rated 12th in the crypto market and had a market cap of $2.997 billion in 2020. At the time of writing, Cardano maintains a market capitalization of $12.64 billion. Despite recent underperformance, Cardano’s resilience during the 2022 and 2023 market decline has kept it in the top 10 for an extended period. Related Reading: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast Meanwhile, with technical indicators suggesting a cautious outlook for investors, Cardano (ADA) is presently in a bearish territory in the market. By November 7, 2024, the price of Cardano is expected to climb by 16.86%, according to CoinCodex, to over $0.412024. At 49, the Fear & Greed Index says traders are neutral even at this potential upward trajectory. The price volatility of Cardano had been at 5.70% with 60% positivity, boasting 18 out of 30 days in the green in the last 30 days. Based on these factors, many analysts believe that today isn’t probably the best time to make investments in Cardano.

The price must clear the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels to start a fresh increase. XRP price is still stuck in a range above the $0.5080 support. The price is now trading near $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5340 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5360 and $0.5450 resistance levels. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Surge XRP price remained supported above the $0.5080 support level. The price started a consolidation phase above the $0.5120 level, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a minor increase within a range and the price climbed above the $0.5250 resistance. There was a move above the $0.5320 level. However, the bears are active near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5453 swing high to the $0.5211 low. The price is now trading near $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another increase, the price might face resistance near the $0.5340 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5340 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.5460 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5453 swing high to the $0.5211 low. The next key resistance could be $0.5550. A clear move above the $0.5550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6000 resistance or even $0.6050 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5360 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5200 level. The next major support is near the $0.5165 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5165 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5050 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5000 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5200 and $0.5165.

Bitcoin UTXO Supply In Loss Has Seen A Sharp Increase Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr talked about the recent trend in the Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Supply in Loss indicator. The “UTXO Supply in Loss” measures, as its name suggests, the total percentage of UTXOs in existence (or more simply, just the tokens) that are being held at some net unrealized loss. The indicator works by going through the on-chain history of each UTXO in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. Generally, the last transfer of any token represents the last point that it changed hands, so the price at its time can be assumed to be its cost basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Not Sold On Uptober As Sentiment Remains Neutral When this cost basis for any UTXO is greater than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, then that particular UTXO can be assumed to be underwater right now. The UTXO Supply in Loss adds up all UTXOs satisfying this condition to find what percentage of the total supply that they make up for. Like this metric, there also exists the UTXO Supply in Profit, which naturally keeps track of the UTXOs of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin UTXO Supply in Loss over the history of the asset: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin UTXO Supply in Loss registered a sharp plunge to the zero mark (note that the chart is reversed as it uses a negative scale) when the cryptocurrency’s price set its all-time high (ATH) back in March of this year. Whenever BTC sets a new record, 100% of the investors get into profits, so the UTXO Supply in Loss shrinking down to zero is only natural. As the coin has witnessed bearish momentum in the last few months, though, the metric’s value has gone through an increase again. The 90-day moving average (MA) of the indicator, which is also listed in the chart, has now come close to the 20% mark. The CryptoQuant author has marked in the graph the previous instances of the metric making a similar retest of this level. “In previous cycles, similar conditions were sometimes followed by a price rally,” notes Axel. Thus, it’s possible that a price surge may follow for Bitcoin this time as well. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Be Preparing For Next Big Rally, Analyst Explains As for why the UTXO Supply in Loss going up can be bullish for Bitcoin, the reason is that the investors in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling, so whenever their number reduces, the chances of a selloff also go down. BTC Price Bitcoin had shown some recovery beyond the $64,000 level yesterday, but it would appear that the asset couldn’t maintain as it’s back at $62,500 now.

ADA is consolidating above $0.3400 and might attempt a recovery wave. ADA price started a downward move below the $0.3500 support level. The price is trading below $0.3520 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3460 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.3520 resistance zone. Cardano Price Consolidates Losses After testing the $0.3680 resistance, Cardano struggled to continue higher. ADA formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.3550 and $0.3500 support levels. The price even declined below $0.3450 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $0.3409 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.3450 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3681 swing high to the $0.3409 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.3520 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.3460 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3460 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.3520 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3681 swing high to the $0.3409 low. The next key resistance might be $0.3550. If there is a close above the $0.3550 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.3680 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.400. More Downsides in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.3550 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.3420 level. The next major support is near the $0.3400 level. A downside break below the $0.3400 level could open the doors for a test of $0.3250. The next major support is near the $0.3120 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.3400 and $0.3350.
