I buy #XRP from now on. — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 12, 2025 Why The XRP Endorsement Now? And, yeah, the XRP Army did what it always does: it treated the post like a mini event. “The smartest man in the world is buying XRP,” one account, Gordon (@GordonGekko), replied — then immediately stapled the other big narrative of the day onto it: “XRP is now on Solana too. Is this the start of an XRP rally?” That second line isn’t just vibes. Solana’s official account posted “BREAKING: XRP is coming to Solana,” pointing to a wrapped-asset setup that would let XRP trade and move inside Solana DeFi rails. Hex Trust, which is positioning itself as issuer/custodian for the wrapped token (wXRP), says the product is designed to be 1:1 backed and redeemable for native XRP, using LayerZero’s OFT standard and launching “starting with Solana” (with more chains name-checked). Related Reading: Why This Market Analyst Is Warning Crypto Investors To Stop Buying XRP So Kim’s timing, intentional or not, landed right on top of a very convenient distribution channel: “XRP, but DeFi-ready.” If you’re an XRP holder who’s been watching Solana soak up memecoin liquidity and on-chain volume for the past year, that’s an easy story to forward to your group chat. The funny part is Kim’s recent persona has leaned hard into Bitcoin-maxi prophecy. In the last week alone, he made dozens of Bitcoin posts via X. On December 7, he posted: “In my personal view, Bitcoin’s current price is just a temporary discount caused by what seems to be market manipulation. I think any such manipulation may disappear within a week, and then it could start accelerating toward a new ATH.” Just a few days later, on December 10, he wrote: “My analysis suggests that Bitcoin may have set its bottom a few weeks ago, and we could now be entering a true supercycle.” One day later, he added: “”My analysis suggests that Bitcoin reaching 300K in early 2026 is a logical scenario.” Related Reading: XRP Forecast Turns Explosive As Canadian Experts Highlight Massive FinTech Utility Yesterday, Kim posted: “Bitcoin looks ready to break every prediction ever written. The real bull run begins when people think it’s already over,” before adding today: “I think Bitcoin is the money of God” and “In my view, one of the fastest ways to get rich is to stack Bitcoin.” So why the sudden XRP detour? No explanation yet, at least publicly. There’s also the reality that Kim is, politely put, controversial. Korean coverage has described him as being reported as an “IQ 276” holder tied to mind-sports organizations, but the broader profile has drawn scrutiny and debate online, with questions about verifiability and sourcing trailing the “world’s highest IQ” framing. Still, crypto doesn’t really wait for footnotes. A big claim, a big ticker, a hot comment section — and now an XRP-to-Solana headline to glue it together. That’s plenty for a one-day narrative. At press time, XRP traded at $2.04.

The project’s opening phase was a definitive success, quickly selling 10 million tokens and securing $500,000 from a committed group of over 2,400 investors . This trajectory has only steepened, with total sales now surpassing 13 million tokens and capital raised exceeding the $800,000 threshold. As Phase 2 advances past 80% completion , this non-custodial ecosystem is cementing its position as a market leader. Industry analysts are already predicting that Phase 3 will be fully subscribed in under 10 days , fueled by intensifying rumors regarding upcoming listings on major centralized exchanges. Looking Beyond Avalanche’s Slow Recovery While Avalanche (AVAX) is trading around $14.58 and making headlines with its inclusion in Bitwise’s crypto index ETF and adoption initiatives in the Middle East, its price recovery remains sluggish. Investors seeking more explosive growth are pivoting toward GeeFi , an integrated platform that experts are widely recognizing as 2026’s 100x gem . Unlike older blockchain ecosystems grappling with resistance levels, GeeFi offers a comprehensive solution for managing assets across more than 14 networks . This capability allows users to execute token swaps and bridge assets effortlessly, eliminating the fragmentation that currently complicates the DeFi experience. The GeeFi Team commenced development in 2023, adhering to a strict product-first philosophy to ensure a robust platform was ready for its 2024 debut. The architecture is built entirely around self-sovereignty, guaranteeing that users retain exclusive custody of their private keys at all times. With a fully functional Android app currently in the hands of users and an iOS version nearing release, GeeFi is proving its dedication to tangible results. This commitment to shipping code rather than just promises is a primary reason why the conviction that it is 2026’s 100x gem is spreading rapidly among smart investors. The Strategic Value of the GeeFi Presale GeeFi is currently advancing through Phase 2 of its presale, where GEE tokens are available at the strategic price point of $0.06 . This valuation offers early adopters a locked-in 667% return , calculated against the confirmed listing price of $0.40 . The scope for capital multiplication is staggering; a calculated allocation of $1,800 today could swell to $90,000 should the token reach the analysts’ projected $3 valuation , yielding a monumental 4,900% ROI . The market’s appetite for GEE is evident in the numbers. Phase 2 has already surpassed 80% , accumulating over $800K in capital through the sale of 13 million tokens . Industry observers are confident that Phase 3 will commence next week and conclude with lightning speed, driven by the mounting excitement surrounding imminent exchange listings. This overwhelming demand serves as validation for the project’s title as 2026’s 100x gem . Wealth Generation Through Staking and Referrals A primary catalyst for GeeFi’s sticky liquidity is its high-yield staking protocol, which offers impressive passive income streams. By committing their assets, investors can secure 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a dominant 55% APR for a 12-month duration . For those requiring instant access to funds, a flexible tier offers returns up to 10% with no locked liquidity . To further fuel network expansion, GeeFi has implemented a generous referral initiative. Users who share their unique invite link receive a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on all contributions made by their network. This mechanism rewards community advocacy and enables early backers to compound their positions significantly. These robust financial incentives make GeeFi a compelling vehicle for portfolio growth. Don’t Let This Opportunity Slip Away The window to acquire a position in a high-utility infrastructure project before mass adoption occurs is closing fast. The GeeFi presale represents a fleeting chance to enter before the wider market reacts. With a deflationary supply mechanics, a live application, and a roadmap featuring a crypto debit card, GeeFi is poised to dominate the sector. The velocity of token sales signals extreme market confidence. As the crypto space gears up for its next expansion phase, projects with working products and strong fundamentals will leave speculative assets behind. Ignoring GeeFi now could result in missed gains when the token debuts on major exchanges, confirming the forecast that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The moment to act is now. Securing your stake today is the optimal strategy to capture the explosive upside experts are anticipating.

The market is attempting to digest a sharp correction triggered by wider macro moves, while internal ecosystem developments offer little support. For now, ADA’s direction continues to depend on how well it can hold established support, particularly as market mood turns more cautious. NIGHT Token Crash Adds Pressure to ADA’s Decline ADA’s 2% drop to around $0.42 arrived just as the broader market reacted to the recent Federal Reserve rate cut. The decline pushed Cardano below the $0.45 level, a zone it has struggled to reclaim, placing renewed focus on its next support levels. A major driver of the negative sentiment was the steep decline of Midnight Network’s NIGHT token , which fell roughly 90% from an early surge to $1.50 before settling near $0.05. The sell-off was largely driven by airdrop recipients offloading their allocations immediately after launch. Despite earlier expectations around Midnight’s debut, the rapid reversal highlighted the speculative nature of the event. Market data also shows that 54% of active positions are leaning short, signaling that traders expect further downside. Key Support Levels Hold, but Momentum Remains Weak Cardano’s ADA is now trading near the lower edge of its established range, testing support between $0.42 and $0.43. Analysts note that this area aligns with a broader weekly support cluster that stretches toward the $0.38–$0.39 region. Technical readings reinforce a cautious outlook, the MACD continues to trend bearish, while the RSI sits near 40, approaching oversold territory. Traders are watching to see if ADA can stabilize above $0.42. A breakdown could expose the next lower supports, while a reclaim of the $0.45 zone would be required to shift momentum toward $0.48–$0.50. Despite a recent $750 million inflow to Binance, the market absorbed the volume with limited price reaction, suggesting demand remains modest. Sentiment Softens as Cardano Repeatedly Fails at $0.45 Social sentiment across major crypto forums has turned noticeably cautious. Conversations remain active, but the tone reflects trader fatigue as ADA continues to struggle against the same resistance. With no new updates from core Cardano development efforts, including Hydra scaling, Mithril upgrades , or governance milestones, market participants have shifted their focus to external forces, such as BTC’s price direction and overall risk appetite. ADA trades around $0.41–$0.42 at the time of writing, holding its range but without clear signs of a breakout. Until a fresh catalyst emerges, Cardano is likely to remain in a consolidation phase, with sentiment triggered more by broader market trends than internal progress.

As Wall Street continues to embrace cryptos with open arms, can these new ETFs push the token back to the levels we saw earlier this year? XRP Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout Above $2.20 Could Result in Big Short-Term Gains For the third time this month, XRP has bounced off the $2 level, showing that buyers are still defending this key support. This latest retest followed a move back into a former trend line support, now acting as resistance, which makes the next few moves critical. Source: TradingView If the uptrend holds, the next likely target is $2.17 , a zone where three major technical indicators line up on the 4-hour chart: the 200-period EMA, the old trend line, and a key horizontal resistance. A rejection at that level could lead to another dip back to $2, but a clean breakout may trigger a strong rally toward $2.50 , as short positions get squeezed. While large-cap tokens like XRP are starting to wake up, early-stage presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) still offer the highest upside potential. This meme-powered trader community is flying under the radar for now, but with the presale closing in, $MAXI could be one of the next explosive movers in the altcoin space. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Taps on Doge’s Virality to Build a Thriving Community By leveraging the huge popularity of the Doge viral meme, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) aims to launch a token that unites ‘degen’ traders under a single meme coin.

This transaction is reportedly fully backed by Tether’s own capital, will depend on regulatory approvals and Exor’s acceptance. In a press release dropped on Friday, Tether said that the offer is driven by a long-term commitment to the club and once finalized, Tether said it will launch a tender offer for the remaining minority shares under the same terms. Tether outlines its plan for Juventus Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, said the decision comes from both personal connection and respect for Juventus’ legacy. In Paolo’s words:- “For me, Juventus has always been part of my life. I grew up with this team. As a boy, I learned what commitment, resilience, and responsibility meant by watching Juventus face success and adversity with dignity. Those lessons stayed with me long after the final whistle.” Paolo also called Juventus “a symbol of Italian excellence with a truly global presence.” Though it continues to face scrutiny over the transparency of its reserves, Tether vowed that it is in a position of strong financial health and intends to provide Juventus with stable capital and a long investment horizon. The offer includes plans for a €1 billion investment to support and develop Juventus if the transaction is completed. Tether confirmed that the completion of the deal would depend on definitive documentation and formal regulatory clearance. Once finalized, it will move forward with the public tender offer for all remaining shares at the same price per share offered to Exor. Tether said it would provide further updates in line with applicable laws and regulations once the process moves forward. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This call, reported by The Wall Street Journal, isn’t just political rhetoric. It targets the very lever that controls economic growth, inflation, and crucially for our readers, the digital asset markets. But what does pushing for the “lowest interest rates in the world” truly mean for the economy and your crypto portfolio? What Does Trump’s Call for 1% Interest Rates Actually Mean? When a figure like Donald Trump advocates for ultra-low interest rates , he’s directly challenging the Federal Reserve’s current policy stance. The Fed sets the federal funds rate, which influences borrowing costs across the economy. Lower rates typically aim to stimulate spending and investment by making loans cheaper. However, Trump’s specific target of 1% or below is exceptionally aggressive in the current climate of persistent inflation. This stance highlights a fundamental tension: the desire for robust economic growth versus the need to maintain price stability. How Do Interest Rates Impact the Cryptocurrency Market? You might wonder, “Why should crypto investors care about traditional interest rates ?” The connection is more direct than it seems. Historically, low-interest-rate environments have been favorable for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Here’s why: Cheaper Money: Low rates reduce the yield on safe-haven assets like bonds, pushing investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. Increased Liquidity: Easy monetary policy increases the money supply, some of which can flow into digital assets. Weaker Dollar: Sustained low rates can pressure the U.S. dollar, potentially enhancing the appeal of decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin. Therefore, a world with 1% interest rates could, in theory, create a tailwind for crypto adoption and valuation. However, the Fed must balance this with controlling inflation, which erodes purchasing power and can trigger market sell-offs. The Federal Reserve’s Dilemma: Growth vs. Inflation The core challenge for policymakers is that the Fed operates independently to ensure long-term economic health. While political figures may advocate for specific interest rates , the Fed’s mandate focuses on maximum employment and stable prices. Currently, with inflation above its 2% target, the central bank’s priority has been to keep rates sufficiently high to cool the economy. A premature or politically-driven cut to 1% could risk re-igniting inflationary pressures, undoing recent progress. This independence is crucial for market credibility. What Are the Real-World Implications of Ultra-Low Rates? Imagine a sustained era of 1% interest rates . The effects would ripple through every financial sector: For Savers: Returns on savings accounts and CDs would plummet, punishing conservative investors. For Borrowers: Mortgages, car loans, and business credit would become significantly cheaper, potentially fueling a debt boom. For Assets: All asset classes, from real estate to stocks and crypto, could see inflated valuations as money searches for yield. This environment creates a “search for yield” that has historically benefited alternative investments. However, it also builds financial fragility by encouraging excessive leverage and risk-taking. Conclusion: Navigating a Potential Low-Rate Future Donald Trump’s advocacy for 1% interest rates underscores a pivotal economic crossroad. While such a policy could stimulate short-term growth and potentially benefit risk-on assets like cryptocurrency, it carries significant long-term risks for inflation and financial stability. For investors, the key takeaway is vigilance. Understanding the link between central bank policy, macroeconomics, and digital asset performance is no longer optional—it’s essential. The debate over the ideal level for interest rates is a debate about the very foundation of our financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why does Donald Trump want interest rates at 1%? A: He believes very low rates stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, potentially leading to more hiring, investment, and spending. Q: Can the President directly set interest rates? A: No. The Federal Reserve, an independent central bank, sets monetary policy. The President can influence through appointments and public pressure, but cannot mandate specific rate levels. Q: How do low interest rates affect Bitcoin and Ethereum? A> Historically, low rates reduce the appeal of yield-bearing traditional assets. This can drive capital towards alternative stores of value and high-growth potential assets like cryptocurrencies. Q: What is the main risk of keeping interest rates too low for too long? A> The primary risk is runaway inflation. If too much cheap money chases too few goods and services, prices soar, eroding savings and destabilizing the economy. Q: Are interest rates currently near 1%? A> As of the latest data, the Federal Funds rate is significantly higher than 1%, as the Fed has raised rates to combat post-pandemic inflation. Q: What should a crypto investor do if rates fall sharply? A> Monitor macro trends closely. While a low-rate environment can be favorable, it’s crucial to assess market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological adoption alongside monetary policy. Found this analysis insightful?

The altcoin has seen a comeback this month, with momentum accelerating this week after the deployment of the v2.18.0 network upgrade. The upgrade introduced stronger security, tighter Cosmos interoperability, and a reinforced link between LUNA and USTC — directly addressing the core issues behind the original chain’s collapse. Even so, popular X trader Toknex warns the rally carries “no narrative and no lasting value.” Before you FOMO into $LUNA , read this. $LUNA is pumping again but let’s be honest. This is not a comeback. This is not fundamentals. It is just community driven trading pressure. The real Terra ecosystem died in 2022. This new $LUNA has no narrative and no lasting… pic.twitter.com/OioLf2c9BO — Toknex (@Toknex_xyz) December 11, 2025 Unlike the original ecosystem, they argue the current momentum is driven almost entirely by short-term speculative trading and “community-driven trading pressure.” While the upgrade does create a foundation to rebuild the Terra ecosystem, the current market reaction has far outpaced its current fundamentals. Terra Luna Price Prediction: Is the Rally About to Reverse? The rally affirms the lower boundary of a three-year descending channel pattern, a proven launchpad throughout LUNA’s post-crash consolidation. With that confirmation, eyes are turning back to a potential breakout as the upper resistance trendline comes into view. LUNA USDT 1-week chart, descending channel pattern. Source: TradingView . Yet, momentum indicators add merit to Toknex concerns. The RSI sits at 63, yet to reach the 70 overbought threshold that often marks local tops, while the MACD strengthens its bullish posture with a widening gap above the signal line. While these could be interpreted as room to grow, their sharp and sudden spikes could commemorate a rally driven by speculation rather than a long-term positioning, opening the door to downside volatility. If long-term holders decide to take profit, a shakeout of weak hands could trigger a 70% slide back to the $0.0665 support and potentially expose lower lows. Still, the bullish case is plausible. The key breakout threshold sits at a past demand zone around the $0.357 0.382 Fib retracement. Flipping this level to support could open the door to a potential 1,000% rally toward $2. The interim $0.246 0.236 retracement remains immediate resistance, capping this week’s advance. PepeNode: A Different Way To Take Positions Those suffering Terra Luna rally FOMO now face a challenging decision: sit out and miss out on the next leg up, or enter and risk exposure to potential heavy losses. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is easing that burden with an easier way to accumulate, without needing to time the market — the pitfall of most speculative investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure your setup to start earning passive rewards that diversify across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.3 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 557% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry. With less than a month of presale left, waiting until the public release could set a higher barrier to entry.

The name of the token will be TER and it is the result of the collaboration of multiple financial institutions and fintech companies like DK Bank and Matrixdock Technology.

Bhutan has been mining Bitcoin for years by using renewable sources of energy and currently holds over 6,000 BTC tokens, worth over $500 million, as part of an ongoing effort to modernize its economy. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Hits Key Resistance – Can It Reverse Its Downtrend? The price of Solana (SOL) has reacted positively to the news and has jumped 5.4% in the past 24 hours to $138.4. Source: TradingView SOL is hitting a key resistance that matches the upper bound of its latest descending price channel. The token has been consolidating for a few days, trading between $130 and $145 as the market struggles to find direction. Now that the Fed has cut interest rates for a third time , it is up to the market to determine if conditions are sufficient to support a move higher for SOL. If Solana breaks above the $150 level, it could trigger a full trend reversal, setting the stage for a potential rally back to $200. On the flip side, a drop below $130 would open the door to a deeper correction, though for now, that outcome looks less likely as momentum continues to build. While Solana eyes its next move, a far bigger opportunity is emerging on Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one of the best crypto presales right now, bringing Solana’s speed and low fees to Bitcoin, turning it into a true high-performance chain. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Brings Solana’s High Speed and Low Costs to the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is giving Bitcoin the upgrade it needs, combining the power of Solana’s technology with the security of the Bitcoin network. Built using Solana’s SVM , Bitcoin Hyper brings lightning-fast speed and ultra-low fees to Bitcoin, unlocking real utility like staking, yield generation, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

Despite this gain, SHIB remains down by 1% in a week, 14% in a month, and by 71% in the past year, not to mention by 90% since its 2021 all-time high of $0.00008616. These declines come as the Shiba Inu community warns of scammers impersonating developers and admins, and sending fake bug warnings in order to steal tokens. However, such scams have long been a part of the crypto ecosystem, and they shouldn’t have an impact on the Shiba Inu price prediction, which now looks very positive after a period of overselling. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Community Hit With Major Scam Warning – Is This a Sign of What’s Coming in 2026? Posting on X, the Susbarium account – which watches out for scams and security threats – warned that it has detected scammers operating on Discord and Telegram, where they would send direct messages to potential victims. The aim would be to coax targets into clicking on malicious links, where they would potentially enter wallet info, which the criminals would then use to steal crypto. SHIBARMY SAFETY ALERT Scammers are impersonating Tech Leads, Mods, and Admins in Discord & Telegram, sending fake “wallet bug” warnings to trick you into connecting to malicious sites. DO NOT ENGAGE.

If you need help: Use… pic.twitter.com/kHLRpKgucz — Susbarium | Shibarium Trustwatch (@susbarium) December 10, 2025 The same Susbarium account also warned in November of similar scammers operating on X , again impersonating admins and tech leads in order to trick people into thinking that they needed to take action to rectify wallet bugs. While this may point to an alarming trend, scams are sadly a regular feature of the crypto landscape, and data from Chainalysis suggests that scams are growing across the board, affecting not only Shiba Inu. And if we look at the Shiba Inu price chart today, we see that it could be at the beginning of a big corrective upswing. For instance, its MACD (orange, blue) has been in negative territory since late September, but is now rising towards 0 and should turn positive very soon. Source: TradingView This could spark a breakout, something which the descending pennant above also suggests. Because the Shiba Inu price has been trading within an increasingly narrow range, it’s nearing a point where it may have to make a big move, presumably upwards. The market’s general mood has improved this week, if only because the Federal Reserve cut rates on Wednesday and also signalled that 2026 will bring at least one other cut. Assuming a gradual increase in sentiment, the Shiba Inu price could return to $0.000010 by the end of the year, before reaching $0.000030 by Q2 2026. Layer-Two Network Bitcoin Hyper Raises $29.3 Million in Presale: Could It 100x in 2026? If some traders are unconvinced that the Shiba Inu price will ever get near its record high again, they may want to find alternatives. There’s currently no shortage of new tokens and projects appearing on the market, but one of the most promising is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new layer-two network for Bitcoin . When the walls come down, Hyper keeps coding. $BTC needs builders, not barriers. https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/owNj50QTQc — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) December 7, 2025 It’s currently holding its presale, which has now raised a total of $29.3 million from eager investors, who are betting that Bitcoin Hyper will be one of next year’s biggest new coins and platforms. What sets Bitcoin Hyper apart from 99% of other new tokens and presale coins is that its fundamentals are hugely promising. By developing and launching an L2 for Bitcoin, it could attract massive adoption and usage, especially from Bitcoin holders looking to put their BTC to work in a DeFi context. Bitcoin Hyper aims to grow a thriving ecosystem of DeFi apps and protocols, which investors will be able to use to lend, borrow, and trade with bridged Bitcoin. On a technical level, it will make use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge proofs, providing a level of scalability, security, and privacy that few L2s can match. Given that Bitcoin does not yet have a fully fledged L2, it could witness significant uptake, which could lead to strong demand for the native token HYPER. And investors can buy HYPER early by going to the coin’s official website , where it’s available at $0.013415. This price will rise in just under two days, while the success of its sale would indicate that it will rise much higher once it lists.

Rather than liquidating positions, the majority are aggressively withdrawing coins from the exchange, leading the Bitcoin price prediction to signal a potential breakout above $100,000. Bitcoin Deposits Hit 8-Year Low, Creating Supply Shock According to charts from CryptoOnchain , the 30-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA-30) of Exchange Withdrawal Transactions on Binance experienced a substantial spike, reaching 3,100 daily transactions on December 3rd. Historic Divergence on Binance: Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation at $91K “Existing supply is being removed from the order books, and new selling pressure is virtually non-existent. This behavior indicates extreme conviction among investors.” – By @CryptoOnchain pic.twitter.com/QPOQzmcfSj — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 12, 2025 “This marks the highest level of withdrawal activity observed since May 2018,” the analyst noted. The metric indicates a growing number of investors are transferring assets to cold storage, demonstrating a long-term holding strategy, rather than short-term trading speculation. Even more remarkable is the sell-side behavior. While withdrawals surge, the 30-day moving average of depositing transactions to Binance has fallen to its lowest level since 2017 , dropping to approximately 320 transactions. The massive divergence, where withdrawals hit a 7-year peak while deposits reach an 8-year low, creates a textbook “Supply Shock” scenario. “This behavior indicates extreme conviction among investors who believe the price discovery phase is far from over,” CryptoOnchain concluded. Technical Structure Shows Range-Bound Consolidation Bitcoin continues trading within a broad one-year range, with recent weekly candles positioning the price near the range low around $80,000-$81,000. The chart identifies substantial resistance between $117,000 and $122,000, but the market must first reclaim the mid-range level near $109,000, an area that has consistently capped rallies since mid-2025. Only a decisive weekly close above $109,000 would reopen pathways toward a larger bullish structure. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, weekly moving averages are beginning to flatten, and price currently trades beneath the 20-week and 50-week MAs , indicating momentum remains subdued. If Bitcoin loses the $80,000 support, the chart reveals a wide demand zone between $62,000 and $71,000 as the next significant area where buyers may establish a bottom. Until then, price will likely range sideways with a slight bearish tendency unless bulls recover $109,000 and reverse momentum in their favor. Pepenode Raised Over $2.3M To Position for Meme Coin Mania If Bitcoin finally breaks through $109,000 and starts climbing again, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could experience another explosive rally. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite challenging market conditions. It’s a game where you can “mine” coins without needing expensive computer equipment. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining nodes, and upgrade your facilities to earn $PEPENODE tokens . The project is replicating PEPE’s success strategy, which surged over 1,000x during Bitcoin’s rally from $27,000 to over $64,000 during the 2023-24 run. As more people start purchasing Pepenode’s mining rigs, the token price is expected to rise rapidly. To join the presale before the price increases, visit the official Pepenode website and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet .

According to a Wall Street Journal report, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett are top contenders. For cryptocurrency investors, this isn’t just political news—it’s a potential pivot point for the monetary policy that shapes our digital asset landscape. Who Are the Candidates for the Next Fed Chair? The race for the next Fed chair features two prominent figures with distinct backgrounds. Kevin Warsh served as a Fed Governor from 2006 to 2011, gaining firsthand experience during the global financial crisis. He is often viewed as a critic of the Fed’s post-crisis quantitative easing policies. Conversely, Kevin Hassett, currently the chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, is a respected economist known for his work on tax policy and market analysis. Their differing philosophies present a stark choice for the future of U.S. monetary policy. Why Does the Next Fed Chair Matter for Crypto? The Federal Reserve controls the levers of the U.S. dollar, influencing interest rates and money supply. Therefore, the appointment of the next Fed chair is a monumental event for all markets, especially cryptocurrencies. Here’s why crypto traders are watching closely: Interest Rate Policy: A hawkish chair (favoring higher rates to fight inflation) could strengthen the dollar, potentially applying downward pressure on crypto prices. Regulatory Stance: The Fed’s view on digital currencies and stablecoins will shape the regulatory environment for years. Market Sentiment: The appointment signals the administration’s broader economic priorities, affecting investor confidence and risk appetite. Historically, periods of loose monetary policy (low rates, money printing) have correlated with strong crypto bull markets. The new chair’s approach will define the next chapter. What Challenges Will the Next Fed Chair Face? Whoever becomes the next Fed chair will inherit a complex economic puzzle. The post-pandemic world presents unique challenges that directly intersect with the crypto economy. The new leader must navigate persistent inflation concerns, a potential economic slowdown, and a massive federal debt. Moreover, they will need to formulate a stance on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a development that could compete with or legitimize the existing crypto ecosystem. Their decisions will ripple through every asset class. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors While the political process unfolds, savvy investors can prepare. First, monitor the Senate confirmation hearings for clues on the nominee’s philosophy. Second, pay attention to statements regarding inflation and digital currency innovation. Finally, consider how your portfolio is positioned for different monetary policy scenarios. A shift towards tighter policy may favor different assets than an era of continued liquidity. Staying informed about the next Fed chair selection is not just about politics—it’s a fundamental part of risk management in the crypto space. The Bottom Line: A Decision with Lasting Impact The selection of the next Fed chair is more than a personnel change; it’s a signal that will define monetary policy for a critical period. For the cryptocurrency community, understanding the leanings of Kevin Warsh versus Kevin Hassett is essential. Their approach to interest rates, balance sheet management, and financial innovation will create the macroeconomic backdrop for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the entire digital asset class. As President Trump moves closer to his decision, the entire market holds its breath for a choice that will resonate from Wall Street to the blockchain. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is currently the most likely candidate for the next Fed chair? As of the WSJ report, Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett are the leading contenders, though the President’s final decision is pending. How quickly could a new Fed chair be appointed? President Trump stated he would nominate a candidate early next year. The nominee must then be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, a process that can take several months. What is the main difference between Warsh and Hassett’s economic views? Warsh is generally seen as more hawkish, critical of expansive Fed balance sheets. Hassett’s public focus has been more on tax policy and growth, making his precise monetary policy stance less defined. Why should a cryptocurrency investor care about the Fed chair? The Fed controls the U.S. money supply and interest rates, which are primary drivers of global liquidity and investor risk appetite—two factors that profoundly influence cryptocurrency valuations. Could this decision impact Bitcoin’s price directly? Not directly, but indirectly and powerfully. The Fed’s policies affect the dollar’s strength and the flow of capital into risk assets like tech stocks and crypto, creating a strong correlative environment. Has a Fed chair ever made public statements about Bitcoin? Yes, past chairs like Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell have commented on cryptocurrencies, typically highlighting volatility and regulatory concerns, setting a tone for institutional engagement.

Analyst Weighs In",https://timestabloid.com/can-3500-xrp-make-millionaires-by-2026-analyst-weighs-in/,"Growing concerns over sensational predictions in the XRP community have resurfaced after industry analyst Vincent Scott criticized a recurring trend of exaggerated forecasts circulating on social media. Scott expressed frustration over claims suggesting that holding a modest amount of XRP, specifically 3,500 tokens, could allegedly turn investors into millionaires within a very short period. In a recent post , he addressed what he described as an increasing pattern in which influencers present highly ambitious price targets without evidence, primarily to boost online attention. According to Scott, these statements gain rapid traction because they appeal to investors seeking quick, transformative gains, even when the claims have no credible foundation. Influencers Benefit From Viral XRP Claims Scott explained that predictions of this nature typically flourish because they are crafted to generate high engagement. He noted that if he were to release a similar claim, even without supporting data, it would likely attract a significant number of likes, new followers, and paid subscribers. “You need 3500 XRP by February 2, 2026 to be a millionaire” I bet if I said this? i would get a million likes, 350k followers, 10k subscribers, and never be held accountable for it Thats how fucking stupid people are — VincentScott (@VincentSco72192) December 8, 2025 He stressed that these outcomes would come at virtually no cost to the person making the claim, especially since failed predictions rarely result in accountability. He pointed out that the ease with which such content spreads reflects a broader issue: audiences often share or endorse impressive-sounding price targets without assessing their feasibility. As a result, many individuals promoting these narratives continue to grow their online presence while offering little substance behind their statements. Scott contrasted this approach with more measured commentary, noting that analysts who prioritize accuracy and transparency tend to experience slower audience growth, even though their assessments are more grounded. Pattern of Exaggerated XRP Forecasts Scott’s remarks are part of a larger conversation around increasingly unrealistic XRP projections. Numerous high-profile commentators have previously suggested that XRP could generate substantial wealth within extremely short timelines. Earlier this year, for example, a known Bitcoin advocate claimed that early XRP holders would soon obtain generational wealth significant enough to support entire families. Despite the scale of the projection, many followers accepted it without raising questions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other predictions have already been disproven. In September, an XRP-focused analyst asserted that a wave of new millionaires would emerge immediately after the approval of multiple spot XRP ETFs. However, after the ETFs became available in November , the token’s price declined from $2.52 to $1.80 before later stabilizing above $2. These outcomes contradict the idea that ETF approval alone would result in sudden, extraordinary profits for retail investors. The projection highlighted by Scott suggests that owning 3,500 XRP would be sufficient to reach millionaire status by February 2, 2026. For this to occur, XRP would need to trade near $286, representing an increase of more than 14,000% from its current value of around $2. Scott did not dismiss the possibility of long-term XRP appreciation, but he emphasized that achieving such a price level within a matter of weeks is not realistic. He argued that the projection lacks analytical support and fails to consider broader market conditions, including liquidity, regulatory developments, and historical growth patterns. Scott’s critique underscores the importance of responsible communication in the digital asset space. He urged investors to assess claims critically and rely on data-driven analysis rather than predictions designed to attract attention. While optimistic scenarios are not inherently invalid, Scott argued that they should be conveyed with appropriate context and grounded expectations. His comments add to a growing push within the industry to differentiate between informed analysis and viral claims.

This week’s rate cut from the Federal Reserve has improved sentiment to some degree, with Bitcoin (2%), Ethereum (1.5%), XRP (1.7%), and Solana (5.5%) all up today. It appears as though the conditions for an end-of-year rally are falling into place, as coins regain some momentum after a long period of overselling. And it’s in this context that we’ve picked new ERC-20 token PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) as the next meme coin to turn $100 into $10,000, with its launch fast approaching. Next Meme Coin to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 12 December PEPENODE is currently holding its presale, which has so far raised an impressive $2.3 million from profit-hungry investors. Its sale has actually entered its final stretch, and is due to end in 27 days, at which point the coin will list, and sale participants will receive their tokens. What has carried its emerging popularity so far is its unique approach to mining, with PEPENODE providing investors with the opportunity to mine meme coins without needing to invest in expensive hardware. Rather than having to run some kind of physical mining facility, PEPENODE users will be able to build and operate virtual mining rigs, which can earn them rewards in external tokens such as Pepe and Fartcoin. What’s interesting here is that, by spending PEPENODE tokens on buying more nodes, users can earn greater rewards. In fact, they can also upgrade and combine nodes to increase their yields, something which adds a gamification element that should improve engagement. Users also have the option of selling off nodes when they no longer require them, giving them a chance to make back their costs, on top of their mining yields. If that weren’t enough, PEPENODE holders can also stake the token for a passive income , which at the moment stands at 557% APY. How to Buy PEPENODE Before Its Sale Ends: Best Prospect for Q1 2026? This all makes PEPENODE one of the most lucrative new tokens in the market, and it explains why its presale has succeeded in attracting so much investment. And while there isn’t much time left before the sale ends, latecomers can join by going to the official website and connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet). From there, they can use ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to buy however much PEPENODE they want, with the token selling at its final presale price of $0.001192. Even the pickaxe is festive. This season the best present is a levelled up virtual mining rig. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/BRg3lVom3u — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 11, 2025 It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, and investors will be able to claim their bought tokens once the sale closes. Given the project’s fundamentals and tokenomics, and given that the market appears to be turning a corner, its launch could be big. This is why it’s our next meme coin to turn $100 into $10,000, since it has lots of potential.

All five companies are responsible for issuing stablecoins. However, Fidelity is yet to issue its own stablecoin, still allegedly said to be testing in anticipation of a launch earlier this year. Which firms have an OCC national trust bank license? According to an official release, the conditional approval of the five national trust bank charter applications is subject to meeting the OCC’s conditions, after which all five institutions will join approximately 60 other national trust banks currently supervised by the OCC. The OCC claims to have applied the same rigorous review and standards it applies to all charter applications before deciding to grant the conditional approvals. It also meticulously reviewed each application, based on its individual merits, consistent with applicable statutory and regulatory factors. “New entrants into the federal banking sector are good for consumers, the banking industry and the economy,” said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. “They provide access to new products, services and sources of credit to consumers, and ensure a dynamic, competitive and diverse banking system.” Gould says the OCC will continue to chart a path for both traditional and innovative approaches to financial services to ensure the federal banking system is able to keep up with the evolution of finance and support a modern economy. Among the five firms involved, the OCC conditionally approved applications for new national banking charters for USDC issuer Circle’s First National Digital Currency Bank and Ripple National Trust Bank. The other three, namely BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos Trust Company, already had state charters but received conditional approval for conversions to a national trust bank. The national trust bank charters will enable the above-mentioned firms to carry out a variety of tasks, including custody digital assets, issue stablecoins, and related services under federal regulation, without full commercial banking powers (like lending deposits). The green light from the OCC is a significant achievement for the banks involved, as the federal banking system, which includes more than 1,000 national banks operating in the United States, conducts approximately 67% of the banking activity in the United States and holds more than $17 trillion in assets combined with more than $85 trillion under their control. Other crypto applicants waiting with pending applications for such an approval from the OCC include Coinbase, Crypto.com’s Foris DAX National Trust Bank, Stripe’s stablecoin orchestration affiliate Bridge, Brazil neobank Nubank, and Sony’s Connectia. Protego’s National Digital Trust Company is also among those ranks. The company initially got a conditional approval in 2021, but the decision was suspended after Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown sent a letter to the OCC demanding a reassessment. OCC approval divides opinions The overall response to the approvals has been mostly positive from the crypto industry, with the likes of Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse calling it “huge news” and a “massive step forward” for RLUSD stablecoin compliance, while criticizing banking lobby opposition as “anti-competitive.” BitGo CEO Mike Belshe has declared that it “marks an official end to the war on crypto and the beginning of the next era of innovation in banking” while Circle emphasized it enhances safety for USDC reserves and institutional custody. Speaking about the development, Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, said it will enable customers to innovate, incubate and grow digital asset businesses safely and seamlessly within the US. Observers and analysts have been describing it as a significant milestone for crypto companies, signaling maturity, nationwide operational authority, and reduced institutional friction for digital asset custody and settlement. However, it has not been all positive comments. Greg Baer, BPI President and CEO, responded to the decision with a less enthusiastic statement, which claimed that the decision leaves “substantial unanswered questions.” “Chiefly, whether the requirements the OCC has outlined for the applicants are appropriately tailored to the activities and risks in which the trust will engage,” Baer said . “We hope the OCC will share more details about these applications so the public can better understand the rationale behind today’s decision.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|OCC,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-12 23:49:04

The leading cryptocurrency exchange just made a significant move that could unlock new possibilities for traders. Coinbase announced the addition of LIGHTER to its listing roadmap, creating immediate buzz across crypto communities. This development signals the exchange’s continued commitment to expanding its digital asset offerings and providing users with access to emerging projects. What Does the Coinbase Listing Roadmap Actually Mean? First, let’s clarify what a Coinbase listing roadmap represents. Unlike immediate listings, the roadmap serves as a public announcement of assets under consideration. It provides transparency about which cryptocurrencies Coinbase is evaluating for potential future trading. When a project appears on this roadmap, it indicates serious interest from one of the world’s largest exchanges. However, it doesn’t guarantee immediate listing. The exchange conducts thorough due diligence before making final decisions. The inclusion of LIGHTER on the Coinbase listing roadmap follows specific evaluation criteria. The exchange typically considers factors like: Security and compliance standards Project technology and innovation Community adoption and developer activity Legal and regulatory considerations Why Should You Care About This Roadmap Addition? You might wonder why this particular addition matters to your crypto strategy. The Coinbase listing roadmap serves as an early indicator of potential market movements. Historically, assets appearing on this roadmap often experience increased attention and trading volume. This happens because the roadmap signals institutional interest and potential mainstream accessibility. For LIGHTER specifically, this development represents a crucial validation milestone. Being considered by Coinbase suggests the project meets certain quality thresholds that many other cryptocurrencies don’t achieve. However, remember that roadmap inclusion differs from guaranteed listing. The exchange might still decide against adding LIGHTER to its trading platforms after further review. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The Coinbase listing roadmap influences more than just individual projects. Each addition reflects broader trends in the cryptocurrency industry. When exchanges like Coinbase show interest in specific types of assets, it often indicates where institutional attention is heading. This particular addition suggests continued interest in innovative blockchain applications beyond the major established cryptocurrencies. Market observers typically watch the Coinbase listing roadmap for several reasons: It signals exchange expansion strategies It highlights emerging sector trends It provides early investment indicators It demonstrates regulatory compliance progress What Are the Practical Implications for Traders? If you’re actively trading cryptocurrencies, understanding the Coinbase listing roadmap can provide valuable insights. The roadmap often precedes actual listings by weeks or months, giving attentive traders time to research and prepare. For LIGHTER specifically, this announcement means increased visibility and potential liquidity if the project eventually lists. However, approach this information with balanced perspective. While the Coinbase listing roadmap indicates serious consideration, not all roadmap assets receive final approval. The exchange maintains rigorous standards throughout its evaluation process. Therefore, use this information as one factor in your research, not as sole investment guidance. Looking Ahead: What Comes Next for LIGHTER? Following this Coinbase listing roadmap announcement, the LIGHTER project will likely undergo increased scrutiny from both the exchange and the broader crypto community. The development team must maintain transparency and continue building their platform to meet exchange requirements. Meanwhile, traders and investors should monitor official announcements from both Coinbase and the LIGHTER project for updates. The journey from roadmap to actual listing involves multiple steps. Coinbase typically announces specific listing dates only after completing all necessary technical integrations and compliance checks. This process ensures smooth trading experiences for users while maintaining the exchange’s security standards. In summary, the addition of LIGHTER to the Coinbase listing roadmap represents an exciting development in cryptocurrency accessibility. It demonstrates the exchange’s ongoing efforts to expand its offerings while providing early signals about emerging projects worth watching. As always in crypto markets, thorough research and balanced perspective remain essential for making informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Coinbase listing roadmap? The Coinbase listing roadmap is a public list of digital assets that the exchange is considering for potential future trading. It provides transparency about projects under evaluation but doesn’t guarantee eventual listing. Does appearing on the roadmap mean immediate listing? No, roadmap inclusion indicates consideration only. Coinbase conducts thorough due diligence before making final listing decisions, which may take weeks or months. How should investors react to roadmap announcements? Investors should view roadmap announcements as research opportunities rather than immediate trading signals. Conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions. What happens if Coinbase decides not to list LIGHTER? If Coinbase decides against listing LIGHTER after roadmap inclusion, the project will be removed from consideration. This doesn’t necessarily reflect on the project’s quality, as listing decisions involve multiple factors. Can other exchanges be influenced by Coinbase’s roadmap? Yes, other exchanges often monitor Coinbase’s roadmap for market signals. However, each exchange makes independent listing decisions based on their own criteria. Where can I track updates about this potential listing? Monitor official Coinbase announcements through their blog and social media channels, along with official LIGHTER project communications for the most accurate information.

55709905,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244409,1765584012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Defiant DeFi Industry Rejects Citadel’s Push for Stricter Tokenized Securities Rules,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-refutes-citadel-tokenized-securities-rules/,"BitcoinWorld Defiant DeFi Industry Rejects Citadel’s Push for Stricter Tokenized Securities Rules A major clash is unfolding in the world of finance. The decentralized finance (DeFi) industry is defiantly pushing back against a powerful Wall Street player. Citadel Securities, a giant market maker, wants stricter rules for tokenized securities . However, key DeFi advocates argue this would stifle crucial innovation. This regulatory showdown could shape the future of digital assets. Why is Citadel Calling for Stricter Tokenized Securities Rules? Citadel Securities sent a formal letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Their core argument focuses on the nature of DeFi platforms. Citadel claims that while many projects claim to be “decentralized,” they often have identifiable intermediaries. These can include core developers or governance groups that control protocol updates. Therefore, Citadel opposes any regulatory exemptions for platforms offering tokenized securities , like tokenized stocks or bonds. They believe a consistent regulatory framework is necessary for investor protection and market integrity. How is the DeFi Industry Fighting Back? In a powerful rebuttal, a coalition of major industry voices has responded. The group includes the DeFi Education Fund, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the Chamber of Digital Commerce, and the Uniswap Foundation. Their counter-argument to the SEC is fundamentally different. They state that autonomous software itself cannot be considered an “intermediary” under existing legal definitions. In true DeFi protocols, they argue, traders always maintain direct control of their assets through self-custody wallets. The code merely executes pre-programmed functions without human discretion. This distinction is at the heart of the debate over tokenized securities regulation. What’s the Real Stakes in This Debate? This isn’t just a theoretical legal argument. The outcome has real-world consequences for the evolution of finance. Here are the core issues at play: Innovation vs. Protection: Stricter rules could slow DeFi development but might offer clearer investor safeguards. Definition of Control: The fight centers on whether software code or human actors are in control of tokenized securities transactions. Market Access: Regulation will determine how easily traditional assets like stocks can be represented and traded on blockchain networks. The DeFi coalition warns that applying old rules to new technology could cripple a promising financial frontier before it matures. What Does This Mean for the Future of DeFi? This confrontation highlights a critical growing pain for the crypto industry. As tokenized securities gain traction, regulatory clarity becomes essential. However, the path to that clarity is fraught with disagreement. The DeFi industry’s defiant stance shows its growing confidence and political organization. They are no longer just technologists but engaged policy advocates. The SEC’s response to these conflicting letters will be closely watched. It will signal whether U.S. regulators lean toward Wall Street’s caution or the crypto industry’s plea for a tailored, innovation-friendly approach. In conclusion, the battle lines are drawn. On one side, traditional finance giants like Citadel seek to bring tokenized securities under familiar, strict oversight. On the other, the DeFi industry defiantly champions a new regulatory paradigm fit for autonomous technology. This clash is not just about rules; it’s about who gets to define the next generation of global markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are tokenized securities? Tokenized securities are traditional financial assets, like stocks or bonds, that are represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. They aim to make these assets easier to trade and settle. What is Citadel Securities’ main concern? Citadel is concerned that DeFi platforms offering tokenized securities might not be as decentralized as claimed. They argue that identifiable intermediaries exist and should be regulated to protect investors. What is the DeFi industry’s key argument against stricter rules? The industry argues that truly decentralized protocols are just autonomous software. Since users maintain control of their assets via self-custody, the software itself shouldn’t be classified as a regulated financial intermediary. Who are the groups defending DeFi in this case? Major groups include the DeFi Education Fund, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the Chamber of Digital Commerce, and the Uniswap Foundation. Why does this regulatory debate matter? The outcome will set a precedent for how decentralized finance is governed. It will determine if innovation is prioritized or if traditional regulatory models are forcefully applied, potentially stifling new technology. What happens next? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will review the arguments from both sides. Their future rulemaking or enforcement actions regarding tokenized securities will be guided by this debate. Did you find this breakdown of the DeFi vs. Citadel clash helpful?

The development centers on Hex Trust’s introduction of a wrapped version of XRP designed to enable the asset to function on multiple blockchains and increase its utility within DeFi applications. The announcement comes at a time when interest in expanding XRP’s reach beyond the XRP Ledger continues to grow. By allowing the asset to operate in environments where it was not previously accessible, the initiative signals a significant step toward integrating XRP with established multi-chain DeFi infrastructures. More XRP ecosystems is a good thing. Letting XRP operate in more environments builds utility, and the XRPL remains the anchor that makes it all work. https://t.co/szCfaj3KcL — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 12, 2025 Hex Trust Introduces Wrapped XRP With Cross-Chain Capabilities Hex Trust confirmed the release of wrapped XRP (wXRP), explaining that the product is structured as a fully collateralized token backed one-to-one with native XRP held in its custody. According to the firm, users can deposit their XRP into its platform and mint an equivalent amount of wXRP, ensuring consistent backing and clear traceability of reserves. The firm also noted that wXRP will initially be available on Ethereum, with support for additional chains such as Solana, Optimism, and HyperEVM. By expanding to these networks, the wrapped asset enables trading pairs, lending options, and other DeFi services that were previously unavailable to XRP holders. Hex Trust stated that the asset will allow direct trading between wXRP and RLUSD, further integrating XRP into broader liquidity markets. As part of its rollout, Hex Trust confirmed that wXRP is launching with more than $100 million in total value locked, providing substantial liquidity from the beginning and helping stabilize market activity. The company is using LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard to facilitate movement of wXRP across supported blockchains. This approach allows cross-chain transfers without depending on unregulated bridge technologies, which have historically presented security risks for digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple Executives Welcome the Development The introduction of wXRP received a direct response from Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz, who described the effort as a positive addition to the XRP ecosystem. He noted that enabling XRP to function across more blockchain environments increases the asset’s long-term relevance and enhances the flexibility available to users. Ripple CTO Schwartz emphasized that while XRP will continue to rely on the XRP Ledger as its core infrastructure, expanding its reach through wrapped representations offers meaningful benefits. RippleX Senior Vice President Markus Infanger also commented on the announcement, highlighting the growing interest among users seeking access to XRP-based DeFi activity. He stated that Hex Trust’s initiative provides regulated, transparent entry points into the DeFi market and reflects broader industry demand for interoperable digital assets. Expanded Opportunities for XRP Holders in DeFi The introduction of wXRP adds to a steady wave of developments aimed at increasing XRP’s participation in decentralized finance. Although the XRP Ledger was not originally designed with native DeFi support, various projects have worked to integrate it into multi-chain ecosystems. Platforms such as Flare and Axelar already enable holders to use XRP in yield-generating activities across several networks. Hex Trust’s wrapped asset follows a similar approach by offering a secure pathway for XRP holders to engage with DeFi tools outside the XRP Ledger. At the same time, other initiatives are exploring additional methods to broaden XRP’s presence. In recent months, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson signaled interest in pursuing conversations aimed at expanding yield and utility options for XRP users. Collectively, these developments indicate accelerating efforts to increase XRP’s interoperability across blockchain environments. The launch of wXRP marks a significant milestone in that direction, providing regulated access to cross-chain DeFi and strengthening the asset’s broader ecosystem.

55711220,644367,1765584053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55711220.jpeg,SEC Chair Touts Crypto-Led Shift To On-Chain Finance,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-chair-crypto-on-chain-finance/,"SEC Chair Paul Atkins is leaning into a message that would’ve sounded borderline heretical in Washington not that long ago: the rails are changing, and crypto-native infrastructure is going to be part of it. “As I told @MariaBartiromo last week, US financial markets are poised to move on-chain,” Atkins wrote on X late Thursday, adding that the SEC is “prioritizing innovation and embracing new technologies to enable this on-chain future, while continuing to protect investors.” Crypto Will Put The Future Of Finance On-Chain Atkins didn’t leave it at vibes . Earlier in the day, Atkins pointed to a staff no-action letter out of the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets tied to the Depository Trust Company’s (DTC) voluntary tokenization effort — a pilot that effectively gives the plumbing of US securities settlement a carve-out to experiment without immediately tripping over parts of the Exchange Act rulebook. “Today, the Division of Trading and Markets issued a no-action letter to the Depository Trust Company (DTC) regarding DTC’s voluntary securities tokenization pilot program. DTC’s initiative marks an important step towards on-chain capital markets,” Atkins shared via X. The letter dated Dec. 11 describes a “pilot version” of what it calls DTCC Tokenization Services — a preliminary, time-limited program that lets DTC participants elect to have certain security entitlements recorded using distributed ledger tech instead of relying solely on DTC’s centralized ledger. In plain English: eligible participants can tokenize positions, hold them in registered wallets on approved blockchains, and transfer those tokenized entitlements directly to another participant’s registered wallet — with DTC’s official records still serving as the system of record for what’s real. Atkins added: “On-chain markets will bring greater predictability, transparency, and efficiency for investors. DTC’s participants will now be allowed to transfer tokenized securities directly to the registered wallets of other participants, which will be tracked by DTC’s official records.I’m excited to see the benefits of this program to our financial markets and will continue to encourage market participants to innovate as we move towards on-chain settlement.” Notably, the no-action relief itself is narrowly scoped: it’s centered on how the pilot interacts with Reg SCI, Section 19(b)/Rule 19b-4, and certain clearing-agency standards — and it’s structured to sunset three years after launch of the preliminary version, with DTC required to notify staff when that launch happens. So this isn’t “tokenized stocks for everyone next week.” It’s closer to a supervised sandbox with reporting hooks. Notably, Atkins is already pitching what comes next. “But this is just the beginning,” he wrote, saying he wants the SEC to consider an “innovation exemption” that would let market participants begin transitioning on-chain “without being burdened by cumbersome regulatory requirements.” That line is doing a lot of work, and it’s also where the fight (or at least the lobbying) is likely to concentrate. What qualifies as “innovation”? Who gets exempted, and from which obligations? And what’s the gating factor — investor protection, market integrity, operational resilience, or just politics? Crypto watchers noticed the tone shift immediately. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju summed it up in one sentence: “SEC Chairman: The future of finance is on-chain.” For now, the tangible takeaway is the DTC pilot: a regulated core market utility experimenting with tokenized representations under staff comfort. The rest — the “on-chain future” language, and the exemption talk — is the part that could either become a framework or just another ambitious headline that runs into the realities of US market structure.

The bank created the on-chain token representing the bond and handled primary settlement, positioning the project as a practical test of how public networks could support regulated financial transactions. The move shows Solana’s growing role in real-world asset tokenization, a sector projected by industry analysts to reach trillions of dollars over the next decade. For Solana, the deal is also a strategic validation. While the chain is widely known for retail and developer activity, institutional adoption has historically been slower to materialize. Seeing a large financial institution test a foundational market instrument on Solana offers a clearer path to deeper enterprise use cases. Solana – XRP Integration Signals Cross-Chain Expansion Alongside the bond issuance, Solana is preparing for the arrival of XRP through a partnership with Hex Trust and LayerZero, which will issue wrapped XRP (wXRP) on the network. The integration aims to extend XRP’s liquidity and utility into Solana’s fast-moving DeFi environment, enabling lending, liquidity provision, and other decentralized applications. Hex Trust confirmed that wXRP will be fully backed 1:1 with native XRP held in segregated custody accounts, supported by more than $100 million in initial liquidity. The addition may also influence XRP’s market structure, as wrapped supply requires native XRP to be locked, potentially tightening liquidity during high-demand periods. For Solana, the asset brings an established user base and deeper liquidity pools. For XRP, the move broadens its utility across high-performance decentralized markets that prioritize low-cost transactions and throughput. A Broader Shift in Market Perception These developments come as industry figures, such as Anthony Scaramucci, publicly reiterate their bullish outlook on Solana, arguing that the network’s growth trajectory could surpass Ethereum’s in market capitalization. While the claim remains speculative, the combination of institutional pilots, cross-chain integrations, and expanding developer activity suggests Solana is strengthening its position as a platform for both consumer and enterprise-grade applications.

That’s exactly what happened when a South Korean man in his 40s embezzled company funds worth 423 million won (approximately $307,000) to chase cryptocurrency profits. This shocking case reveals the dangerous intersection of financial desperation and digital asset speculation. What Happened in This Bitcoin Investment Case? According to Money Today reports, the defendant worked in financial management at his company. While overseeing corporate funds, he allegedly transferred money on four separate occasions to fund his personal Bitcoin investment activities. The total amount reached 423.38 million won before authorities discovered the scheme. The court recognized several mitigating factors in their decision. However, they emphasized that embezzlement for cryptocurrency speculation represents a serious breach of trust. This case serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering risky financial moves to fund their crypto ambitions. Why Do People Risk Everything for Cryptocurrency? The psychology behind such drastic actions often involves several factors: Fear of missing out (FOMO) on potential gains Overconfidence in cryptocurrency market predictions Desperation to solve financial problems quickly Misunderstanding of investment risks versus gambling This particular Bitcoin investment scheme demonstrates how normal professionals can make catastrophic decisions when driven by speculative fever. The defendant likely believed he could replace the funds after making profits, a common but dangerous assumption in volatile markets. Legal Consequences of Funding Crypto Investments Illegally The suspended sentence means the defendant avoids immediate imprisonment but faces strict conditions. Should he violate probation terms, he could serve the full prison sentence. This legal approach balances punishment with rehabilitation while sending a clear message about financial crimes. Courts worldwide are establishing precedents for cryptocurrency-related crimes. This case contributes to that growing legal framework, showing that: Cryptocurrency motives don’t justify illegal funding methods Professional positions of trust carry greater responsibility The consequences extend beyond legal penalties to career destruction How Can You Avoid Similar Bitcoin Investment Mistakes? Responsible cryptocurrency participation requires disciplined approaches. First, never use funds that aren’t legally yours. Second, understand that all investments carry risk, especially in volatile markets. Third, maintain transparent financial practices in both personal and professional contexts. If you’re considering a significant Bitcoin investment , ask yourself these crucial questions: Can I afford to lose this money entirely? Am I following legal and ethical funding methods? Have I researched beyond hype and promises? What safeguards prevent desperate decisions during market downturns? The Bigger Picture: Cryptocurrency and Financial Responsibility This case isn’t just about one man’s poor decisions. It reflects broader challenges in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As digital assets gain mainstream attention, education about responsible participation becomes increasingly important. Financial institutions and employers are now developing stricter controls around cryptocurrency activities. Meanwhile, regulators are creating clearer guidelines to prevent similar situations. The suspended sentence in this Bitcoin investment case represents part of this evolving regulatory landscape. Ultimately, sustainable cryptocurrency adoption requires both innovation and responsibility. While blockchain technology offers exciting possibilities, its success depends on ethical participation from all involved parties. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did the man do wrong? He embezzled 423.38 million won from his company while working in financial management. He took the money on four occasions specifically to invest in Bitcoin, violating both legal and ethical boundaries. Why did he receive a suspended sentence instead of prison? The court considered mitigating factors, possibly including cooperation, repayment efforts, or personal circumstances. However, suspended sentences for financial crimes typically come with strict probation conditions. Is investing in Bitcoin illegal? No, investing in Bitcoin itself isn’t illegal in most jurisdictions. The crime here was the funding method—embezzling company money rather than using personal, legally obtained funds. Could this happen with traditional investments too? Absolutely. People have embezzled funds for stock market gambling, real estate speculation, and other traditional investments. The cryptocurrency angle makes this case timely but not unique in financial crime history. What should I do if I suspect similar activity at my workplace? Follow your organization’s reporting procedures, typically starting with supervisors or compliance departments. Document concerns factually without speculation, and avoid investigating independently. How can companies prevent such incidents? Implement strong financial controls, regular audits, clear ethical guidelines, and cryptocurrency-specific policies. Employee education about both investment risks and legal consequences also helps prevention. Found this analysis of cryptocurrency investment risks valuable?

That future is now on the table. Global credit rating giant Moody’s has unveiled a groundbreaking proposal for a stablecoin credit scoring system. This move could fundamentally reshape how we perceive trust and risk in the cryptocurrency market. For investors and users navigating the digital asset space, understanding this development is crucial. What is Moody’s Stablecoin Credit Scoring System? Moody’s, a titan in traditional finance, is stepping into crypto with a new framework. The agency aims to apply its century-old expertise to assess the creditworthiness of dollar-pegged stablecoins. The core of the proposal focuses on two critical areas: Reserve Asset Quality: What exactly backs the stablecoin? Is it cash, treasury bills, or commercial paper? Custody Arrangements: How and where are these reserve assets held? Are they secure and verifiable? This system would mean that not all stablecoins are created equal. Similar to corporate or sovereign bonds, different issuers could receive varying grades. This introduces a layer of transparency the market has been craving. Why Does Stablecoin Credit Scoring Matter Now? The crypto industry is at a crossroads, seeking legitimacy and mainstream adoption. High-profile failures have highlighted the dangers of opaque reserves. Moody’s entry signals a maturation of the market. A robust stablecoin credit scoring framework provides several key benefits: Enhanced Investor Confidence: Clear ratings reduce uncertainty for institutional and retail users. Market Differentiation: It rewards issuers with robust, transparent practices. Regulatory Clarity: It offers a potential model for policymakers worldwide. However, challenges exist. Can traditional metrics perfectly capture the nuances of decentralized finance? The feedback period, open until January 26, is vital for addressing these questions. How Will This Impact Major Stablecoins Like USDT and USDC? The immediate question on everyone’s mind is: how would top players fare? A formal stablecoin credit scoring system would subject giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) to unprecedented scrutiny. Their differing reserve compositions—Tether’s mix of assets versus Circle’s focus on cash and short-term treasuries—would likely result in different scores. This could influence user preference, liquidity, and even integration by traditional financial platforms. The market may begin to price in “credit risk” for stablecoins, a concept previously overlooked. What Are the Actionable Insights for Crypto Users? For anyone holding or using stablecoins, this proposal is a wake-up call. It underscores the importance of due diligence. Don’t assume parity between different dollar-pegged tokens. In the future, you might check a stablecoin’s credit rating alongside its price. Look for issuers who proactively publish attestations and reserve details. This move by Moody’s empowers you to make more informed decisions based on security, not just convenience. Conclusion: A Leap Toward a More Transparent Crypto Future Moody’s proposal for a stablecoin credit scoring system is a pivotal moment. It bridges the gap between traditional finance’s demand for clarity and the innovative spirit of cryptocurrency. While the final framework will evolve through industry feedback, the direction is clear: transparency and trust are becoming non-negotiable. This initiative has the potential to fortify the entire digital economy, making it safer and more accessible for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of Moody’s stablecoin credit scoring proposal? A1: The primary goal is to create a standardized framework to evaluate the risk and reliability of stablecoins by grading the quality of their reserve assets and how those assets are safeguarded. Q2: How is this different from a regular financial audit? A2: While an audit provides a snapshot, a credit score implies an ongoing, comparable rating. It distills complex reserve data into a simple grade (like AAA or Baa1) that investors can quickly understand and compare across different stablecoins. Q3: Will this make stablecoins more like traditional banks? A3: In terms of being subject to third-party risk assessment, yes. It introduces a familiar concept from traditional finance to bring clarity and trust to the crypto ecosystem, potentially paving the way for deeper institutional involvement. Q4: Can a poor credit score “break” a stablecoin’s peg to the dollar? A4: Potentially, yes. A low score could trigger a crisis of confidence, leading to mass redemptions (a “bank run”) that strain its reserves. This makes the scoring system a powerful tool for market discipline. Q5: Who can give feedback on Moody’s proposal, and how? A5: Moody’s is seeking feedback from all market participants—including stablecoin issuers, investors, exchanges, and analysts—until January 26. Details for submission are typically provided through Moody’s official channels and publications like The Block. Q6: Does this mean stablecoins will be regulated by credit agencies now? A6: No, this is a voluntary, market-driven service proposed by Moody’s, not a government regulation. However, regulators may look favorably upon or even reference such independent assessments in future rule-making. Found this deep dive into the future of stablecoin credit scoring insightful?

The blockchain community recently buzzed with reports of a potential hack. However, the team behind the zero-knowledge proof network has issued a crucial clarification. Zerobase refutes hacking claims entirely, attributing the incident to a third-party vulnerability. This distinction matters greatly for user security and trust in decentralized systems. What Really Happened with Zerobase? Let’s clear the air. The situation began when blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain raised concerns about a possible front-end compromise. In response, the Zerobase team conducted a thorough forensic analysis. Their investigation revealed a critical detail: this was not a protocol-level attack. The issue stemmed from a specific traffic hijacking incident. This hijacking occurred due to a security vulnerability at an external middleware provider. Therefore, the core Zerobase protocol and its smart contracts remained untouched and fully operational. The team emphasized this point strongly, stating their systems are 100% safe. Understanding the Third-Party Vulnerability So, if Zerobase refutes hacking claims, what was the actual problem? The incident was an isolated, client-side issue. Think of it like this: a trusted delivery service (the middleware) had a temporary security lapse, not the bank vault (the Zerobase protocol) itself. The team described it as a problem stemming from an external provider. This distinction is vital for several reasons: Protocol Integrity: The zero-knowledge proof technology and core contracts were never breached. User Fund Safety: No direct access to user wallets or private keys was possible through this vector. Targeted Response: The fix involved addressing the specific third-party weakness, not overhauling the main system. How Zerobase is Enhancing Security Now In light of this event, the Zerobase project has not been idle. The team has proactively implemented new security measures to protect its community. They reminded users about a separate, previously reported phishing contract on BNB Chain. This malicious contract impersonates the Zerobase interface to trick users. To combat this, Zerobase has rolled out an innovative security feature. The system now automatically blocks deposits and withdrawals if it detects a user has interacted with a known phishing contract while accessing staking services. This automated safeguard adds a powerful layer of protection against social engineering attacks. Essential Safety Tips for Crypto Users The Zerobase situation offers valuable lessons for everyone in the crypto space. While the team works on technical solutions, user vigilance remains the first line of defense. Here are actionable steps you can take today: Verify Official Sources: Always double-check URLs and official social media channels. Beware of Unofficial Links: The Zerobase team specifically urged caution with links from unofficial sources. Monitor Transaction Approvals: Scrutinize every contract interaction, especially token approvals. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider cold storage solutions for enhanced security. The Bigger Picture for Blockchain Security When Zerobase refutes hacking claims, it highlights a common challenge in decentralized ecosystems. Modern blockchain projects often rely on various external services and providers. A vulnerability in any connected service can create perceived risks, even if the core protocol remains secure. This incident underscores the importance of comprehensive security audits across the entire technology stack. It also shows why transparent communication, like Zerobase’s official statement, is crucial for maintaining community trust during potential crises. Conclusion: A Lesson in Transparency and Resilience The Zerobase incident demonstrates how responsible projects handle security concerns. By quickly investigating, clearly communicating that Zerobase refutes hacking claims, and implementing protective features, the team has shown commitment to its users. The key takeaway is clear: not every security alert indicates a protocol breach. Understanding the difference between third-party vulnerabilities and core protocol issues is essential for navigating the crypto landscape safely and confidently. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Was the Zerobase protocol actually hacked? No. Zerobase refutes hacking claims regarding its core protocol. The incident involved a traffic hijacking issue at a third-party middleware provider, not a breach of the Zerobase smart contracts or zero-knowledge proof system. Were user funds at risk during this incident? According to the forensic analysis, the vulnerability did not provide direct access to user wallets or private keys. The team asserts the protocol and contracts remained 100% safe throughout the event. What is a traffic hijacking in crypto terms? Traffic hijacking refers to redirecting user connection requests to malicious servers. In this case, it was a client-side issue related to how users connected to the service, not an attack on the blockchain itself. What should Zerobase users do now? Users should ensure they are accessing official Zerobase interfaces, be cautious of links from unofficial sources, and consider the new security feature that blocks interactions if phishing is detected. How can I verify official Zerobase communications? Always check the project’s official website and verified social media channels. Be skeptical of announcements from unverified accounts or platforms. What does this mean for the future of Zerobase security? The project has shown proactive security enhancement by implementing automated phishing detection. This suggests ongoing commitment to improving user protection beyond the core protocol. Found this security breakdown helpful?

SEC weighs innovation amid rising tokenization debate The letter exchange comes as the SEC maintains that innovation can benefit capital markets. Chair Paul Atkins has emphasized the agency’s need to provide clear pathways for market participants to stay compliant with existing regulations. Tokenization, the process of representing real-world assets like stocks and bonds onchain, has gained significant attention over the past few months. This practice still presents complicated questions and needs more attention, while regulators have signalled that blockchain technology could help modernize the U.S. financial sector. Conflict between Citadel Securities and the crypto industry intensified after the market maker sent a letter to the SEC last week, urging the agency to identify all intermediaries involved in trading tokenized U.S. equities. Citadel argued that decentralized trading protocols often function like exchanges or broker-dealers under existing SEC classifications. “To conclude that there are no participants that meet the definitions of a ‘broker’ or ‘dealer’ would again suggest that the technology used matters more than the services provided, and would potentially call into question the regulatory treatment of firms that have long registered with the Commission,” Citadel Global Head of Government & Regulatory Policy Stephen John Berger wrote. Citadel’s letter prompted backlash from some in the crypto industry who referred to the market maker’s approach as “unworkable.” Crypto advocates argue that DeFi transactions are inherently peer-to-peer, with no centralized entity controlling users’ funds. As such, applying traditional SEC registration rules could unfairly target developers and infrastructure providers who do not hold custody of users’ assets. Addressing the SEC Advisory Committee meeting earlier this month, Jonah Platt, managing director and U.S. head of government and regulatory policy at Citadel Securities, noted that tokenization of U.S. equities could prove beneficial to investors, but said granting broad exemptions for DeFi could have negative consequences for investors. In response to the letter on Friday, a Citadel Securities spokesperson affirmed the firm’s support for tokenization while emphasizing the importance of investor protections. When questioned by reporters, the spokesperson said in an email that, as detailed in their comment letters, Citadel Securities strongly supports tokenization and other innovations that can reinforce America’s leadership in digital finance. Still, the individual noted that this does not require sacrificing the rigorous investor protections that have made U.S. equity markets the global gold standard. Tokenization and regulatory clash highlight industry tensions The group’s Friday letter argued that “autonomous software” and “technological infrastructure” should not fall under the same category used by the SEC in its statutory definitions, since traders retain control over their own assets. “These definitions must be applied carefully to avoid inadvertently including software developers who neither hold custody of nor control users’ assets,” the letter stated. Earlier that day, the SEC issued a no-action letter to the Depository Trust Company (DTC), allowing it to provide a tokenization service for custodied real-world assets (RWAs). Under the letter, DTC may tokenize a specific set of assets, including Russell 1000 constituents, ETFs tracking major U.S. equity indices, and U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, and notes.

This significant drop of six points from the previous day signals growing anxiety among cryptocurrency investors. For traders and enthusiasts monitoring market psychology, this shift provides crucial insights into potential price movements and investor behavior. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading Mean? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index now sits at 23, firmly in the extreme fear category according to data from Alternative. This measurement tool tracks market sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents maximum fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. The current reading suggests investors are becoming increasingly nervous about cryptocurrency prices and market stability. Several factors contribute to this concerning shift in sentiment. Market volatility has increased significantly, while trading volumes show patterns typically associated with fearful markets. Social media discussions have turned more negative, and surveys indicate growing pessimism among cryptocurrency participants. How Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Understanding how this important metric works helps explain why the current reading matters. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index combines multiple data sources to create a comprehensive picture of market psychology: Volatility (25%) : Measures price fluctuations compared to historical averages Trading Volume (25%) : Analyzes buying and selling activity patterns Social Media Mentions (15%) : Tracks sentiment across major platforms Surveys (15%) : Gathers direct investor sentiment data Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Monitors Bitcoin’s market share relative to altcoins Google Search Volume (10%) : Measures public interest and concern levels This multi-factor approach makes the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable indicator of genuine market sentiment rather than just price movements. Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Readings? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters extreme fear territory, it often signals potential turning points in the market. Historically, such readings have frequently preceded price rebounds as fearful investors create buying opportunities for confident traders. However, extreme fear can also indicate deeper market problems that might lead to further declines. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 23 suggests several market conditions: Increased selling pressure from nervous investors Potential for panic selling if prices drop further Opportunities for value investors to enter positions Higher volatility as emotions drive trading decisions What Can Investors Do During Extreme Fear Periods? Navigating markets when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear requires careful strategy. First, avoid making emotional decisions based solely on fear. Instead, review your investment thesis and consider whether market conditions have fundamentally changed or if this represents temporary sentiment. Second, implement risk management strategies. This might include setting stop-loss orders, diversifying holdings, or reducing position sizes until sentiment improves. Remember that extreme fear readings on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index often create excellent buying opportunities for patient investors. Finally, monitor other indicators alongside the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Technical analysis, fundamental metrics, and macroeconomic factors all contribute to comprehensive market understanding. The index provides valuable sentiment data but should inform rather than dictate your investment decisions. Historical Context of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has proven valuable during previous market cycles. During major sell-offs, the index typically reaches single-digit readings before significant recoveries begin. The current reading of 23, while concerning, remains above the absolute panic levels seen during major market crashes. Previous instances when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index entered extreme fear territory often marked excellent entry points for long-term investors. However, timing these reversals requires patience and discipline, as sentiment can remain negative for extended periods before improving. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 23 clearly indicates extreme fear has gripped cryptocurrency markets. This sentiment shift reflects genuine concerns among investors but also creates potential opportunities. Successful navigation requires balancing caution with perspective, recognizing that extreme fear often precedes market recoveries while acknowledging real risks. By understanding what drives the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how to interpret its readings, investors can make more informed decisions during volatile periods. The current extreme fear reading serves as both a warning and a potential opportunity, depending on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment measurement tool that tracks cryptocurrency market psychology on a scale from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). It combines multiple data sources including volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, and search trends. Why has the index dropped to 23? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen to 23 due to increased market volatility, negative social media sentiment, higher selling pressure, and growing investor concerns about cryptocurrency prices and market stability.

Moreover, its clearinghouse supports margin and settlement based on cryptocurrency, granting approved products the opportunity to be margined and settled directly using digital assets. Following these findings, the crypto community expressed its excitement over Bitnomial’s approval. This action prompted the president of Bitnomial, Michael Dunn, to comment on the topic of discussion. Dunn highlighted that this approval marks a recent accomplishment, further elaborating that it enables the firm to support both its exchange and external partners. This move establishes a clearing network that improves the overall prediction market ecosystem, he said. Concerning reports that the Bitnomial Clearinghouse operates as an infrastructure-only clearing provider, sources clarified that the firm decided to undertake this function rather than rivalling retail businesses. This strategy grants partners the green light to access its margin and settlement systems. The decision creates room for collateral conversion between US dollars and cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, analysts discovered that Bitnomial’s recent approval followed the green light to begin a US-based spot cryptocurrency trading platform regulated by CFTC. The platform enables clients to effectively purchase, sell and conduct trade of both leveraged and non-leveraged cryptocurrency products on a federally government-regulated exchange. Prediction markets become increasingly popular in the crypto industry The CFTC’s recent decision on Bitnomial’s request to start prediction markets in the US demonstrates an increasing popularity among prediction markets this year. To support this claim, DefiLlama shared data indicating that the prediction market Kalshi has successfully achieved $5.27 billion in trading volume over the last month. On the other hand, Polymarket, which is based on blockchain, recently achieved $2 billion at the same time. This accomplishment followed Polymarket’s acquisition of approval from the CFTC in November to operate an intermediated trading platform. This enabled its users to access it via registered brokers due to US market regulations. The approval was secured after the CFTC and the US Department of Justice discontinued an investigation in July. In this investigation, they examined whether Polymarket permitted its users based in the US to trade. The investigation involved an FBI search of founder Shayne Coplan’s house. In the meantime, sources mentioned that Polymarket finalises contracts using the USDC stablecoin on the Polygon blockchain . It has also recently reported the formation of partnerships, including collaborations with UFC and Zuffa Boxing, as well as fantasy sports operator PrizePicks, in November.

This green light from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission allows the firm to launch a first-of-its-kind, fully regulated prediction market. This move blurs the lines between traditional finance and crypto, offering a novel way for traders to gain exposure. But what exactly does this mean for you, and why is it such a significant development? What Does Bitnomial’s CFTC Approval Actually Mean? The recent Bitnomial CFTC approval is not for another simple futures contract. Instead, it authorizes the creation of an event contract market. Think of it as a regulated platform for betting on the outcome of specific future events. Bitnomial plans to offer contracts tied to cryptocurrency prices, like Bitcoin (BTC), and major macroeconomic data releases. This provides a structured, transparent, and federally overseen alternative to informal prediction markets. This approval signals a growing comfort level from U.S. regulators with innovative crypto-based financial products. However, it comes with strict oversight. The CFTC’s involvement ensures: Consumer Protection: Clear rules and safeguards against manipulation. Market Integrity: A level playing field for all participants. Financial Transparency: All trades occur on a regulated exchange with proper clearing. How Will This New Prediction Market Work? Imagine you have a strong view on where the Bitcoin price or the next inflation number will be in a month. Instead of just hoping your spot trade works out, you could use Bitnomial’s new market. You would buy or sell a contract that pays out based on whether the actual outcome is above or below a specific target. It’s a direct bet on volatility and direction, packaged into a regulated derivative. This model offers several potential benefits for traders: Targeted Exposure: Hedge or speculate on very specific events or price levels. Regulated Environment: Operate with the confidence of a CFTC-regulated venue. Novel Strategies: Create complex trading strategies combining traditional derivatives with event contracts. What Are the Challenges and Implications? While the Bitnomial CFTC approval is a breakthrough, challenges remain. Regulatory clarity is still evolving, and the success of this market depends on attracting sufficient liquidity. Furthermore, educating traders on how to use these new instruments effectively will be crucial. The broader implication, however, is profound. Bitnomial is building a comprehensive ecosystem. With this prediction market, its existing crypto derivatives, and its planned CFTC-regulated spot exchange, the company aims to be a one-stop regulated shop for U.S. crypto traders. This could pressure other exchanges to seek similar approvals, accelerating the institutionalization of the entire sector. Conclusion: A Step Toward a Mature Market The Bitnomial CFTC approval for a prediction market is more than a niche product launch. It represents a thoughtful expansion of regulated crypto finance. By bringing speculative activity on future events into a transparent framework, it reduces systemic risk and enhances market credibility. For the savvy trader, it opens new doors for strategy. For the industry, it’s another brick in the foundation of a mature, legitimate financial marketplace. The journey toward full regulatory integration continues, but Bitnomial has just mapped a compelling new route. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a prediction market in simple terms? A: It’s a regulated marketplace where people can trade contracts whose value depends on the outcome of a future event, like “Will Bitcoin be above $70,000 on June 1st?” It turns predictions into tradable assets. Q2: How is Bitnomial’s product different from sports betting or unregulated platforms? A: The key difference is CFTC regulation. Bitnomial’s market operates under strict federal rules for financial derivatives, ensuring transparency, fair pricing, and consumer protections that informal betting lacks. Q3: Can anyone trade on Bitnomial’s new market? A: While specific account requirements will be set by Bitnomial, access will likely be limited to eligible participants who pass know-your-customer (KYC) checks, similar to other regulated derivatives exchanges. Q4: What can I bet on in this market? A: Initially, Bitnomial plans to offer contracts based on cryptocurrency prices (e.g., BTC) and key macroeconomic data points (like CPI inflation numbers), with the potential for more events in the future. Q5: Why is CFTC approval for this so important? A: CFTC approval provides legal certainty and institutional trust. It signals that the product meets federal standards for market integrity, which can attract more participants, including professional traders and institutions. Q6: Does this mean crypto is becoming more like traditional finance? A: Yes, precisely. This approval is a clear example of crypto-native innovation being integrated into the existing, regulated financial framework, a process often called “TradFi” integration.

Instead of a traditional presale, Fogo is now giving away a massive $20 million worth of its native cryptocurrency. This decision to launch a FOGO token airdrop is sending ripples through the crypto community and raises a crucial question: is this a generous gift or a calculated masterstroke? What Exactly Happened with the FOGO Presale? Fogo, an innovative SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) Layer 1 blockchain, made headlines by abruptly canceling its planned FOGO token presale. According to a report by The Block, the team decided to airdrop the entire allocation originally meant for the sale. This allocation is valued at a staggering $20 million and represents 2% of the total FOGO supply. The project is now gearing up for its mainnet launch, scheduled for January next year. Why Would a Project Cancel a $20M Presale? This pivot from a presale to an airdrop is not a common occurrence. Typically, a presale helps a project raise crucial capital. Therefore, Fogo’s decision is a strategic one, likely aimed at achieving specific long-term goals. Let’s break down the potential benefits of this FOGO token airdrop strategy: Building a Loyal Community: An airdrop distributes tokens directly to users, fostering a sense of ownership and loyalty from day one. Enhancing Decentralization: By distributing tokens widely, the project avoids concentrating a large portion with early presale investors. Generating Buzz and Engagement: A free token distribution creates immense hype, driving user sign-ups and platform testing. Testing Network Resilience: A sudden influx of new token holders can help stress-test the network before the mainnet launch. What Are the Potential Challenges of This Airdrop Model? However, this generous move is not without its risks. The crypto space is rife with airdrop hunters who quickly sell their free tokens, which can lead to significant price volatility. Furthermore, the project forgoes the immediate capital infusion a $20 million presale would provide. This means Fogo must have secured funding through other means, such as venture capital, to support its development. The success of this FOGO token strategy now hinges entirely on building a product so compelling that the airdrop recipients become long-term believers and users. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Launches? Fogo’s audacious pivot could signal a shift in how new blockchain projects approach their initial token distribution. The traditional presale model is facing scrutiny for creating uneven playing fields. In contrast, a well-executed FOGO token airdrop prioritizes community building and fair distribution. If successful, Fogo could inspire other projects to adopt similar models, potentially making airdrops a more central part of launch strategies. The key will be watching how the market receives these tokens upon trading and whether the community actively participates in the network. Conclusion: A Generous Gamble with High Rewards Fogo’s cancellation of its $20 million presale in favor of a massive airdrop is a stunning gamble. It trades short-term capital for long-term community trust and network participation. This move places immense importance on the upcoming mainnet launch. If the Fogo blockchain delivers on its promises of speed and scalability as an SVM Layer 1, this FOGO token airdrop could be remembered as a genius community-building exercise. If it stumbles, the token distribution might lack the supportive foundation it needs. All eyes are now on January to see if this bold bet pays off. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the FOGO token airdrop? The FOGO token airdrop is the free distribution of $20 million worth of FOGO tokens by the Fogo blockchain project, replacing its originally planned presale. Why did Fogo cancel its presale? While not explicitly stated, Fogo likely canceled the presale to build a more decentralized and engaged community from the outset by distributing tokens directly to potential users. How can I qualify for the FOGO airdrop? Eligibility details (like completing specific tasks or signing up early) have not been fully announced yet. You should follow Fogo’s official channels for the exact criteria. When is the Fogo mainnet launching? The Fogo SVM Layer 1 mainnet is scheduled to launch in January of next year. What is an SVM Layer 1 chain? An SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) Layer 1 chain is a standalone blockchain that uses the same virtual machine as Solana, aiming for high speed and low transaction costs. Is the airdrop better than a presale for investors? For recipients, an airdrop offers free tokens with no upfront cost, which is beneficial. However, the long-term value depends entirely on the success of the underlying Fogo blockchain project. Found this analysis of the FOGO token airdrop strategy insightful?

The cryptocurrency market is showing subtle but important shifts. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has just climbed two points to reach 19. This movement captures the attention of every crypto investor watching for the next big trend. But what does this number actually mean for your portfolio? What Is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market thermometer. It measures how the top 100 cryptocurrencies perform against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus purely on market-driven assets. Currently sitting at 19, the index has gained two points from the previous day. This upward movement suggests growing momentum for alternative cryptocurrencies. However, we’re still far from official altcoin season territory. The market declares an “altcoin season” only when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin during that three-month window. The current reading of 19 indicates we’re in early stages, but the direction is worth monitoring closely. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Work? Understanding this index requires breaking down its components. First, it tracks performance data from the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Second, it compares each asset’s 90-day performance against Bitcoin’s returns during the same period. Finally, it calculates what percentage of these altcoins are beating Bitcoin. The index operates on a simple scale: 0-74: Bitcoin dominance period 75-100: Altcoin season declared Closer to 100 indicates stronger altcoin season At 19, we’re seeing approximately 19% of top altcoins outperforming Bitcoin over the last quarter. This represents measurable progress, but substantial room remains before reaching the 75% threshold. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Movement? The Altcoin Season Index provides more than just a number—it offers actionable insights. When this index begins climbing, it often signals changing market dynamics. Historically, sustained increases in the index have preceded broader altcoin rallies. However, investors should approach with both optimism and caution. Several factors could be driving this two-point increase: Improved sentiment toward specific altcoin projects Bitcoin consolidation periods allowing altcoins to catch up Sector rotation within the cryptocurrency market New developments in blockchain technology attracting attention Remember that the Altcoin Season Index reflects historical performance, not future guarantees. While the trend is encouraging, it doesn’t guarantee immediate profits. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? A rising Altcoin Season Index suggests it might be time to review your portfolio allocation. Many investors use this indicator to adjust their Bitcoin versus altcoin exposure. However, successful investing requires more than following a single metric. Consider these approaches when the index shows upward movement: Research altcoins with strong fundamentals showing relative strength Diversify across different blockchain sectors and use cases Maintain appropriate Bitcoin exposure as a market anchor Set clear entry and exit strategies before making moves The current index reading of 19 suggests cautious optimism rather than aggressive action. It’s an early signal worth watching, not a trigger for impulsive decisions. How to Track the Altcoin Season Index Effectively Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index requires consistent attention. CoinMarketCap updates this metric regularly, providing transparent data for informed decisions. Savvy investors combine this index with other indicators for comprehensive analysis. For best results: Check the index weekly rather than daily to avoid noise Compare index movements with overall market volume and sentiment Watch for sustained trends rather than single-day movements Consider the specific altcoins driving index changes This disciplined approach helps separate meaningful signals from market noise. Conclusion: Reading the Crypto Market’s Early Signals The Altcoin Season Index climbing to 19 represents a noteworthy development in cryptocurrency markets. While far from declaring an official altcoin season, this movement indicates shifting dynamics worth your attention. Successful investors recognize these early signals while maintaining balanced perspectives. Remember that cryptocurrency investing involves substantial risk. The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable data, but it’s just one tool among many. Combine this metric with fundamental research, risk management, and clear investment goals. The current reading suggests watching altcoin opportunities while respecting Bitcoin’s ongoing market role. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It helps identify when alternative cryptocurrencies are gaining relative strength. What does a reading of 19 mean? A reading of 19 means approximately 19% of top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last three months. This indicates early positive momentum but remains below the 75% threshold for declaring an altcoin season. How often does CoinMarketCap update this index? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index regularly, typically showing daily changes. However, significant trends usually develop over weeks rather than days. Should I buy altcoins when this index rises? Not necessarily. The index provides context but shouldn’t dictate investment decisions alone. Always conduct independent research and consider your risk tolerance before investing. What other indicators should I watch with this index? Combine the Altcoin Season Index with trading volume, market sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, and fundamental project analysis for comprehensive market understanding. Has the index ever reached 100? Yes, during strong altcoin seasons, the index can approach 100, indicating nearly all top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. These periods typically occur during broad cryptocurrency bull markets.

This major price advancement for Bitcoin comes after significant institutional events, including Strike & Twenty One ringing the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, along with PNC Bank becoming the first major institution in the U.S. to offer private customers direct spot Bitcoin trading services via the Coinbase infrastructure. As market sentiment continues to strengthen, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood says that the macro lows are well behind the current market. However, seasoned traders are also looking for higher upside elsewhere, beyond the current Bitcoin market cap of $1.86 trillion, pushing the demand for new cryptos like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and, hence, placing it among the best cryptos to buy at the current moment, looking ahead toward 2026. Institutional Adoption Propels a Strengthening Bitcoin Rally The increasing integration of digital assets within the traditional financial system continues to support the bullish trend. Bank of America has recommended that their wealth management clients allocate between 1% and 4% of their portfolio to the crypto market, which is unprecedented for the conservative institution. Additionally, Neuberger Berman CIO Shannon Saccocia emphasizes that the expected Fed rate cut and growth of productivity powered by AI could fuel additional capital inflows into risk assets. This provides the backdrop for the start of the bull cycle for the digital assets market. However, whereas Bitcoin offers the benefit of stability, the scale of Bitcoin restricts the chances of short-term exponential growth. Consequently, individuals keeping abreast of crypto news, as of today, are cycling their investments into new, early-stage, high-utility cryptos that provide opportunities for short-term growth. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Phase 6 With the increasing diversification of investments into high-growth assets, a new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has shot up the ranks and is among the top cryptocurrencies that individuals can invest for 2025. This project has been able to raise $19,280,000, with over 18,450 participants on board. However, the price of phase 6 comes with a requirement of $0.035 per MUTM, which is a staggering 250% increase over the listing price. But this will not last for long since the current phase is already 98% sold out, and the token will skyrocket by 20% to $0.040, the price of phase 7. With the officially confirmed launch price of $0.06, early adopters are ready for the returns that come with a potential increase of over 400%. Security is also a consideration for the project, with Halborn Security performing the current lending and borrowing contract audit for the project. Mutuum Finance is also growing engagement through the use of community incentives. Through its 24-hour leaderboard, it ranks engagement, and the highest-ranked individual is rewarded $500 worth of MUTM for completing a transaction. This resets every 00:00 UTC. Additionally, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway, where they will target ten individuals who will win the money. This strategy will ensure that the level of interaction on the blockchain is higher. This is a very essential parameter for new initiatives that claim they offer the best crypto investment. Strategic Entry Before the Price Hike Strategic entry, While Bitcoin continues to make new records by trading above $94,000, investors are actively aligning themselves with assets that have better upside. Mutuum Finance is one of the assets that provide a good combination of utility, security, and a very aggressive presale price. With Phase 6 nearing completion and the $0.035 price level about to expire, the time for discounted acquisition is running out. Investors looking for the top cryptocurrency on which to make their investment for next year should act fast before the price rises to $0.040 in Phase 7.

The network, once hailed for its blazing speed, is now SOL struggling with a significant downturn in key growth metrics. From a plunging Total Value Locked to fading memecoin mania, what’s behind this slump, and what could it mean for the future? Why Is SOL Struggling With On-Chain Metrics? A deep dive into the numbers reveals the core of the issue. According to a Cointelegraph analysis, Solana’s ecosystem vitality has weakened considerably. The most glaring signal is the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL), which represents the total capital deposited in its decentralized applications. This figure has fallen by over $10 billion from its all-time high of $15 billion last September. This decline suggests that users and investors are pulling capital out of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, the financial health of the network’s applications is under pressure. Weekly revenue generated by decentralized apps (DApps) on Solana has dropped to approximately $26 million. This marks a notable fall from the $37 million recorded just two months prior. When DApps earn less, it can signal reduced user transactions and engagement, creating a cycle that’s hard to break. Has the Memecoin Frenzy Truly Faded on Solana? Solana gained immense popularity during the recent memecoin boom, with tokens like BONK and WIF capturing headlines. However, this activity has dramatically cooled. Data shows that trading volume and engagement with Solana-based memecoins have plummeted by 67% since their peak in January. This exodus of speculative capital removes a major source of network fee revenue and general buzz, contributing directly to the current state of SOL struggling to maintain momentum. The derivatives market adds another layer of concern. The annualized funding rate for Solana perpetual contracts sits around 6%. In simple terms, this positive rate means traders holding long positions are paying those with short positions. While not extreme, it indicates weakening conviction among bulls and can be a precursor to further price pressure if the trend continues. What Are the Broader Implications for the Solana Ecosystem? This period of SOL struggling is a critical stress test for the network’s long-term value proposition. The challenges are multifaceted: Developer Retention: Falling revenues may discourage developers from building and maintaining projects on Solana. Investor Sentiment: Persistent negative metrics can erode investor confidence, making it harder to attract new capital. Network Effect Erosion: The core strength of any blockchain is its active community. Declining activity threatens this vital network effect. However, it’s crucial to view this within the context of the broader crypto market cycle. Many networks experience periods of consolidation after explosive growth. The key question is whether Solana’s underlying technology and community are robust enough to navigate this phase and build more sustainable, utility-driven growth for the future. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Solana The data is clear: Solana is in a phase of significant challenge. The network is SOL struggling with declining capital, user activity, and speculative interest. This presents a pivotal moment that will separate fleeting hype from enduring utility. For investors and observers, the focus should now shift to whether the ecosystem can innovate and attract new, substantive use cases beyond speculative trading. The path forward requires rebuilding on fundamentals rather than frenzy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘SOL struggling’ mean in this context? It refers to Solana’s native token (SOL) and the broader network facing a period of declining key performance indicators, such as Total Value Locked (TVL) and decentralized application (DApp) revenue, indicating reduced user and capital engagement. Why is Total Value Locked (TVL) dropping important? TVL is a crucial metric for DeFi-focused blockchains. A falling TVL suggests users are withdrawing funds from Solana’s applications, which can decrease network security, developer incentives, and overall ecosystem health. Has Solana’s technology failed? Not necessarily. The current struggles are primarily related to economic activity and market sentiment, not a fundamental failure of its high-speed blockchain technology. However, sustaining a network requires both strong tech and a vibrant economy. Can Solana recover from this slump? Yes, blockchain projects often go through cycles. Recovery depends on the ecosystem’s ability to foster new, utility-driven applications, improve user experience, and regain developer and investor confidence during the next market upturn. What should a SOL holder do during this period? Holders should conduct their own research, monitor fundamental developments (not just price), assess their risk tolerance, and consider the long-term roadmap of the Solana ecosystem rather than reacting to short-term metrics alone. Is this decline unique to Solana? While the severity may vary, many blockchain networks experience similar periods of cooling activity after a hype cycle. The broader cryptocurrency market conditions significantly influence individual network metrics. Found this analysis of SOL struggling insightful?

Price action has stalled as traders wait for clearer direction after the recent Federal Reserve decision and ongoing macro uncertainty. Yet beneath the surface, whale activity tells a very different story. According to Lookonchain, one of the most notable market participants—the famous BitcoinOG, known for accurately shorting the market during the sharp October 10 crash—is now aggressively expanding his long exposure across multiple assets. His current positioning is substantial: 150,466 ETH valued at approximately $491 million, 1,000 BTC worth $92.6 million, and 212,907 SOL totaling $27.8 million. Rather than scaling out or reducing risk during this period of market hesitation, he continues to build, signaling strong conviction in a broader recovery across major cryptocurrencies. While retail traders and smaller speculators wait for confirmation , this whale is positioning early, anticipating a potential shift in momentum. His actions add a new layer of intrigue to Bitcoin’s consolidation, raising the question of whether smart money is preparing for a trend reversal while the rest of the market hesitates. Whale Positioning and Strategic Bids Ahead Lookonchain reports, citing Hypurrscan data , that this whale isn’t just holding an already massive multi-asset long position—he is strategically preparing to increase exposure even further. According to the data, he has placed limit orders to add an additional 40,000 ETH in the $3,030–$3,258 price range and 50,000 SOL at $138.6. These levels are positioned just below current market prices, suggesting he expects—or is at least prepared for—a deeper pullback before the next major move. This behavior is notable because it reflects a deliberate accumulation strategy rather than impulsive buying. By setting large bids at key support zones, he aims to capture liquidity during periods of volatility, effectively using market weakness to scale into long-term positions. Such an approach is typical of sophisticated traders who rely on structured entries rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. The scale of these pending orders also indicates that his conviction extends beyond his already massive exposure. If filled, these additions would significantly increase his leverage in the broader crypto market, particularly in Ethereum and Solana. For observers, this raises an important question: is this smart money positioning ahead of a potential macro-driven rebound, or is it a high-risk bet into an uncertain environment? Bitcoin Price Analysis: Testing Support, Lacking Momentum Bitcoin’s latest price action on the 3-day timeframe shows a market stuck between recovery attempts and lingering downside pressure. After the sharp November sell-off, BTC stabilized above the $90,000 zone, which is now acting as a short-term support area. Price briefly dipped below this level but was quickly bought back, suggesting that buyers are still defending the region. However, the rebound remains shallow, and the structure lacks the strong momentum typically seen during bullish reversals. The chart shows BTC trading below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which have now turned downward. This alignment reflects a shift toward medium-term bearish conditions. The 200-day moving average currently sits below the price and has become the most important dynamic support; BTC is hovering directly above it. Historically, when Bitcoin holds the 200-day MA after a major correction, a consolidation phase often follows before a decisive move. Volume also reinforces the uncertainty. Despite multiple attempts to push higher, buying volume remains muted compared to previous rallies, indicating limited conviction from bulls. Until BTC breaks convincingly above the 50-day MA region near $100K, the market will likely remain in a cautious, range-bound state.

The combination of higher lows, compressed structure, and developing Wyckoff signals suggests growing strength beneath the surface, raising the possibility that DOGE is quietly preparing for its next major move. MTF Range Strategy: Longs At Discount, Shorts At Premium According to an update by Wyckoff Insider via the lens of a multi-timeframe (MTF) range, the focus is on seeking long positions in areas of extreme discount and short positions in areas of extreme premium. When an MTF range is present, it often develops a Wyckoff structure near both the range highs and lows, providing clearer points of interest for traders. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds Dogecoin is currently forming an 8H Bojan pivot in the extreme discount zone of this MTF range. The key to trading a Bojan pivot is identifying the Sign of Strength (SOS) that forms on the third candle. Bitcoin displayed a similar 8H Bojan recently, but trading it was more challenging due to deviations on both sides of the range, making DOGE difficult to trade also. On the lower timeframes, Dogecoin is also showing a Wyckoff Model 1 range. When the third candle opens, and price pulls down, traders look for an LPS, BOS, and internal BOS pattern. Valid entries include taking the breakout on the 3-minute BOS with a stop below the M1 low, or entering on the LPS after the internal BOS, with a stop placed beneath the LPS itself. In terms of trade management, Wyckoff Insider outlines a clear plan: risk should be kept at 2% per setup, with TP1 at the Wyckoff target zone (40%), and TP2 at the first range supply, fully closing the trade once a Sign of Weakness (SOW) appears. This structured approach helps navigate DOGE’s multi-layered Wyckoff-driven price action with discipline and clarity. Daily Structure Shows Strength Despite Downtrend Trader Tardigrade revealed that the daily chart provides clear indications that Dogecoin is actively building a stronger market structure despite the recent overall downtrend. This strength is apparent when comparing the current price action to past cycles. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Volatility Returns as Market Weighs Bullish Indicators Against Recent Dip Historically, when the broader market is weak, DOGE typically reinforces its bearish trend by forming lower lows following a distinct new swing low. However, in a significant departure from this pattern, DOGE is now attempting to establish a higher lows structure within a symmetrical triangle pattern. This formation is key, as the analyst suggests the symmetrical triangle structure indicates that Dogecoin has been rejected from trading further downward. Such a development signals that selling exhaustion is setting in, preparing the market for a potential directional breakout.

According to a CNBC report, cryptocurrency giant Coinbase is poised to launch its own Coinbase prediction market , leveraging technology from the specialist platform Kalshi. This bold move signals Coinbase’s ambition to become a one-stop shop for all asset types, from crypto to tokenized stocks and now, event-based contracts. An official announcement could come as early as next week. What Exactly is a Coinbase Prediction Market? Simply put, a prediction market lets users trade contracts based on the outcome of future events. Think of it as financial betting on questions like “Will the Fed cut rates in June?” or “Which team will win the championship?” By integrating this feature, Coinbase isn’t just adding a new product; it’s fundamentally expanding its ecosystem. This initiative is a core part of their strategy to dominate as a comprehensive exchange for the digital age. Why is This Partnership with Kalshi a Game-Changer? Coinbase isn’t building this complex platform from scratch. Instead, they are smartly partnering with Kalshi, a regulated platform already experienced in event contracts. This collaboration offers significant advantages: Speed to Market: Using proven technology means Coinbase can launch faster and more reliably. Regulatory Navigation: Kalshi’s experience helps navigate the complex legal landscape of prediction markets. User Trust: It combines Coinbase’s massive user base with specialized, tested infrastructure. Therefore, this partnership de-risks the launch and increases its chance of success, bringing sophisticated financial instruments to a mainstream audience. How Will the New Coinbase Prediction Market Work? While full details await the official announcement, we can expect a user-friendly interface within the Coinbase app or website. Users will likely be able to buy and sell contracts on a wide range of topics. The potential categories are vast: Finance & Economics: Interest rate decisions, inflation reports, stock market milestones. Politics: Election outcomes, policy decisions, geopolitical events. Sports & Entertainment: Championship winners, award show results. Crypto-Specific Events: Bitcoin ETF inflows, protocol upgrade approvals, network adoption metrics. This move could unlock unprecedented liquidity and mainstream interest in prediction markets, merging them with traditional and crypto asset trading. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? This expansion is not without its hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny will be intense, as prediction markets often walk a fine line with gambling laws in different jurisdictions. Coinbase will need to ensure robust compliance and clear communication. However, the opportunities are transformative. A successful Coinbase prediction market could: Attract a new wave of users interested in speculative event trading. Increase platform engagement and transaction volume. Provide valuable, crowd-sourced data on event probabilities, useful for all traders. Further legitimize event contracts as a serious financial tool. Moreover, it solidifies Coinbase’s position as an innovator, constantly pushing the boundaries of what a crypto exchange can be. Conclusion: A Bold Step Toward a Unified Financial Future The planned launch of a Coinbase prediction market is more than a new feature—it’s a vision statement. Coinbase is systematically building a platform where you can manage every aspect of your financial worldview, from cryptocurrencies and stocks to opinions on future events. By harnessing Kalshi’s technology, they are executing this vision with precision. This move promises to bring sophistication, liquidity, and mainstream appeal to prediction markets, potentially changing how we interact with uncertainty itself. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will the Coinbase prediction market launch? A: While not officially confirmed, reports suggest an announcement could come as early as next week, with a platform rollout likely to follow. Q2: Is this like sports betting or gambling? A: While conceptually similar, prediction markets are often framed as financial instruments for hedging risk or speculating on event outcomes. Their legal status depends heavily on specific regulations in each country. Q3: Do I need a separate account from my regular Coinbase account? A: Details are pending, but it will likely be integrated into the existing Coinbase ecosystem, potentially requiring additional terms of service agreement. Q4: What can I trade on this new market? A: Expect contracts on events across finance, politics, sports, and technology, though the exact initial offerings will be revealed at launch. Q5: How is Kalshi involved? A: Coinbase is licensing technology and expertise from Kalshi, a regulated platform specializing in event contracts, to power its new prediction market. Q6: Will this be available worldwide? A: Initially, availability will almost certainly be limited to jurisdictions where such markets are explicitly legal, starting likely with the United States.

Sentiment remains fragile, and many traders have shifted into defensive positioning while awaiting clearer macro signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels According to a new report from CryptoQuant, however, the underlying picture is more complex than the price chart suggests. Despite the short-term decline, XRP whales are becoming increasingly active, showing no hesitation in trading and accumulating even as retail participation weakens. This divergence between whale behavior and market sentiment is noteworthy. Historically, XRP’s most significant recoveries have begun during phases of deep pessimism, when large holders quietly build exposure rather than chase rallies. The latest data confirms this pattern: while price approaches yearly lows, whale-driven transaction volume has risen, signaling that high-value wallets are repositioning rather than exiting. Whale Accumulation and CVD Shift Signal a Potential XRP Bottom The CryptoQuant report highlights that the recent surge in whale activity follows a pattern often observed during market bottoming phases. Large holders rarely accumulate aggressively during strong uptrends; instead, they tend to build positions quietly during periods of weakness, when sentiment is poor, and prices are depressed. Their willingness to buy in the current environment—while XRP trades near yearly lows—suggests strategic positioning rather than speculative momentum chasing. This behavior is typically interpreted as a pre-rally signal. When whales accumulate into weakness, it indicates confidence that current prices offer value and that the downside may be limited. Historically, such phases have preceded meaningful upside moves in XRP, as whale accumulation often absorbs available sell pressure and stabilizes market structure. Supporting this view, the report also points to a notable shift in the XRP Spot Taker CVD, which has turned taker-buy dominant. This means that aggressive buyers are now driving more of the executed volume, reflecting strengthening demand in real time. A taker-buy dominant CVD often emerges before sustained rallies, as it highlights increasing willingness among market participants to buy at the ask rather than wait for dips. Together, rising whale accumulation and a bullish CVD trend paint an increasingly constructive backdrop for XRP’s medium-term outlook.

Price remains pinned below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—indicating that bullish momentum has not yet returned. The persistent rejection at the 50-day moving average throughout November and December highlights the strength of overhead resistance and the absence of sustained buying pressure from the broader market. The $2.00 region, now acting as a key horizontal support, has been tested multiple times over the past month. Each retest shows reduced volatility, suggesting that sellers are no longer driving aggressive breakdown attempts. But demand remains too weak to generate a meaningful rebound. A decisive loss of this level could open the door toward the $1.80–$1.90 support zone. XRP previously consolidated during the early stages of the 2025 rally. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next Volume also confirms the broader downtrend. Selling spikes stand out noticeably, whereas buy-side volume remains muted. This imbalance reinforces the prevailing bearish structure, even as whale accumulation begins to appear on-chain. For XRP to shift out of this downtrend, bulls must reclaim the 50-day moving average and produce higher lows. Until then, the chart signals continued caution. Whale activity must begin translating into visible spot demand, or the risk skews to the downside.

A report from Digital Asset Solutions (DAS) highlights three main points behind this shift, tying the altcoin’s technical setup to Ripple’s work on stablecoins and regulated payment rails. Structural Edge For XRP Reports have disclosed that XRP offers several qualities that matter to companies moving money across borders. It settles fast, costs little to send, and works as a neutral bridge asset between different currencies. Ripple’s ledger is described as reliable and globally distributed, which is why some enterprises are testing it for predictable transfers. However, many firms still use RippleNet without using the crypto directly, so broad bank-level usage has not taken hold. DAS Research just laid out the clearest confirmation yet of where XRP is heading Their analysis shows XRP and Ripple are no longer competing in crypto.They are evolving into global payment infrastructure, the kind used by banks, fintechs, and cross border networks that… pic.twitter.com/ZwqUD68Qur — Stern Drew (@SternDrewCrypto) December 9, 2025 The research frames these features as the first major factor behind the digital asset’s potential role in global payment flows. The traits are real, but adoption varies and has not yet reached large commercial scale. Stablecoins And XRP Working Together Ripple plans to use RLUSD as a fiat-backed anchor while relying on the crypto to provide liquidity between different corridors. The concept is simple: Stablecoins maintain price stability tied to fiat, while XRP acts as the connector for moving value across currencies. This pairing is presented as the second major point in DAS Research’s findings. Ripple Prime, ZK-enabled identity tools, and licensing efforts are being built to meet compliance requirements from regulated institutions. Early RLUSD corridors have started to appear, but the level of real-world transaction volume remains small compared to the broader payments industry. Catalysts Forming In The Background The final point focuses on developments that analysts believe could help XRP move closer to regulated financial rails. RippleNet partnerships are growing, institutional custody services are improving, RLUSD integrations are underway, and conversations around possible ETF structures have emerged. Each of these adds some weight to the idea that XRP may gain a deeper role in payment systems in the future. Some of these steps are active today, while others remain early discussions. Custody upgrades, for example, are happening across the crypto sector, not only for the altcoin. While procedural steps like exchange listings and filings have progressed for multiple XRP ETF proposals, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet given formal approval to a spot XRP ETF. Even so, these developments show how Ripple is preparing for broader institutional use.

Managing over $185 billion, the firm advises investors to dedicate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This guidance signals a pivotal shift in how traditional finance views digital assets as essential components of a modern investment strategy. Why Is a Bitcoin Allocation Gaining Institutional Traction? Itaú Asset’s report, highlighted by Wu Blockchain, provides clear reasoning. The firm positions Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset but as a strategic hedge. Primarily, it can protect against local currency devaluation and geopolitical instability. For Brazilian investors, this is particularly relevant given the nation’s historical currency fluctuations. Therefore, a small Bitcoin allocation acts as a form of insurance, diversifying risk away from traditional markets. What Are the Core Benefits of This Strategy? Adopting a 1-3% Bitcoin allocation offers several key advantages for portfolio construction. First, it introduces non-correlated asset exposure. Bitcoin’s price movements often differ from stocks and bonds. Moreover, it provides a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, a concern for many economies. Finally, it offers asymmetric return potential—the small allocation limits downside risk while capturing significant upside. Portfolio Diversification: Reduces overall volatility through low correlation with traditional assets. Inflation Hedge: Serves as a digital store of value akin to ‘digital gold’. Strategic Positioning: Gains exposure to the growing digital asset ecosystem with controlled risk. How Should Investors Approach This Bitcoin Allocation? Itaú’s recommendation is precise for a reason. A 1-3% stake is significant enough to impact returns but small enough to prevent catastrophic loss. This balanced approach is crucial for risk-averse institutional and retail investors alike. Investors should consider dollar-cost averaging into this Bitcoin allocation to mitigate timing risk. Furthermore, secure storage in regulated custodians or cold wallets is non-negotiable for safeguarding assets. What Does This Mean for Global Crypto Adoption? Itaú Asset’s endorsement is a powerful signal. As a dominant player in Latin America’s largest economy, its move legitimizes Bitcoin for a vast audience. This could encourage other major financial institutions in emerging markets to follow suit. Consequently, we may see a wave of formal Bitcoin allocation recommendations worldwide, accelerating mainstream integration. In summary, Itaú Asset’s advice marks a mature phase for cryptocurrency investment. A strategic Bitcoin allocation is no longer a fringe concept but a calculated portfolio optimization tool recommended by giants of traditional finance. This pivot underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role from a speculative novelty to a recognized financial hedge, paving the way for broader institutional acceptance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Itaú Asset recommend specifically 1-3% for Bitcoin? This range is considered a ‘sweet spot’ in portfolio theory. It provides meaningful exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside while limiting the portfolio’s overall risk if the asset’s price becomes volatile. It’s a balanced entry point. Is this recommendation only for Brazilian investors? While the report originates from a Brazilian firm and addresses local currency risks, the core principle of using a small Bitcoin allocation for diversification and hedging is applicable to investors globally. Does this mean Bitcoin is now a ‘safe’ investment? No. Itaú’s report frames Bitcoin as a strategic hedge, not a safe asset. It remains volatile. The recommendation is for a limited allocation precisely to manage this inherent risk while seeking its unique benefits. How can an average investor implement this 1-3% allocation? Investors can start by calculating 1-3% of their total investment portfolio’s value. They can then purchase that amount in Bitcoin through regulated exchanges, potentially using dollar-cost averaging over time to build the position. What are the main risks of following this advice? Key risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility, regulatory changes, cybersecurity threats (like exchange hacks), and the potential for long-term technological obsolescence. The small allocation size is the primary risk-mitigation tool. Are other major asset managers making similar recommendations? Yes, several global firms have published research or offered products for client exposure. However, Itaú’s clear, direct recommendation to allocate a specific percentage is a significant and influential step, especially from a top-tier firm in a major emerging market.

This decision is more than a simple administrative note; it’s a powerful signal about the maturation and resilience of cryptocurrency-linked investments within traditional finance. For investors watching the convergence of crypto and mainstream markets, this news carries substantial weight. Let’s unpack what this continued inclusion truly means. What Does Staying in the Nasdaq 100 Index Actually Mean? The Nasdaq 100 index is a benchmark for the world’s leading non-financial companies. Inclusion is a badge of honor, representing liquidity, market capitalization, and corporate governance standards. Therefore, Strategy’s retention is a clear endorsement. It signals to institutional investors that the company meets rigorous listing criteria. Moreover, it provides continued exposure to a massive pool of passive investment funds, such as ETFs, that track the index. This steady demand can be a stabilizing force. Why Is This a Big Deal for the Crypto Ecosystem? Strategy’s presence in a major traditional index acts as a bridge. It allows conservative capital to gain indirect exposure to the crypto sector’s growth narrative. Think of it as a familiar on-ramp for institutional money. This decision, following a recent rebalancing period, suggests that despite market volatility, key players see long-term value. The benefits are multifaceted: Enhanced Legitimacy: Association with giants like Apple and Microsoft boosts credibility. Liquidity and Stability: Index fund buying creates consistent, non-speculative demand. Mainstream Awareness: It keeps cryptocurrency on the radar of a broader investor base. However, challenges remain. The company’s performance is still tied to crypto market sentiment, which can be unpredictable. What Are the Immediate Implications for Investors? For current and prospective investors, this is reassuring news. It reduces the near-term risk of a ‘de-indexing’ sell-off. The Nasdaq 100 index inclusion often correlates with lower volatility compared to purely crypto-native assets. Therefore, it can be viewed as a relatively stable component within a diversified crypto portfolio. The actionable insight here is clear: monitor how traditional market movements and index flows begin to influence crypto-correlated stocks, creating new intermarket dynamics to understand. Looking Ahead: A Lasting Partnership or Temporary Stay? The key question now is about longevity. Will Strategy become a permanent fixture in the Nasdaq 100 index , or is this a tentative relationship? The answer depends on sustained compliance with Nasdaq’s requirements and the overall health of the crypto industry. Continued innovation, regulatory clarity, and robust financials from Strategy will be critical. This development is a milestone, not the finish line. It underscores a trend where digital asset companies are increasingly evaluated by the same standards as their traditional counterparts. Conclusion: A Steady Hand in a Evolving Market Strategy’s confirmed place in the Nasdaq 100 index is a triumph for pragmatic crypto integration. It demonstrates resilience and provides a crucial link between two financial worlds. While not a guarantee against market downturns, it offers a layer of institutional validation and stability. For the astute observer, this move highlights the slow but steady weaving of cryptocurrency threads into the broader tapestry of global finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Nasdaq 100 index? A: The Nasdaq 100 is a stock market index of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It includes technology and growth giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Q2: Why does inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 matter for a crypto company? A: Inclusion grants immense legitimacy, ensures buying from index-tracking funds (providing stable demand), and exposes the company to a vast pool of traditional institutional investors. Q3: Could Strategy be removed from the index in the future? A: Yes. Companies are regularly evaluated. If Strategy fails to meet the index’s market cap, liquidity, or other listing requirements, it could be excluded in a future rebalancing. Q4: How does this affect the price of cryptocurrency itself? A: It has an indirect effect. It boosts overall sector sentiment and legitimacy, which can positively influence market confidence, but it does not directly dictate Bitcoin or Ethereum prices. Q5: Does this mean traditional finance is fully embracing crypto? A: It’s a significant step in that direction. It shows select crypto-linked entities are being judged by traditional metrics and deemed worthy of inclusion alongside blue-chip companies, signaling growing acceptance. Q6: Where can I find the official list of Nasdaq 100 components? A: The official and updated list is always available on the Nasdaq website’s official indexes section.

Blockchain analytics firm AmberCN reports that an address linked to major crypto investment firm Polychain Capital deposited a staggering 4.114 million PENDLE tokens to the institutional exchange FalconX. This move, completed just hours ago, has analysts scrutinizing the implications for both the investor and the PENDLE market. Let’s unpack what this Polychain Capital deposits PENDLE action means. What Does Polychain Capital’s PENDLE Deposit Reveal? The transaction itself is straightforward, but the context tells a deeper story. The wallet in question accumulated these PENDLE tokens over a six-month period between March and September. This suggests a strategic accumulation phase, possibly in anticipation of price appreciation. However, the recent deposit to FalconX, a platform known for facilitating large, often OTC (over-the-counter) trades, indicates a potential exit or repositioning strategy is now in motion. Why Is This Deposit So Consequential? The most striking detail is the reported financial implication. According to the data, if Polychain Capital were to sell the deposited assets at current market prices, it would realize an estimated loss of $3.25 million . This highlights the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments, even for sophisticated, institutional players. Several key questions arise from this situation: Motivation for the Move: Is this a loss-cutting measure, a portfolio rebalance, or preparation for a different financial instrument? Market Impact: Could a potential sale of this magnitude apply downward pressure on PENDLE’s price? Strategic Shift: Does this signal a changing thesis on the Pendle Finance protocol from a major backer? Understanding the PENDLE and FalconX Dynamic To grasp the full picture, it’s helpful to understand the players. PENDLE is the native token of Pendle Finance, a DeFi protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield. Polychain Capital is a well-known, early-stage crypto investment fund. FalconX is a prime brokerage and trading platform catering to institutions. Therefore, this Polychain Capital deposits PENDLE transaction isn’t a retail move; it’s an institutional-level action with potential market-wide signals. What Are the Potential Ripple Effects? While the deposit has occurred, a sale is not guaranteed. The tokens could be moved for collateral, lending, or other financial engineering purposes. However, the mere possibility of a large sell order can affect trader sentiment. Other market participants may front-run the anticipated move, leading to short-term price volatility. Furthermore, it puts a spotlight on the performance of DeFi asset tokens in the current market cycle and how even savvy investors navigate them. Key Takeaways from This Crypto Movement This event serves as a powerful case study in crypto investing. It underscores that due diligence and timing are critical, as even institutional giants can face substantial paper losses. It also demonstrates the transparency of blockchain, where such significant moves are publicly visible, allowing the entire market to analyze and react. In conclusion, the move by Polychain Capital to deposit millions of PENDLE tokens is a noteworthy event that blends on-chain analytics with market psychology. Whether it results in a finalized loss or a more complex strategic play, it reminds us that the crypto markets are a dynamic chessboard where every major move is watched and analyzed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Polychain Capital? A1: Polychain Capital is a prominent cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused investment firm that manages capital for institutional investors like endowments and foundations. Q2: What is PENDLE used for? A2: PENDLE is the governance and utility token for the Pendle Finance protocol, which allows users to separate and trade the future yield generated from their crypto assets. Q3: Why would Polychain deposit to FalconX? A3: FalconX is an institutional-grade exchange. The deposit could precede a large over-the-counter (OTC) sale, be used as collateral, or be part of a more complex financial transaction to manage their position. Q4: Does this mean PENDLE’s price will drop? A4: Not necessarily. A deposit is not a sale. However, the potential for a large sell order can influence market sentiment and cause short-term volatility as traders speculate. Q5: How was this transaction discovered? A5: Blockchain analytics firms like AmberCN monitor wallet activity of known entities. The transparency of public blockchains allows anyone to track large movements, though attributing wallets to specific companies involves analysis. Q6: What is the estimated loss based on? A6: The $3.25 million loss figure is an estimate comparing the likely average acquisition cost of the tokens (based on the accumulation period) against their current market value at the time of the deposit.

55714062,644492,1765594814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55714062.jpeg,Bitcoin On-Chain Signals Delay Bull Thesis: MVRV Model Projects Recovery Next Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-chain-signals-delay-bull-thesis-mvrv-model/,"Bitcoin has failed to reclaim higher prices, reinforcing the growing belief that the market may be entering a deeper bearish phase. After multiple attempts to push above key resistance levels, BTC continues to trade sideways with declining momentum, reflecting a clear shift in investor sentiment. Fear is rising across the market, and price action has yet to show any convincing signs of recovery. According to new data shared by Axel Adler, several structural on-chain and market indicators now support a continuation of bearish conditions in the months ahead. Adler’s analysis points to weakening demand, persistent sell pressure, and deteriorating liquidity—factors that historically precede prolonged corrective periods. While Bitcoin has held above critical support zones, its inability to establish higher highs or sustain rebounds suggests that buyers remain cautious and largely defensive. Moreover, broader market conditions show similar fragility, with derivatives positioning, stablecoin flows, and long-term holder behavior all signaling reduced conviction. This confluence of factors strengthens the bearish thesis and implies that volatility could intensify before the market finds a meaningful bottom. Bitcoin MVRV Spread Signals a Deep Bear Phase Adler’s analysis highlights one of the clearest structural indicators pointing toward sustained bearish conditions: the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Bull vs. Bear Market model. Specifically, he notes that the 30-day to 365-day MVRV spread is deeply negative and continues to deteriorate. This spread measures the difference in profitability between short-term and long-term holders, and when the short-term cohort is underperforming significantly, it traditionally signals risk aversion, exhaustion, and weakening demand. A crossover—when the 30-day MVRV rises above the 365-day metric—has historically marked the transition from bear markets into new bullish phases. However, Adler stresses that such a crossover does not appear imminent under current conditions. The spread remains far below the threshold required for a structural reversal, reinforcing the view that Bitcoin is still entrenched in a deep bear phase within this model’s framework. Cycle analogs further support this interpretation. Reviewing past market cycles, Adler estimates that the next likely window for a meaningful crossover sits in the second half of 2026. This implies that even if short-term rallies occur, they are more likely to be counter-trend bounces rather than the early stages of a sustainable bull market. Until the MVRV structure improves, broader sentiment may remain decisively bearish. Price Struggles to Recover Momentum Bitcoin continues to move sideways, reflecting a market that remains indecisive and structurally weak. The chart shows BTC trading near $92,000 after its sharp decline from the $120,000 region, with recent candles forming a tight consolidation range. This behavior typically signals a temporary stabilization phase rather than a confirmed reversal, especially given the broader bearish context highlighted by on-chain and macro indicators. The 50-day moving average sits well above the current price, acting as dynamic resistance and indicating that short-term momentum remains firmly bearish. Likewise, the 100-day and 200-day moving averages trend downward, creating a compression zone that BTC has yet to challenge. Until Bitcoin can reclaim these levels with conviction, rallies may continue to be faded by sellers. Despite the small rebound from sub-$90,000 levels, buying activity remains muted compared to the heavy sell volume that drove the initial breakdown. This suggests that demand is insufficient to absorb higher-timeframe selling pressure. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming lower highs and lower lows across the daily timeframe, reinforcing a downtrend. A decisive break below $90,000 would expose deeper liquidity zones near $86,000–$84,000. Conversely, reclaiming $96,000 would be the first sign of strength—but current price action shows no such momentum yet.

This significant cryptocurrency seizure highlights how authorities are adapting to investigate and recover digital funds in complex financial crimes. What Happened in This Cryptocurrency Seizure Case? Prosecutors in Florida recently confiscated $1.5 million worth of digital currencies from a suspect facing multiple charges. According to reports from Decrypt, the individual faces allegations of fraud, money laundering, and theft. The seized assets include several popular cryptocurrencies: SOL (Solana) AVAX (Avalanche) DOGE (Dogecoin) PEPE (Pepe) This case represents one of the larger cryptocurrency seizure operations in recent Florida history. It demonstrates how prosecutors are developing specialized skills to handle digital asset investigations. How Do Authorities Track Cryptocurrency in Fraud Cases? Many readers wonder how law enforcement can trace and seize cryptocurrency when it’s supposed to be anonymous. The reality is more complex than popular belief. Blockchain technology actually creates a permanent, public record of all transactions. Investigators use sophisticated tools to analyze these transaction histories. They look for patterns that connect digital wallets to real-world identities. When suspects convert cryptocurrency to traditional currency through regulated exchanges, they create additional paper trails that authorities can follow. This cryptocurrency seizure case likely involved: Blockchain analysis software Cooperation with cryptocurrency exchanges Traditional financial investigation techniques Search warrants for digital evidence Why Is This Cryptocurrency Seizure Significant? This case matters for several important reasons. First, it shows that law enforcement agencies are becoming more proficient at investigating cryptocurrency-related crimes. The successful cryptocurrency seizure of $1.5 million sends a clear message to potential fraudsters. Second, the variety of seized assets is noteworthy. The inclusion of both established cryptocurrencies like Solana and meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe demonstrates that authorities are tracking multiple blockchain networks. This comprehensive approach strengthens their ability to investigate complex fraud schemes. Third, this cryptocurrency seizure reinforces that digital assets are not beyond the reach of the law. As regulatory frameworks evolve, prosecutors are gaining more tools and precedents for handling such cases effectively. What Challenges Do Prosecutors Face with Cryptocurrency Seizures? Despite this successful operation, cryptocurrency seizures present unique challenges. The decentralized nature of blockchain networks means assets can move across borders instantly. Different jurisdictions have varying regulations regarding digital assets. Storage and security of seized cryptocurrency also requires specialized knowledge. Unlike physical assets, digital currencies need proper wallet management and security protocols to prevent loss or theft during legal proceedings. Moreover, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency values adds complexity. The $1.5 million cryptocurrency seizure represents a snapshot in time – the actual value when assets are liquidated may differ significantly. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investors? For legitimate cryptocurrency investors, this case offers both reassurance and important reminders. The successful cryptocurrency seizure demonstrates that authorities can protect investors from fraud. However, it also highlights the importance of: Conducting thorough due diligence before investing Using regulated platforms for transactions Keeping detailed records of all cryptocurrency activities Reporting suspicious schemes to appropriate authorities As the regulatory landscape evolves, transparency and compliance become increasingly important for all participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Era of Digital Asset Enforcement The Florida cryptocurrency seizure case marks an important development in financial crime investigation. It proves that law enforcement can effectively track, seize, and secure digital assets in fraud cases. This growing capability benefits legitimate investors while creating stronger deterrents against cryptocurrency-related crimes. As authorities continue to develop expertise in blockchain analysis, we can expect more sophisticated investigations and recoveries. The $1.5 million cryptocurrency seizure serves as both a warning to potential fraudsters and reassurance to investors that the digital asset space is becoming more secure through proper enforcement. Frequently Asked Questions How did Florida prosecutors find the cryptocurrency? Prosecutors likely used blockchain analysis tools to trace transactions from the fraud scheme to digital wallets controlled by the suspect. They probably obtained cooperation from cryptocurrency exchanges and used traditional investigation methods to connect digital identities to real persons. Can cryptocurrency really be seized if it’s decentralized? Yes, authorities can seize cryptocurrency by gaining control of the private keys to digital wallets. While blockchain networks are decentralized, the access points (wallets and exchanges) can be identified and secured through legal processes. What happens to seized cryptocurrency? Seized cryptocurrency is typically held in secure wallets controlled by law enforcement or court-appointed custodians. After legal proceedings conclude, the assets may be liquidated, with proceeds often going to victims or government funds, depending on the case specifics. Will this affect legitimate cryptocurrency users? Legitimate users following regulations and best practices have little to worry about. These enforcement actions primarily target illegal activities. In fact, successful prosecutions can make the cryptocurrency ecosystem safer for all participants. How common are cryptocurrency seizures? Cryptocurrency seizures are becoming increasingly common as law enforcement agencies develop specialized capabilities. While still representing a small percentage of overall asset seizures, their frequency is growing alongside cryptocurrency adoption. What should I do if I suspect cryptocurrency fraud? Report your concerns to the appropriate authorities, including the SEC for investment fraud or the FBI for broader financial crimes. Provide as much documentation as possible, including transaction IDs, wallet addresses, and communication records. Found this analysis of the Florida cryptocurrency seizure helpful?

This wave of crypto liquidations wasn’t a balanced affair—it was a targeted assault on traders betting on higher prices. If you’re active in futures trading or simply watching market volatility, understanding this event is crucial for navigating the turbulent waters ahead. What Sparked This Frenzy of Crypto Liquidations? Perpetual futures markets allow traders to use high leverage, amplifying both gains and losses. When prices move sharply against these leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close them to prevent further loss—a process known as liquidation. The past day saw a perfect storm of selling pressure trigger a cascade of these forced closures. The data reveals a clear narrative: the overwhelming majority of traders caught in this squeeze were optimistic, holding long positions. Let’s break down the staggering numbers from the last 24 hours: Ethereum (ETH): Led the carnage with $114 million liquidated. A shocking 92.93% of these were long positions. Bitcoin (BTC): Followed with $73.77 million wiped out. Here, 90.55% were traders betting on a price rise. Solana (SOL): Saw $25.24 million in liquidations, with longs making up 80.82% of the total. Why Were Long Positions So Vulnerable? This lopsided damage points to a sudden and significant price drop across major assets. When the market turns bearish swiftly, those using leverage to buy (go long) get hit first and hardest. Their positions fall in value faster than their collateral can cover, triggering automatic sell orders from the exchange. This selling can then fuel further price declines, potentially creating a negative feedback loop. Therefore, a high concentration of crypto liquidations in one direction is often a strong indicator of a sharp, sentiment-driven correction. How Can Traders Navigate Future Liquidation Storms? While market volatility is inevitable, there are actionable steps to manage risk. First, use leverage cautiously . Higher leverage means a smaller price move can wipe you out. Second, always employ stop-loss orders . These allow you to define your maximum loss in advance, rather than relying on an exchange’s liquidation engine. Third, monitor funding rates . Extremely high positive rates can signal overcrowded long trades, which often precede a flush-out. Understanding these mechanics is key to surviving periods of intense crypto liquidations . The Bigger Picture: What Do Mass Liquidations Signal? Events like this serve as a stark reminder of the market’s inherent risk. They can quickly wash out over-leveraged speculators and reset leverage levels across the board. Sometimes, this cleansing can even lay the foundation for a more stable price move afterward. However, for the traders involved, it’s a painful lesson in risk management. The scale of these crypto liquidations shows how quickly sentiment can shift and how important it is to trade with a plan, not just a prediction. In summary, the $213 million liquidation event was a dramatic demonstration of market forces at work. It highlighted the dangers of excessive leverage during volatile swings and underscored the dominance of long positions in the recent market structure. For savvy participants, such events offer critical lessons on position sizing and the importance of defensive strategies to protect capital when the tide turns suddenly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because it has lost too much value and can no longer cover the potential loss. This happens to protect the exchange from the trader going into debt. Why were mostly long positions liquidated? This indicates a sharp price drop. Long positions profit when prices rise. A sudden fall causes these leveraged buys to lose value rapidly, hitting their liquidation price faster than short positions (which profit from falls). Do large liquidations mean the market will crash? Not necessarily. While they signal high volatility and pain for leveraged traders, large-scale liquidations can sometimes reduce overall market leverage, potentially leading to a period of consolidation or even a rebound once the forced selling is over. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set prudent stop-loss orders manually, and ensure you have sufficient collateral (margin) in your account to withstand normal market fluctuations without hitting your liquidation price. What is a long position? A long position is a trade where you buy an asset expecting its price to increase. You profit if the market goes up. In futures trading, you can use leverage to amplify a long position’s potential gains and losses. Where can I track liquidation data? Several analytics websites like Coinglass provide real-time data on crypto liquidations across exchanges, broken down by cryptocurrency, long/short ratio, and time frames.

Fear and uncertainty continue to dominate as several analysts warn that the broader trend may still point toward a potential bear market. Yet, beneath the volatile price action, key on-chain data is revealing a development that could shape Ethereum’s next major phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Refuse to Sell: Historic Signal Emerges As Binance CDD Drops To 2017 Levels According to a new report from CryptoQuant, a historic signal tied to the realized price of whales holding more than 100,000 ETH has emerged once again. This metric, which tracks the average cost basis of the largest holders, has only been tested a handful of times over the past five years. Each instance occurred during decisive turning points in Ethereum’s macro trend. Whenever ETH approached or traded near this realized price, it signaled either the exhaustion of a deep downtrend or the beginning of a strong recovery phase. Today, Ethereum is once again hovering near this critical threshold. With analysts divided and sentiment weakening, the whale realized price has become one of the most important indicators to monitor. Whether ETH bounces or breaks here may determine the direction of the next major trend cycle. Whale Realized Price as a Cycle-Defining Threshold The CryptoQuant report highlights the significance of Ethereum’s proximity to the realized price of whales holding at least 100,000 ETH. According to the analysis, ETH has traded very close to this level only four times in the last five years. Two of those instances occurred during the capitulation phase of the 2022 bear market, when selling pressure peaked, and long-term confidence was severely tested. The other two have happened this year, underscoring how unusual and cycle-defining the current environment has become. What makes this metric particularly important is its historical reliability. In the past five years, Ethereum has never traded below the realized price of these mega-whales. This level has consistently acted as a structural floor, signaling areas where the largest and most sophisticated holders refuse to sell at a loss. Their behavior often marks moments of deep undervaluation or macro exhaustion within the market. Today, that realized price sits near the $2,500 range, placing Ethereum within striking distance of a level that has repeatedly separated long-term accumulation zones from full-scale trend reversals. If ETH holds above this threshold, it would reinforce the idea that large holders still see long-term value—despite fear dominating broader market sentiment.

After rebounding from the sub-$2,900 zone, ETH has reclaimed the $3,200 level and is currently trading near $3,238. While this bounce reflects short-term strength, the broader trend remains fragile. The price is encountering the 50-day moving average, which has acted as dynamic resistance throughout the decline from September’s peak. ETH briefly pierced above it but failed to secure a strong close, signaling hesitation from buyers. Related Reading: The Whale Who Can’t Stop Buying: BitcoinOG Scales Ethereum Long To $280M After Price Surge The 100-day and 200-day moving averages remain well above the current price, reinforcing that Ethereum is still operating beneath major trend markers. These moving averages are likely to form an overhead cluster of resistance between $3,400 and $3,600—an area where sellers previously overwhelmed bullish attempts. Structurally, ETH is forming a potential higher low, but it has not yet produced a higher high—an essential condition for confirming a trend reversal. A clean breakout above $3,350 would strengthen bullish momentum. Conversely, losing $3,150 risks reopening a path toward $3,000 and potentially retesting deeper support levels.

Unrealized Loss Has Spiked In The Crypto Sector After Bearish Price Action In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared the data related to the Unrealized Loss in the crypto sector. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of loss that investors are holding on their tokens right now. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each token on a given network to find what price it was last moved at. If this last selling price of a token was less than the current spot price of the asset, then that particular coin is assumed to be underwater. The exact amount of the loss involved with the token is equal to the difference between the two prices. The Unrealized Loss sums up this value for all coins being held at a loss. Like the Unrealized Loss, there also exists the Unrealized Profit , keeping track of the supply of the opposite type. That is, it accounts for the coins with a cost basis lower than the latest spot price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Unrealized Loss for the combined crypto market and Bitcoin over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Unrealized Loss across the crypto market has surged following the downturn that the sector has gone through since October. At its peak, the indicator hit a value of $350 billion for the entire market, with Bitcoin alone contributing about $85 billion. These are both elevated levels and showcase the degree of pain among the investors. Glassnode explained: With multiple on-chain indicators signalling shrinking liquidity across the board, the market is likely entering a high-volatility regime in the weeks ahead. In some other news, Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown strong divergence in the Exchange Netflow trend this week, as institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora has pointed out in an X post . As is visible above, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow registered a significant value of -$1.34 billion over the past week. The value being negative implies centralized exchanges faced net withdrawals. In contrast, the same indicator has witnessed a sharp positive value of $1.03 billion for Ethereum instead. Usually, investors deposit to exchanges when they want to participate in one of the services that they provide, which can include selling. As such, large exchange net inflows can be bearish for the asset’s price.

Valued at approximately $205 million, this single Bitcoin whale transaction is more than just a large number on a screen; it’s a significant event that sends ripples through the entire market. But what does a move of this magnitude actually mean for the average investor and the future of Bitcoin’s price? Let’s dive deep into the implications. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Whale Transaction Tell Us? Firstly, the sheer size of this Bitcoin whale transaction confirms that large-scale players, often called ‘whales,’ remain highly active. These entities hold enough Bitcoin to influence market sentiment and, potentially, price direction with their moves. The transfer to Antpool, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pools, is particularly intriguing. It could signal several strategic intentions from the anonymous holder. Strategic Accumulation or Storage: The whale might be moving funds into a custodial service associated with the pool for safekeeping. Preparing for Action: This could be a preparatory move for other financial activities, like using the Bitcoin as collateral for a loan. Institutional Movement: The unknown wallet could belong to a large fund or institution rebalancing its assets. Therefore, while the exact reason is private, the transaction’s visibility acts as a powerful market thermometer. How Do Whale Transactions Impact Bitcoin’s Price? You might wonder if a single Bitcoin whale transaction can really move the market. The direct answer is complex. A transfer between wallets doesn’t automatically mean the coins are being sold on an exchange. However, the psychological impact is immediate and real. Large movements often create a sense of anticipation or anxiety among traders. For example, a transfer to a known exchange wallet can spark fears of an impending sell-off, potentially leading to short-term price dips. Conversely, a move from an exchange to a private ‘cold’ wallet is typically seen as a long-term holding (or ‘HODLing’) signal, which can boost bullish sentiment. In this case, moving to a mining pool is a nuanced action that experts watch closely for clues about broader market strategy. Why Should Everyday Crypto Investors Pay Attention? Monitoring Bitcoin whale transaction activity isn’t just for analysts. For the everyday investor, it provides crucial context. Think of it as watching the trading activity of a company’s largest shareholders. Their confidence or caution can be a leading indicator. Actionable Insight: Don’t panic-sell based on one large transaction. Instead, use it as one data point among many. Look for patterns. Are multiple whales moving coins? Is the flow generally towards exchanges (potentially bearish) or away from them (potentially bullish)? This context helps you make informed decisions rather than emotional ones. Decoding the Antpool Connection The destination—Antpool—adds another layer. As a major mining pool, Antpool is a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s network security. A whale choosing to interact directly with a miner could be related to over-the-counter (OTC) trading deals, which are private sales that don’t affect the public order books. This method is preferred by large holders to avoid causing slippage and visible market disruption. This Bitcoin whale transaction highlights the sophisticated, behind-the-scenes infrastructure that supports the crypto economy. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Whale Activity In summary, the $205 million Bitcoin whale transaction to Antpool is a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate. It underscores Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class where institutional-grade movements are commonplace. For savvy investors, the key takeaway is vigilance. Understanding the potential motives behind such transfers empowers you to separate market noise from meaningful signals. Remember, in the volatile seas of cryptocurrency, informed observation is your most valuable asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a ‘Bitcoin whale’? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of Bitcoin that their transaction activity has the potential to influence the market price. Q2: How can I track whale transactions myself? You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or dedicated alert services like Whale Alert on social media platforms, which report large transactions in real-time. Q3: Does a whale moving Bitcoin always mean they are selling? No, not at all. A transfer between wallets is just a movement. It only indicates a potential sale if the coins are sent to a known deposit address of a cryptocurrency exchange. Q4: Why is the transaction public if the wallet is ‘unknown’? Bitcoin’s blockchain is transparent. While wallet addresses are pseudonymous (not directly linked to a real-world identity), all transaction amounts and addresses are publicly visible on the ledger. Q5: What is Antpool? Antpool is one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools in the world, where multiple miners combine their computational power to increase the chance of earning block rewards, which are then shared. Q6: Should I change my investment strategy when I see a large whale move? Avoid making impulsive strategy changes based on a single event.

Sacks argues that the administration is only focused on pushing back on the “most onerous examples of state regulation” while listing reasons such a move is needed for continued innovation in the AI industry. David Sacks defends Trump on AI Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” aimed at establishing a unified federal regulatory framework for AI on Thursday. The move seeks to preempt or override state-level AI regulations, which the administration views as a “patchwork” that burdens companies and discourages U.S. competitiveness, particularly against China. However, it has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, some states, and AI safety advocates, who argue it strips away essential consumer protections without providing immediate federal replacements. Sacks disagrees, saying the move, which involves developing with Congress a common standard for oversight of the emerging technology, is more about easing a growing compliance burden for companies than anything else. Right now, AI model development is taking place across multiple states, all with their own regulatory standards. Sacks highlighted that as an issue. He acknowledged that the U.S. is currently leading China where AI is concerned, but that innovation could fall behind if forced to comply with a patchwork of conflicting AI rules emerging across all 50 states. While speaking on Fox Business’ “Mornings with Maria”, he said , “If you have to report to 50 different state regulators at 50 different times with 50 different definitions, it’s extremely onerous. And it’s going to slow down innovation, and it’s going to hinder our progress in the AI race.” “So if we want to stay in the lead, as President Trump has declared, we need to have a single national standard, one standard for AI, so that the most onerous states, the most draconian ones, can’t hold you up,” he added. “We want to work with Congress on this.” Until a national standard is in place, Sacks claims the administration is prepared to push back against what it sees as excessively restrictive state regulations. Some states will not accept the order without a fight The order is widely expected to face legal challenges, especially from states with provisions already in place. Many of these states are expected to treat the order as a case of federal overreach as it affects their respective abilities to govern technology within their borders. California State Senator Scott Wiener has already drawn the battle lines. “It’s absurd for Trump to think he can weaponize the DOJ and Commerce to undermine those state rights,” Wiener said in a statement. “If the Trump Administration tries to enforce this ridiculous order, we will see them in court.” Democratic U.S. Senator Brian Schatz has also shared plans to draft legislation that would seek a full repeal of the order. “Embracing the amazing possibilities of AI can’t come at the cost of leaving Americans vulnerable to its profound risks, which is exactly what this executive order does,” Schatz said. “Congress has a responsibility to get this technology right – and quickly – but states must be allowed to act in the public interest in the meantime.” Meanwhile, Sacks has said the provision that calls on the Justice Department to sue states over AI rules will only go after the most burdensome regulations. While he expressed uncertainty about whether the administration would seek to challenge California or New York, he singled out a law in Colorado seeking to prohibit algorithmic discrimination and tagged it “probably the most excessive.” Trump resorted to the executive order because White House officials and Republican lawmakers reportedly refused to include similar legislation preempting state AI laws in a must-pass defense bill earlier this month. The order calls for Sacks and other administration officials to work with Congress on legislation for a “minimally burdensome national standard.” Unfortunately, it has come at a time when more state lawmakers have started expressing an eagerness to impose some rules of the road on the ever-growing AI sector. Experts foresee complications, as any state passing legislation would face potential conflict with the White House.

ChatGPT Makes Worrying PI Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/will-pi-networks-price-tumble-to-new-atl-next-week-chatgpt-makes-worrying-pi-predictions/,"Despite the latest developments and new updates around the project behind the token, PI has lost the momentum that started in October and lasted for most of November. At the time, most of the cryptocurrency market was sliding hard, including massive double-digit price declines from the largest of the bunch. However, PI managed to defy the overall crash and even surged from around $0.23 to over $0.28 at one point. This stability has faded as the broader market recovered the early Q4 losses, and PI is close to breaking below $0.20 as of press time. Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT about its view on the matter for the week ahead. New ATL? The aforementioned PI revival was most likely linked to recent updates in the Pi Network ecosystem, including new AI integrations and upgrades to the blockchain itself. Now, though, the asset sees itself struggling to remain above $0.20, which, according to ChatGPT’s analysis, is the first major support on its way to the early October ATL of $0.172 (CoinGecko data). If it falls, the next and final one is situated at $0.18-$0.19. If that one gives in, then the path toward a new low becomes wide open, which is why the AI solution described the current trend as “short-term bearish” as the overall PI momentum is weakening. It also warned that the volume is declining, which suggests “seller dominance and weak demand” before it added: “When assets approach an all-time low with low liquidity and falling volume, volatility tends to spike sharply.” The only positive here is the momentum indicators, which show that PI has neared oversold conditions, but “not yet at a clear reversal zone.” Most Likely Scenario? The popular AI platform warned that PI’s worst-case scenario for the week ahead would be a drop to $0.16 if the $0.18 support falls, which would essentially mean a new all-time low. The bear case is also supported by the large number of tokens to be unlocked in the following month, which is over 180 million (or roughly 6 million per day). The bull scenario, which ChatGPT categorized as the least likely, would be a breakout above $0.21 and a surge toward $0.25. However, the most anticipated case for OpenAI’s solution is a more sideways move at around $0.18 and $0.21. “PI is entering a critical phase. The token remains only a few percentage points above its all-time low, and without a swift resurgence in demand, a retest of $0.172 appears increasingly likely. Whether bulls can defend this level will determine if PI stabilizes — or enters a new bearish chapter,” concluded ChatGPT. The post Will Pi Network’s Price Tumble to New ATL Next Week?

These assets may include sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and a range of commodity reserves such as oil, gas, metals, and other raw materials. Related Reading: Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism The country’s finance ministry, Muhammad Aurangzeb, indicated that while the initiative could involve assets valued at up to $2 billion, final approval is still pending. The goal is to improve liquidity, transparency, and access to international markets for these assets. Aurangzeb remarked that the memorandum of understanding signifies Pakistan’s commitment to a reform-oriented economic trajectory and establishes a long-term partnership with Binance. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao expressed optimism about the agreement, calling it “a great signal for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan.” He suggested that this partnership marks the beginning of a significant shift toward fully implementing the tokenisation initiative. PVARA Provides Initial Clearance For Binance And HTX In addition to this MoU, Pakistan has granted initial clearance for Binance and cryptocurrency exchange HTX, to register with local regulators as part of their efforts to establish domestic subsidiaries. This step allows both companies to prepare applications for full exchange licenses. The Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) provided these early approvals after assessing the governance and compliance frameworks of both platforms. Chairman Bilal bin Saqib indicated that these clearances initiate Pakistan’s phased licensing process, emphasizing that the strength of compliance will play a crucial role in determining which exchanges will proceed. This move comes as Pakistan accelerates its digital finance overhaul, which has included the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council and the establishment of the PVARA, alongside the drafting of a formal licensing regime.

These NOCs let the exchanges connect to Pakistan’s AML systems and coordinate with the Securities and Exchange Commission to set up regulated subsidiaries. That review was described as part of a phased licensing system meant to align local rules with global standards. Partnerships And Local Players Move Fast Local payments firms and government bodies are being brought into talks. One public statement from a Pakistan-based payments group said the aim is to study how regulated virtual-asset access could expand financial services for ordinary users, while keeping track of risks. Commercial ties like these could speed up customer access if full regulatory approval follows. How Big Is Pakistan’s Crypto Scene? Based on reports, Pakistan ranks third globally in retail crypto activity. That ranking has helped push the authorities to build a formal regime quickly. Officials say the new framework will be backed by a Virtual Assets Act and other measures, including plans for a pilot central bank digital currency and closer work on stablecoins. The intent is to bring trading and payments under clearer oversight while attracting compliant investment. What Comes Next Binance and HTX must still meet full licensing conditions before they can offer trading to the public. The NOCs are an opening move. Full permissions will depend on how well each firm satisfies the regulator’s detailed checks and how the proposed Virtual Assets Act is implemented. Markets may react to progress on tokenization and any future licensing milestones, but for now the country has signaled a clear shift from informal activity to regulated market access.

However, the story behind this number is even more revealing: the entire inflow was powered by just one fund. This event highlights a pivotal moment for spot Bitcoin ETF adoption, showing where institutional and retail investor confidence is truly concentrated. What Does a $50.4M Net Inflow for Spot Bitcoin ETFs Really Mean? Data from TraderT shows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products collectively attracted $50.41 million in new capital. A net inflow indicates that more money entered these funds than left them, which is generally seen as a bullish signal for Bitcoin. It suggests investors are choosing to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price through these regulated, exchange-traded products rather than selling their holdings. However, the breakdown of this total tells a more nuanced and powerful story about current market dynamics. BlackRock’s IBIT: The Sole Engine of Growth Digging deeper into the numbers uncovers a stunning fact. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only spot Bitcoin ETF to report a net inflow that day, drawing in $52.37 million. This means that without IBIT’s performance, the entire ETF category would have seen a net outflow. BlackRock’s dominance raises several key questions: Why is investor preference so heavily skewed toward one provider? Does this signal a ‘flight to quality’ where investors trust the largest, most established asset manager? What challenges does this create for other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers? This lopsided inflow underscores the immense brand power and distribution network that traditional finance giants like BlackRock bring to the crypto space. The Other Side of the Coin: Fidelity’s Outflow and Stagnant Peers While BlackRock shone, the data presented a different picture for its competitors. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) experienced a small net outflow of $1.96 million. Perhaps more tellingly, every other U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF reported zero net flows for the day. This stagnation suggests a highly competitive landscape where a few leaders are beginning to separate from the pack. For investors, it highlights the importance of looking beyond the overall category headline to understand which specific funds are capturing—or losing—market share. Why Should You Care About Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows? Tracking these daily inflows and outflows is more than just a numbers game. It provides a transparent, real-time window into institutional sentiment toward Bitcoin. Consistent net inflows into a spot Bitcoin ETF can indicate growing mainstream adoption and act as a sustained source of buying pressure for Bitcoin itself. Conversely, outflows can signal profit-taking or shifting risk appetite. For any market participant, these flows are a crucial piece of the puzzle for gauging market health and trend direction. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What can you learn from this single day’s data? First, recognize that the spot Bitcoin ETF market is maturing and becoming stratified. Leadership is consolidating. Second, consider what fund attributes—like low fees, issuer reputation, or liquidity—are driving these investment decisions. Finally, use this data as one of many tools, not a sole indicator. Pair flow analysis with broader market trends, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors to build a complete investment thesis. The Final Verdict: A Market Defining Its Leaders The December 12th flow data delivers a clear, compelling message. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF landscape is no longer a story of uniform growth. It is a story of divergence, where BlackRock has emerged as a dominant force capable of single-handedly pushing the entire category into positive territory. This signals a critical phase in the product’s lifecycle, moving from initial adoption to a battle for market share where brand, trust, and scale become decisive factors. For the future of Bitcoin adoption, the health and competition within this ETF arena will be a trend to watch closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a net inflow in a spot Bitcoin ETF? A net inflow occurs when the amount of new money invested into the ETF shares exceeds the amount redeemed or sold on a given day. It means the fund is growing in assets under management. Why was BlackRock’s IBIT the only ETF with an inflow? This could be due to BlackRock’s unparalleled brand recognition in traditional finance, its massive client network, or specific marketing efforts. Investors may perceive it as the safest or most credible option. Is a net outflow from an ETF like Fidelity’s FBTC a bad sign? Not necessarily from a single day’s data. A small outflow could represent routine profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing. It becomes a concern only if it develops into a sustained trend. How do ETF flows affect Bitcoin’s price? When a spot ETF has a net inflow, the issuer must typically buy an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin to back the new shares. This creates direct buying pressure in the market, which can support or increase the price. Where can I find daily spot Bitcoin ETF flow data? Data is compiled by several analytics firms and shared publicly on financial news websites and social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). TraderT is one well-known source. Should I invest only in the ETF with the largest inflows? Not based solely on that metric. Consider the fund’s expense ratio, liquidity (trading volume), the reputation of the issuer, and how it fits your overall investment strategy.

The claim suggests that increased market distribution of XRP through Ripple’s sales could ultimately support higher long-term value. Although this view runs against traditional expectations, it is grounded in specific ideas about adoption, liquidity, and the role of circulating supply. Understanding the reasoning behind the claim requires examining each part of the argument and the conditions under which it may hold. I am going to say this, and it might give you cognitive dissonance. The more XRP Ripple sells into the market, the higher the XRP price will be in the long term. In other words, the less XRP Ripple has in escrow, the higher the price of XRP. The reason is simple: the more XRP… — BD (@DiepSanh) December 11, 2025 The Core Statement BD’s position is that wider distribution of XRP, including reductions in Ripple’s escrow balance, can benefit the asset’s long-term price trajectory. The idea is that increased circulation facilitates accessibility, enabling XRP to be used in more environments, which could ultimately strengthen the ecosystem over time. In this view, distributing XRP more evenly across the market helps build a foundation for usage rather than concentrating supply in a single holder’s reserves. How Distribution Connects to Utility The argument relies on the assumption that newly released XRP contributes to real utility. When additional XRP enters the market and is used for institutional liquidity , payment flows, or settlement activity, it can create recurring demand. Greater liquidity also enables more efficient movement of value across services, which may encourage further integration by enterprises and financial platforms. If this expanded participation leads to sustained usage, the effect of increased distribution could shift from purely supply-driven dynamics to utility-driven growth. The Role of Escrow and Market Confidence Another component of the claim is the suggestion that a lower remaining escrow balance can indirectly support price by reducing perceived future selling pressure. While markets already have visibility into the escrow schedule, some investors may view a diminishing reserve as a positive signal. However, this effect is dependent on how market participants interpret the change and whether it meaningfully alters expectations about long-term issuance and liquidity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Understanding Velocity in Context BD’s argument refers to increased velocity as a factor that enhances adoption. Velocity alone does not automatically lead to higher prices, as rapid movement of an asset can reflect speculative activity rather than utility. For velocity to contribute to long-term value , it must be tied to genuine transactional use that requires stable liquidity. In such cases, the movement of XRP supports practical functions rather than short-term trading, and this form of demand can have a more constructive impact on price. BD’s claim is technically possible under specific circumstances, but it is not universally applicable. Increased distribution can support long-term value only when it leads to broader usage, deeper liquidity, and sustained demand that outweighs the effect of added supply. Reduced escrow may contribute to market confidence, but it does not guarantee appreciation on its own. The overall validity of the argument depends on how newly distributed XRP is used and whether that usage forms the basis for real, lasting adoption.

The latest data reveals a concerning trend: US spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net outflow of $19.44 million on December 12th. This marks the second consecutive day of withdrawals, raising questions about short-term investor sentiment toward these popular funds. What’s Driving the Spot Ethereum ETFs Outflow? According to data from TraderT, the outflow wasn’t uniform across all funds. In fact, BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) actually saw an inflow of $23.21 million. However, this positive movement was completely overshadowed by significant withdrawals from other major players. Grayscale’s Mini ETH experienced a $22.10 million outflow, while their ETHE fund lost $14.41 million. Fidelity’s FETH also contributed to the trend with a $6.14 million withdrawal. This pattern suggests that while some investors remain confident in specific spot Ethereum ETFs, overall sentiment has turned cautious. The consecutive days of net outflows indicate this isn’t just a one-day anomaly but potentially a developing trend worth monitoring closely. Why Should Investors Care About These Movements? Spot Ethereum ETFs represent a significant bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. When these funds experience consistent outflows, it often signals broader market sentiment shifts. Here are three key implications: Price pressure potential: Large outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs can create selling pressure on the underlying Ethereum assets Institutional sentiment indicator: These movements often reflect how larger, institutional investors view Ethereum’s near-term prospects Market confidence barometer: Consistent outflows may indicate declining confidence in Ethereum’s immediate price trajectory However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The cryptocurrency market experiences regular fluctuations, and two days of outflows don’t necessarily define a long-term trend. Many factors influence these movements, including broader market conditions, profit-taking behavior, and portfolio rebalancing. How Do Spot Ethereum ETFs Actually Work? For those new to cryptocurrency investing, spot Ethereum ETFs provide exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without requiring investors to directly purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves. These funds hold actual Ethereum tokens, and their shares trade on traditional stock exchanges. This structure offers several advantages: Regulatory oversight and investor protections Familiar trading through brokerage accounts No need for cryptocurrency wallets or private keys Integration with traditional retirement and investment accounts The recent outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs highlight how these products respond to market dynamics just like traditional investment vehicles. The varying performance between different providers’ funds also demonstrates that not all spot Ethereum ETFs are created equal—investor preferences and fund specifics matter. What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future? While two days of outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs might seem alarming, experienced cryptocurrency investors understand that market sentiment can shift rapidly. Several factors could reverse this trend: Positive regulatory developments for Ethereum Stronger-than-expected network adoption metrics Broader cryptocurrency market recovery Institutional announcements favoring Ethereum The current situation with spot Ethereum ETFs serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investing requires both patience and perspective. Short-term movements, while important to monitor, don’t necessarily predict long-term outcomes. The fundamental value proposition of Ethereum—as a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts—remains unchanged by these temporary fund flows. Ultimately, the spot Ethereum ETFs outflow data provides valuable insight into current market psychology. It shows that some investors are taking profits or reducing exposure amid uncertainty. However, the simultaneous inflow into BlackRock’s fund suggests other investors see this as a buying opportunity. This divergence of opinion is what makes markets function, and it’s why monitoring spot Ethereum ETFs remains crucial for understanding broader cryptocurrency trends. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Ethereum ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum tokens. They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to directly purchase or store cryptocurrency. Why are spot Ethereum ETFs experiencing outflows? The recent outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs likely reflect short-term profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or cautious sentiment amid market uncertainty. Different funds experienced varying flows, indicating diverse investor strategies. Do spot Ethereum ETF outflows affect Ethereum’s price? Yes, significant outflows from spot Ethereum ETFs can create selling pressure on the underlying Ethereum assets, potentially affecting market prices. However, many other factors also influence Ethereum’s price movements. Which spot Ethereum ETF performed best during this period? BlackRock’s ETHA actually saw an inflow of $23.21 million during the reported period, while Grayscale’s funds experienced the largest outflows. Should I be concerned about investing in spot Ethereum ETFs? Like all investments, spot Ethereum ETFs carry risk. The recent outflows highlight market volatility but don’t necessarily indicate long-term problems. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. How often should I monitor spot Ethereum ETF flows? While daily flows provide interesting data points, most investors benefit from focusing on weekly or monthly trends rather than reacting to daily movements, unless they are active traders.

This movement represents substantial value leaving a transparent, institutional platform for complete privacy. Blockchain analysts immediately began speculating about the purpose behind this transfer. Could this be an institutional investor repositioning assets? Perhaps it’s a mining pool consolidating funds, or maybe even preparation for a major market move. The timing of any large Bitcoin transaction always matters, especially when it involves nine figures worth of cryptocurrency. Why Do Unknown Wallet Transactions Matter? When Bitcoin moves to an unknown wallet, the transparency of blockchain technology meets the privacy of cryptocurrency ownership. Here’s why these movements create such interest: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large transfers often precede significant price movements Institutional Activity: Unknown wallets frequently belong to major investors Security Considerations: Moving funds to cold storage suggests long-term holding Liquidity Impact: Removing $205 million from exchange-connected wallets affects available supply This particular Bitcoin transaction stands out because of its source. Antpool isn’t just any wallet—it’s a mining pool that generates new Bitcoin through proof-of-work. When mining rewards leave the pool’s custody, it suggests either payout distribution or strategic repositioning. How Might This Affect Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics? The immediate effect of any substantial Bitcoin transaction involves market psychology. When traders see $205 million moving between wallets, they naturally wonder about the implications. However, the actual market impact depends on several factors that every investor should understand. First, consider the destination. An unknown wallet typically means the Bitcoin has moved to cold storage—a more secure, offline environment. This suggests the holder plans to keep these assets for the long term rather than trading them immediately. Therefore, this Bitcoin transaction might actually reduce selling pressure rather than increase it. Second, examine the timing. Large transfers often occur during periods of market consolidation or before anticipated volatility. While we can’t predict future price movements based on a single transaction, we can recognize patterns. Historical data shows that accumulation in private wallets frequently precedes bullish periods. What Can Investors Learn From This Movement? Every significant Bitcoin transaction offers learning opportunities for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Rather than reacting emotionally to large transfers, savvy investors analyze what these movements might indicate about broader market trends. Consider these actionable insights from this event: Monitor Whale Activity: Services like Whale Alert provide valuable data about large transfers Context Matters: Always consider the source and destination of transactions Don’t Overreact: Single transactions rarely dictate market direction alone Look for Patterns: Repeated similar movements matter more than isolated events This $205 million Bitcoin transaction reminds us that substantial wealth continues moving through blockchain networks daily. The transparency of these movements, combined with the privacy of wallet ownership, creates the unique dynamic that makes cryptocurrency markets so fascinating to observe. The Bottom Line on Major Bitcoin Movements The 2,265 BTC transfer from Antpool represents exactly what makes blockchain technology revolutionary: complete transparency of movement with selective transparency of ownership. While we know exactly how much value moved and when, we may never know who controls the receiving wallet or their ultimate intentions. For everyday investors, the key takeaway is perspective. Major transactions occur regularly in cryptocurrency markets, and they typically reflect normal portfolio management rather than market manipulation. This particular Bitcoin transaction demonstrates the scale at which institutional players operate while reminding us that Bitcoin’s infrastructure handles nine-figure transfers seamlessly. Frequently Asked Questions What is Whale Alert and how does it track transactions? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions across multiple networks. It uses algorithms to detect transfers above certain thresholds and reports them publicly, providing transparency about major market movements. Why would someone move Bitcoin to an unknown wallet? Investors typically move cryptocurrency to unknown wallets for enhanced security through cold storage, privacy concerns, institutional custody requirements, or preparation for long-term holding rather than active trading. Does a large Bitcoin transaction always affect the price? Not necessarily. While large transactions can influence market sentiment, the actual price impact depends on multiple factors including market conditions, transaction purpose, and whether the Bitcoin moves to or from exchange wallets. What is Antpool and why is it significant? Antpool is one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pools, responsible for significant portions of network hash rate. Transactions from mining pools are noteworthy because they often represent newly minted Bitcoin or mining rewards being distributed. How can I track large Bitcoin transactions myself? You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or BTC.com, follow tracking services like Whale Alert on social media, or utilize cryptocurrency analytics platforms that highlight significant on-chain movements. What does “unknown wallet” actually mean? An unknown wallet refers to a cryptocurrency address that hasn’t been publicly associated with any known entity, exchange, or institution. These wallets provide privacy for their owners while still maintaining transaction transparency on the blockchain.

A shocking new report reveals that nearly one-third of all circulating Bitcoin is now concentrated in the hands of institutions, exchanges, and governments. This Bitcoin supply concentration represents a fundamental shift in the cryptocurrency landscape that every investor needs to understand. What Does This Bitcoin Supply Concentration Mean? According to data from Glassnode, approximately 5.94 million BTC – representing 29.8% of the circulating supply – is now held by major players. This Bitcoin supply concentration includes institutions, governments, U.S. spot ETFs, and cryptocurrency exchanges. The breakdown reveals some surprising patterns: Exchanges hold 2.94 million BTC – the largest single category U.S. spot BTC ETFs control 1.31 million BTC Publicly traded companies own 1.07 million BTC Governments possess 620,000 BTC This distribution shows how institutional adoption has accelerated dramatically in recent years. However, it also raises important questions about market decentralization. Why Should You Care About Bitcoin Supply Concentration? The growing Bitcoin supply concentration represents both opportunity and risk for individual investors. On one hand, institutional involvement brings legitimacy and potentially greater price stability. On the other hand, concentrated ownership could impact market dynamics in unexpected ways. Consider this: when large entities control significant portions of supply, their buying and selling decisions can create substantial price movements. This Bitcoin supply concentration means that institutional actions now have more weight than ever before in determining market direction. How Does This Affect Bitcoin’s Original Vision? Bitcoin was originally conceived as a decentralized currency free from institutional control. The current Bitcoin supply concentration challenges this vision in practical terms. While the network remains decentralized technically, ownership patterns tell a different story. This concentration creates several implications: Increased market influence for large holders Potential regulatory attention on concentrated ownership Changed liquidity dynamics across exchanges New price discovery mechanisms driven by institutional flows However, it’s important to remember that 70% of Bitcoin remains outside these concentrated holdings, preserving significant decentralization. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Distribution? The trend toward Bitcoin supply concentration appears likely to continue as more institutions enter the space. U.S. spot ETFs have already accumulated over 1.3 million BTC in just months since approval. This rapid accumulation suggests institutional appetite remains strong. Looking forward, several factors could influence this concentration: Regulatory developments affecting institutional participation New financial products making Bitcoin accessible to more investors Geopolitical factors influencing government Bitcoin holdings Technological developments affecting custody solutions The key takeaway is that Bitcoin’s ownership landscape is evolving rapidly, and understanding these shifts is crucial for informed investment decisions. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors Given the current Bitcoin supply concentration , what should individual investors do? First, recognize that institutional involvement brings both stability and new market dynamics. Second, consider how custody solutions affect your own Bitcoin holdings. Third, monitor institutional flows as indicators of market sentiment. Most importantly, remember that Bitcoin’s value proposition extends beyond ownership patterns. The network’s security, decentralization, and scarcity remain intact regardless of who holds the coins. The revelation that institutions and exchanges control nearly 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply marks a turning point in cryptocurrency history. This Bitcoin supply concentration reflects growing mainstream adoption while raising important questions about market structure. As the landscape continues to evolve, staying informed about these ownership patterns will be essential for navigating the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What percentage of Bitcoin do institutions actually control? Institutions, exchanges, governments, and ETFs collectively control approximately 29.8% of circulating Bitcoin, which equals about 5.94 million BTC according to Glassnode data. Does this concentration make Bitcoin more or less valuable? Institutional involvement generally increases legitimacy and could support price stability, but concentrated ownership also creates new market dynamics that investors should monitor carefully. Are U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs a major contributor to this concentration? Yes, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated 1.31 million BTC in a relatively short time, making them significant contributors to the current supply concentration. How does exchange-held Bitcoin affect market liquidity? Exchange-held Bitcoin (2.94 million BTC) provides trading liquidity but also represents potential selling pressure, as exchanges typically don’t hold Bitcoin as long-term investments. Is Bitcoin still decentralized with this level of concentration? While ownership shows concentration, the Bitcoin network itself remains decentralized. The protocol and mining distribution continue to operate without central control. Should individual investors be concerned about institutional control? Individual investors should be aware of these trends but not necessarily concerned. Understanding ownership patterns helps make better investment decisions in any market environment.

The company’s latest Bitmine purchases ETH transaction, a whopping $46 million for 14,959 Ether, is more than just a trade—it’s a powerful statement of institutional faith in the world’s second-largest blockchain. This strategic acquisition, spotted by blockchain analysts at Lookonchain, underscores a growing trend of traditional finance embracing the digital future. But what does this massive buy really mean for Ethereum and the broader market? Let’s dive in. Why Did Bitmine Purchase $46 Million in ETH? When a publicly traded company like Bitmine allocates millions to a single crypto asset, it’s a decision backed by rigorous analysis. This isn’t speculative gambling; it’s a calculated investment. The recent Bitmine purchases ETH move likely stems from several key convictions held by the firm’s strategists. Firstly, Ethereum’s ongoing transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has made it more energy-efficient and potentially more valuable as a yield-generating asset. Secondly, the network’s role as the primary foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) provides a fundamental utility that is hard to replicate. For institutional investors, this combination of technological upgrade and real-world use case creates a compelling investment thesis. What Does This Signal for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Bitmine’s action is a beacon for other traditional finance players still on the sidelines. This purchase demonstrates that sophisticated investors are moving beyond Bitcoin and actively building positions in other core blockchain assets. The implications are significant: Validation: Major purchases by listed companies validate Ethereum’s economic model and long-term viability. Liquidity: Large-scale buying adds stability and depth to the market, reducing volatility over time. Trend Confirmation: It confirms the trend of corporations treating cryptocurrencies as a legitimate part of treasury management and growth strategy. Therefore, when Bitmine purchases ETH on this scale, it acts as a catalyst, encouraging other institutions to conduct their own due diligence and potentially follow suit. How Does This Impact the Average Ethereum Investor? For the everyday crypto enthusiast, news of a $46 million buy might seem distant from their own portfolio. However, the effects are tangible. Institutional moves like this create a stronger price floor and can improve overall market sentiment. When giants like Bitmine purchase ETH, they are effectively locking up a substantial amount of the circulating supply, which can contribute to scarcity-driven value appreciation. Furthermore, it brings increased regulatory clarity and professional infrastructure to the ecosystem, benefiting all participants. While not a guarantee of short-term gains, it represents a vote of confidence in the network you are invested in. What Are the Potential Risks and Challenges? Despite the optimistic signal, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. Institutional investment is a double-edged sword. Their large capital inflows can lead to increased market correlation with traditional finance, meaning crypto markets might sway with stock market sentiments. Additionally, concentrated buying power could, in theory, influence market movements in ways that disadvantage smaller traders. The key for retail investors is to see this not as a signal to blindly follow, but as confirmation to continue their own research and stick to a disciplined investment strategy based on personal risk tolerance. The Bottom Line: A Confident Step Forward Bitmine’s decisive $46 million Ethereum purchase is a landmark moment. It transcends a simple transaction and stands as a testament to the maturing cryptocurrency landscape. This move highlights a strategic shift where established financial entities are not just observing digital assets but are actively integrating them into their core investment frameworks. For Ethereum, it reinforces its position as the indispensable utility blockchain. For the market, it heralds a new phase of maturity where institutional capital plays a defining role. The message is clear: the future of finance is being built on blockchains, and savvy institutions are positioning themselves accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much ETH did Bitmine actually buy? A1: According to data from Lookonchain, Bitmine purchased 14,959 ETH, which was valued at approximately $46 million at the time of the transaction. Q2: Is Bitmine a mining company? A2: Despite the name, Bitmine is primarily an investment company focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain assets, listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Their recent activity shows a focus on strategic acquisition rather than computational mining. Q3: Why is this purchase significant for Ethereum? A3: It’s significant because it represents a major vote of confidence from a traditional, publicly-traded financial institution. It signals that sophisticated investors see long-term value and utility in the Ethereum network beyond short-term speculation. Q4: Should I buy Ethereum because Bitmine did? A4: Institutional moves can be a useful data point, but they should not be your sole reason for investing. Always conduct your own research, understand the risks of cryptocurrency investing, and make decisions that align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Q5: Where can I track such large transactions? A5: Large transactions are often reported by blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain, Arkham, and Nansen, which monitor wallet activity of known institutions and “whales” (large holders). Q6: Does this mean the price of ETH will go up? A6: While large purchases can positively influence supply, demand, and sentiment, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by countless factors. No single transaction guarantees a specific price movement. Join the Conversation Does Bitmine’s massive bet on Ethereum change your outlook on the crypto market?

Here’s how other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum compare. XRP 30-Day MVRV Ratio Shows Negative Returns In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is currently looking for the different top coins in the cryptocurrency sector like Bitcoin and XRP. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Forms Signal That Last Led To 95% Price Rally The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular indicator that keeps track of the ratio between an asset’s market cap and its Realized Cap. The latter capitalization model calculates the cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming the value of each individual token is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. The Realized Cap can be thought of as an estimate of the capital that the investors as a whole used to purchase their tokens. In contrast, the market cap is the value that they are carrying in the present. As the MVRV Ratio takes the ratio between the two, it essentially contains information about the profit-loss balance of the investors. In the context of the current topic, a very specific form of the MVRV Ratio is of interest: the 30-day version. This metric only tracks the profit-loss balance for the traders who got into the market during the past month. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the 30-day MVRV Ratio for six assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, XRP, and Chainlink. As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MVRV Ratio hasn’t displayed a uniform behavior across the top cryptocurrencies, indicating that the situation of the 30-day buyers is different for the various assets. Ethereum currently has the metric at a positive value of 7.2%. This means that market entrants from the past month are sitting on a gain of 7.2% on the network. Bitcoin also has a positive value, but at just a level of 2.4%, the 30-day traders are more-or-less breaking even. Chainlink also has a very neutral trend with the 30-day MVRV Ratio at a value of -0.3%. Cardano 30-day traders are also in the red, but in its case, the losses are more notable at -4.4%. Finally, new XRP investors are down 6.1%, implying that the network currently hosts the worst trader profitability. This fact, however, may not actually be negative for the cryptocurrency. Generally, the higher investor gains get, the more likely they become to participate in a selloff with the aim of profit realization. This can make a top more probable for the asset when its MVRV Ratio is at a high level. Similarly, a deep negative value can be bullish instead, as it suggests profit-takers have probably become depleted. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lacks Fresh Momentum As Realized Cap Growth Still Declining In the chart, the analytics firm has defined overvalued and undervalued zones based on the 30-day MVRV Ratio. XRP is currently the only one in an undervalued zone, while Ethereum is inside a mild overbought region. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.04, up 1.5% over the last 24 hours.

However, this Zcash price prediction depends on several key factors: Factor Positive Impact Negative Impact Regulatory Environment Clear guidelines could boost adoption Restrictive policies could limit growth Technological Development Improved privacy features Competition from newer protocols Market Adoption Increased merchant acceptance Slow mainstream integration Competitive Landscape First-mover advantage Newer privacy solutions emerging Cryptocurrency Investment Considerations for Privacy Coins Investing in privacy coins like Zcash requires careful consideration of unique factors. Unlike mainstream cryptocurrencies, privacy coins face specific regulatory challenges and market dynamics. When evaluating this Zcash price prediction, consider: The balance between privacy needs and regulatory compliance Technological sustainability and development roadmap Market liquidity and exchange availability Competitive advantages over other privacy solutions Long-term viability in evolving regulatory landscapes Challenges and Opportunities in the Privacy Coin Sector The road ahead for Zcash and similar cryptocurrencies involves navigating complex challenges while capitalizing on emerging opportunities. Regulatory pressure represents the most significant hurdle, with governments worldwide scrutinizing privacy-focused digital assets. However, growing concerns about financial privacy and data protection create substantial opportunities for technologies that can balance privacy with compliance. Actionable Insights for Zcash Investors Based on our Zcash price prediction analysis, here are practical considerations for potential investors: Diversify within the privacy coin sector rather than concentrating on Zcash alone Monitor regulatory developments in key markets like the United States and European Union Track technological upgrades and network development progress Consider dollar-cost averaging to manage volatility risks Maintain awareness of competitive developments in the privacy technology space Conclusion: The Future of Financial Privacy Our Zcash price prediction for 2026-2030 suggests that privacy coins face both significant challenges and extraordinary opportunities. As digital surveillance increases and financial privacy becomes more valued, technologies like Zcash could see growing adoption. However, success depends on navigating regulatory landscapes, maintaining technological superiority, and achieving broader market acceptance.

Instead of focusing on speculative activity, the post centers on measurable performance and practical applications, outlining why Solana is becoming a preferred infrastructure layer for developers building at scale. Core performance benchmarks The post underscores several technical metrics that define Solana’s current capabilities. Finality is often achieved in under one second, allowing transactions to settle almost immediately. Block times average around 400 milliseconds, keeping network activity continuous and consistent. Fees typically fall below $0.001 per transaction, which reduces barriers for applications that require frequent or micro-sized transactions. Live throughput is described as operating in the thousands of transactions per second, with a theoretical ceiling far higher. These benchmarks are presented as indicators that Solana can support applications requiring sustained, high-volume activity. If you still think Solana $SOL is just for memecoins, read this This is the infrastructure layer quietly powering real-time gaming, high-volume DeFi, tokenized assets, and even low-cost micropayments. ALL AT SCALE Finality under 1 second 400ms block times pic.twitter.com/pvcQNjv39X — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 10, 2025 Applications that rely on scale The post notes that Solana is already serving use cases where speed and low-cost execution are essential. This includes decentralized finance platforms handling high trading volumes, Web3 gaming that depends on real-time interaction, tokenized assets and micropayments that require efficient settlement, and NFT minting designed to remain cost-effective. These sectors depend on consistent network performance, and the post positions Solana as a chain capable of meeting those expectations today rather than in a distant roadmap. Positioning relative to other blockchains A comparison is made between Solana and other major networks. The post asserts that Ethereum’s current structure limits its ability to handle consumer-scale throughput, that Bitcoin’s design does not target these types of applications, and that most layer-2 networks are still working toward long-term stability and scalability. Through this comparison, the argument emphasizes that Solana is already performing at the level required for emerging on-chain products and services.

It states that future users will prioritize applications that function smoothly, without concern for which chain powers them. In this context, Solana’s speed , throughput, and low costs are framed as features that will support broad adoption. The message concludes with the view that Solana remains relevant for investors assessing which networks are ready to operate at consumer scale and suggests reevaluating whether Solana has a place in modern portfolios. Overall, the X Finance Bull’s post delivers a straightforward assessment of Solana’s infrastructure capabilities and presents it as a blockchain that is already prepared for high-demand environments across several active sectors.

A subtle but significant shift is occurring. Recent data reveals that traders on the world’s largest crypto futures exchanges are holding a slight edge in short positions for Bitcoin perpetual futures . This isn’t a dramatic crash signal, but it’s a crucial sentiment gauge every savvy investor should understand. Let’s decode what this minor tilt means for the market’s next move. What Do the Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Ratios Tell Us? The long/short ratio is a direct window into trader sentiment. A ratio above 50% long indicates bullish dominance, while below 50% suggests bearish leanings. Over the last 24 hours, the aggregate data across top exchanges shows a market almost perfectly balanced, yet tipped ever so slightly towards the bears. Overall: 49.88% long / 50.12% short Binance: 49.16% long / 50.84% short OKX: 48.49% long / 51.51% short Bybit: 49.69% long / 50.31% short This data tells a story of cautious skepticism. The market for Bitcoin perpetual futures isn’t panicking, but it is preparing for potential downside or hedging existing long spot positions. Why is This Short Bias Significant? You might wonder why a difference of less than 2% matters. In the high-leverage world of crypto derivatives, small imbalances can precede larger moves. This slight short bias in Bitcoin perpetual futures often acts as a contrarian indicator. When the crowd leans one way, the market frequently moves the opposite direction to liquidate over-leveraged positions. Furthermore, this sentiment is consistent across three major venues—Binance, OKX, and Bybit. This convergence suggests a broad-based, global caution rather than an isolated event on a single exchange. It reflects a collective pause, a moment where traders are questioning whether the recent price momentum can sustain itself. How Should Traders Interpret This Data? Interpreting futures data requires context. A slight short bias does not equal a prediction of a crash. Instead, it can signal several scenarios: Hedging Activity: Large holders (whales) might be opening short futures positions to protect their long spot Bitcoin holdings from volatility. Expectation of Consolidation: Traders may anticipate a period of sideways movement or a minor pullback before the next leg up. Liquidity Hunting: Markets often move against the majority position. This setup can be a precursor to a swift “short squeeze” if buying pressure returns. Therefore, watching the Bitcoin perpetual futures market is less about following the crowd and more about understanding the potential energy stored in the market’s positioning. Actionable Insights from the Futures Market What can you do with this information? First, use it as a risk management tool. A neutral-to-bearish derivatives sentiment suggests increasing volatility is possible. It might be a time to review your portfolio’s leverage and ensure stop-losses are in place. Second, monitor for a reversal. If the price of Bitcoin begins to rise while shorts are elevated, it could trigger a cascade of buying as short positions are forced to close. This is the infamous short squeeze, a powerful, fast-moving rally fueled by liquidations. The data from these Bitcoin perpetual futures exchanges gives you the map to see this potential fuel building up. In conclusion, the derivatives market is whispering a note of caution. The slight short bias across major exchanges for Bitcoin perpetual futures highlights a market at a crossroads, balancing between continued optimism and pragmatic risk management. This isn’t a signal to flee, but a reminder to stay alert. The most profitable moves often come from understanding the subtle shifts in sentiment that others overlook. The balance is delicate, and the next tilt could define the short-term trend. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? Bitcoin perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price without an expiry date. They use a funding rate mechanism to tether their price to the underlying spot market. What does a long/short ratio below 50% mean? A ratio below 50% long means more traders on that exchange are holding positions that profit if the price goes down (shorts) than positions that profit if it goes up (longs). It indicates bearish sentiment. Is a slight short bias bearish for Bitcoin’s price? Not necessarily. It reflects derivative trader sentiment, which can be used for hedging. It can sometimes be a contrarian indicator, setting the stage for a rally if shorts are forced to close. Which exchange has the most bearish sentiment currently? Based on the 24-hour data, OKX shows the highest percentage of short positions at 51.51%, making it the most bearish-leaning of the three major exchanges listed. How often does this data change? The long/short ratio updates in real-time as traders open and close positions. It can shift significantly with major news events or sharp price movements.

New correspondence from members of Congress urges the Securities and Exchange Commission to act on President Trump’s executive order concerning retirement access to alternative assets. The scale of the market involved and the regulatory direction described in the letter raise important questions about which digital assets are positioned to meet the required standards for inclusion in 401(k) plans. BREAKING: This is seismic and absolutely critical for XRP’s future U S lawmakers just sent a formal directive to the SEC urging them to implement President Trump’s executive order that opens the twelve point five trillion dollar 401k retirement market to digital assets.… pic.twitter.com/oDNDlYfPeA — Pumpius (@pumpius) December 11, 2025 Lawmakers Support Executive Order on Expanding 401(k) Options The letter, addressed to the SEC Chairman, expresses congressional support for President Trump’s August 7, 2025, executive order directing federal agencies to facilitate access to alternative assets for Americans preparing for retirement. The document notes that the Secretary of Labor and the SEC should coordinate on regulatory adjustments that allow defined-contribution retirement plans to consider alternative investments where appropriate. Lawmakers emphasize that revising existing rules may involve evaluating accredited investor and qualified purchaser criteria, signaling intent to modernize access pathways. Members of Congress state that these changes could assist nearly 90 million Americans who cannot engage with alternative assets in their retirement accounts. They encourage the SEC to act promptly and reference ongoing bipartisan legislative efforts concerning accredited investor definitions. The overall message centers on enabling broader, regulated access to alternative investment classes within 401(k) structures. Implications for Digital Assets and Eligibility Standards Pumpius points out that the directive carries significant consequences for the digital asset industry because only assets meeting regulatory, liquidity, and settlement requirements stand to be eligible for integration into retirement plans. He notes that consistent, long-horizon retirement allocations differ substantially from speculative inflows, making compliance-ready assets central to this emerging segment. According to Pumpius, XRP aligns with several of the standards emphasized in the policymaking environment. He cites the rollout of XRP-linked exchange-traded products , the availability of institutional custody solutions such as Ripple Prime , and the presence of RLUSD as a regulated dollar-backed settlement option on the XRP Ledger. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He also highlights that international regulators continue to provide clarity for XRP more rapidly than for many other assets. Pumpius argues that these factors position for adoption by retirement plan administrators who require dependable settlement systems and liquidity depth. A Potential Structural Shift for the Market Pumpius concludes that if U.S. retirement plans receive permission to allocate even small percentages of their portfolios into digital assets, the resulting inflows could represent one of the most substantial structural shifts the sector has seen. He underscores that such developments would come from regulated, long-term capital rather than short-term trading products. His message stresses that XRP holders should recognize the scale of the moment, stating that the opportunity is larger and moving faster than many market participants realize.

According to on-chain investigators Lookonchain, several users reported unauthorized fund movements at around 2:30 PM UTC yesterday, after interactions with what appeared to be the official Zerobase interface. Hackers compromised the @zerobasezk frontend, stealing funds from 270+ users, totaling over $240K. One user alone lost 123,597 $USDT . Please use https://t.co/inHmYxIkPw or other tools to revoke any suspicious or unnecessary contract approvals in your wallet. Stay safe.… https://t.co/VMveJS728M pic.twitter.com/Iduq2Fb1gY — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 12, 2025 The attackers did not breach the underlying blockchain infrastructure, but exploited the platform’s front-end which could be accessed directly through a web interface. They deployed a phishing smart contract on BNB Chain to impersonate Zerobase, which tricked users into connecting their wallets and approving USDT spending permissions. Once approvals were granted, the attackers were able to siphon funds without further user interaction, with one affected user alone reportedly lost 123,597 USDT, Lookonchain found. Front-end attack on Zerobase interface causes $240K loss According to blockchain cybersecurity platform HashDit, the malicious contract address linked to the incident was identified as 0x0dd28fd7d343401e46c1af33031b27aed2152396. The contract was specifically made to hijack wallet connections and extract approved tokens. Zerobase’s hack was different from the regular smart contract exploits, because a front-end compromise does not need a breacher to tamper with the blockchain’s security. They can manipulate the interface and add malicious codes to intercept transactions or redirect assets once approvals are in place. These attacks take place at the user interaction layer, so they can be difficult for non-technical users to detect even as their funds are being rerouted. Lookonchain pleaded with affected users to immediately review their wallet permissions and use revoke.cash or similar services to remove any suspicious or unnecessary contract approvals from their wallets. Zerobase acknowledged the issue in a post on X, warning users who had interacted with the malicious contract and adding that it had implemented automatic safeguards for affected wallets. “When you access ZEROBASE Staking, if your wallet is detected to have interacted with this contract, the system will automatically block deposits and withdrawals until the approval to the phishing contract is revoked,” the company wrote. The Binance Wallet team also confirmed it blocked the website domain suspected of hosting malicious activity. It also blacklisted the relevant contracts to prevent more authorization risks, and would automatically send alerts to affected users within 30 minutes advising them to review their approvals. “We will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary measures to ensure user security. We will share any further updates as soon as possible,” the Binance team noted. Binance with questions to answer after Upbit hack discovery The Zerobase incident comes on the backdrop of Binance’s scrutiny over its response to the Upbit exchange hack that occurred late November. Cryptopolitan reported that South Korea’s regulators accused the world’s largest exchange by volume of only partially complying with a freeze request from Upbit. On November 27 hackers stole a significant amount of digital assets from the exchange and later laundered the funds through more than a thousand wallets. That same day, South Korean police and Upbit formally requested Binance to freeze approximately 470 million won worth of stolen Solana tokens traced to its platform. Binance froze only about 80 million won, or roughly 17% of the requested amount citing the need for “fact-checking” before taking any action. South Korean authorities were notified that the freeze had been completed around midnight on November 27, 15 hours after the initial request was submitted. Upbit later disclosed the perpetrators had exploited a vulnerability in its Solana-based hot wallet, siphoning funds from 24 Solana ecosystem tokens in less than an hour. Losses from the attack were estimated at 44.5 billion won, equivalent to about $33 million at the time. The exchange later confirmed that all customer losses would be covered using internal reserves, seeking to reassure users amid heightened concerns about platform security. In a separate but related blockchain security event, blockchain security firm CertiK detected suspicious Tornado Cash deposits linked to anomalous withdrawals from 0G Labs on Friday. 🚨 Hack Alert Two projects were hacked at once 1.

Coinbase Teases Major Updates The anticipation surrounding the prediction market has been building for nearly a month. Recently, a screenshot of what appears to be Coinbase’s prediction markets dashboard was shared by Silicon Valley researcher Jane Manchun Wong in a post on social media site X (previously Twitter), shedding some light on the features of the forthcoming product. Related Reading: Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism The Information first indicated on November 19 that Coinbase planned to introduce these prediction markets powered by Kalshi, with a formal unveiling set for the “Coinbase System Update” event scheduled for December 17. Formal announcements regarding this new platform are expected soon, potentially as early as next week. Bloomberg corroborated this report, stating that the cryptocurrency exchange is also likely to announce a tokenized stock offering during the same event, in line with Tether’s same vision reported earlier this week. While Coinbase has refrained from confirming these developments directly to CNBC, the company has encouraged stakeholders to tune in to its upcoming event for more details. The firm did not disclose a specific timeline for when the prediction markets will become available to users. ‘Everything Exchange’ Status Coinbase’s push to launch a prediction market is part of a broader strategy to transform itself into an “everything exchange”—a comprehensive platform for trading a wide variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized stocks, and event contracts. CEO Brian Armstrong articulated this vision earlier in May, stressing that the cryptocurrency exchange aims to evolve into a leading financial services application within the next decade. This development comes as Coinbase faces increasing competition from rivals like Robinhood (HOOD), Gemini (GEMI), and Kraken, all of whom have introduced tokenized equity offerings for users outside the US and are exploring prediction markets to varying extents.

These include major deals such as the purchase of the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit and the on-chain advertising firm Spindl, as well as seven other major acquisitions. This also follows a shift in investor sentiment in the digital asset space, with the largest cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin (BTC) — having retraced by over 30% since October amid fears of a new bear market beginning. Over the past months, the exchange’s stock, which trades under the ticker name COIN, has also seen a significant drop of over 39%, with the current valuation standing at $267 per share.

The commentary describes these elements as parts of a broader trend in institutional adoption, tokenization, and on-chain infrastructure. While many of the assertions remain speculative, the post highlights several factual components that are currently shaping discussions in the digital asset sector, including ongoing work on tokenized treasuries, partnerships involving major asset managers, and the increasing role of blockchain-based identity systems. (1/) I’ve uncovered the secret tie between BlackRock and Ripple… They’ve been building the same system under different names. Now the puzzle pieces are locking in: Aladdin. XRP. Tokenized treasuries. Identity on-chain. This goes deeper than anyone realizes. pic.twitter.com/pFfbpOvj4P — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) July 20, 2025 BlackRock’s Stance on Tokenization and Ondo Finance’s Role The commentator references public statements from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink , who has previously described tokenization as a defining next step for financial markets. This outlook aligns with the activity of Ondo Finance, which has issued tokenized U.S. Treasuries on the XRP Ledger . According to the post, Ondo’s connections to BlackRock are noteworthy, given the firm’s partnership with the asset manager and the background of Ondo’s co-founder, who comes from Goldman Sachs. The commentary further emphasizes that several senior figures across BlackRock and U.S. regulatory bodies also share Goldman Sachs backgrounds, presenting this as part of a recurring institutional network. Ripple’s Regulatory Encounter and Identity Developments Stellar Rippler interprets Ripple’s prior legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an inflection point, suggesting that the outcome positioned the company more strongly than anticipated. The post then transitions into new identity-focused initiatives on the XRP Ledger, specifically the launch of DNA Protocol’s XDNA token on 4 July. According to the claims highlighted, the project aims to develop decentralized DNA identity systems , encrypted medical data solutions, and on-chain access credentials. The commentator draws attention to the matching ticker symbol between BlackRock’s existing XDNA health and genomics ETF and the new token on the XRP Ledger, presenting this as a significant parallel.

Stellar Rippler references unverified claims that Aladdin has explored blockchain-based payment rails. The post states that XRPL’s compatibility with messaging standards such as ISO 20022 positions it as a viable component for future interoperability. This aligns with Ripple’s stated focus on tokenizing real-world assets, including real estate, treasuries, commodities, and central bank digital currencies. The commentator presents BlackRock’s digital asset strategy as targeting similar objectives, interpreting this as evidence of converging institutional plans. The post concludes that Ripple, BlackRock, and emerging identity solutions may be forming a cohesive framework for future tokenized markets and on-chain identity infrastructure.

55720883,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245196,1765609811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exposed: How OKX Identified and Stopped OM Price Manipulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/okx-om-price-manipulation-exposed/,"BitcoinWorld Exposed: How OKX Identified and Stopped OM Price Manipulation In a dramatic move that highlights the ongoing battle for market integrity, cryptocurrency exchange OKX has exposed and acted against a sophisticated OM price manipulation scheme. This incident serves as a crucial case study in how exchanges can detect and mitigate artificial price inflation to protect their users. How Did OKX Uncover the OM Price Manipulation? OKX’s security systems detected abnormal trading patterns involving the Mantra (OM) token. Several accounts were using unusually large OM holdings as collateral to borrow substantial amounts of USDT. This coordinated activity created artificial buying pressure, effectively inflating the token’s price beyond its organic market value. The exchange immediately identified this as potential OM price manipulation and took decisive action. When account holders failed to cooperate with requests for corrective measures, OKX implemented account restrictions to prevent further market distortion. What Happened After OKX Intervened? The consequences were immediate and significant. Once OKX restricted the problematic accounts, the artificially inflated OM price collapsed dramatically. However, the exchange had prepared for this scenario through its security fund mechanism. OKX confirmed that its security fund completely covered all user losses resulting from the price crash. This demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to user protection, even when facing coordinated OM price manipulation attempts. Was the Price Drop Entirely OKX’s Responsibility? Interestingly, external analysis revealed that the sharp decline wasn’t solely due to OKX’s actions. The exchange reported that perpetual contract trading occurring on other platforms significantly contributed to the price drop. This highlights how interconnected cryptocurrency markets can amplify both manipulation attempts and their consequences. Key aspects of OKX’s response included: Immediate detection of abnormal trading patterns Direct communication with account holders Swift restriction of uncooperative accounts Full coverage of user losses through security fund Comprehensive investigation into OM holdings origin What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Markets? This incident extends beyond a single exchange or token. OKX has submitted its findings to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and is currently involved in several related lawsuits. This proactive approach signals a maturing industry that’s increasingly willing to police itself and collaborate with traditional oversight bodies. The OM price manipulation case demonstrates several important developments: Exchanges are developing sophisticated detection systems Security funds provide crucial user protection Market manipulation carries increasing legal consequences Transparency builds trust in cryptocurrency platforms How Can Traders Protect Themselves? While exchanges like OKX work to prevent OM price manipulation , traders should remain vigilant. Understanding that artificial price inflation can occur helps investors make more informed decisions. Choosing platforms with robust security measures and protection funds provides an additional layer of safety against market manipulation risks. Remember that unusual price movements, especially when accompanied by disproportionate trading volume, might indicate manipulation rather than organic market activity. The OKX case shows that while manipulation attempts continue, so do the defenses against them. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly was the OM price manipulation scheme? Several accounts used large amounts of Mantra (OM) tokens as collateral to borrow USDT, creating artificial buying pressure that inflated OM’s price beyond its true market value. How did OKX respond to the manipulation? OKX detected the abnormal activity, requested corrective action from account holders, restricted uncooperative accounts, and used its security fund to cover all user losses from the subsequent price crash. Was the price drop only caused by OKX’s actions? No. External analysis indicated that perpetual contract trading on other platforms significantly contributed to the sharp price decline following the account restrictions. What happens to the manipulators now? OKX has submitted findings to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and is involved in related lawsuits. The origin of the large OM holdings remains under investigation. How can I avoid falling victim to price manipulation? Trade on reputable exchanges with strong security measures, be skeptical of unusually rapid price increases, and understand that exchanges with protection funds offer additional security. Does this mean OM is a problematic token? Not necessarily. This incident demonstrates manipulation attempts can target various tokens. The response from OKX shows how exchanges can protect markets regardless of which token manipulators target. Found this analysis of the OM price manipulation case insightful?

The city’s Financial Services Development Council (FSDC) has just unveiled an ambitious 10-year roadmap with a clear goal: to become a dominant force in RWA tokenization and digital finance. This strategic pivot could redefine how the world invests in and trades everything from real estate to bonds. What is Hong Kong’s RWA Tokenization Strategy? The FSDC’s report, “Hong Kong Capital Market Leadership Strategy,” outlines a phased approach. The immediate focus is on developing tangible RWA tokenization products within the next two to five years. However, the vision extends far beyond that. The long-term objective is a complete overhaul of the financial system’s backbone for tokenized issuance and trading. This means building the necessary digital infrastructure from the ground up. The plan includes creating robust tokenization platforms, deploying secure smart contracts, and establishing real-time settlement systems. Therefore, Hong Kong isn’t just dipping its toes in the water; it’s preparing to dive deep into the future of finance. Why is RWA Tokenization a Game-Changer? Tokenizing real-world assets involves converting physical or traditional financial assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process unlocks significant benefits that address long-standing market inefficiencies. Enhanced Liquidity: It can transform traditionally illiquid assets, like real estate or fine art, into fractional, easily tradable units. Increased Accessibility: Smaller investors can gain exposure to high-value asset classes that were previously out of reach. Improved Transparency and Security: Blockchain provides an immutable record of ownership and transaction history. Operational Efficiency: Smart contracts can automate complex processes like dividend payments and compliance, reducing costs and time. By championing RWA tokenization , Hong Kong aims to solve these core challenges and attract new capital and innovation. What Are the Key Challenges Ahead? Despite the exciting potential, the path forward is not without hurdles. Successfully implementing this decade-long vision requires navigating a complex landscape. First, a clear and supportive regulatory framework is paramount. Authorities must balance innovation with investor protection and financial stability. Second, achieving widespread adoption depends on building trust among traditional financial institutions and the public. Furthermore, the technological infrastructure must be scalable, secure, and interoperable with global systems. Hong Kong’s strategy appears to acknowledge these challenges by emphasizing a structured, infrastructure-first approach over a rushed product launch. How Will This Shape the Future of Finance in Hong Kong? This initiative is more than a technological upgrade; it’s a strategic repositioning. By investing heavily in its digital financial infrastructure, Hong Kong is sending a powerful signal to the world. The city intends to be the preferred gateway for digital asset innovation, especially for the vast Chinese market and the broader Asia-Pacific region. The development of platforms for RWA tokenization could create entirely new markets and financial products. Moreover, it positions Hong Kong to set global standards and best practices in this emerging field. This forward-thinking plan could be the key to maintaining its competitive edge against other financial centers like Singapore and Dubai. Conclusion: A Decisive Step into a Tokenized Future Hong Kong’s 10-year plan is a bold declaration of intent. It moves beyond speculative crypto assets to focus on the substantive digitization of the global economy’s bedrock—real-world assets. While execution over the next decade will be critical, the strategy provides a clear and compelling vision. If successful, Hong Kong will not only future-proof its financial sector but could also lead the world into a new era of efficient, accessible, and transparent capital markets powered by RWA tokenization . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does RWA tokenization mean? RWA tokenization is the process of converting rights to a real-world asset (like property, bonds, or commodities) into a digital token on a blockchain. This digital representation can then be traded or held, similar to a digital stock certificate. What is the FSDC in Hong Kong? The Financial Services Development Council (FSDC) is a high-level, cross-sectoral advisory body established by the Hong Kong government. Its mission is to propose strategies to promote the further development of Hong Kong’s financial services industry. How soon will we see RWA products from Hong Kong? According to the FSDC report, the goal is to develop the first wave of RWA-related products within the next two to five years, with a longer-term vision for full market infrastructure. What kind of assets could be tokenized first? Likely candidates include government and corporate bonds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and funds. These have clearer regulatory paths and established markets, making them ideal pilot projects. Is this good for the average investor? Potentially, yes. By fractionalizing expensive assets, RWA tokenization could allow smaller investors to diversify their portfolios into asset classes that were previously inaccessible due to high minimum investment requirements. What are the main risks? Key risks include regulatory uncertainty, technological vulnerabilities in new platforms, potential for market manipulation in less liquid tokenized assets, and the challenge of ensuring legal enforceability of digital token ownership.

Ant International, HSBC, and Swift have completed a joint proof of concept on cross-border transfer of tokenized bank deposits using ISO 20022 messaging standards. The test was carried out on HSBC’s operations in Singapore and Hong Kong, two of Asia’s most technologically advanced jurisdictions. The proof of concept focused on sending cross-border tokenized deposits in real time and in line with existing banking systems, to reduce inefficiencies in international payments like delays, high costs, and limited transparency. Ant International, HSBC test cross-border tokenized settlements At the core of the initiative was the integration of Ant International’s in-house blockchain infrastructure with Swift’s messaging network ISO 20022. The connection helped the financial firm to conduct real-time treasury management through HSBC Singapore and Hong Kong using HSBC’s Tokenized Deposit Service. HSBC converts traditional bank deposits into digital tokens on a one-to-one basis under the service, with each token representing a unit of fiat currency. The tokens can then be transferred instantly between participating HSBC locations, which are operational 24 hours a day. The introduction of a common protocol, co-built by Ant International, HSBC, and Swift, could simplify how large multinational companies interact with banks’ tokenized deposit services. Ant International would be able to access tokenized services through a standardized framework instead of setting up individual bilateral agreements with each banking partner. ISO 20022 to modernize cross-border payments The ISO 20022 messaging standard has been around since 2004, although most financial institutions had not yet adopted the more structured payment data until the early 2020s. According to a Financial Stability Board progress report released in early October, these payments have only improved marginally over the past two years in countries within the Geneva-based intergovernmental forum Group of 20 (G20). Ant International and HSBC’s proof of concept could help solve the structural problems by reducing intermediaries and enabling near-instant settlement. The ISO 20022 solution also extends HSBC’s tokenized deposit service compliance framework, which includes anti-money laundering systems and sanctions screening. “We are excited to demonstrate how ISO 20022 data formats, when combined with new technologies like blockchain, bring significant value to the entire community. We are committed to shaping a future of seamless global interoperability, powered by ISO 20022’s structured data with financial institutions’ need for trust, efficiency, and regulatory consistency.” Shirish Wadvikar, Global Head, Payments and Cash Management at Swift HSBC’s head of domestic and emerging payments, Lewis Sun, said ISO 20022 has created a more connected digital money ecosystem for the banking institutions’ clients. “We are giving our corporate clients more choice in how they manage liquidity globally; with the familiarity of traditional banking and the benefits of next-generation digital infrastructure,” Sun told reporters in a press briefing. General Manager of Platform Tech at Ant International, Kelvin Li, doubled down on HSBC’s sentiments for the proof of concept, saying he believes the collaboration “can guide the standardization of tokenized deposits under ISO 20022.” “We will continue to enable interoperability in global money movement together with our partners, so businesses can access more transparent, secure, and efficient cross-border payments,” Li concluded. Ant International wins NIPS AI security award Away from news of its payment infrastructure, Ant International took first place at the NeurIPS Competition of Fairness in AI Face Detection, held in early December at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems in the San Diego Convention Center, California. The competition saw participants develop AI models capable of detecting AI-generated face images from several demographic groups fairly split by gender, age, and skin tone. Ant International ranked first among more than 2,100 submissions from 162 teams worldwide after achieving a 99.8% detection rate. “A biased AI is an insecure AI,” said Dr. Tianyi Zhang, General Manager of Risk Management and Cybersecurity at Ant International. “Our model’s fairness prevents exploitation from deepfakes and provides reliable identity verification for all users, supporting our mission to deliver secure and inclusive financial services worldwide.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|Ant International|HKD|HSBC|SGD|Swift,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-13 07:22:40

The first involved the key interest rates in the country, which have been frequently related to the price of BTC, as each development on that front tends to move the cryptocurrency in either direction. The POTUS suggested that the rates could be at 1% or even lower next year, which would mean significant reductions from the 3.50% – 3.75%. BREAKING: President Trump is asked where he wants interest rates to be next year. His response: “1% and maybe lower than that.” You don’t own enough assets. pic.twitter.com/XS3aPViKsv — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 12, 2025 Later on, Donald Trump warned that the US would start land strikes against drug operations in Latin America, and in Venezuela in particular. Nevertheless, he noted that the Maduro-led nation is not the only supposed perpetrator, and added that “people that are bringing in drugs to our country are targets.” “We knocked out 96% of the drugs coming in by water, and now we’re starting by land, and by land is a lot easier, and that’s going to start happening,” Trump commented in front of reporters on Friday. His latest remarks came after the US initiated numerous attacks against what he referred to as drug-smuggling boats in international waters off the coast of South America. The US has reportedly killed over 80 people with its strikes in the region, and just recently seized an oil tanker near Venezuela. Despite both of these major statements from Trump, BTC’s price remains relatively stable at just over $90,000. In general, rate reduction hints tend to pump the asset, while military strikes do the opposite, but the cryptocurrency remains calm, at least for now. BTCUSD Dec 13.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-prediction-130-to-600-rally-in-the-coming-weeks-heres-why/,"A new post from crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) has drawn attention to an intriguing technical structure on the XRP chart. The analyst highlighted the Stochastic RSI’s climb toward oversold territory, showing that the setup mirrors two earlier points that preceded sharp upward moves. Oversold Conditions Shape the Current Setup The chart displays three major lows between 2024 and 2025. Each low shows the blue and orange SRSI lines dipping beneath the lower threshold of 20 and moving into the oversold range . ChartNerd indicated that those earlier events came before strong upside reactions. The first move reached roughly 600% when XRP surged in late 2024. The second dip brought a rally of around 130%, sending XRP to its all-time high of $3.65 . Both sequences showed the same momentum cross, which draws focus to the current pattern. The new reset sits at the right edge of the chart, where the SRSI lines hover near 6.49 and 3.99. The structure resembles the earlier moves from 2025, with the SRSI lines near the bottom of the range. $XRP : SRSI Resets SRSI is currently sitting in oversold territory, which in the past has seen bullish reactions of 130% and 600% vertical moves. The fact is, we could be on the cusp of a major breakout. The cross does not definitely mark a low but indicates opportunity pic.twitter.com/nl6GNai0z5 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 11, 2025 ChartNerd’s Prediction for XRP ChartNerd believes that XRP “could be on the cusp of a major breakout.” He framed the setup as a potential turning point. He said that the cross “does not definitely mark a low but indicates opportunity.” If XRP follows historical patterns, the asset could experience a 130% to 600% surge in the coming weeks. XRP currently trades at $2. A 130% move would lift the price to $4.6, which matches the scale of the earlier mid-cycle rally. A 600% move would take it to $14 , which reflects the more extreme reaction seen in the first signal. Both levels show how sensitive XRP can be during SRSI resets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook as the Market Watches XRP’s Next Moves XRP traders now wait to see whether momentum can shift in a way that resembles the earlier surges. ChartNerd’s analysis positions the current SRSI reading as an early stage for a potential move. Other analysts have shared bullish outlooks , reinforcing the overall positive sentiment in the market. The chart supports that bullish framing by showing how prior SRSI resets aligned with major price rallies. While ChartNerd did not outline explicit targets, previous price performance suggests something big is coming for the digital asset.

Key Takeaways: The OCC has conditionally approved five crypto firms, including Circle and Ripple, to launch national trust banks. The charters give digital-asset companies a single federal rulebook instead of navigating state-by-state regulations. Paxos is cleared to issue stablecoins under federal oversight, while Ripple’s charter excludes RLUSD issuance. The approvals, announced Friday , mark one of the most aggressive moves yet by the Trump administration to pull crypto deeper into the regulated banking framework. Crypto Firms Win Conditional Approval for National Trust Banks Circle and Ripple were among the applicants granted conditional approval to build national trust banks, a charter that allows them to custody assets and offer select banking services without taking deposits or issuing loans. The entrants now have 18 months to raise capital, assemble staff and build compliant infrastructure before facing a final exam from the OCC. Trust charters have historically been the realm of asset managers and insurers, but the crypto sector has increasingly sought them as a regulatory foothold that can streamline operations and remove intermediaries. The OCC also approved BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets and Paxos to convert existing state trust companies into federally chartered banks. JUST IN: The OCC just approved conditional national trust bank charters: Ripple. Paxos. BitGo. Fidelity Digital Assets. Circle. A national trust charter means federal supervision, 50-state reach, and the credibility to custody assets for ETFs, treasuries, and institutions… pic.twitter.com/DWQyX6jKsm — Simon Taylor (@sytaylor) December 12, 2025 The shift gives the firms the ability to operate under a single national standard rather than juggling a patchwork of state rules, a longstanding pain point for digital-asset custodians. For Paxos, the approval explicitly permits stablecoin issuance under federal oversight, while Ripple’s charter states it will not issue its US dollar-pegged RLUSD through the bank. Crypto firms argue that a national trust bank charter brings clarity and boosts client confidence, especially for custody and settlement services. Stablecoin issuers, in particular, view federal oversight as a way to assure corporate partners and distance themselves from lightly regulated competitors. Jonathan Gould, the Comptroller of the Currency, said the new entrants would help ensure that the federal banking system “keeps pace with the evolution of finance.” Crypto’s Push for Legitimacy Grows as Approvals and Listings Surge The approvals come as the crypto industry seeks broader legitimacy in Washington. The digital asset space has seen several notable public listings in 2025. Last month, tZero Group, a New York–based blockchain infrastructure firm focused on tokenized securities and real-world assets, announced that it is preparing to go public in 2026 . Before that, BitGo officially filed for an initial public offering , becoming the first dedicated crypto custodian to pursue a listing on a US stock exchange. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a splash with its IPO in June, surging more than sevenfold since going public. Online trading platform Etoro , which offers crypto trading among its services, debuted in May. Gemini, the exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO in June, signaling strong market confidence in crypto exchanges going public. More recently, Figure Technology Solutions Inc., a blockchain-focused lending platform, raised $787.5 million in its initial public offering . Ripple, by contrast, has said it has no plans to pursue an IPO.

Both of these developments were announced in the span of less than 24 hours. Yet, the price of the underlying asset has not felt any positive consequences and continues to struggle to remain above $2.00. Ripple’s Latest Wins CryptoPotato reported at the end of November that Ripple is having its best year on record, with massive acquisitions, such as Hidden Road, the conclusion of the lawsuit against the US SEC, as well as the launch of numerous spot XRP ETFs. However, its cross-border token has slumped by more than 40% since the July all-time high of $3.65 and is underwater YTD. As mentioned above, the company made two additional significant announcements on Friday that only build on its impressive 2025 performance. At first, the firm partnered with the Swiss-based AMINA Bank, which will use its stablecoin to support near-real-time cross-border payments for clients using Ripple Payments. Just a few hours later, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse outlined ‘huge news’ for the company he runs, indicating that it had received conditional approval from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to launch a national trust bank. Thus, Ripple joined other digital asset-related companies, such as Circle, BitGo, Paxos, and Fidelity, in obtaining such licenses. No Pump for XRP Such major news typically impacts the underlying asset. However, this hasn’t been the case with XRP lately. In the first month of the launch of the spot XRP ETFs in the US, the asset’s price has tumbled from above $2.50 to just over $2.00 as of now, even though the financial vehicles have seen impressive inflows of nearly $1 billion. The Friday announcements failed to stage a recovery for XRP either. In fact, the token slipped below $2.00 once again – for the second time in 36 hours – during the overall market-wide correction on Friday afternoon. Although it has managed to reclaim that level and to trade around $2.04 now, it’s still down nearly 20% in the past month. Moreover, it has lost over 40% of its value since its July all-time high, while the company behind it continues to notch new victories on different fronts. XRPUSD Dec 13.

In the news announced by the US Attorney’s Office of New York, Rinsch was found guilty. In the report, the 47 Ronin director was found guilty of one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering , with each of the counts carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Prosecutors were also able to secure a conviction on five counts of engaging in monetary transactions using property derived from unlawful activity. Each count is also carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years, with his sentencing already scheduled for April 17, 2026. 47 Ronin director convicted of wire fraud, money laundering According to the indictment that was unsealed in a Manhattan federal court on March 18, the 47 Ronin director reached an agreement with streaming platform Netflix in 2018 to produce episodes of a science fiction series called White Horse. Both parties agreed on payments, with Netflix paying $44 million for the initial episodes of the series, a payment that was made between 2018 and 2019. After spending the initial budget provided by Netflix, the streaming platform agreed to pay an additional $11 million, transferring the funds to him in March 2020 to complete the project. Federal prosecutors noted that while the payment for the series was completed, Rinsch refused to spend the additional budget on White House, holding off on the completion of the series. Prosecutors mentioned that within days of receiving the additional budget, Rinsch moved the money through several bank accounts, with the funds ending up in a personal brokerage account. The funds were then used to make several purchases, with the 47 Ronin director specifically focusing on digital assets. “His trading was unsuccessful, and within two months after receiving the additional funds, Rinsch had lost more than half of them,” the US Attorney’s Office stated. Rinsch spent additional funds on crypto The indictment noted that even after losing more than half of the $11 million, the 47 Ronin director did not spend the remaining funds on White Horse. Instead, he used the funds to purchase digital assets , personal expenses, and luxury items. These included at least $1.7 million on credit card bills, around $3.3 million on furniture, antiques, and mattresses. He also purchased a Swiss watch worth $387,000, and spent $2.4 million on five Rolls-Royces and a red Ferrari. Speaking on the conviction, United States Attorney Jay Clayton mentioned that Rinsch betrayed the trust of the other party in the business, spending the funds meant for the production of a TV show by gambling part of it on stock options and crypto transactions. “Today’s conviction shows that when someone steals from investors, we will follow the money and hold them accountable,” he added. Rinsch, a native of California, could be looking at a total of 90 days maximum in prison. The Maximum sentences in cases like these are prescribed by Congress, but the sentencing of any defendant will remain up to the judge. Meanwhile, Rinsch’s attorney argued that this verdict could set a precedent that would allow contractual and creative disputes between artists and financial backers to result in federal fraud charges.

Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher According to Solana’s announcement, the client moved out of a controlled testing phase and is now active for real-world validation. Traders pushed SOL up about 5%, with the token trading close to $140 during the initial move. Firedancer Goes Live On Mainnet During more than 100 days of controlled tests, a small set of validators produced more than 50,000 blocks without downtime, according to reports. Built in C and C++, Firedancer was made to handle heavy workloads and to lower the chance of network interruptions. Test environments reportedly showed the client processing over 1 million transactions per second, a figure that far exceeds current mainnet throughput. BREAKING: After 3 years of development, Firedancer is now live on Solana Mainnet, and has been running on a handful of validators for 100 days, successfully producing 50,000 blocks 🔥💃 pic.twitter.com/Y0WxxEj2WL — Solana (@solana) December 12, 2025 That high number comes from lab-style tests, not live traffic, and should be read as experimental performance rather than everyday capability. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko marked the transition as a step out of a long beta cycle for the network. Early Adoption And Stake Adoption is still small in terms of stake. The first Firedancer nodes hold under one percent of total staked SOL, and that share is expected to grow as operators add it to their setups. Reports have disclosed that a December rollout prompted more than 20% of validators to move from earlier experimental clients, showing a rapid shift among some operators. Running multiple validator clients reduces dependence on a single software implementation. If one client encounters a bug, others can keep block production running. That diversity mirrors how other large proof-of-stake chains operate. Why This Matters For Validators And Apps Validators and developers stand to benefit if Firedancer keeps meeting its goals. Faster or more reliable validation could mean more capacity for apps that need many transactions per second. For node operators, the option to mix clients offers an added safety net. Still, the network’s real-world load will be the true test, and watchers say they will be looking at uptime and performance over the coming weeks.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/21shares-xrp-is-more-affordable-and-reliable-than-swift-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) has drawn attention to a document from 21Shares that highlights the advantages that XRP has over traditional systems, such as SWIFT. The firm published a concise explanation of XRP’s role in payment systems, highlighting the structure of the XRP Ledger on its product page. This set the stage for a closer look at XRP’s position in global payments and its potential for future price strength. XRP’s Payment Utility Gains New Visibility The screenshot from 21Shares describes XRP as a digital asset designed to facilitate faster, more affordable, and more reliable cross-border payments, which are independent of legacy messaging rails. It also presents the XRP Ledger as decentralized and not controlled by a single company . These points match long-standing claims about the token’s design. This message is important because it comes from a regulated issuer and accurately presents technical details. 21Shares highlights the asset’s utility rather than promotional language. Its description focuses on transaction speed, cost efficiency, and operational independence from older settlement channels. This approach strengthens the perception that XRP serves a functional purpose in cross-border payments . 21Shares just IDENTIFIED XRP for a next-gen cross-border payment asset. Faster. More affordable. More reliable than SWIFT. Built on the decentralized $XRP Ledger not owned or controlled by ANY company.

This is the powerful vision behind a new proposal in the Ethereum ecosystem. An Ethereum developer has introduced ERC-8092, a draft standard designed to authenticate relationships between cross-chain account links . This innovation could fundamentally change how we manage assets and identity in a multi-chain world. What Are Cross-Chain Account Links and Why Do They Matter? In today’s fragmented blockchain landscape, your wallet on Ethereum is entirely separate from your wallet on Polygon or Arbitrum. Cross-chain account links aim to solve this by creating a publicly verifiable way to declare that two accounts on different chains belong to the same entity. The proposed ERC-8092 standard uses cryptographic signatures to make these links provable, transparent, and revocable. Think of it as creating a secure, digital handshake between your accounts. This handshake is not controlled by a central authority but is proven by math. Therefore, it allows for trustless verification that you control multiple addresses across various networks. How Does the ERC-8092 Proposal Actually Work? The core mechanism is elegantly simple. A user generates a special cryptographic signature payload. This payload acts as an unforgeable declaration stating, “Account A on Chain 1 and Account B on Chain 2 are linked under my control.” This proposal is then published on-chain. Declaration: The user publicly states the relationship between two specific accounts. Proof: Anyone can cryptographically verify the signature to confirm the link is authentic and authorized by the account holder. Revocation: If needed, the user can issue another transaction to invalidate the link, ensuring control remains in their hands. This process creates a foundational layer for more complex cross-chain interactions. It moves beyond simple asset bridges to enable verifiable identity and reputation portability. What Are the Tangible Benefits of Secure Cross-Chain Links? The potential applications are vast and transformative. By establishing reliable cross-chain account links , developers can build more sophisticated and user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps). Unified Identity: Your reputation, credentials, or social graph from one chain could be verifiably used on another. Enhanced Security: Dapps could require proof of ownership of a linked account on a more secure chain for sensitive operations on a less secure one. Streamlined User Experience: Instead of managing dozens of isolated wallets, users could have a more cohesive identity across ecosystems. Trustless Collateral: Protocols could accept collateral from a linked account on a different chain, verified through this standard. This standard doesn’t just connect assets; it aims to connect identity and intent across the blockchain universe. What Challenges Lie Ahead for ERC-8092? While promising, the path from draft to widely adopted standard is challenging. The proposal must undergo rigorous community review and technical scrutiny. Key questions remain about implementation details and potential attack vectors. Moreover, adoption requires buy-in from multiple blockchain communities beyond Ethereum. The true power of cross-chain account links is realized only when many networks support the standard. Interoperability, therefore, is the ultimate goal, not just a technical feature. The Future of a Truly Interconnected Blockchain World ERC-8092 represents a crucial step toward a more unified and functional multi-chain future. It provides a missing piece of infrastructure: a standard way to prove “you are you” across different digital realms. By solving the verifiable link problem, it unlocks a new wave of innovation in DeFi, gaming, and social dApps. In conclusion, the proposal for ERC-8092 is more than a technical specification. It is a blueprint for a more connected and user-centric blockchain ecosystem. As the draft evolves, it has the potential to transform isolated chains into a cohesive network of verifiable identities and relationships. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is ERC-8092 live and usable now? A: No, ERC-8092 is currently a draft proposal. It is in the early discussion phase within the Ethereum community and must go through a review and formalization process before becoming a live standard. Q: Do I need to do anything if this standard is adopted? A: Not immediately. As an end-user, you would only interact with this standard through wallet interfaces and dApps that choose to implement it. They would guide you through the process of creating or using cross-chain account links . Q: How is this different from a cross-chain bridge? A: Bridges move assets (like tokens) between chains. ERC-8092 verifies relationships between accounts (like proving ownership). It’s about identity and proof, not asset transfer, though it could be used to make bridges more secure. Q: Can someone else falsely link my account? A: No. The link requires a cryptographic signature that only the private key holder of the originating account can create. It is mathematically unforgeable, ensuring you have full control over which links are declared. Q: Will this work with non-EVM chains like Solana or Bitcoin? A: The proposal is designed for the Ethereum ecosystem, but the core concept could inspire similar standards on other chains. True universal interoperability would require collaboration across different blockchain architectures. Q: What happens if I lose access to one of the linked accounts? A: The standard includes a revocation mechanism. From your still-accessible linked account, you could issue a transaction to revoke the old link, preventing any misuse of the declared relationship.

The release date has not yet been confirmed. The romantic comedy is about a divorced couple who are seeking to get back the million-dollar crypto fortune they used to share. In the brief synopsis released by the streaming service on Thursday, the divorcees won the crypto assets during a cruise competition but fell out and forgot the wallet’s password. The couple will receive a notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission informing them they have just 48 hours to recover the $35 million before the claim expires. Jennifer Garner will star in ONE ATTEMPT REMAINING, a new comedy feature directed by Kay Cannon (Blockers). Years after an acrimonious divorce, two exes discover that the cryptocurrency they won together on a cruise is now worth millions…but they've forgotten the password. pic.twitter.com/k9gOcvIgyH — Netflix (@netflix) December 11, 2025 Hollywood actor Jennifer Garner is one of the main characters and producers of the film, working alongside Shawn Levy, Dan Levine of 21 Laps, and Nicole King of Linden Productions. Her first breakout came through the action spy series “Alias” in the early 2000s, but she later transitioned into romantic comedies and dramas, including “13 Going on 30” and “Juno.” Netflix romcom inspired by real-life lost password cases Netflix’s ‘One Last Attempt’ premise is similar to real-life cases where crypto investors lost access to vast sums due to forgotten credentials or discarded storage devices. An example is Stefan Thomas, a former Ripple chief technology officer, who lost access to an IronKey hard drive containing 7,002 Bitcoins deposited in 2011. At the time of publication, that stash was valued at roughly $640 million. According to Thomas, the device permanently erases its contents after 10 incorrect password attempts, and Thomas publicly stated he had already used eight attempts. As of December, the former Ripple developer has not yet revealed if he has ever regained access to the funds. Another tale belongs to James Howells, an IT worker from Wales who mined Bitcoin in its early days. In 2010, Howells used his personal laptop to mine around 8,000 coins now worth over $700 million, according to Arkham Intelligence data. Three years later, during a routine clean-up, his wife accidentally discarded the hard drive containing the private keys. Even after his repeated efforts to obtain permission from Newport City Council to excavate the site, including an offer to share a substantial portion of the recovered bitcoin, Howells was denied access. Netflix adds ‘One Last Attempt’ to crypto movies lineup Crypto and blockchain stories have appeared in popular culture over the past 15 years, but they have mostly been about crimes or scandals. Some featured titles include the 2020 action film “Money Plane” and the 2022 documentary “Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King,” which involved the collapse of the QuadrigaCX exchange. In 2024, Netflix released “Biggest Heist Ever,” a documentary detailing the $4.5 billion bitcoin laundering case involving Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan. The film showed how the couple attempted to hide the origins of the Bitcoin stolen during the 2016 hack of Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex, where 120,000 Bitcoin were taken. As reported by Cryptopolitan, US authorities arrested Morgan and Lichtenstein in 2022 after a warrant was issued by New York police, and the Department of Justice charged them with conspiracy to launder the stolen funds. 33-year-old Morgan was an entrepreneur and aspiring rapper from Chico, California, while her husband Lichtenstein, originally from Glenview, Illinois, was a tech enthusiast with interests in blockchain and automation with a psychology degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Its main pillar is a digital-asset treasury strategy built around RAIN — a protocol that allows users to create and trade markets on future events. The ""biotech pillar"" is now centered on knee osteoarthritis, where Allocetra has delivered encouraging six-month Phase IIa results across pain, function, and safety. ENLV's identity, risk profile, and drivers have fundamentally shifted, demanding a reset of investor expectations and valuation frameworks. A rather unusual corporate move In 2022, when we last wrote about Enlivex Therapeutics (ENLV) on Seeking Alpha, the company was a small Israeli biotech built around macrophage reprogramming, with Allocetra as its flagship program. Our analysis then focused on immunology, clinical signals, and the usual uncertainties of early-stage development. Three years later, that description no longer fits reality Enlivex has completely reshaped its identity, strategy, and financial structure. A $212M private placement, a new corporate purpose, a new board composition, and a new set of information materials for investors make clear that anyone looking at ENLV today is looking at a fundamentally different company. This short note exists simply to prevent confusion for readers who may come across our 2022 article and assume continuity with the present situation. What Enlivex Is Now: A ""Dual-Pillar"" Company The company now describes itself as having two pillars - one in prediction markets and digital assets, and one in continued clinical development. This dual structure is set out clearly in the December 2025 investor presentation . 1. Prediction Markets & the RAIN Treasury Strategy One of the two pillars is entirely new: a digital-asset treasury strategy centered on RAIN, a decentralized protocol for prediction markets - essentially, software that allows users to create and trade markets on future events. The company intends to accumulate substantial RAIN holdings, participate in staking and related yield mechanisms, and position itself as a public-market gateway to this emerging sector. Slides 3-17 in the December deck highlight: the rapid rise of prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi), growing institutional interest (ICE's $2B investment; a16z/Sequoia's $300M round), RAIN's design as a permissionless protocol for creating markets in any language, and, notably, an exclusive option permitting ENLV to acquire up to $918M of RAIN at a fixed price. This is not a side initiative. In the company's own materials, it is one of the two pillars defining what Enlivex is today. 2. Continued Development of Allocetra The second pillar is the continuation of the company's original biotech program, now focused on osteoarthritis, where macrophage imbalance plays a central role in chronic inflammation. The November 2025 clinical presentation makes this explicit. Key points include: clear positioning of KOA as the lead indication (pages 3-12), strong Phase IIa data in age-selected patients (pages 14-24), consistent improvements across pain and function endpoints, durability to six months, and a favorable safety profile. This was also reflected in the company's November news release: ENLV reported positive six-month efficacy results , confirming and extending earlier findings, and the stock briefly rose more than 20%. The December slide deck further notes very low projected COGS (page 26) and a streamlined plan toward the next clinical trial. In short, Allocetra is portrayed as remaining an active clinical program, and it forms the second component of the company's new identity. The ""Dual-Pillar"" Concept The company's materials present these two activities as co-equal pillars. At this stage, however, it is difficult not to retain a certain suspension of belief as to whether they will truly develop in parallel or whether the biotech pillar has become merely a side play. The scale of the capital raised, the prominence given to RAIN, and the strategic language all point to a company undergoing a profound reorientation. The appointment of Italy's former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to the board certainly took place to support the company's new positioning. Prediction markets sit where technology, finance, and regulation intersect. Bringing in a well-known international public figure likely aims to add visibility, legitimacy, and institutional weight to a strategy that might otherwise be difficult to introduce to mainstream investors. In short, we are not taking a view here on whether both pillars will ultimately receive the same operational attention or whether the dual framing exists to avoid the appearance of a straightforward reverse merger into a listed shell. Why This Short Article Is Necessary Because our 2022 piece is still the last Seeking Alpha coverage of ENLV, readers researching the ticker today could easily assume: that ENLV is still primarily a cell-therapy company, that sepsis or ARDS remain the central indications, or that standard biotech valuation frameworks still apply. None of this is accurate anymore. The company's identity, risk profile, and future drivers have all changed. Prediction markets and the RAIN strategy now form a major part of the thesis, while Allocetra remains a clinical program with fresh mid-stage data. This is not a full analysis of the new ENLV. For now, the aim is simply to reset expectations and clarify that the company we wrote about in 2022 i s not the company investors are looking at today . For regular investors, a position here would mainly rest on the asymmetric upside of riding alongside a large investing group that is deploying very substantial capital to achieve its objectives. We therefore maintain a HOLD rating (together with a small position) in recognition that, while the upside optionality may be significant, the risk-reward profile of the company's new direction remains highly speculative . A deeper understanding of the prospects for RAIN itself would go a long way toward clarifying the true risk profile of Enlivex's new strategy; we welcome informed perspectives from readers who follow the prediction-markets ecosystem closely.",ENLV,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-13 09:11:45

Key Takeaways: Wintermute’s Yoann Turpin and other crypto investors bought a rare triceratops fossil, signaling a shift from NFTs to ultra-scarce physical assets. The fossil sits in Singapore’s Le Freeport alongside tokenized gold, fine art and major crypto holdings. As some chase prestige collectibles, others push forward with regulated stablecoin projects in Malaysia. Wintermute co-founder Yoann Turpin and a small group of crypto investors have quietly purchased a fully intact dinosaur fossil, according to a recent Bloomberg report . The fossil, one of only 24 known specimens, now sits inside Le Freeport in Singapore, a fortress-like storage facility owned by crypto billionaire Jihan Wu and often described as “Asia’s Fort Knox.” Inside the Vault Where Crypto Wealth Meets Dinosaur Bones When Bloomberg’s Suvashree Ghosh visited the vault with Turpin and co-owners including collectibles entrepreneur Chaw Wei Yang, the dinosaur wasn’t the only surprise. The halls were lined with tokenized gold bars, fine art, rare wine, and hard drives holding hundreds of millions in digital assets, a real-world archive of crypto wealth that has spilled far beyond the blockchain, per the report. Turpin told the media that the splurge was partly passion, partly prestige, echoing a trend that has swept through the upper tiers of the industry. Just last year, Citadel’s Ken Griffin paid $44.6 million for a near-complete stegosaurus, the highest price ever for a fossil at auction. For crypto’s nouveau riche, the shift from NFTs to fossils marks a broader turn toward ultra-scarce, tangible collectibles, assets that can’t suddenly vanish in a protocol upgrade. However, while some crypto figures are digging up dinosaurs, others are building new digital-asset infrastructure.

Meta Retreats From Metaverse as AI Glasses Take Center Stage As reported, Meta is reducing investment in its metaverse division and shifting its focus to AI-powered glasses and wearable devices, reflecting one of its biggest strategic resets in years. The move follows rising investor skepticism over the commercial viability of virtual worlds and large-scale VR platforms. The company has spent more than a decade and billions of dollars building out its metaverse vision, including rebranding to Meta in 2021. However, user growth on Horizon Worlds has stagnated, and headset sales have repeatedly fallen short of expectations. Bloomberg reported that metaverse spending may be cut by as much as 30%, a signal to markets that the company is rebalancing priorities. Meanwhile, NFT sales have slumped to their lowest levels of the year, with monthly volume dropping to $320 million in November, roughly half of October’s total. Early December data shows only $62 million in sales during the first week, signaling that the slowdown is likely to continue as demand for digital collectibles weakens. The downturn reflects a steep drop in NFT valuations across the board. CoinGecko data shows the sector’s market capitalization has fallen to $3.1 billion, a 66% decline from January’s $9.2 billion peak.

While Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out, it seems that it’s MUTM’s latest entry into the world of cryptocurrencies that has set early investors’ tongues aflutter. With its presale picking up speed, a steadily expanding list of holders, and a DeFi strategy that focuses on decentralized lending, true yield, MUTM has now reached a point where it can be considered the best crypto to buy. Solana Rekindles Bullish Trend as SOL Maintains Important Support Level Solana (SOL) seems to be showing signs of fresh buy opportunities as it has bounced back from its rising base trend line and broken back above the midpoint of its rising channel. Technical analysis of SOL reveals an expanding rising channel, which suggests a buy setup unless it falls below the diagonal support line. Market players are now waiting for a reaction to take place around $133-$135, which acts as a major support zone, but $145-$148 acts as a resistance zone for now. A fall below the recent higher low would disrupt this positive setup. Such periods see investors with knowledge of the market look for new projects that are taking over with immediate functionality, hence introducing MUTM. XRP Sustains Trading Below 20-Day EMA as Buyers Target Important Levels XRP, as of now, appears to be in a coiling motion below the 20-day EMA, with bears failing to break through with a severe downside, keeping the token in a cautious consolidation zone. Market analysts are of the opinion that a break above $2.12 may unlock access to $2.26 as well as the downtrend line, but a move below $1.98 could lead to access to the support zone as well as $1.61. This seems to be a characteristic of all major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, which continue to dwell in a market that alternates between bouts of tranquility and sudden bursts of intense action, prompting investors to look for novel projects, with a focus on newcomers like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Speeds Up in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is increasingly being recognized as the best crypto to buy as it progresses in Phase 6 of its presale. The MUTM token, which currently costs $0.035, offers a last chance for investors before a 20% rise to $0.04 in Phase 7. With support from over 18,450 contributors and a total of over $19.33 million, it’s evident that the presale has received immense worldwide support. The transparency, innovative nature, and sustainable development of this project have seen MUTM emerge as a top choice among cryptocurrencies for those in search of practical DeFi application use. Utility-Driven Token Mutuum Finance stands out in that it has use-case-driven tokenomics, which focuses on utility over speculation. Every transaction on their platform fuels further demand for MUTM, launching a self-feeding mechanism that fuels further growth. Their dual lending mechanism facilitates Peer-to-Contract markets for assets like ETH and stablecoins, as well as Peer-to-Peer markets for riskier, illiquid assets. Fully over-collateralized loans with flexible fixed or variable interest rates help maintain protocol stability. A borrower, for instance, could borrow $750 in stablecoin with $1,000 of deposited ETH with a 75% LTV while watching APY grow in real-time. Mutuum Finance will launch mtTokens that will allow users to earn interest in real-time as they provide liquidity to the platform, unlike traditional platforms that earn interest when users withdraw their funds. Further, their Buy-and-Distribute model directs a part of the platform fees for purchasing and distributing MUTM tokens in their ecosystem. This ensures a consistent buying pressure in the market, and it immediately relates token value to platform activities.

In the statement issued by the ED, the proceeds of crime in these cases have amounted to Rs. 104.15 crore (approximately $11 million). According to the complaint, the Enforcement Directorate names Makbul Abdul Rehman Doctor, Kaashif Makbul Doctor, Mahesh Mafatlal Desai, Om Rajendra Pandya, and Mitesh Gokulbhai Thakkar as the accused in the cases. The ED claims the group was fingered in several cyber fraud schemes that have defrauded residents across the country since its inception. Enforcement Directorate files charges against five suspects The ED statement noted cases were based on the investigation carried out by the Surat Police’s special operations group (SOG), adding that one of the key accused, Bassam Doctor, has absconded and is currently on the run. The Enforcement Directorate noted that their investigations point out that Bassam Doctor is currently hiding in an Arab country. They believe he is the ultimate recipient of the proceeds of crime, noting that most of the illicit funds were sent to his crypto wallet. Law enforcement carried out several analyses of the devices and bank accounts seized from the suspects. In its statement, the Enforcement Directorate mentioned that the criminals spent crores of rupees through several e-commerce and online transactions to maintain their lavish lifestyle. The release mentioned that the ED arrested four of the accused in connection with investigations that kick-started in October 2025. In addition, three properties worth close to $1 million were also seized in connection with the case. The Enforcement Directorate claimed that the criminals carried out their illicit activities using fake stock/investment tips and digital assets scams. They sent out fake notices impersonating agencies like ED, TRAI, CBI, and the Supreme Court. They play on fear and other emotions to force people to part with their funds on some occasions, and digital assets on other occasions. For their digital assets, they set up a fake police station with fake uniformed men making bogus claims to unsuspecting victims. Indian police urge residents to be watchful The criminals were said to have also been issuing fake challans as proof of penalties paid, with the Enforcement Directorate noting that several notices were recovered at the crime scene. Extorted funds were first collected in the bank accounts of known entities who have been able to pass simple Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations. These accounts are known as mule accounts, usually used to move and layer illicit funds, before they are eventually moved into other mediums like digital assets. The criminals also link fraudulently obtained pre-activated SIM cards, making it easy to carry out their operations. After routing the funds through the bank accounts, they are then withdrawn in cash and also routed through several hawala channels, making it hard for regulators to make a definite trace, even if their transactions are intercepted. The funds are later moved into digital assets and stored in wallets that have not been KYC’ed. Meanwhile, the Indian police have issued a warning to residents concerning the growing rate of criminal activities tied to digital scams. They have urged residents to be careful about how they share their personal data on social media, urging them to make sure they are careful when interacting with unknown entities. They also urged residents to seek professional help anytime someone proposes an investment opportunity to them online.

This has been defined in a research study that puts Bitcoin as a diversification tool and a currency hedge, but not a core investment. According to the report signed by Itaú strategist Renato Eid, Bitcoin operates differently compared to common classes of assets, such as equities, fixed income, and domestic markets. The document observes that the decentralized and global character of Bitcoin may cause it to respond differently to various drivers as compared to local financial instruments. Itaú argues that this structural variance enables the bank to become one of the complementary assets, even in the face of heightened volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Allocation rationale and currency dynamics According to Itaú’s analysis , the proposed 1% to 3% allocation range aims to strike a balance between exposure and risk. According to the bank, volatile assets are usually unpredictable in the short term, and a long-term investment date is more appropriate. The report also examines Bitcoin’s performance in 2025, focusing on the role of foreign exchange movements in shaping outcomes for Brazilian investors. Bitcoin started the year near $93,500 and later traded between lows around $80,000 and highs above $125,000. While price volatility was large, Itaú notes that currency appreciation amplified local losses. Even though the price volatility was high, Itaú observes that the appreciation of the currency enhanced local losses. According to TradingView data used in the report, the U.S. dollar fell on average by 3.5% throughout the year, and the value of Bitcoin dropped by 16.2% against the Brazilian real. Eid observes that the movements of the exchange rates directly affect the local performance of Bitcoin. The report mentions December 2024, when the dollar was expected to have reached close to R$6.30, strengthening Bitcoin positions in Brazil and its use as a form of currency protection during times of stress. Bitcoin market access and recent price action Itaú also offers exposure to Bitcoin through its Íon investment platform and the BITI11 exchange-traded fund, both of which are listed on B3. The two solutions also allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations without being entangled in custody and operational processes. The report also states that B3 is on the verge of entering into a new era of large-scale tokenization beginning in 2026, which potentially would extend digital assets into the Brazilian capital markets. According to recent market reports, Bitcoin has experienced another period of short-term volatility. The price has fallen by 2.5% over the past 24 hours, currently trading at $90,300. The Itaú report concludes that in this kind of environment, characterized by low supply, currency sensitivity, and volatile prices, a small position assignment of 1-3% renders Bitcoin a suitable diversification tool, rather than a core asset.

The current $0.035 pricing has remained a central reference point in recent crypto news today, especially as observers assess what crypto to buy now based on verifiable development progress rather than speculative narratives. With presale participation expanding and the project confirming multiple infrastructure updates, MUTM continues to appear in discussions alongside top cryptocurrencies monitored by research groups. Presale Momentum and Phase Progress Phase 6 is reported as 98% filled, with the token priced at $0.035. Once this allocation is completed, Phase 7 will begin at a higher rate of $0.04. The project reports that $19,330,000 has been raised so far, and the total holder count stands at 18,450. These figures reflect consistent participation across earlier stages and have kept MUTM visible during conversations about what crypto to invest in from an informational perspective. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also expanded its user interface to include a dashboard displaying a leaderboard of the top 50 holders. This addition forms part of its broader effort to maintain ongoing transparency while the presale continues. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a 100,000-dollar giveaway distributed across ten prizes of 10,000 dollars. Interested users may access the $100,000 giveaway and opt in. Alongside this, the project operates a 24-hour leaderboard that resets at 00:00 UTC. The highest-ranked user each cycle receives $500 in MUTM provided they complete at least one transaction within the window. These systems function as engagement mechanisms rather than valuation indicators and have been highlighted neutrally within coverage of top cryptocurrencies in presale stages. Card Purchases for MUTM Tokens Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently introduced a feature allowing users to purchase tokens using bank cards without imposed limits. The update was confirmed through the project’s communication channel and is already accessible. This addition has been noted as a convenience layer for participants who prefer direct on-ramp access while following the structured presale model. MUTM Price Prediction and Comparative Analysis Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is scheduled to list at 0.06 dollars, and Phase 6 buyers would observe a theoretical difference of roughly 300% if the launch price is met. Any price projection for a developing protocol must be treated as speculative, yet analysts often use comparable historical cases to frame potential directional scenarios. A commonly referenced analogy involves Cardano (ADA) during its 2020–2021 expansion phase. ADA traded near 0.02 dollars in early 2020 before advancing to approximately $3.10 at its 2021 peak. The move unfolded across roughly 18 months and delivered an ROI exceeding 15,000%. Analysts who compare MUTM’s structured rollout to ADA’s earlier developmental period do so mainly to illustrate how strong user participation, consistent development activity, and transparent communication can correlate with improved visibility once a protocol transitions from presale to live deployment. This does not guarantee similar results, but the historical reference provides context for how market participants interpret early-stage DeFi launches. Based on the combination of structured pricing, presale participation, and the confirmed technical rollout, some analysts frame a speculative near-term post-launch range of $0.06 to $0.08 as plausible under neutral market conditions. Scenarios above this range would depend on broader DeFi activity, exchange liquidity, and how users respond to the protocol after its initial testnet phase. As with any projection, this is not a prediction of future returns but rather an outline of how similar early-stage developments have been evaluated historically. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s progress through Phase 6, the introduction of new accessibility features, and its confirmed technical roadmap continue placing it within ongoing commentary about what crypto to buy now from an informational perspective. Readers should conduct independent research when comparing top cryptocurrencies and forming individual assessments of project maturity, risk levels, and long-term potential.

Cryptoes (@cryptoes_ta), a well-known technical analyst, recently posted a chart showing a setup expected to change XRP’s trajectory. The analyst highlighted a horizontal level that once acted as firm support. The price moved sharply higher after it touched that level in June. While many saw this level as XRP’s bottom, the asset experienced a swift resurgence shortly after hitting it. It’s worth noting that the market is around the same zone, which raises interest among those who follow long-term structures . This level market the bottom back in June | Huge moment for #XRP pic.twitter.com/Nkyl58NRYU — Cryptoes (@cryptoes_ta) December 11, 2025 XRP Price Returns to a Key Support Zone XRP trades close to $2.01 on the chart provided. The candles show a long decline from the previous peak of $3.65. The move down formed lower highs and steady pressure. Traders watch the current test of support because the chart shows several reactions near this zone over time. The earlier bounce from this level produced a strong advance that carried the asset to its all-time high in July . That move formed a clean and aggressive trend in a short period. The present structure looks different in tempo but comparable in its test of the same support. Market participants track repeated levels because buyers often respond at familiar prices. XRP now sits near that same floor. The chart highlights a narrow range with repeated closes near $2.01. That behavior signals tension before a larger move . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price: Evaluating the Current Setup The post by Cryptoes gained interest because it links the current price zone to a historic pivot. The comment that this is a “huge moment” reflects the view that a clear reaction often follows such tests. If buyers can defend this level again, XRP could experience another notable rally. Other analysts have bullish expectations for XRP , and retesting this support could kickstart that run. The chart also shows several failed attempts to push the price below the support level. Wicks extend under the line, but closures remain near or above it. That pattern suggests buyers attempt to absorb selling pressure each time the price dips. If sellers prevail, the structure could break down and push XRP deeper. However, if buyers can hold the level, the market could form a base suitable for a sustained advance.

The token is currently hovering above the $2 mark, a price area that has repeatedly acted as a structural floor in recent months. Now, fresh insights suggest this support is under sustained pressure, putting downside targets firmly back into focus, according to an outlook shared by Ali Martinez in an X post on December 13. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Ali_charts According to his analysis, on the higher time frame, XRP has shifted from strong upside expansion into a clear downtrend defined by lower highs and lower lows. XRP key price levels After topping above $3.40 earlier in the year, momentum faded, with the price breaking below key supports at $2.60 and $2.25. Each subsequent rebound has weakened, pointing to declining bullish conviction and a firmly bearish market structure. The key development is XRP’s consolidation just above $2, marked by tightening price action and lower volatility. While this signals indecision, following an extended decline, it more often points to downside continuation rather than recovery. Technically, $2 is a key psychological and structural support for XRP. A decisive break below it would confirm the loss of long-term support and open the way for a drop toward $1.20, a level aligned with past consolidation and historical reactions. Once $2 fails, selling pressure could accelerate as stop-losses are triggered. Notably, in recent sessions, XRP has been weighed down by broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, which has seen the asset briefly dip below $2 alongside reported outflows of about $6 billion. Still, there are hints of a possible rebound, as ETF inflows remain strong and investors appear to be moving tokens off exchanges, a signal that can precede price stabilization or recovery. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.04, up about 0.5% over the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the asset has posted a similar gain. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Meanwhile, XRP’s troubles are further reflected in its technical positioning, as the token remains below both its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.27 and its 200-day SMA of $2.60. This setup signals a persistent downtrend across both short- and long-term horizons, with the wider gap to the 200-day average pointing to deeper bearish momentum. Complementing this, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) at 41.51 sits in neutral territory but leans toward mild oversold conditions, suggesting selling pressure is easing, though not yet at levels that typically trigger a strong rebound.

According to mining data provider Hashrate Index, Bitcoin’s hash price stands at about $38.56 per petahash second per day (PH/s/day), down from roughly $55 per PH/s/day in Q3 2025. Thus, companies like Sangha Renewables are using more renewable energy for their operations. According to TheMinerMag’s research, the firm recently energized a 20-megawatt (MW) solar-powered mining facility in Ector County, Texas , in partnership with TotalEnergies. Due to its deregulated power market, abundant renewable resources, and flexible grid infrastructure, Texas has become one of the world’s leading locations for Bitcoin mining. In the state, most mining companies participate in demand response programs, which enable them to shut down operations during periods of peak electricity demand in exchange for grid credits or compensation. Under the agreement, Sangha is responsible for the mining facility and its equipment. At the same time, TotalEnergies will supply retail electricity, offering firm power when solar energy is unavailable and providing tools to manage price volatility. Phoenix Group and Canaan companies are focusing on renewable energy Phoenix Group had also announced in November that it had started a 30-megawatt hydro-powered mining operation in Ethiopia, while in September, Canaan and Soluna partnered to deploy a wind-powered mining site in Texas’s Briscoe County. Canaan is also innovating a mining rig that dynamically adjusts energy usage with AI while balancing electrical loads. Overall, Bitcoin miners are facing tough times, with falling rewards driving profit margins to their most challenging levels ever. Analysts have noted that the nearly 40% drop in Bitcoin to around $81,000 by late November has made each block reward worth less in dollars, directly impacting mining revenue. Moreover, in early November 2025, network difficulty also increased to 156 trillion, a 6.3% rise, which heightened competition among miners and reduced the coins each miner earns per unit of computing power. Additionally, following the April 2024 halving, each block now yields 3.125 BTC instead of 6.25, immediately halving the rewards available to miners. The pressure from halving, low Bitcoin prices, near-peak difficulty, and minimal transaction fees has sent hash price to historic lows. However, some have instead sought alternative ways to reduce costs by shutting down rigs and offloading surplus equipment. A recent reading of the hash ribbon, a technical indicator based on Bitcoin hashrate averages, has signaled a major capitulation among miners. Bitcoin’s total mining hashrate is still increasing Still, Bitcoin’s total mining hashrate, representing the computing power protecting the protocol, is at an all-time high. Though it fluctuates day-to-day, the overall trend is rising, reaching one zetahash in April. An expanding hashrate means miners must scale up computing power to stay competitive. In November, Tether stated that rising energy prices compelled it to scale back its mining operations in Uruguay. Meanwhile, the ROI (return on investment), under today’s economics, has ballooned to roughly 1,000 days or more, including for the latest ASIC machines . The timeline is critical because it’s longer than the wait to the next halving. With roughly 850 days until 2028, machines purchased today will face a 50% reward cut before breaking even, reducing the odds that they will ever recoup their costs unless economic conditions improve significantly.

Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano have also declined over the past day by up to 4% in the case of ETH, which is just inches above $3,100. BTC Defends $90K The primary cryptocurrency had quite a volatile trading week, mostly influenced by the Wednesday FOMC meeting. As the anticipation built about another interest rate cut by the central bank, BTC skyrocketed from under $90,000 to a new multi-week peak of $94,500 on Tuesday. It retreated slightly before the meeting, but once the Fed made the 25 bps rate reduction official, bitcoin went on the offensive once again, but was capped at $94,400. This time, the rejection was more violent and resulted in a price drop to under $89,500. The bulls initiated another leg up to $93,600 on Thursday, but BTC couldn’t keep climbing. It calmed at $92,500 by Friday when it suddenly dumped by around three grand before it quickly reclaimed the $90,000 support.

According to several blockchain investigators on social platform X, the attack occurred just six days after the platform upgraded its oracle infrastructure and option creation procedures. They used a smart contract prompt to extract hundreds of Ethereum tokens and other digital assets. The old contract of @ribbonfinance has been drained for a total of $2.7M.

Ribbon Finance’s oracle price upgrade had weaknesses Six days before the attack, Ribbon Finance’s team updated the oracle pricer to support 18 decimals for stETH, PAXG, LINK, and AAVE . However, other assets, including USDC, were still at eight decimals, and according to Zhou, the discrepancy in decimal precision contributed to the vulnerability that was exploited on Friday. The latest @ribbonfinance attack appears to be a oracle configuration fault. 6 days ago, the owners updated the oracle pricer which uses 18 decimals price for stETH, PAXG, LINK and AAVE.

The malicious activity began with the creation of poorly structured option products, where one product consisted of a stETH call option with a 3,800 USDC strike, collateralized with WETH, set to expire on December 12. The attacker then created several oTokens for these options, which were later exploited to drain the protocol. The attack involved repeated interactions with the proxy admin contract at 0x9D7b…8ae6B76. Some functions, like transferOwnership and setImplementation, were used to manipulate the price-feed proxies through delegate calls. The hacker invoked an implementation for the oracle to set asset expiry prices at the same timestamp to cause ExpiryPriceUpdated events that confirmed the fraudulent valuations. The manipulated prices made the system recognize stETH as being far above the strike price and burned 225 oTokens, yielding 22.468662541163160869 WETH. In total, the hacker extracted approximately 900 ETH through this method. Web3 security firm Spectre spotted the initial transfers to a wallet address at 0x354ad…9a355e, but from there, the money was distributed to 14 more accounts, with many holding around 100.1 ETH each. Some of the stolen funds have already entered what blockchain Zhou referred to as “TC” or treasury consolidation pools. DeFi lending protocol builder: Opyn dApp was not compromised According to Monarch DeFi developer Anton Cheng, Coinbase-backed decentralized application Opyn was not compromised as rumored in chatter on Crypto Twitter. I took a look at the Ribbon hack since I might be responsible. Here's what I found so far: 1. @opyn_ wasn’t hacked; it's actually a fork from @ribbonfinance_ . 2. The hack was mainly triggered by an upgraded oracle code that let anyone set prices for new assets. This, when… https://t.co/AcF2p495OM pic.twitter.com/BH2rAvNPmP — Anton Cheng (@antonttc) December 13, 2025 Cheng explained that the Ribbon Finance hack was facilitated by an upgraded oracle code that inadvertently allowed any user to set prices for newly added assets. He denoted that the attack began with a preparatory transaction to “set the stage” by generating poorly structured oTokens with legitimate collateral and strike assets. He continued to say that the fake tokens allowed the hacker to pick well-known underlyings like AAVE to avoid drawing attention and getting flagged. The hacker then set up three “subaccounts,” each depositing minimal collateral to mint all three options. All subaccounts were marked as type 0, meaning they were fully collateralized, but the absence of a maximum payout limit for each account or oToken helped the perpetrator drain assets without any restrictions. Under Opyn’s Gamma systems, the underlying asset must match the collateral for call options and the strike for puts to keep sellers fully collateralized. If an oracle is compromised, only sellers for that specific product are meant to suffer. Yet in this case, the combination of new oToken creation and the manipulated oracle were enough to bypass these protections. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Malatsi’s policy received over 19,000 public submissions and approximately 90% of those were in support of the approach which disproves the idea that the policy especially favors Elon Musk and his company. Starlink can now launch in South Africa South African Communications Minister Solly Malatsi has finalized a controversial policy directive published on Friday that instructs the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa to align its ownership regulations with the national empowerment framework by recognizing equity equivalent investment programs. Starlink has been unable to launch in South Africa for years because the current ICASA rules require telecommunications companies to sell 30% of their equity to historically disadvantaged individuals. Starlink has consistently refused, stating it does not sell equity in any market where it operates. But now under the new directive, multinational companies that cannot sell equity due to global shareholding structures can instead make substantial investments in local development programs. These equity equivalent investment programs must be worth either 30% of the company’s South African operations value or 4% of annual local revenue. The programs require approval and monitoring by the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition. According to the department, more than 19,000 submissions were received during the public comment period, with only about 15,000 being substantial. Approximately 90% of submissions supported the EEIP proposals. The policy directive clarifies that ICASA participated in developing the ICT sector empowerment code and that all government organs must apply it. It also states that ICASA’s decision to exclude large portions of the code from its regulations, including provisions for equity equivalents, is not legally permissible. Malatsi stressed that the directive applies equally to all telecommunications companies, which satisfies telecoms operators like Vodacom and MTN. The companies argued that existing licensees should have the same options as new ones. Starlink has already outlined plans to invest nearly R2 billion in South Africa. The company proposed investing R500 million to connect approximately 5,000 schools to high-speed internet, benefiting about 2.4 million students. Ryan Goodnight, Starlink’s Senior Director of Market Access, has stated the company will partner with local internet service providers to install and maintain infrastructure using an open-access model. The company has also pledged to establish a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment-compliant South African subsidiary. What happens next for Starlink’s licensing process? Before Starlink can operate, ICASA must still go through a formal process involving public consultations, regulatory hearings, and legal finalization to amend its ownership regulations. Telecommunications expert Dominic Cull has warned that even with political support, the full regulatory amendment process could take 12 to 18 months or longer. The Department of Communications and Digital Technologies aims to finalize the EEIP policy by March 2026, and some experts predict Starlink may not launch in South Africa until late 2027. In May 2025, ICASA announced investigations into South Africans engaging in unauthorized Starlink use through equipment obtained from international sources. The Economic Freedom Fighters and some civil society groups have strongly criticized the policy. They argue it allows foreign companies to avoid meaningful transformation and undermines the spirit of Black Economic Empowerment. The EFF has threatened legal challenges if the policy is implemented. More than 20% of South Africa’s population still does not actively use the internet despite widespread mobile network coverage. Affordability remains the primary barrier, along with device costs. Minister Malatsi has argued that the deployment limits for fiber infrastructure in remote regions have been met, and therefore, satellite technology is essential for achieving universal connectivity goals. Minister Malatsi defended against accusations that the policy favors Starlink specifically clarifying that no exemptions have been granted exclusively to any company, as other multinationals like Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and JP Morgan already use EEIPs in South Africa in other sectors. Amazon’s Project Kuiper and Eutelsat OneWeb are also considering entering into the South African market, and if they or other companies are willing to compromise on ownership requirements and accept the 30% equity rule, they may reach the market first despite Starlink’s stronger brand and larger operational capabilities. The regulatory changes, if fully implemented, would establish South Africa as taking a different approach than some African neighbors. Countries like Kenya, Rwanda, and Nigeria have adopted more flexible regulatory frameworks that have attracted digital technology investment more quickly. South African policymakers worry about losing competitiveness if their regulatory environment is perceived as unnecessarily restrictive. Get seen where it counts.

Each brings a different type of utility to the market, yet analysts consistently highlight Ozak AI as the frontrunner due to its early-stage valuation and real-time intelligence engine already functioning before launch. While XRP and BNB offer strong, reliable upside, Ozak AI introduces a compounding, AI-driven growth curve that has quickly made it the most aggressively forecasted altcoin heading into 2025–2026. Ozak AI Takes the Lead Ozak AI’s rise has been nothing short of explosive as the project establishes itself as a foundational intelligence layer for Web3. Its ability to interpret blockchain conditions in milliseconds, deploy SINT-powered autonomous agents for real-time strategy automation, and process HIVE’s ultra-fast 30 ms execution signals gives it unmatched analytical depth. With Perceptron Network’s 700K+ nodes feeding live multi-chain data, Ozak AI becomes smarter and more accurate with every data cycle—creating a compounding utility model rarely seen in presale-stage assets. This is why analysts assign Ozak AI some of the strongest ROI projections in the entire market. The project’s early-stage valuation, fully functional infrastructure, and fast-growing Ozak AI Presale —now exceeding $4.9 million—confirm strong early conviction. As Ozak AI integrates across trading tools, predictive dashboards, and automated on-chain systems, its exponential growth curve becomes even more compelling. XRP Holds a Powerful Long-Term Structure XRP trades near $2 and maintains one of the strongest long-term technical structures among major altcoins. Support at $1.96 stabilizes its short-term trend, while deeper levels at $1.90 and $1.84 reinforce its macro foundation—a setup that has historically preceded major upside bursts. XRP begins forming bullish continuation once it approaches resistance at $2.10, with higher challenge zones at $2.16 and $2.23 marking the classic ignition levels seen in previous cycles. XRP’s major value drivers remain its enterprise adoption, cross-border settlement utility, and increasing institutional attention following regulatory clarity. Analysts still project a pathway toward $5–$10 during a full market expansion. Yet despite its strength, XRP’s growth remains more linear and liquidity-driven — making it powerful, but not as explosive as early-stage, intelligence-driven assets like Ozak AI . BNB Remains a Top Performer With High Reliability BNB trades around $900 and continues operating as one of the most fundamentally sound and utility-rich tokens in the crypto market. Support at $880 protects the immediate trend, while deeper structural zones at $862 and $839 hold long-term accumulation. BNB begins developing upward continuation once it retests resistance at $928, with upper challenge levels at $953 and $978 historically acting as major breakout zones. BNB’s strength comes from the sheer scale of the Binance ecosystem—exchange utility, token burns, staking, trading incentives, and liquidity depth all drive consistent demand. Analysts continue projecting BNB toward $1,600–$1,700 during the next peak. But like XRP, its upside is limited by maturity; BNB may double or triple, but its massive market cap naturally caps exponential breakout potential. Ozak AI Dominates ROI Models for 2025–2026 XRP brings institutional-grade utility. BNB brings unmatched ecosystem depth. Ozak AI brings machine-speed, real-time intelligence that compounds over time. This is the core reason analysts rank Ozak AI, XRP, and BNB as the top three altcoins for breakout potential—with Ozak AI leading by a wide margin in ROI projections. Its early-stage valuation, fully operational predictive infrastructure, cross-chain AI capabilities, and accelerating presale adoption all point toward exponential upside that neither XRP nor BNB can match at this stage. As markets prepare for the next bullish wave, these three assets form a powerful trio—but Ozak AI stands above them as the top high-ROI opportunity of the upcoming cycle.

The warning comes after the September breach of the Shibarium bridge, which caused significant losses for the DeFi platform and its users. K9 Finance has given the Shiba Inu team a deadline of January 6, 2026, to fully compensate affected users, or risk a formal review of their partnership, according to a message from its decentralized autonomous account (DAO) official X account published on Thursday. The September hack cost K9 Finance more than $700,000 in KNINE tokens, in addition to other crypto assets including Ethereum (ETH), Shiba Inu (SHIB), LEASH, ROAR, and TREAT. After the attack, the Shiba Inu team offered the hacker a reward of 50 ETH and the promise of no criminal prosecution in exchange for not returning the stolen funds. At the same time, K9 Finance issued a 5 ETH bounty for the return of frozen tokens. K9 Finance DAO issues ultimatum to Shibarium devs According to K9 Finance, the platform adhered to all protocols requested by Shiba Inu during the post-hack recovery process. The team claims it kept communication channels with the Shiba Inu team open throughout the months following the attack, but that correspondence eventually ceased. “K9 Finance DAO has followed every step requested by the Shib team regarding the Shibarium bridge hack and the process to make affected users whole… At this time, we have received no further communication or guidance in any of our private chats with the Shib team. The decision should not be interpreted as an attempt to create drama. It is a necessary step to provide clarity to our holders and ensure responsible governance.” K9 Finance DAO As reported by Cryptopolitan in mid-September, the attack began with a flash loan used to acquire 4.6 million BONE tokens. This temporarily granted the attacker control over two-thirds of validator voting power on Shibarium’s Layer-2 network. The hacker used the vulnerability to extract 224.5 ETH, valued at roughly $1.03 million, and 92.6 billion SHIB, worth about $1.27 million. Other tokens, including Doge Killer (LEASH), Shiba Inu’s TREAT, and Shifu (SHIFU), were also stolen but were moved days after the breach, according to blockchain records. The breach came from a compromised checkpoint where the perpetrators inserted a fraudulent Merkle root. After this malicious root was added, the attacker executed a large transaction to drain approximately $1 million, which ballooned to $2.8 million at the time of this reporting. Out of the twelve validator signing keys, ten approved the hacker’s malicious root state and withdrew the assets, with only validators run by K9 Finance and UnificationUND shunning the request. “If no complete restitution is provided by that date, the DAO will formally convene and vote on our future relationship with Shibarium, including whether continued business on the chain remains viable for the long-term health of the K9 ecosystem,” the organization’s statement concluded. Shiba Inu down 36% after Shibarium smart contract hack The hack and the ensuing dispute rattled the broader Shiba Inu ecosystem, leading to a 36% price downturn in the SHIB token, which was trading at $0.00000826 on Saturday morning. The price level is a few points above its year-to-date low of $0.00000753, although the coin is 70% below its year-on-year highs. Following news of the exploit, SHIB initially spiked to $0.0000148 but fell to $0.0000137 within 24 hours, a 7.4% decline. Yet, despite the turbulence in the Shibarium ecosystem, there are indications that Shiba Inu’s fundamentals may be improving. One positive metric is token burn activity, which saw its rate increase by 170% on Friday, bringing the total tokens burned since inception to over 410.75 billion. The number of SHIB tokens held on exchanges dropped to 288.75 trillion from this month’s high of 366.1 trillion, and could mean the market is exhibiting stronger buying interest towards Christmas. Whales, or large investors, have increased their holdings significantly, currently controlling 96.67 billion tokens, up from this week’s low of 1.36 billion. Don’t just read crypto news.

This time around, he outlined the technical formation that could spark a parabolic surge for the altcoin as it eyes the $27 target. How The XRP Price Could Reach $27 In an X post, Egrag Crypto stated that the Linear Regression targets for the XRP price are $3.4, $10, and $27. He further explained that, as of this month, these three major price levels stand out based on the long-term Logarithmic Linear Regression Channel. The analyst then touched on each price target and how XRP could reach there. Related Reading: XRP Price Needs To Hold This Macro Support For Hope Of Revival Egrag Crypto described the $3.40 target for the XRP price as the mean reversion. He stated that a retest and rejection from $3.40 would be one of the strongest bearish TA signals for the altcoin. The analyst further remarked that this target is based solely on chart structure, not fundamentals. He added that a close above this level means that XRP is officially back in macro bullish territory. Furthermore, the analyst stated that the $10 target for the XRP price is the upper midline. He explained that this is where full bull expansion normally accelerates and that the target rises with time because this channel is logarithmic. Lastly, Egrag Crypto highlighted $27 as the top of the channel. He noted that multiple long-term confluences point to this target for the altcoin. Notably, this XRP price prediction comes amid several bullish fundamentals for the altcoin. Ripple was just granted a conditional approval for its national trust bank charter, which could boost XRP’s adoption. XRP also just expanded to Solana with Hex Trust’s launch of its wrapped XRP token for DeFi purposes. Meanwhile, Swiss bank AMINA Bank has integrated Ripple payments, which utilize XRP. The Major Levels To Watch Haven’t Changed Crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the major levels for the XRP price haven’t changed. The macro supports are $2.03 and $1.64. On the other hand, the macro resistance is $2.41, which a break above would confirm a bullish scenario for the altcoin. The analyst remarked that if a break above $2.41 happens, the next measured targets stand around $2.75 and $2.90. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rise To $14 By Frontrunning Bitcoin By Over 600% However, if the XRP price breaks below the macro support at $2.03, CasiTrades predicts that the altcoin could fall below $1.97 and decline towards the $1.64 major support. She reiterated that there is no official confirmation yet on the next potential move for XRP. Interestingly, the world’s largest IQ holder, YoungHoon Kim, stated that XRP has a strong possibility of reaching a new ATH by the end of this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.01, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Here’s the Signal",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-about-to-explode-buckle-up-heres-the-signal/,"Crypto markets often deliver their biggest moves when attention fades and patience thins. Extended consolidation usually precedes sharp expansion, not collapse. XRP now sits at a crossroads where history, structure, and sentiment quietly converge. What looks calm on the surface might be hiding a big move brewing beneath. This is the stage where long-term trends are typically born. That perspective gained momentum after an analysis shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO, which reignited discussion around XRP’s macro structure. His work does not focus on hype or short-term price noise; instead, it centers on historical market behavior and structural repetition. This approach has drawn attention from traders seeking high-confidence setups. #XRP is about to explode, just like it did in 2017. Buckle up! pic.twitter.com/Wc048ti664 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 12, 2025 Revisiting XRP’s 2017 Breakout In 2017, XRP delivered one of the most aggressive rallies in crypto history. Price climbed from approximately $0.006 to nearly $3.84 within one cycle. That move represented a gain exceeding 64,000 percent. Importantly, the rally did not begin during peak excitement; it started after months of sideways price compression. During that period, volatility narrowed and sellers gradually exhausted, accumulation quietly replaced distribution across higher timeframes. Once resistance broke, momentum accelerated rapidly. The move shocked late participants who underestimated structural buildup. That historical context forms the foundation of today’s comparison. The Current Market Structure in Focus Steph’s analysis compares the 2017 structure with the current conditions. The similarities extend beyond price levels or visual symmetry. XRP has spent several years forming a wide consolidation range. This type of base often reflects long-term capital positioning. Higher lows are now emerging with increasing consistency. Price behavior suggests stabilization rather than speculative excess. Momentum remains controlled, not euphoric. Such characteristics typically define early expansion phases and favors continuation over sudden exhaustion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Structure Matters More Than Hype Market cycles rarely repeat exactly, but structure often rhymes. Long-term charts capture investor psychology across time. Fear dominates accumulation phases, while disbelief delays participation; that emotional sequence appears to be unfolding again. Steph’s analysis emphasizes behavior, not predictions. The comparison does not claim guaranteed outcomes. Instead, it highlights conditions that historically preceded major moves. This distinction separates disciplined analysis from speculation, and strengthens the credibility of the signal. Institutional Narratives and ETF Influence Broader market dynamics are also shifting beneath the surface. Institutional involvement in crypto continues expanding globally. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already transformed market access and liquidity. This development has renewed interest in large-cap digital assets. XRP remains a frequent subject within these discussions. Narratives alone do not drive rallies, but they can amplify momentum, when structure and narrative align, price reactions tend to intensify. Historically, XRP has responded strongly under such conditions. Caution, Confirmation, and the Road Ahead Despite the compelling setup, confirmation remains essential. Regulatory frameworks and liquidity conditions differ from 2017. These factors may influence the pace of any potential breakout. They do not, however, invalidate the structural signal. XRP now trades within a narrowing decision zone, the coming months may determine its next macro direction. Whether history echoes or diverges will soon become clear. For now, the signal has emerged, and the market is watching closely. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a major crackdown against financial crime, the CBI claimed it apprehended suspects who carried out illicit activities using digital assets. In its statement, the CBI mentioned that during the raid , it was able to capture six suspects, with funds of about Rs. 1.88 crore (approximately $207,000) in cash–one of the biggest seizures in busts of this nature–recovered from the criminals. The arrested suspects have been identified as Shubham Sing, who uses the alias Domnic, Daltanlian, known as Michael, George T Zamlianlal, known as Miles, L Seiminlen Haokip, known as Ronny, Magkholun, known as Maxy, and Robert Thangkhankhual, who used the aliases David and Munroin. CBI busts criminals targeting United States citizens According to the CBI, the criminal syndicate has been operating since 2022, targeting United States nationals in several scams. Authorities also claimed that the criminals have netted more than $8 million from these scams. The operation, which led to their arrest, was carried out by the CBI, which acted on intelligence provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The statement mentioned that the accused operated under several pseudonymous identities of officials from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the FBI, and the Social Security Administration (SSA). They carried out a complex conspiracy to con American citizens, successfully scamming unsuspecting victims of their hard-earned funds. Their modus operandi involved calling and threatening United States residents, the CBI said in its statement. The CBI claimed that in some cases, the criminals would call residents of the United States, telling them that their Social Security Numbers (SSN) were involved in money laundering and drug delivery schemes. They would go further by claiming that they have the right to freeze all the assets in their bank account. Using this fear tactic, they were able to manipulate most of their victims into transferring their funds into crypto wallets and bank accounts provided. According to an official, the bank accounts and crypto wallets that they used for the fraud were under the control of one of the members of the syndicate. The CBI registered the case on December 9, commencing investigations immediately. This led to simultaneous searches in several connecting areas, including Delhi and Noida. The CBI was able to apprehend the suspects, who were engaged in criminal activities at an illegal call center operated by the syndicate in Noida. Operation Chakra continues to record success Authorities claimed that searches continued on December 10 and 11, dismantling the areas of operation of the network. They claimed that the criminals were able to channel their illegal proceeds through a complex web of digital assets and bank transfers. The police were able to recover cash and electronic devices, including laptops, phones, hard drives, and incriminating evidence pertaining to the crimes from the accused. The crackdown is part of Operation Chakra, the flagship initiative approved by India to go after transnational criminal networks. The operation is carried out in close coordination with Interpol, the FBI, and several foreign law enforcement agencies. CBI officials also added that investigations are still underway to trace additional accomplices and establish money flows to identify the complete proceeds of crimes. The CBI had initially arrested accused Vikas Kumar Nimar on November 24, uncovering an illegal call center that he operated in Lucknow. The agency acted on intelligence, carrying out several searches on the premises to apprehend suspects linked to the accused across other cities. The suspect was reported to the authorities by good-will residents after catching a whiff of the activities going on in the building. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The decision was made due to increased criminal activity and mounting losses of up to KES5.6 billion ($43.3 million) among local investors in the past year. According to the DCI, the new unit will focus on crypto scams and related cyber offences due to criminals increasingly exploiting online platforms that offer anonymity. The agency described the initiative as a “ruthless” crackdown on crypto fraud . Rosemary Kuraru, head of the DCI’s forensic laboratory, stated, “We are forming a specialised unit to crack down on cryptocurrency fraud. The DCI is committed to staying ahead of criminal syndicates. As criminals migrate to digital spaces that offer anonymity, law enforcement must innovate with equal speed.” Kenya’s crypto fraud in 2025 surpasses the 2024 total The so-called crackdown comes amid a sharp rise in reported crypto-fraud losses. The $43.3 million loss in 2024 represented a 73% year-on-year increase. Overall, Kenyans lost $231.5 million to cybercrime in 2024, ranking the country among Africa’s most affected markets in terms of digital crime losses. “The proliferation of digital assets has brought both opportunity and peril. While many Kenyans use cryptocurrency for remittances and as an alternative financial solution, thousands have also fallen victim to fraudsters, losing billions of shillings,” Kuraru said . Meanwhile, although the DCI has not yet published audited or finalised figures for 2025, a Kenyan detective reported losses in the first 10 months of 2025 to have already exceeded the 2024 total. On the other hand, authorities say enforcement activity has increased. There have been dozens of arrests linked to crypto fraud this year, as per police statements and court arraignments. Recent cases cited by Kenyan media include alleged scams of $119,000, $100,000 and $30,000 in the main cities of Nairobi and Nakuru. The DCI said it has handled more than 500 crypto-related cases over the past three years. Separately, investigators have also pursued a small number of cases involving alleged use of digital assets in terrorism financing, which authorities have treated as national-security matters distinct from fraud investigations. Digital-asset crime has drawn attention at the highest political level. In his State of Security report to parliament, President William Ruto identified misuse of crypto platforms as a growing threat to Kenya’s digital economy. “Cybercriminals have been exploiting cryptocurrency platforms for fraud, ransomware payments and anonymous transactions, thereby fuelling cybercrime — a threat to our national security,” Ruto stated. Kenya’s shift to crypto regulation Over the years, Kenya’s crypto activity grew for years without a dedicated statute. Exchanges, wallets and peer-to-peer platforms served Kenyan users, often from abroad. Volumes rose through retail trading, remittances, merchant acceptance experiments, gaming and token projects. According to figures presented to Parliament, Kenyans processed close to $2 billion via decentralised protocols last year, with approximately 6.1 million users. This placed Kenya third in Africa in terms of chain volume. The country has also made huge steps in terms of regulation. As reported by Cryptopolitan, in October, the lawmakers passed a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Bill. It legalised crypto activity and introduced licensing requirements. The Central Bank of Kenya has said it has not yet issued licences under the new framework, pending implementation. Additionally, the country welcomed the launch of a Blockchain and Crypto Investigation Training Module, co-funded by the European Union. It is equipping investigators with specialist skills in blockchain forensics and cross-border digital investigations. “It delved into tracing and analysing blockchain transactions, investigating crimes related to digital wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges, applying international best practices in digital forensics and enhancing cross-border cooperation to tackle transnational digital crimes,” Kuraru said. This is to encourage innovation that is supervised rather than outlawed.

This explosive move has catapulted the Merlin Chain MERL token into the prestigious top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, a significant milestone for any digital asset. According to analysis from Bitcoin World, the token briefly touched $0.44 on the OKX exchange, signaling intense buying pressure and growing investor confidence. What Sparked the Merlin Chain MERL Rally? The sudden ascent of Merlin Chain MERL isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors likely contributed to this impressive price action. First, the broader Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem has been gaining significant traction, drawing attention to projects building on this foundational technology. Merlin Chain, as a native Bitcoin Layer 2 solution, is positioned directly within this hot narrative. Furthermore, increased on-chain activity, potential protocol developments, or strategic partnership rumors often serve as catalysts for such rapid moves. The break into the top 100 on CoinMarketCap acts as both a result of the rally and a new reason for investors to take notice, creating a potential feedback loop of interest. Breaking Down the Top 100 Milestone Entering the top 100 by market cap is a crucial psychological and practical barrier in the cryptocurrency world. It represents a major vote of confidence from the market and offers tangible benefits: Increased Visibility: The token gains prominence on major tracking sites, attracting new investors. Enhanced Credibility: It signals a project with substantial backing and liquidity. Liquidity Inflows: Larger funds and institutional players often have mandates to consider assets within this tier. For Merlin Chain MERL , trading firmly around $0.436 after its peak, this achievement validates its growing ecosystem. However, maintaining this position requires sustained development and user adoption, not just price speculation. Can Merlin Chain MERL Sustain Its Momentum? While a 17% gain is exhilarating, the critical question for traders and long-term holders is sustainability. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and rapid pumps can sometimes lead to equally sharp corrections. The future trajectory of Merlin Chain MERL will likely hinge on several key challenges and opportunities: Ecosystem Growth: Real, utility-driven adoption on the Merlin Chain network is the ultimate foundation for value. Market Conditions: The overall health of the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin’s price action, will influence all altcoins. Competition: The Bitcoin Layer 2 space is becoming crowded, requiring continuous innovation. Therefore, while the current momentum is a powerful sign, investors should look beyond the price chart to the project’s fundamentals and roadmap for actionable insights into its long-term potential. A Compelling Summary for Crypto Enthusiasts The dramatic rise of Merlin Chain (MERL) serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic opportunities within the cryptocurrency landscape. Its 17% surge and entry into the market cap top 100 highlight how quickly narratives and capital can shift towards promising Layer 2 solutions. This milestone is more than just a number; it’s a testament to growing belief in Bitcoin’s scalability ecosystem. For the Merlin Chain MERL project, the real work begins now—translating this price momentum into lasting, tangible utility and cementing its place among crypto’s elite. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Merlin Chain (MERL)? Merlin Chain is a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution designed to scale the Bitcoin network by enabling faster and cheaper transactions, while leveraging Bitcoin’s security. The MERL token is its native cryptocurrency. Why did MERL price jump 17%? The exact catalyst can be multi-faceted, but it’s likely due to a combination of growing interest in Bitcoin L2s, specific project developments, and its subsequent breakthrough into the top 100 market cap ranking, which attracts more investor attention. Is Merlin Chain a good investment after this pump? All cryptocurrency investments carry risk. While the top 100 entry is a positive sign, investors should conduct their own research (DYOR), examining the project’s technology, team, roadmap, and market conditions before making any decision. Where can I buy MERL tokens? The article mentions OKX as one exchange where MERL is actively traded. Always ensure you are using a reputable and secure cryptocurrency exchange. What does ‘Top 100 by market cap’ mean? It means the total market value of all MERL tokens in circulation ranks within the 100 highest among all thousands of cryptocurrencies. It’s a common benchmark for a project’s relative size and adoption. Can the price of MERL fall just as quickly? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Prices can correct rapidly after a sharp rally, so it’s important to understand the risks and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Analysts, in their examination of news in the world of crypto, note that XRP has shown it has struggled to maintain a position above $2.12. Such considerations have ensured that XRP remains in the lists of cryptocurrencies to buy watch, however most attention is being diverted to emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which some analysts consider when talking about top cryptos. XRP Trading Near Important Turning Point XRP has been range-bound between a tight $2.08 and $2.17 range, due to a balance between buyers trying to defend higher lows and sellers using every rally as an opportunity to cut their exposure. The current status of XRP being around the middle range has been impacted by deteriorating short-term momentum indicators like Supertrend and Chaikin Money Flow, which turned bearish. Analysts have suggested that a break below the $2.00 psychological level would cause a move towards $1.85, which served as a support in earlier cycles. Despite this, some technical analysts are still pointing to the symmetrical triangle developing in the weekly charts. This formation, which has been set up by condensing volatility, has traditionally been a precursor to a break in a direction as markets begin to see the return of liquidity. If XRP can break above $2.12 and then $2.30, it would show sufficient momentum to test near the top of the range. Such factors are influencing decisions over which crypto to invest in, with markets being extremely sensitive. Progress of Presale in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been steadily progressing with their presale, which has now moved into Phase 6, with a value of $0.035. The present stage has been indicated as being 98% filled, with Phase 7 proposing a value increase to $0.04. According to project data, a total of $19,330,000 in funds has been raised since the presale started, with 18,450 registrants. Some of the individuals monitoring the growth of major cryptocurrencies have noted this development, though all of these are still early entry points that should be judged independently. The listing price for MUTM is pegged at $0.06, and there will be a 300% increase for those purchasing in Phase 6 when the initial listing price is reached. There is also a Mutuum Finance leaderboard that operates for a 24-hour period and resets every 00:00 UTC. The winner of this leaderboard gets $500 in MUTM tokens in exchange for participation in this platform, as long as it involves at least a single transaction in every 24 hours. This dashboard also provides information on the top 50 token holders. Dual Lending Structure There is a twofold lending model planned by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which combines both pool-based and peer-matched loans in their upcoming protocol. The “Peer-to-Contract” layer of their protocol will enable users to contribute their funds, for example, in ETH or USDT, to common pools. Borrowers access funds from these pools under variable interest rates, which in turn provides a means for the lender to earn interest in proportion to market usage. To complement this, the Peer-to-Peer layer provides a mechanism for loans to be facilitated directly for assets that require personalized interest rates, providing users with flexibility in terms of loan structures arranged. Such a model has been cited in debates on which currency to invest in when analyzing DeFi-based projects. Stablecoin Plans A new over-collateralized stablecoin with a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar has been proposed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which will function as part of a borrowing mechanism in the protocol. The stablecoin will be minted/burned in relation to a user’s collateralized position set in their accounts, which aims to provide a means for denominating loans/borrows. With the end of the year quickly drawing near, it has become important to note that a potential return to key resistances for XRP, as well as further development for MUTM, are all part of a conversation related to which cryptocurrencies are the best to buy now. MUTM shines brighter ahead of 2026 breakout rally.

Now, picture those same ideas powering the world’s most secure banks. According to a top JPMorgan executive, this is precisely the journey Solana’s experimental concepts are taking. At the recent Solana Breakpoint conference, Scott Lucas, Global Head of Digital Assets at JPMorgan, made a compelling case: the blockchain’s most challenging innovations are evolving into robust Solana regulated market solutions . This signals a major shift where crypto’s frontier spirit meets the rigorous demands of global finance. What Did JPMorgan Actually Say About Solana? Scott Lucas didn’t just offer polite praise. He delivered a powerful endorsement of Solana’s development process. Speaking directly to the ecosystem’s builders, Lucas stated that the ‘challenging ideas’ emerging from Solana often mature into frameworks suitable for regulated environments. He emphasized that true innovation springs from the clash of diverse perspectives and open debate. For a traditional finance giant like JPMorgan, this represents a significant acknowledgment. It shows they are not just watching from the sidelines but actively listening to absorb the energy and direction of the Solana community. Why Are Regulated Market Solutions So Crucial? For any technology to achieve mass adoption, it must navigate the complex world of financial regulation. This has been a historic hurdle for blockchain. Solana regulated market solutions address this head-on by transforming experimental protocols into tools that institutions can trust and use. Lucas’s comments highlight a maturation path: From Experiment to Enterprise: Ideas tested in Solana’s high-speed, low-cost environment are being refined for security and compliance. Bridging Two Worlds: The dialogue between crypto-native developers and traditional finance experts is creating hybrid solutions. Building Trust: The process turns speculative concepts into dependable infrastructure for major financial players. This evolution is vital for bringing blockchain’s benefits—like instant settlement and transparency—into everyday banking and investment. How Does Solana Foster This Innovation? The key, as Lucas noted, is the ecosystem’s culture of open discussion and pressure-testing. Solana’s Breakpoint conference itself is a testament to this. It’s not a closed-door meeting but a vibrant forum where developers, entrepreneurs, and now, institutional leaders, collide. This environment allows raw ideas to be challenged and improved rapidly. The high throughput and low transaction costs of the Solana network act as a sandbox where these regulated market solutions can be prototyped at scale before being tailored for institutional use. The technology’s performance enables experimentation that would be too costly or slow on other networks. What Are the Actionable Insights for the Crypto Industry? JPMorgan’s perspective offers a clear roadmap for the broader crypto space. First, engagement with regulators and traditional institutions is not a sell-out; it’s a necessary step for growth. Second, the value of public, developer-focused events like Breakpoint is immense for cross-pollination of ideas. Finally, it underscores that scalability and low cost are not just technical specs—they are enablers of innovation that can lead to practical, real-world Solana regulated market solutions . For investors and builders, the takeaway is to watch projects that successfully navigate this path from decentralized experiment to institutional-grade tool. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Blockchain Adoption The message from JPMorgan is unequivocal: the frontier of crypto innovation is beginning to build the foundations for the future of mainstream finance. Solana’s role in this transition is becoming increasingly prominent. By providing a platform where bold ideas can be tested and matured, it is helping to create the very regulated market solutions that will bridge the gap between decentralized protocols and the global financial system. This isn’t just about technology adoption; it’s about the formal recognition of blockchain’s potential to solve core problems in regulated markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did the JPMorgan executive say about Solana? Scott Lucas, JPMorgan’s Global Head of Digital Assets, stated at the Solana Breakpoint conference that challenging ideas from the Solana ecosystem are maturing into solutions suitable for regulated financial markets. Why is JPMorgan’s opinion on Solana important? JPMorgan is a leading global investment bank. Its positive assessment signals to other institutions that Solana’s technology is evolving to meet the strict compliance and security standards required in traditional finance. What are ‘regulated market solutions’ in crypto? These are blockchain-based products, services, or protocols designed to operate within existing financial regulations. They offer crypto’s benefits (like speed and transparency) while ensuring compliance with laws for anti-money laundering (AML) and investor protection. How can Solana’s ideas become regulated? Through iterative development, security audits, and active dialogue with regulators and institutional partners. Experimental concepts are refined for robustness, compliance, and integration with legacy financial systems. What does this mean for the average crypto investor? It suggests growing institutional confidence in specific blockchain platforms. This can lead to greater stability, new financial products, and broader adoption, potentially impacting the long-term value and utility of the underlying ecosystem. Was this just talk, or is JPMorgan building on Solana? While Lucas’s comments are a significant public endorsement, JPMorgan has multiple blockchain initiatives. His statement reflects a strategic interest in the ecosystem’s output, though specific JPMorgan projects on Solana were not detailed.

New data has sent a clear signal to the crypto market: a significant Bitcoin outflow is underway. Over the past 24 hours, a net total of 425.22 BTC has moved off centralized trading platforms. This movement often indicates a shift in holder behavior, potentially foreshadowing future price action. Let’s break down what this Bitcoin outflow means and why it matters to every investor. What Does a Major Bitcoin Outflow Actually Mean? When Bitcoin leaves centralized exchanges (CEXs), it typically moves into private wallets. This action, known as a Bitcoin outflow , is widely interpreted as a bullish signal. Why? Because it suggests investors are moving their coins off trading platforms for long-term storage, reducing the immediate selling pressure on the market. Essentially, they are taking their coins off the shelf, making them less available for quick sale. This recent data from Coinglass shows a clear trend of accumulation. The three exchanges leading this Bitcoin outflow were: Coinbase Pro: -1,119.30 BTC Binance: -862.13 BTC Bitstamp: -94.85 BTC When giants like Coinbase and Binance see such substantial outflows, it’s a trend worth watching closely. Is This a Sign of Growing Investor Confidence? Large-scale Bitcoin outflow events are often linked to a ‘hodling’ mentality. Investors who believe the price will rise in the future are more likely to withdraw their coins to secure cold storage or hardware wallets. This behavior reduces liquid supply. Therefore, this 425 BTC movement could reflect growing confidence among large holders, often called ‘whales.’ However, it’s crucial to view this data in context. A single day’s Bitcoin outflow is a snapshot, not the full movie. We must ask: Is this the start of a sustained trend, or just a temporary blip? To answer that, analysts will monitor if this outflow continues over the coming days and weeks. How Could This Bitcoin Outflow Impact the Market? The direct impact of a Bitcoin outflow is on market liquidity. With fewer coins readily available on exchanges, even moderate buying pressure can lead to sharper price increases. Think of it like a popular product being bought off store shelves; the remaining items often get more expensive. Here are the potential market implications: Reduced Selling Pressure: Coins in private wallets are less likely to be sold impulsively. Increased Scarcity: The effective circulating supply on trading venues decreases. Sentiment Shift: Large withdrawals can be interpreted as a vote of confidence, influencing retail investor sentiment. While not a guarantee of a price surge, a consistent Bitcoin outflow from exchanges is a fundamental metric that seasoned traders watch. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? First, don’t make impulsive decisions based on one data point. Use exchange flow data as one piece of a larger puzzle. Consider pairing it with other on-chain metrics like wallet growth and miner behavior. If you are a long-term believer in Bitcoin, this kind of Bitcoin outflow data might reinforce a strategy of accumulation and self-custody. The trend highlights the importance of controlling your private keys, as the market’s big players appear to be doing. In conclusion, the 425.22 BTC net outflow from major exchanges is a noteworthy development. It underscores a potential shift from trading to holding among a segment of the market. While the crypto landscape is complex, movements like this provide valuable clues about underlying investor psychology and potential supply dynamics. Watching for a continuation of this trend will be key in the days ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin outflow from exchanges? A Bitcoin outflow occurs when more BTC is withdrawn from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges than is deposited. It means users are moving their coins into private wallets for storage. Is a Bitcoin outflow bullish or bearish? It is generally considered a bullish signal. It suggests investors are moving coins into long-term storage (“hodling”), reducing the immediate supply available for sale on exchanges. Which exchanges had the largest outflows? According to the data, Coinbase Pro (-1,119.30 BTC), Binance (-862.13 BTC), and Bitstamp (-94.85 BTC) saw the largest net outflows in the past 24 hours. How reliable is this data for predicting price? While a strong indicator, exchange flow data is just one metric. It should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools and viewed as part of a trend, not a single event. Where does the outflow data come from? This data is typically sourced from on-chain analytics platforms like Coinglass, which track the movement of cryptocurrencies to and from known exchange wallets. What’s the difference between net outflow and gross outflow? Gross outflow is the total amount withdrawn. Net outflow is the total withdrawals minus the total deposits. A net outflow means withdrawals exceeded deposits for the period. Found this analysis of the recent Bitcoin outflow helpful?

Reports that crypto trading platforms such as Bybit and Bitget are once again available in the country come days after their websites were added to a list of banned internet resources. Belarusians regain control over their crypto assets on foreign exchanges Residents of Belarus, who recently lost access to their accounts on major international exchanges for digital currencies, can reach their assets again. Some of the world’s largest coin trading venues, blocked by the nation’s Ministry of Information earlier this week, are now accessible, local media reported. Bybit, Bitget and other platforms have been removed from the database of banned pages, the Belarusian business news portal Banki24 noticed first and shared the news on Telegram. BingX and OKX were also among those previously added to the register , Tochka.by noted in a report, quoting the post. Late on Friday, the news outlet announced: “These sites are no longer on the blacklist of BelGIE. The exchanges did indeed reopen in Belarus on the evening of December 12.” BelGIE, or the Republican Unitary Enterprise for Supervision of Telecommunications, serves as the country’s telecom watchdog, which maintains the list of prohibited websites. The positive development is good news for Belarusian traders as attempts to access their accounts via VPN may result in account suspensions by the exchanges themselves, Onliner.by warned. ‘Improper advertising’ cited as the main reason for the blocking Access to the cryptocurrency exchanges was restricted on Wednesday, as reported by Cryptopolitan, initially without any proper explanation. On Thursday, the Information Ministry published a short notice indicating it acted on a request from the Minsk City Executive Committee, the capital city’s main governing body. The announcement cited the presence of “inappropriate advertising” on their websites as the main reason for the move. It also revealed that weex.com and gate.com had been blocked as well. According to a report by RBC, Kucoin and MEXC were also temporarily inaccessible. The Russian economic news source noted, however, that Binance and KuCoin remained available. The department remarked that it could provide more details only to the owners of the affected internet resources, noting it would restore access once the violations were eliminated. The platforms are among the world’s biggest crypto trading sites. Bybit, for example, is the leading crypto exchange in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). CIS is the regional organization formed after the dissolution of the USSR to facilitate cooperation between its former republics. Nine of them, including Belarus, are still members of the Eurasian format. Belarus leads the bunch in terms of crypto regulation Belarus is an established leader among peers in its region when it comes to building a comprehensive regulatory framework for activities and transactions related to cryptocurrencies. The Eastern European nation defined its legal status with a presidential decree “On the Development of the Digital Economy” signed by its long-term leader, Alexander Lukashenko, in 2017 and enforced the following year. Its citizens can buy and sell what the document calls “digital tokens” on regulated platforms that have obtained the status of residents of the High-Tech Park ( HTP ) in Minsk. The latter provides a special legal regime and benefits for business in the IT sector, including the crypto industry. It should be noted that in 2024, the authorities banned ordinary Belarusians, including those registered as individual entrepreneurs, from trading on non-domestic exchanges, amid concerns about capital flight from the sanctioned nation. In September, Lukashenko called on officials and government institutions to update the rules, highlighting the increasing relevance of cryptocurrencies, particularly in payments under financial restrictions imposed by the West. Russia, Belarus’s closest ally and the economic powerhouse of CIS, which has been the main target of international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, has only recently started to seriously consider legalizing its crypto market. Officials in Moscow have now indicated they are going to introduce the necessary legislation in 2026.

POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction December 2025 $0.12 $0.18 $0.25 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.12. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

According to Bloomberg , John Ameriks, Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, compared Bitcoin to a viral plush toy collectible rather than a productive asset at Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference on Thursday, saying it lacks the income, compounding, and cash flow that the firm seeks in long-term investments. “ It’s difficult for me to think about Bitcoin as anything more than a digital Labubu, ” Ameriks said, referencing the popular stuffed toy craze. The comment comes as Bitcoin trades around $90,000 , down from $126,000 in October. Source: TradingView At the same time, Vanguard maintains its longstanding position against launching its own crypto-focused ETFs even as it opened platform access to third-party products earlier this month. Platform Opens Despite Deep Investment Doubts Vanguard’s decision to allow ETF trading followed months of tracking the performance of crypto products, since spot Bitcoin funds launched in January 2024. The firm wanted to ensure these products “ delivered what’s on the tin, the way that they’re described, ” Ameriks explained in a separate conference interview. However, he stressed that Vanguard won’t advise clients on whether to buy or sell digital-asset ETFs. “ We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion, ” he said. “ We’re going to not give them advice as to whether buy or sell or which crypto tokens they ought to hold. That’s just not something we’re going to do at this point. “ Vanguard will allow trading of crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds starting Tuesday, opening access to Bitcoin, Ether and other tokens for millions of investors. #Vanguard #CryptoETFs https://t.co/mmU1DdIi7s — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2025 The reversal reflects growing pressure on the world’s second-largest asset manager after rivals BlackRock and Fidelity captured billions in crypto ETF flows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust became the fastest ETF ever to reach $70 billion in assets, generating hundreds of millions in annual fees while Vanguard clients complained about restricted access and some threatened to close accounts in response to the firm’s initial blockade. Leadership Change Drives Strategic Shift The firm’s leadership transition played a key role in the platform’s opening . Salim Ranji, who took over as CEO this year after running BlackRock’s giant ETF business and overseeing the launch of IBIT, has spoken publicly about blockchain’s potential despite Vanguard maintaining that it has “ no plans to launch its own crypto products. “ Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, told Bloomberg that “ cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity. ” He added that “ the administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve. “ Ramji’s predecessor, Tim Buckley, had said a Bitcoin ETF did not belong in a typical retirement account, reinforcing the firm’s reputation as crypto-skeptical. The platform now serves more than 50 million clients worldwide who previously couldn’t buy spot Bitcoin ETFs through their existing Vanguard accounts, potentially pulling mainstream money toward digital assets. Speculative Asset View Persists Despite Market Evolution Vanguard executives have consistently labeled cryptocurrencies speculative investments throughout Bitcoin’s volatile boom-and-bust cycles. The firm now considers digital assets extremely or very risky, with 66% of US investors aware of crypto sharing this view, according to recent FINRA Foundation data , up from 58% in 2021. US crypto purchase interest falls to 26% from 33% in 2021 as investor risk appetite declines sharply, FINRA study shows. #US #Crypto https://t.co/4mTMJ49hLC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 5, 2025 Ameriks conceded that Bitcoin might offer non-speculative value in certain scenarios, including high-inflation environments or periods of political instability. “ If you can see reliable movement in the price in those circumstances, we can talk more sensibly about what the investment thesis might be and what role it could play in a portfolio, ” he said. “ But you just don’t have that yet—you’ve still got too short of a history. “ A Vanguard spokesperson added that the firm remains optimistic about blockchain’s utility and its ability to improve market structure. Despite platform restrictions, Vanguard holds indirect Bitcoin exposure as the second-largest institutional shareholder in Strategy , while managing approximately $11 trillion and treating crypto funds similarly to other “non-core” assets, such as gold, on its US brokerage platform.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, one question dominates the minds of investors and enthusiasts alike: what does the future hold for Cardano’s ADA? With its unique scientific approach and growing ecosystem, Cardano has positioned itself as more than just another cryptocurrency. This comprehensive analysis dives deep into Cardano price predictions from 2025 through 2030, examining whether ADA can realistically reach the coveted $2 milestone. We’ll explore technical developments, market trends, and expert opinions to give you a clear picture of what to expect in the coming years. Understanding Cardano’s Current Position Before we dive into specific Cardano price predictions, it’s crucial to understand where ADA stands today. Cardano, founded by Charles Hoskinson , has established itself as a third-generation blockchain platform with a research-driven approach. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that prioritize speed over security, Cardano has taken a methodical path, focusing on peer-reviewed research and formal verification. The current ADA price reflects both the platform’s achievements and its challenges. As of our latest analysis, ADA trades within a range that suggests cautious optimism from investors. Several factors influence this positioning: Network upgrades including the successful implementation of smart contracts through the Alonzo hard fork Growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Cardano Institutional interest and partnerships Overall cryptocurrency market sentiment Cardano Price Prediction 2025: The Foundation Year Looking toward 2025, our Cardano price prediction considers several key factors. By this time, Cardano’s ecosystem should be more mature, with numerous dApps fully operational and user adoption increasing significantly. Most analysts agree that 2025 could be a pivotal year for ADA’s price trajectory. Based on current growth patterns and planned developments, here’s what we might expect for ADA price in 2025: Scenario Price Range Probability Conservative $0.80 – $1.20 40% Moderate $1.20 – $1.80 45% Bullish $1.80 – $2.50 15% The key to reaching the higher end of these predictions lies in successful implementation of Cardano’s roadmap, particularly the Basho phase focusing on scaling and the Voltaire phase introducing governance. If these developments proceed smoothly and adoption accelerates, our ADA future looks promising for 2025. Will ADA Price Hit $2 by 2026? This is the million-dollar question for many investors. Based on our analysis, ADA reaching $2 by 2026 is certainly within the realm of possibility, though not guaranteed. Several factors will determine whether this milestone becomes reality: Ecosystem Growth: The number and quality of projects building on Cardano Market Conditions: Overall cryptocurrency bull or bear market cycles Regulatory Environment: How governments worldwide approach cryptocurrency regulation Technical Advancements: Successful implementation of scaling solutions and governance models Our cryptocurrency forecast suggests that if Cardano continues its current trajectory of development and adoption, the $2 mark could be tested by late 2026. However, investors should remain aware that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and predictions should be taken as educated estimates rather than guarantees. Cardano 2025 and Beyond: Long-Term Projections Looking beyond 2026, our Cardano price prediction extends to 2030. Long-term forecasts become increasingly speculative, but they help us understand potential trajectories based on current trends and planned developments. For the period 2027-2030, several scenarios could unfold: Base Case (2030): $3-5 range, assuming steady growth and mainstream adoption Bull Case (2030): $8-12 range, if Cardano becomes a dominant smart contract platform Bear Case (2030): $1-2 range, if development stalls or competitors outperform These Cardano 2025 through 2030 projections depend heavily on the platform’s ability to execute its vision. The transition to a fully decentralized governance model through Voltaire will be particularly crucial for long-term success. Factors Influencing ADA Future Performance To make an accurate Cardano price prediction, we must consider the fundamental factors that will drive ADA’s value in the coming years. These elements provide the foundation for any meaningful cryptocurrency forecast. Technical Developments: Cardano’s roadmap includes several critical upgrades. The successful implementation of Hydra scaling solutions could dramatically increase transaction throughput, making Cardano more competitive with other smart contract platforms. Additionally, improvements to Plutus smart contracts and the development of partner chains could expand Cardano’s capabilities. Ecosystem Growth: The number of projects building on Cardano continues to increase. From decentralized exchanges to lending protocols and NFT marketplaces, a vibrant ecosystem is essential for long-term ADA price appreciation. Projects like SundaeSwap and Minswap represent early successes in this area. Market Adoption: Real-world usage drives cryptocurrency value. Cardano’s partnerships in developing countries for identity solutions and financial inclusion could create substantial demand for ADA. Additionally, institutional adoption through products like Grayscale’s Cardano Trust contributes to price stability and growth. Competitive Landscape: Cardano doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Its ADA future depends partly on how it competes with platforms like Ethereum , Solana , and Polkadot . Each has strengths and weaknesses that will influence market share in the smart contract platform space. Risks and Challenges for Cardano While our Cardano price prediction generally leans positive, investors must understand the risks. No cryptocurrency forecast is complete without considering potential challenges that could impact ADA price. The primary risks include: Development delays that have historically affected Cardano’s timeline Intense competition from other smart contract platforms Regulatory uncertainty that could impact all cryptocurrencies Technical vulnerabilities that might emerge as the network scales Market volatility affecting the entire cryptocurrency sector Successful investors balance optimism about Cardano’s potential with realistic assessment of these challenges. This balanced approach is crucial when considering any cryptocurrency forecast, especially long-term predictions like our Cardano 2025 through 2030 analysis. Expert Opinions on ADA Price Trajectory Various analysts and organizations have published their own Cardano price predictions. While these vary widely, they provide additional perspectives on ADA’s potential future. Notable predictions include: Wallet Investor: Generally bullish long-term outlook with gradual appreciation Digital Coin Price: Moderate growth projections through 2030 Changelly: Cautiously optimistic with emphasis on ecosystem development It’s worth noting that even experts with impressive track records can be wrong about cryptocurrency forecasts. The market’s complexity and sensitivity to unexpected events make precise predictions challenging. Our Cardano price prediction synthesizes these expert views with fundamental analysis to provide a balanced perspective. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on our comprehensive Cardano price prediction analysis, here are actionable insights for those considering ADA investment: Dollar-Cost Average: Given market volatility, consider regular investments rather than timing the market Monitor Development: Follow Cardano’s technical progress through official channels and developer updates Diversify: While ADA shows promise, maintain a balanced cryptocurrency portfolio Long-Term Perspective: Our Cardano 2025 through 2030 analysis suggests potential, but patience may be required Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose, given cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility Remember that any cryptocurrency forecast, including our Cardano price prediction, should inform rather than dictate investment decisions. Your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals should always take precedence. Frequently Asked Questions What is Cardano and who created it?

Itaú Analyst Says Bitcoin Offers “Uncorrelated” Portfolio Protection Itaú analyst Renato Eid emphasized that Bitcoin operates fundamentally differently from equities, fixed income, or domestic assets. JUST IN: Brazil's largest private bank Itau is now recommending a Bitcoin allocation of up to 3% pic.twitter.com/UlMxaMJo91 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 12, 2025 Though price swings remain a defining characteristic, the institution contends Bitcoin can serve as a portfolio stabilizer while delivering growth opportunities during periods when traditional investments falter. Itaú Asset now stands alongside Morgan Stanley and Bank of America in promoting controlled crypto exposure , with these financial giants suggesting 2-4% and 1-4% ranges, respectively. Brazilian market participants encountered amplified volatility as their national currency gained over 15% in value against the U.S. dollar this year. This exchange rate movement intensified losses for local investors maintaining dollar-priced holdings like Bitcoin. Internal research from Itaú demonstrated minimal correlation between BITI11, the bank’s domestically traded Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, and competing asset categories. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $90K Support Test And Bear Wick Signals Buyer Defense On the 1-day Bitcoin chart, price currently trades at $90,467.70, reflecting a modest 0.22% gain. The technical picture displays a descending channel pattern that has dominated since October’s highs. The chart highlights a “bear wick” formation in recent price action, typically indicating strong selling pressure that encountered buying interest. Bitcoin is currently testing the descending channel’s lower boundary near $90,467, with critical support identified at $80,638. Source: TradingView Resistance levels are clearly marked at $102,152 and a more substantial barrier at $116,453. The RSI indicator registers 44.61, positioned in neutral territory but leaning slightly bearish. This suggests Bitcoin isn’t oversold yet, meaning additional downside remains possible if selling pressure intensifies. A potential decline toward the $80,000 support zone, followed by a reversal, could trigger a rally back toward $102,000 and potentially higher toward $116,000. Failure to maintain current levels would likely accelerate downside movement, while a strong bounce with increasing volume could validate the bullish reversal scenario outlined in the projection. MAXI Raise $4.3M And Targets Early Investors Before Rewards Drop As Bitcoin defends the $90K level to build momentum for a 2026 rally, early-stage projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are attracting investors seeking to benefit from the upcoming wave of capital flowing into crypto.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, one question dominates the minds of investors and enthusiasts alike: What does the future hold for Ripple’s XRP? With its unique position in the financial technology space and ongoing legal developments, XRP stands at a critical juncture. This comprehensive analysis examines the potential price trajectory of XRP from 2025 through 2030, exploring whether the ambitious target of $5 per token is within reach. Understanding the factors that could drive or hinder XRP’s growth is essential for anyone considering this digital asset. Understanding Ripple XRP Price Prediction Fundamentals Before diving into specific numbers, it’s crucial to understand what drives XRP’s value. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that position themselves as digital gold or decentralized computing platforms, XRP serves primarily as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. This fundamental difference means its price prediction depends on unique factors including adoption by financial institutions, regulatory clarity, and competition from both traditional systems and other cryptocurrencies. The Ripple XRP price prediction for any given year must account for these specialized market dynamics. XRP Price 2025: The Critical Year Ahead 2025 represents a pivotal moment for XRP, as many analysts believe this could be the year when several key factors converge. Based on current trends and potential developments, here’s what experts are saying about the XRP price 2025 outlook: Conservative Estimate: $1.20 – $1.80 range Moderate Bull Case: $2.00 – $2.50 range Aggressive Prediction: $3.00+ under optimal conditions The primary drivers for the XRP price 2025 projection include potential resolution of regulatory challenges, increased institutional adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions, and broader cryptocurrency market recovery. Many analysts point to 2025 as the year when XRP could establish a new baseline above the $1 mark, setting the stage for future growth. Will XRP Reach $5? Analyzing the Possibility The question “Will XRP reach $5?” has sparked intense debate within the cryptocurrency community. To reach this milestone, XRP would need to achieve approximately a 10x increase from current levels. Several scenarios could make this possible: Scenario Likelihood Timeframe Massive institutional adoption Medium 2026-2028 Favorable regulatory resolution worldwide Medium-High 2025-2027 Cryptocurrency market super-cycle Low-Medium 2027-2030 Ripple IPO or major partnership announcements Medium 2025-2026 While $5 represents a significant psychological barrier, historical patterns suggest that cryptocurrency assets can experience rapid appreciation under the right conditions. The possibility of XRP reaching $5 depends heavily on both internal developments at Ripple and external market factors. XRP Future Price: 2026-2030 Long-Term Outlook Looking beyond 2025, the XRP future price trajectory becomes increasingly dependent on macro trends in both cryptocurrency and traditional finance. Here’s a year-by-year breakdown of potential scenarios: 2026: $2.50 – $3.50 range assuming continued adoption growth 2027: $3.00 – $4.50 range if regulatory clarity improves globally 2028: $4.00 – $6.00 range in a bullish market environment 2029: $5.00 – $8.00 range if cross-border payment dominance emerges 2030: $7.00 – $12.00 range in an optimal adoption scenario These XRP future price projections assume gradual but steady adoption of Ripple’s technology by financial institutions worldwide. The company’s focus on solving real-world payment problems gives it a unique advantage in the cryptocurrency space, potentially translating to sustained value appreciation over the long term. Ripple Cryptocurrency Forecast: Key Factors to Watch Any accurate Ripple cryptocurrency forecast must consider several critical variables that could significantly impact XRP’s price trajectory: Regulatory Developments: Ongoing cases with the SEC and other regulators worldwide Institutional Adoption: Banks and payment providers implementing RippleNet Market Competition: Emerging technologies challenging Ripple’s solutions Token Utility: Expansion of XRP’s use cases beyond cross-border payments Market Sentiment: Broader cryptocurrency cycles and investor psychology The Ripple cryptocurrency forecast becomes more reliable when these factors are monitored consistently. Investors should pay particular attention to quarterly adoption metrics and regulatory announcements, as these have historically created significant price movements. Challenges and Risks in XRP Price Prediction While optimism surrounds XRP’s potential, several challenges could hinder its growth: Ongoing regulatory uncertainty in major markets Competition from both traditional systems and blockchain alternatives Market volatility affecting all cryptocurrency assets Potential dilution if Ripple releases more tokens from escrow Technological challenges in scaling for global adoption These risks highlight why any XRP price prediction should be approached with caution and balanced perspective. Diversification remains a prudent strategy for cryptocurrency investors. Actionable Insights for XRP Investors Based on current analysis, here are practical considerations for those interested in XRP: Monitor regulatory developments, particularly in the United States Track institutional adoption announcements from Ripple Consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market Maintain realistic expectations about timeframes for price targets Stay informed about broader cryptocurrency market trends Remember that cryptocurrency investments carry significant risk, and only capital that you can afford to lose should be allocated to these assets. Frequently Asked Questions What is Ripple and how is it different from XRP? Ripple is a technology company that develops payment solutions, while XRP is the native cryptocurrency used within Ripple’s ecosystem. Ripple the company was co-founded by Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse . How does the SEC lawsuit affect XRP’s price prediction? The ongoing case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission creates regulatory uncertainty that impacts short-term price predictions. A favorable resolution could significantly improve the outlook. Which financial institutions currently use Ripple’s technology? Ripple has partnered with numerous institutions including Santander , Standard Chartered , and MoneyGram , though adoption levels vary. What makes XRP different from Bitcoin and Ethereum? XRP focuses specifically on fast, low-cost cross-border payments, while Bitcoin serves as digital gold and Ethereum as a decentralized computing platform. How can I stay updated on XRP developments? Follow official channels including Ripple’s website and the XRP Ledger documentation , along with reputable cryptocurrency news sources. Conclusion: The Path Forward for XRP The journey toward $5 for XRP represents both challenge and opportunity. While short-term volatility is inevitable, the long-term fundamentals of Ripple’s technology and growing institutional adoption create a compelling case for gradual appreciation. The most realistic path suggests that XRP could approach the $5 milestone between 2027 and 2029, assuming favorable regulatory outcomes and continued adoption growth. However, investors must remain vigilant about the risks and maintain balanced portfolios.

According to a pivotal analysis from Coinbase Institutional, the 2026 crypto market is poised for a significant transformation, driven primarily by an unexpected wave of liquidity. This forecast cuts through the noise of short-term volatility, offering a compelling long-term vision for investors. Let’s explore the key forces that could define the crypto landscape two years from now. What is Driving the 2026 Crypto Market Forecast? Coinbase Institutional points to a faster-than-anticipated expansion of global liquidity as the central catalyst. The firm’s analysis suggests the Federal Reserve’s current policies are creating a form of “stealth quantitative easing.” This environment, characterized by interest rate cuts and Treasury purchases, is shifting the Fed from balance sheet reduction to net liquidity provision. Consequently, this influx of capital is expected to create a highly favorable backdrop for risk assets, including cryptocurrency. How Will Federal Reserve Policy Shape Crypto? The connection between central bank actions and crypto valuations is becoming increasingly clear. Coinbase notes that the Fed funds futures market is signaling two potential rate cuts totaling 50 basis points by mid-2026. This monetary easing typically weakens the U.S. dollar and makes yield-bearing and growth-oriented assets more attractive. For the 2026 crypto market , this could mean: Reduced borrowing costs for institutions and traders. Increased capital flow into alternative asset classes. A potential weakening of the dollar, historically a positive for Bitcoin. Therefore, the anticipated policy shift is not just a minor adjustment but a fundamental change in the financial ecosystem that crypto inhabits. Is the Classic Four-Year Crypto Cycle Over? Adding a crucial perspective, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley argues that the traditional four-year boom-and-bust cycle theory has been “effectively nullified.” He suggests that 2025 might experience underlying bearish pressures that are masked by sustained institutional buying. This buying comes from sources like: Decentralized Autonomous Trusts (DATs) Corporations adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves This structural demand from large, long-term holders could smooth out volatility and build a stronger foundation for the anticipated 2026 crypto market advance, making it less dependent on retail sentiment cycles. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For anyone with exposure to digital assets, this analysis provides a strategic framework. The focus shifts from short-term price swings to long-term macroeconomic trends. The key takeaway is that liquidity conditions are expected to improve dramatically, setting the stage for a potential bull market. Investors should consider: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Systematically building positions ahead of the forecasted liquidity surge. Portfolio Rebalancing: Ensuring a prudent mix of core assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside selective altcoins. Monitoring Macro Indicators: Watching Fed announcements and inflation data as leading signals. The prediction for the 2026 crypto market is not about guaranteed profits, but about recognizing a powerful tailwind that is beginning to blow. Conclusion: Preparing for a New Market Paradigm The convergence of expansive monetary policy and entrenched institutional demand paints an optimistic picture for 2026. While markets remain unpredictable, the analysis from Coinbase and Bitwise highlights a fundamental shift. The coming years may be defined less by speculative frenzy and more by crypto’s maturation within a liquidity-rich global system. By understanding these drivers, investors can position themselves not just to participate, but to potentially thrive in the next chapter of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “stealth quantitative easing” mean for crypto? A1: It refers to Federal Reserve actions, like buying Treasury securities, that increase the money supply without an official QE program. This excess liquidity often seeks higher returns, potentially flowing into assets like cryptocurrency and boosting prices. Q2: Why does Hunter Horsley say the four-year cycle is nullified? A2: He believes sustained institutional buying from corporations and DATs is creating constant underlying demand. This new demand layer may prevent the deep, cyclical bear markets seen in previous eras, fundamentally altering market dynamics. Q3: Should I invest based solely on this 2026 forecast? A3: No. This analysis is a strategic perspective, not financial advice. Always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and maintain a diversified portfolio. Use such forecasts to inform your long-term strategy, not dictate short-term trades. Q4: Which cryptocurrencies benefit most from this liquidity environment? A4: While broader market liquidity tends to lift all boats, major assets with high institutional adoption like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are primary conduits for capital. However, increased risk appetite can also benefit select altcoins. Q5: What are the biggest risks to this 2026 crypto market outlook? A5: Key risks include a resurgence of high inflation forcing the Fed to reverse course, unexpected regulatory crackdowns in major economies, or a severe global economic recession that dampens all risk appetite.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds Bitcoin Bear Flag Raises Concerns On Friday, Bitcoin shredded its Thursday gains, dropping 3.2% intraday to retest the $89,500-$90,500 support zone once again. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $84,500-$94,500 range for the past four weeks, briefly falling to a seven-month low of $80,600 during the late November correction. This week, the flagship crypto’s price has seen more volatility, fueled by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut and positive regulatory developments in the US. However, BTC has failed to successfully break and hold above its local range’s upper boundary after multiple retests, ultimately falling to the mid-zone of its range. Analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a concerning pattern on Bitcoin’s chart, warning that the cryptocurrency risks a drop to new multi-month lows if the price fails to hold key support levels. Per the post, BTC has been forming a bear flag for nearly a month, which “is too hard to ignore” after the price continues to be rejected from the formation’s upper boundary. The analyst affirmed that this pattern follows a trend that has been developing over the past two months. As he pointed out, bearish flags have been continuously forming on BTC’s chart since the October 10 market pullback, with each pattern resolving in a breakdown to lower levels. To Ted, the new formation signals “that the overall trend is still to the downside.” He suggested that a close above the $96,000 level would invalidate the bearish pattern. On the contrary, a drop to below the $86,000 support, where the formation’s lower boundary is located, could push Bitcoin to the April lows, around the $76,000 mark. Is The 2022 Playbook Repeating? The market observer also noted a resemblance between the last cycle and the current one, which could lead to a drop below the $70,000 level. The chart shows that after losing the 50-Week EMA indications, Bitcoin consolidated within a bear flag before breaking down and descending to the 2022 lows. Now, BTC displays a similar performance after losing the 50-Week EMA and breaking down from its October bear flag. “If this plays out, a pump to $100,000 and then a dump below $70,000” would follow, the analyst added. Meanwhile, Robert Mercer shared a similar perspective in a series of X posts. The analyst affirmed that the classic four-year cycle has not changed despite the significant increase in institutional adoption: Bitcoin is breaking crucial supports one by one and entering a bear market. The same happened back in the end of 2021. At the moment, BTC is forming an ascending channel with the top near $100,000 – $104,000, you can see a clear Right Shoulder of H&S in this move. Something similar happened in the beginning of 2022. He also asserted that Bitcoin shows a similar picture “from the 1W MA50 perspective,” as BTC has traded below this indicator for multiple weeks now for the first time in the bullish cycle.

As of this writing, BTC Trades at $89,990, a 2.75% decline in the daily timeframe.

The platform, which relies heavily on revenue from advertisements, has been accused of enabling the increase of false, harmful, and, most of the time, AI-generated advertisements, which are increasingly slipping through weak filters. Advertising has become the lifeblood of most social media companies in the era of digitalization. Most of these adverts target platforms that are used by billions of users and generate revenue for companies like Meta , X, TikTok, and YouTube. According to documents submitted to Ireland’s Company Registration Office (CRO), TikTok claimed that its models relied on combining adverts, value-added services on the platform, and merchandise sales. TikTok accused of aiding fake AI-generated ads TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance , prioritized investments in artificial intelligence this year. At the beginning of the year, the Financial Times claimed that the company had plans to invest about $12 billion in AI chips across 2025. In the same period, the popularity of AI-generated content on the platform has increased, with users deploying it in advertisements. However, over the last few weeks, there has been an influx of adverts concerning fake or misleading products on TikTok. For example, there has been an increase in fake ads on the platform promoting the use of weight loss supplements and appetite suppression. These developments include ads for GLP-1 patches, which are marketed as weight loss aids, but do not contain actual GLP-1, which is found in drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro. Others are adverts which claim to provide cures to cortisol belly and high-stress levels, resulting in weight gain. In addition, many of these advertisements lead users to cloned websites, which in some cases impersonate legitimate online businesses. They feature unlawfully copied content for deceptive and malicious purposes. In the case of these TikTok adverts, several legitimate pharmacies have been cloned to make it look like these fake products are being promoted by well-known and trusted retailers. Calls for safeguards over the use of AI on social media platforms In its advertising policies, TikTok outlaws behaviors that are misleading, inauthentic, and deceptive to protect integrity, authenticity, and safety for its users and the general public at large. The platform has also warned that engaging in such practices and patterns of abusing its policies would see the accounts being suspended or banned permanently on the platform. In terms of health, the platform has also moved to combat misinformation, which could contribute to the health crisis. “To ensure that our community has access to accurate medical information to support well-informed health choices, we remove health misinformation relating to serious medical conditions or public health issues, or health misinformation that could lead to serious harm to individuals or discourage people from seeking proper medical care,” the company states. Despite its policies, these AI-generated adverts promoting fake products are still rampant on TikTok. The recent investment made by the company in AI means that these ads can now be produced using a dedicated tool created and developed by the application. The company allows users to deploy its “TikTok for Business” platform to create marketing campaigns, offering other aspects such as advertising tools, business accounts features, collaborations, and marketing strategies . To help users carry out tasks, the platform hosts a chatbot assistant that helps people create and share advertisements based on what they are trying to sell. Speaking about the development, Michael McGrath, the EU Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law, and Consumer Protection Code, noted that there are rules in place in the EU when it comes to the use of AI across social media. “We do need safeguards,” Mr McGrath said. “We have recently proposed new amendments to the act, and we aim to get the balance right. We have a good regulatory framework in place, but we need to ensure that the rulebook is enforced.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Ripple’s XRP was among the most highly anticipated alts to have such funds on Wall Street, and the first, Canary Capital’s XRPC, hit the US markets exactly a month ago. Since then, four more joined the list, including 21Shares’ TOXR, which was the most recent one. Here’s what happened in the first 30 days. 1/ Another W for XRP.

As reported the day after the successful launch of XRPC, Canary Capital’s financial vehicles broke the 2025 record for trading volume during its debut. The volume was just under $60 million, which outpaced Bitwise’s SOL ETF launch, while the overall inflows stood at around $243 million. As mentioned above, TOXR was the latest to see the light of day. Grayscale’s GXRP was converted into an ETF, while Bitwise’s XRP and Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ were released in the meantime. The inflow streak has been quite impressive, as all trading days since the debut of XRPC have been in the green. While the initial day record of $243 million in net inflows cannot be reached yet, the total inflows since then continue to climb to $974.50 million as of Friday’s close. The total net assets have shot up above the $1 billion mark and stand at $1.18 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. XRP ETF Inflows as of December 13. Source: SoSoValue XRP Price Impact Given the fact that the spot XRP ETFs outperformed the BTC and ETH counterparts for the most part since their launch, it would be logical to assume that the impact on the underlying asset’s price should be quite positive. Moreover, the company behind the token has been making big moves with partnerships and regulatory approvals. However, the reality is different. In the hours ahead of XRPC’s launch, XRP traded above $2.50 and even close to $2.60. Since then, it dipped below $2.00 on several occasions and even bottomed at $1.85 during the late November crash. Although it has reclaimed the $2.00 support, it still sits just inches above it, which means it has dropped by 20% in a month despite the funds attracting $974 million. XRPUSD December 13.

As the cryptocurrency that started it all approaches its next halving and broader institutional adoption, investors worldwide are asking: How high can BTC price really go? This comprehensive analysis examines Bitcoin price prediction models from 2025 through 2030, combining technical analysis, fundamental factors, and expert insights to give you a clear picture of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. What Drives Bitcoin Price Predictions? Understanding Bitcoin price prediction requires examining multiple factors. The Bitcoin price forecast for any given year depends on macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment. Historical patterns, particularly around halving events, provide crucial data points for projecting future valuations. The 2024 halving reduced mining rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block, creating predictable supply shocks that have historically preceded major bull markets. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: The Post-Halving Year Historically, Bitcoin experiences its most significant gains 12-18 months after halving events. Based on this pattern, 2025 could see substantial appreciation. Several analysts project a Bitcoin price prediction range between $120,000 and $180,000 for 2025. Key factors influencing this BTC price forecast include: Increased institutional adoption through spot Bitcoin ETFs Potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts improving risk appetite Continued development of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network Growing recognition as a digital gold alternative during economic uncertainty Bitcoin 2026: Consolidation or Continued Growth? The cryptocurrency prediction for 2026 depends heavily on how the 2025 bull market develops. If Bitcoin follows historical patterns, 2026 might see a period of consolidation after potential 2025 peaks. However, fundamental adoption metrics could support higher valuations. Projections for Bitcoin 2030 often start taking shape during this period as long-term trends become clearer. Key considerations for 2026 include: Scenario Price Range Probability Bullish Continuation $150,000 – $250,000 35% Moderate Correction $90,000 – $140,000 45% Bear Market $60,000 – $90,000 20% The Long-Term Vision: Bitcoin 2030 Price Projections Looking toward Bitcoin 2030 requires considering exponential adoption curves and Bitcoin’s potential role in the global financial system. Several prominent analysts have published ambitious Bitcoin price prediction models for the end of the decade. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has suggested Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030 in her most bullish scenario, while more conservative estimates range from $300,000 to $500,000. The Bitcoin future value depends on several critical developments: Bitcoin becoming a reserve asset for corporations and nations Integration with traditional finance through regulatory clarity Technological improvements enhancing scalability and utility Demographic shifts as younger, digitally-native generations accumulate wealth Key Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Prediction Accuracy All cryptocurrency prediction models face significant challenges. The volatile nature of digital assets, regulatory uncertainty, and technological disruptions make precise forecasting difficult. However, several metrics provide valuable insight for BTC price forecast accuracy: Network Fundamentals: Active addresses, hash rate, and transaction volume Macroeconomic Conditions: Inflation rates, dollar strength, and global liquidity Adoption Metrics: Institutional holdings, ETF flows, and merchant acceptance Technological Development: Layer 2 adoption, privacy improvements, and smart contract capabilities Risks and Challenges to Bitcoin Future Value While optimistic Bitcoin price prediction models capture attention, responsible analysis must consider potential headwinds. Regulatory crackdowns in major economies, technological vulnerabilities, environmental concerns, and competition from other cryptocurrencies could impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. The Bitcoin 2030 vision assumes continued network security, maintained decentralization, and growing utility beyond pure speculation. Actionable Insights for Investors Rather than focusing on precise price targets, consider these strategies for navigating Bitcoin’s potential future: Dollar-cost average regardless of short-term price movements Maintain a long-term perspective through market cycles Allocate only risk capital you can afford to lose Secure your holdings through hardware wallets and proper key management Stay informed about regulatory developments and technological advancements Conclusion: The Compelling Case for Bitcoin’s Future The Bitcoin price prediction landscape from 2025 to 2030 presents a fascinating narrative of potential growth tempered by real-world challenges. While precise numbers remain speculative, the underlying trend suggests increasing adoption and recognition of Bitcoin’s unique value proposition. The BTC price forecast ultimately depends on Bitcoin’s evolution from speculative asset to established store of value and medium of exchange. As with any investment, diversification and risk management remain paramount, but the data suggests Bitcoin will continue playing a significant role in the future of finance.

Frequently Asked Questions What is the most reliable Bitcoin price prediction method? No single method guarantees accuracy, but combining technical analysis, fundamental network metrics, and macroeconomic analysis provides the most comprehensive view. Many analysts reference models like the Stock-to-Flow created by PlanB , though its accuracy has varied across market cycles. How do Bitcoin halvings affect price predictions? Halvings reduce the new supply of Bitcoin by 50% approximately every four years. Historical data shows these events have preceded major bull markets, making them central to many Bitcoin price prediction models. The 2024 halving reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC. What companies are most bullish on Bitcoin’s future price? Financial institutions like MicroStrategy and Grayscale have made substantial Bitcoin investments. Analysts at ARK Invest , particularly Cathie Wood, have published some of the most optimistic long-term Bitcoin price predictions. How does regulatory uncertainty impact Bitcoin forecasts? Regulatory clarity in major markets like the United States through SEC decisions on Bitcoin ETFs significantly influences institutional adoption. The stance of regulators like Gary Gensler and legislation from bodies like the U.S. Congress create both opportunities and challenges for Bitcoin’s price trajectory.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-ripple-ceo-xrp-holders-deserve-0-interest-rate-heres-why/,"The crypto industry is entering a defining transition phase. Blockchain companies such as Ripple are no longer operating at the edges of finance. They are integrating directly into regulated financial infrastructure. As this shift accelerates, a critical question is emerging. Who truly deserves to benefit from this transformation? For XRP holders, this question carries unusual weight. The XRP community endured prolonged uncertainty, market pressure, and reputational risk. While many exited, others remained committed. That long-term conviction is now driving a broader conversation about recognition and fairness. John Squire Sparks the Debate Crypto commentator John Squire reignited this discussion with a public message directed at Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. His statement quickly gained traction across the XRP community. It reflected sentiments many long-term holders have quietly shared. Squire framed his argument around loyalty and endurance. He emphasized that XRP holders stayed invested during the most difficult chapter in Ripple’s history. That period included regulatory battles, exchange delistings, and years of constrained price action. Hey @bgarlinghouse XRP HOLDERS who held through everything now that Ripple is officially a bank deserve 0 percent interest rates. Diamond hands should count. Make it happen. pic.twitter.com/5wu7c9bETH — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 12, 2025 XRP Holders and the Cost of Conviction Few digital asset communities faced pressure comparable to XRP holders. The SEC lawsuit created systemic uncertainty around XRP’s legal status. Liquidity declined, institutional access narrowed, and public narratives turned sharply negative. Despite these conditions, a core base of holders remained. They absorbed opportunity costs and market volatility. In effect, they provided long-term stability to the ecosystem without contractual guarantees or direct compensation. Ripple’s Expanding Role in Regulated Finance Ripple has received conditional approval from the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to charter Ripple National Trust Bank . The company works closely with regulated institutions. It holds multiple licenses and supports enterprise-grade payment systems. Ripple’s launch of RLUSD in December 2024 further reinforced this positioning. The stablecoin aligns Ripple more closely with regulated financial frameworks. This evolution shaped the context of Squire’s argument. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Zero-Interest Proposal Explained Squire suggested that loyal XRP holders deserve access to zero-interest financial benefits. His proposal was symbolic rather than procedural. It framed XRP holders as foundational stakeholders, not passive speculators. The idea reflects a broader principle. Those who bore the greatest risk during uncertain periods should share in structural advantages later. In traditional finance, early capital often receives preferential terms. Practical and Regulatory Realities Implementing holder-based financial privileges would be complex. Regulatory compliance remains central to Ripple’s strategy. Any differential treatment would require careful legal structuring. Ripple has made no public commitment to such programs. The company continues to prioritize institutional trust and regulatory clarity. That stance limits near-term possibilities but does not invalidate the underlying sentiment. A Signal of Changing Expectations Squire’s message represents more than a specific demand. It signals evolving expectations within the XRP community. Long-term holders increasingly seek recognition beyond market appreciation. As Ripple enters its next growth phase, this conversation may persist. Loyalty, patience, and conviction are becoming harder to ignore. In the future of crypto finance, endurance may finally carry tangible weight.

The mining company, founded by Eric Trump, announced its Bitcoin holdings now total 4,931 BTC. This marks a substantial weekly increase of 613 BTC, blending mining rewards with strategic acquisitions. Let’s delve into what this means for the company and the broader market. How Did American Bitcoin Achieve This Major Increase? The recent addition of 613 BTC to American Bitcoin’s reserves didn’t happen by chance. It was a calculated two-pronged strategy. The company reported that 70 BTC came directly from its mining operations. However, the majority—542 BTC—was acquired through deliberate strategic purchases. This approach highlights a proactive stance beyond passive income generation, suggesting the company is actively accumulating assets it believes are undervalued. This dual method is crucial. Mining provides a steady, albeit energy-intensive, stream of new Bitcoin. Strategic purchases, on the other hand, allow the company to deploy capital swiftly when market conditions are favorable. For American Bitcoin, this isn’t just about growing a number; it’s a statement of long-term conviction in the asset’s value. What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The aggressive accumulation by American Bitcoin is a powerful signal in the institutional investment landscape. When a high-profile company linked to a prominent family makes such a move, it often influences market sentiment. Other institutional players may see this as a validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. Furthermore, this action underscores several key trends: Confidence in Asset Value: Buying over half a thousand BTC in a week shows strong belief in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation. Strategic Treasury Management: Companies are moving beyond simple speculation to integrated treasury strategies involving both production and purchase. Mainstream Legitimacy: High-profile involvement continues to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While the accumulation is impressive, it doesn’t come without hurdles. American Bitcoin, like all miners, faces the persistent challenge of energy costs and network difficulty adjustments. Relying on strategic purchases also requires significant capital and impeccable timing. A wrong move in a volatile market can lead to substantial losses. However, the opportunities are compelling. Holding nearly 5,000 BTC positions the company to benefit directly from any major price rallies. It also provides a solid foundation for future business ventures, potential collateral for loans, or a hedge against inflation. For investors watching, the company’s growth trajectory offers a case study in crypto-native corporate strategy. Key Takeaways from American Bitcoin’s Bold Move American Bitcoin’s latest announcement is more than a portfolio update; it’s a strategic play with broader implications. The company has demonstrated a hybrid model of growing Bitcoin reserves that others may emulate. This move reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold for the modern corporate treasury. As institutional adoption inches forward, actions like these provide tangible proof of concept, potentially paving the way for more traditional entities to enter the space. In conclusion, the 613 BTC surge by American Bitcoin is a confident stride in the marathon of cryptocurrency adoption. It blends operational execution with financial strategy, showcasing how dedicated firms are navigating the new digital asset economy. The market will be watching closely to see if this confidence is rewarded. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who founded American Bitcoin? American Bitcoin was founded by Eric Trump, son of former U.S. President Donald Trump. How much Bitcoin does American Bitcoin now hold? Following the recent increase, American Bitcoin’s total holdings are 4,931 BTC. How did the company acquire the additional 613 BTC? The increase came from two sources: 70 BTC were mined, and 542 BTC were bought through strategic market purchases. Why is this increase significant for the crypto market? It signals strong institutional confidence and showcases a active treasury management strategy combining mining and buying, which can influence other investors. What are the main risks for a company holding so much Bitcoin? Primary risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility, regulatory changes, and the operational costs and challenges associated with large-scale mining. Could this affect the price of Bitcoin? While a single entity’s purchase of this size can cause short-term price movement, its greater impact is on long-term sentiment and institutional adoption narratives.

This narrow range has persisted even as U.S. spot XRP ETFs recorded $20.17 million in net inflows, marking the nineteenth consecutive day of positive flows. The contrast between rising capital access and muted price action has become the defining feature of XRP’s current market phase. ETF Flows Continue to Build Data from SoSoValue shows strong inflows across major XRP spot ETFs on December 12. The Franklin XRP ETF added $8.7 million in a single session, pushing cumulative inflows to $185 million. Bitwise’s XRP ETF followed with $7.85 million in daily inflows, lifting its historical total to $213 million. Total net assets across XRP spot ETFs now stand at $1.18 billion, while cumulative inflows approach $975 million. The launch of the 21Shares spot XRP ETF under ticker TOXR expands regulated exposure and reinforces the steady flow trend. Source: SosoValue Price Compression Defines the Setup Despite these inflows, XRP price action remains compressed. XRP continued trading around $2.02, while volatility tightens into an ascending triangle structure . Liquidity concentrates within this narrow band, which signals market patience rather than conviction. Traders often watch such compression closely because it tends to precede directional movement once pressure reaches a tipping point. Source: X Momentum Indicators Show Hesitation Technical indicators reflect consolidation rather than exhaustion. The Relative Strength Index hoveres near 42, which signals hesitation among traders instead of oversold conditions. The MACD compressed and drifted toward a potential bullish crossover, though the price did not react immediately. This behavior suggests absorption, where incoming capital meets existing supply without forcing rapid repricing. Why would inflows not move the price right away? Markets often require time to complete positioning before price follows. Capital Builds Without Immediate Follow-Through XRP has shown similar behavior in past cycles, where access and capital expanded first and price responded later. ETF inflows increased exposure and liquidity depth, yet price stays pinned as participants adjusted positions. This pattern supports the view that the market tests resolve during periods of tight consolidation. If inflows persist without follow-through, pressure tends to accumulate beneath the surface. Fundamentals Expand Beyond Price Action Ripple’s recent infrastructure progress added weight to the broader setup. The company confirmed completion of the Rail acquisition, which strengthened its end-to-end stablecoin and payments capabilities . Source: X Earlier expansions across custody, treasury intelligence, and prime brokerage continued shaping Ripple into a unified digital asset infrastructure provider. Ripple also announced the first European bank adoption of Ripple Payments through AMINA Bank, which extended real-time cross-border settlement across regulated markets. These developments expanded XRP’s utility footprint even as price lagged. Technical Structure Guides Near-Term Focus From a chart perspective, XRP defended the lower boundary of a broad rising channel and attempted a rebound from that base. This structure points to a potential upward continuation if price holds acceptance above the channel floor. Source: X The $2.00 to $2.06 zone now acts as a decision area. A rotation toward $2.15 may follow if buyers maintain control. A sustained move below the channel base would challenge this recovery structure and shift focus back to downside risk. Market Watches Timing Over Direction At this stage, attention has shifted from growth to timing. ETF inflows, adoption milestones, and infrastructure expansion continue to build, while price remains compressed near $2. XRP’s structure reflects a familiar sequence where fundamentals and capital align first, followed by a delayed price response. As compression persists, traders monitor volume, volatility, and reactions near the current range. The next decisive move may depend less on new catalysts and more on how long the market absorbs existing momentum before releasing it.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-13 12:15:17

The development will see the countries involved collaborate to build a trusted supply chain ecosystem for AI, critical minerals, and other areas. The collaboration comes as the United States continues to seek an edge over China in the growing artificial intelligence sector. According to reports, a total of seven countries are in the collective, including Australia, Japan, Britain, Singapore, and Israel. The declaration was signed under the initiative, led by the United States, to forge a coalition among US allies and partners when they attended the inaugural Pax Silica summit in Washington. South Korea joins other partners to sign the Pax Silica declaration Pax Silica was drawn from the Latin word, which means peace, stability, and long-term prosperity, while silica refers to the compound refined into silicon, a chemical element that is important in the making of computer chips that enable the creation of artificial intelligence, the statement from the State Department read. The declaration also comes as President Donald Trump and his administration continue to make moves to solidify America’s lead in the AI industry. The declaration ensures that supply chains are stable, a means by which critical minerals can be moved, countering China’s control over those strategically vital resources amid an intensifying rivalry between the two superpowers. South Korea was represented by Second Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jina at the summit. Although the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates participated in the summit, they did not join the declaration. According to a release by South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, the declaration stressed that AI is a transformative force for countries’ long-term prosperity and that trustworthy systems are important to safeguard mutual security and prosperity. It noted several areas of collaboration, including frontier foundation models, software applications and platforms, network infrastructure, minerals refining and processing, energy, transportation logistics, and information connectivity. Pax Silica initiative to foster collaboration The declaration also highlighted the importance of fair market practices and joint efforts against market distortions, though it refused to name-drop any country. “We believe that true economic security requires reducing excessive dependencies and forging new connections with reliable partners and suppliers committed to fair market practices. We will endeavor to provide access to trusted partners to the full stack of technological advancements that are shaping the AI economy,” the declaration read. It added that coordination is essential to protect private investment, noting that there is an important need to address non-market practices that undermine innovation and fair competition. This way, the market can be protected from overcapacity and unfair dumping practices to preserve a level playing field for innovation and growth. In addition, it mentioned the need for cooperation on policy efforts to protect sensitive technologies and critical infrastructure. The declaration also highlighted that South Korea and other countries involved would build trusted information networks, including information and communication technology systems, fiber-optic cables, and data centers. During the summit, South Korea’s vice foreign minister drummed up the need for cooperation across the global AI supply chain, including energy, minerals, AI infrastructure, transportation, and other aspects. She added that Korea is determined to help promote supply chain stability by using the strength of Korean companies in batteries, semiconductors, energy, and other fields. The Pax Silica initiative comes amid the growing concerns over China’s control of critical minerals, including rare earth elements that are important in the manufacturing of military and electronic equipment.

The incident, which resulted in the loss of over 520,000 0G tokens , highlights a critical vulnerability, yet also demonstrates a crucial distinction: core user assets remained completely secure. Let’s break down exactly what happened, why it matters, and what the team is doing to prevent future attacks. What Was the 0G Tokens Exploit? On December 11th, an attacker successfully drained 520,010 0G tokens from a specific rewards distribution contract. The foundation explained that the hacker exploited the contract’s “emergencyWithdraw” function. This function is typically a safety mechanism, but it became the attack vector. After the theft, the stolen 0G tokens were quickly bridged to another chain and laundered through the privacy mixer Tornado Cash, a common tactic to obscure the trail of illicit funds. How Did This 0G Security Breach Happen? The root cause was not a flaw in the blockchain’s core code. Instead, 0G attributed the breach to a compromised private key. This key was stored on an AliCloud server instance and was apparently leaked. The attacker used this key to authorize the emergency withdrawal. Therefore, the total loss included the 520,010 0G tokens , plus 9.93 ETH and 4,200 USDT from the same compromised contract. The foundation was quick to emphasize a vital point: the main chain infrastructure and, most importantly, all general user wallets and funds were completely unaffected. What Was 0G’s Immediate Response to the Tokens Theft? The team’s reaction was swift and comprehensive. They didn’t just patch a hole; they overhauled their security posture. Their immediate actions included: Revoking all compromised keys and issuing new, secure replacements. Enhancing overall security protocols across their systems. Rebuilding affected services from the ground up. Patching the specific vulnerability that allowed the exploit. This proactive response aimed to contain the incident and restore confidence by showing they take security seriously. What Are the Future Plans to Secure 0G Tokens? Looking ahead, the 0G Foundation is implementing a robust, multi-layered defense strategy. Their goal is to move beyond reactive fixes to a proactive, resilient model. Key future plans include: Implementing a zero-trust security model by migrating sensitive operations to a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This hardware-based security isolates critical processes. Strengthening multi-signature (multisig) permissions, requiring multiple approvals for sensitive transactions. Introducing an automated alert system to detect and respond to anomalous activity in real-time. These steps are designed to create a much higher barrier for any would-be attacker targeting 0G tokens or ecosystem funds. Key Takeaways from the 0G Tokens Incident This event serves as a powerful case study for the entire crypto industry. First, it underscores that the greatest risks often lie in peripheral systems like reward contracts and key management, not always the core blockchain. The fact that user funds were untouched is a testament to proper architectural segregation. Second, a transparent and rapid response is crucial for maintaining trust. Finally, the commitment to advanced security like TEEs shows the evolution from basic protection to sophisticated, institutional-grade safeguards. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Were my personal 0G tokens in my wallet stolen? A: No. The 0G Foundation confirmed that the exploit was isolated to a specific rewards contract. General user funds held in personal wallets or on the main chain were not affected. Q: What is an “emergencyWithdraw” function? A: It’s a safety feature in many smart contracts that allows authorized parties to withdraw assets in case of a bug or emergency. In this case, the attacker gained unauthorized access to the authorization key for this function. Q: What is Tornado Cash? A: It is a cryptocurrency mixing service on Ethereum that obscures the origin of funds. Hackers often use it to launder stolen tokens, making them harder to trace. Q: What is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)? A: A TEE is a secure area inside a main processor. It ensures code and data loaded inside are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. Using it for key management is a major security upgrade. Q: Will this affect the price or future of the 0G project? A> While exploits can cause short-term uncertainty, the project’s transparent handling and advanced security roadmap are positive signs for long-term resilience. The market ultimately judges how well a team responds to and learns from such events. Q: What can I do to keep my own crypto safe? A> Always use hardware wallets for significant holdings, enable all available security features (like 2FA), be wary of connecting to unknown dApps, and never share your private keys or seed phrases. Security in decentralized finance is a shared journey of constant vigilance. This incident with the 0G tokens is a lesson for both projects and users. Did you find this breakdown helpful?

This sideways movement comes as broader crypto markets cool following heightened volatility earlier in the week. Can XRP maintain this floor as network activity and retail participation show signs of fatigue? Market Calms After Federal Reserve Shock XRP extended its range-bound behavior as markets absorbed the Federal Reserve’s recent policy decision. Investors reacted to a hawkish rate cut that highlighted lingering inflation risks and labor market weakness. This backdrop has kept risk assets cautious, and XRP reflected that tone by holding steady rather than attempting a recovery. The environment continues to favor patience over aggressive positioning. On-Chain Activity Shows Clear Slowdown Data from CryptoQuant shows a noticeable decline in activity on the XRP Ledger . Active addresses averaged around 20,000 earlier this week, down from nearly 25,000 in late November and about 32,000 in mid-November. CryptoQuant This steady drop signals reduced user engagement across the network. Lower participation often translates into softer spot demand, which explains the lack of upward momentum despite price stability. Retail Demand Remains Muted Derivatives data reinforces the slowdown narrative. XRP futures Open Interest hovered near $3.72 billion, far below the $9 billion level recorded in October during the broader market crash. Coinglass The decline from the July peak of $10.94 billion shows that leveraged traders have reduced exposure. When Open Interest stays low, traders often wait for clearer signals before committing capital. This behavior keeps volatility contained and price action compressed. ETF Inflows Provide a Counterbalance Despite weaker retail signals, demand for XRP exchange-traded funds has remained steady. On December 12, XRP spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $20.17 million, according to data from SoSoValue. The Franklin XRP ETF led the session with $8.7 million, raising its cumulative inflows to $185 million. Sosovalue The Bitwise XRP ETF followed with $7.85 million, bringing its historical total to $213 million. Overall, XRP spot ETFs now hold $1.18 billion in net assets, with cumulative inflows approaching $975 million. These figures show sustained institutional interest even as on-chain metrics soften. Technical Picture Centers on $2.00 From a technical perspective, XRP continues to trade sideways above the $2.00 support zone. Price has remained locked between roughly $2.00 and $2.05, creating a tight range that reflects indecision. Bulls and bears continue to test each other at this level. Can this compression last much longer? Traders often expect a decisive move after prolonged consolidation, though timing remains uncertain. Source: X Social sentiment around XRP shows pockets of optimism, yet market data paints a quieter picture. Ripple has continued expanding its infrastructure footprint, including stablecoin initiatives and institutional integrations. However, these developments have not translated into immediate price movement. The gap between advancing fundamentals and subdued market reaction has defined XRP’s recent behavior. Focus Shifts to the Next Test As XRP hovers near $2.02, attention remains fixed on whether this support can withstand ongoing pressure. Analysts continue to flag $2.00 as a critical level, with $1.20 often cited as the next major downside area if support fails. For now, XRP reflects a market in pause mode. Price holds steady, participation cools, and investors wait. The next move may depend less on headlines and more on whether demand returns to the ledger and derivatives markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-13 12:29:41

Have you noticed the eerie quiet in the crypto markets? According to a recent report from exchange giant Bitfinex, crypto spot trading volume has taken a dramatic nosedive, falling 66% from its January peak. While this might sound alarming, seasoned analysts see a familiar and potentially hopeful pattern emerging. This significant drop in activity mirrors the quiet periods that historically preceded massive market rallies. Let’s dive into what this means for your portfolio. What Does the 66% Drop in Crypto Spot Trading Volume Really Mean? Bitfinex’s analysis highlights a sharp 66% contraction in crypto spot trading volume during the fourth quarter. For context, spot trading involves the immediate purchase or sale of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A decline this steep often indicates that retail and institutional traders are stepping back from daily buying and selling. However, instead of signaling doom, Bitfinex draws a compelling historical parallel. They liken this lull to the periods of low activity seen in past market cycles just before a powerful, sustained price rally began. In essence, the market might be catching its breath. Why Aren’t Major News Events Moving the Market? This theory of a pre-rally lull gains weight when we look at recent non-events. Two significant developments failed to spark the expected volatility: The Federal Reserve’s Rate Cut: A 25-basis-point cut typically would stir markets, but the reaction was muted. Strategy’s $962 Million BTC Purchase: A nearly billion-dollar Bitcoin buy-order is monumental, yet prices remained stable. CoinEx analyst Jeff Ko provides a clear explanation for this calm: these events were largely already priced in . The market had anticipated and absorbed the news well in advance. This behavior is classic of a consolidation phase, where the market digests information and prepares for its next major move, rather than reacting impulsively to headlines. Is History About to Repeat Itself with Crypto Spot Trading? Looking back provides crucial insight. Major bull markets in cryptocurrency have rarely erupted from periods of frenzied activity. Instead, they often blossom after extended phases of low crypto spot trading volume and sideways price movement. These quiet times shake out short-term speculators and allow stronger, long-term conviction to build among remaining holders. The current landscape—characterized by low volume, priced-in news, and steady institutional accumulation—bears a striking resemblance to these historical pre-bull setups. The pieces are on the board, waiting for a catalyst. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Now So, what should you do in this environment of low crypto spot trading volume ? Panic selling is likely the worst move. Consider this a strategic period. You can use this time to: Conduct thorough research on projects with strong fundamentals. Dollar-cost average into positions you believe in for the long term. Secure your assets in cold storage and review your security practices. Set clear entry and exit strategies for when volatility inevitably returns. The key is to view the lull not as a threat, but as an opportunity to prepare while the market sleeps. Conclusion: Patience Could Be Your Greatest Asset The dramatic 66% drop in crypto spot trading volume reported by Bitfinex is a powerful data point. When combined with the market’s muted reaction to major news, it paints a picture of a market in a holding pattern, not a decline. History suggests these are the precise conditions that forge the foundation for the next significant advance. For the astute investor, this is a time for disciplined preparation, not fear. The quietest moments often roar the loudest in hindsight. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a drop in trading volume always a good sign for prices? A: Not always. It can also indicate waning interest. However, in the context of a broader bullish trend and following a strong rally, it often signals consolidation before the next leg up. Q2: What is “spot” trading volume? A: Spot trading volume measures the amount of cryptocurrency being bought and sold for immediate delivery, as opposed to futures or derivatives contracts. It’s a direct gauge of current market activity. Q3: Why would big news like a Fed rate cut be “priced in”? A: Markets are forward-looking. Traders and algorithms buy or sell in anticipation of an event based on forecasts and data. By the time the news is officially announced, its expected impact has often already been reflected in the price. Q4: How long do these “pre-rally lulls” typically last? A> There’s no set timeline. Historical consolidation phases have lasted anywhere from several weeks to many months. Patience is essential. Q5: Should I stop investing because volume is low? A> Quite the opposite. For long-term investors, low-volume periods can be excellent times to accumulate assets at stable prices through dollar-cost averaging, assuming the project fundamentals are sound. Q6: What could be the catalyst to break this low-volume trend? A> Potential catalysts include unexpected macroeconomic shifts, a major technological breakthrough (like an Ethereum ETF approval), or a surge in mainstream institutional adoption that forces new money into the market.

The regulated digital bank announced this move at the Solana Breakpoint 2025 event in Abu Dhabi. The product allows SGB’s corporate clients to convert fiat into major stablecoins, including USDC and USDT on Solana, and redeem them back to fiat. Singapore Gulf Bank goes live at #SolanaBreakpoint in 30 minutes. Our Chief Growth Officer, Justin Peyton, will be on stage sharing how we are building the next chapter of stablecoin banking on @solana . Watch the livestream: https://t.co/hQZ2sJZvLw — Singapore Gulf Bank (@SGB_app) December 11, 2025 The launch programme waives both transaction and gas fees for clients using Solana for these operations. At first, the service will only be available to SGB’s corporate treasury operations and cross-border business flows. Later, it will be available to personal banking customers as well. SGB’s new service connects regulated banking with blockchain rails Since its market entry, SGB has processed more than $7 billion in transactions. Adding on-chain minting and redemption aims to make financial transactions easier and smoother for clients doing business in these areas. SGB’s new service connects regulated banking with blockchain rails. Clients are allowed to create or destroy stablecoins directly on Solana, without moving assets through intermediaries. To that end, Solana’s high throughput and relatively low on-chain costs will facilitate high-volume, real-time transfers that would otherwise be slow and expensive through conventional banking systems. Shawn Chan, Chief Executive Officer of SGB, stated, “The adoption of stablecoins by regulated banks reflects their growing real-world utility. By leveraging Solana’s speed and cost advantages, we are providing our clients across the GCC and Asian markets with a bank-grade compliant stablecoin solution that finally makes real-time, cross-border and cross-counterparty transactions viable for corporates.” This program comes after the advent of SGB Net. This platform was made to speed up settlements and make managing liquidity easier across both fiat and crypto channels. Additionally, SGB announced a partnership with digital asset infrastructure provider Fireblocks to support secure digital asset custody and treasury operations. This partnership allowed SGB to offer institutional-grade custody for crypto and stablecoins, backed by multi-party computation (MPC) cryptography and secure wallet infrastructure. Besides SGB, other regulated banks and financial infrastructure firms have also been expanding stablecoin services. As reported by Cryptopolitan, DBS and others have explored stablecoin custody and issuance frameworks. Additionally, networks like the Global Dollar Network and platforms like Fireblocks facilitate secure and stablecoin transactions, as well as bank integrations. Singapore’s Payment Services Act and the MAS framework take the lead Southeast Asia received approximately $80 billion in remittances last year, with average fees exceeding 6%. According to internal trials, SGB’s Solana corridor cut effective costs to under 0.3% while settling in seconds. Solana currently hosts over $5 billion in stablecoin liquidity and processes 65,000 transactions per second at sub-cent costs. The service operates under Singapore’s Payment Services Act and the MAS framework for single-currency stablecoins. All minted tokens are backed 1:1, with USDC reserves independently attested monthly by Grant Thornton. Meanwhile, the total stablecoin market cap surpassed $300 billion. This represents a 75% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to a report from Morgan Stanley Investment Management. USDT supply surpassed $191 billion in 2025, with its user base reaching 500 million for the first time in October. Circle has around $78 billion of USDC in circulation. According to Wall Street giant Citi, the stablecoin market is growing faster than expected. This prompted the bank to recently lift its 2030 forecast for issuance to $1.9 trillion in its base case and $4 trillion in a bull case, up from $1.6 trillion and $3.7 trillion, respectively.

Together, the data points showed heavy positioning across futures and options while onchain metrics pointed to continued accumulation behavior as Bitcoin held near recent highs. Large Bitcoin Long Position Appears on Derivatives Platform A large Bitcoin long position worth about 93 million dollars appeared on a derivatives trading platform on December 12, according to data shared publicly on X by trader Vivek Sen. Large Bitcoin Long Position Dashboard. Source: Vivek Sen via X The position shows a 5x leveraged long on the BTC USD pair with an entry price near 91,506 dollars and a position value listed at roughly 92.5 million dollars. At the time the data was captured, the trade showed an unrealized profit of more than 1 million dollars as Bitcoin traded above 92,500 dollars. The disclosure did not identify the owner of the position. However, the size of the trade places it among the larger single Bitcoin long positions currently visible on public dashboards that track major leveraged accounts. Large leveraged positions often draw attention because they can reflect institutional scale strategies or high conviction directional bets. At the same time, such trades carry higher liquidation risk if price moves sharply against the position. Bitcoin Options Open Interest Stays Elevated as Market Activity Builds Meanwhile, Bitcoin options open interest remained near record levels this week, according to market data highlighted by crypto analyst Mister Crypto on X, pointing to continued buildup in derivatives positioning. Bitcoin Options Open Interest Chart. Source: CoinGlass via Mister Crypto on X The chart shows total Bitcoin options open interest rising alongside price over recent months, with notional exposure staying high as BTC trades near upper ranges. Open interest measures the total value of outstanding options contracts and often reflects how much leverage and risk traders hold across the market. Data from CoinGlass indicates that options exposure expanded sharply during the latest price advance and has not meaningfully declined during recent consolidations. As a result, derivatives positioning remains dense compared with earlier phases of the cycle. Elevated options open interest typically signals heightened market participation and sensitivity to price moves. As Bitcoin continues trading near recent highs, derivatives metrics suggest that positioning remains active across major options venues. Bitcoin Withdrawals From Binance Spike as Accumulation Signals Strengthen Bitcoin exchange withdrawal activity on Binance increased sharply near the 91,000-dollar level, according to data published by CryptoQuant and shared by Bitcoin Archive on X. Bitcoin Exchange Withdrawing Transactions Binance. Source: CryptoQuant via Bitcoin Archive on X The chart shows a surge in Bitcoin exchange withdrawing transactions as price hovered around recent highs. Exchange withdrawals track coins leaving trading platforms, a metric often associated with investors moving assets into self custody rather than preparing them for sale. CryptoQuant data indicates that recent withdrawal spikes stand out compared with prior months, even as Bitcoin trades near elevated levels. The pattern suggests continued accumulation behavior rather than distribution during the current price range. Historically, periods of strong withdrawal activity have coincided with phases where market participants reduce available exchange supply. As Bitcoin remains near 91,000 dollars, onchain data shows that accumulation pressure continues to build alongside price strength.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-13 12:36:09

The move has reopened a political standoff over how quickly the country should align its crypto rules with European Union standards. The cabinet reapproved the bill and urged the president to give his signature, arguing that further delays could leave Poland out of step with EU regulations and weaken oversight of the fast-growing digital asset sector. The appeal came days after parliament failed to secure enough votes to override the veto. The renewed push drew attention because the resubmitted bill did not include material changes, even though the president had already rejected the same text earlier this month. Veto Blocks Crypto Law Despite Parliamentary Vote President Nawrocki vetoed the cryptoassets bill earlier in December, citing concerns about its scope and potential impact on market participants. His decision immediately halted the law, which had passed through parliament but required presidential approval to take effect. Lawmakers in the Sejm later attempted to override the veto. However, they fell short of the required supermajority, leaving the bill blocked under Poland’s constitutional process. As a result, the legislation could not advance, despite support from the ruling coalition. The veto created an unusual situation in which the government’s legislative agenda stalled, even though the bill had already cleared most parliamentary hurdles. That impasse set the stage for the cabinet’s decision to reapprove the same draft. Government Cites EU Rules and Security Risks After the failed override vote, the government approved the bill again and publicly urged the president to reconsider. Officials said the legislation is necessary to implement the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets framework, known as MiCA, which sets common rules for crypto firms across the bloc. Government representatives argued that without the law, Poland risks falling behind other EU states that are already moving to enforce MiCA standards. They also said the absence of clear domestic rules could weaken supervision and enforcement in the crypto sector. In public statements, the government linked the issue to broader security concerns. It warned that regulatory gaps could expose the financial system to abuse and illicit activity, adding urgency to its call for the president’s approval. The president has not indicated whether he will change his position. Until he signs the bill or a revised version clears parliament, Poland’s crypto framework remains in limbo.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-13 12:38:01

The much-anticipated US crypto bill, aimed at creating a comprehensive market structure, will likely not see a vote until January. This frustrating delay comes as lawmakers struggle to bridge major divides on several core issues, leaving the industry in a state of prolonged uncertainty just as the year ends. Why is the US Crypto Bill Stalled? According to reports, negotiations in the U.S. Senate have reached an impasse. Key disagreements remain unresolved, forcing discussions to pause for the year-end recess. A draft of the US crypto bill is currently circulating privately. However, finding common ground between industry representatives, the White House, Republicans, and Democrats has proven challenging. The delay underscores the complexity of regulating a fast-evolving sector that touches on finance, technology, and consumer protection. What Are the Major Sticking Points? Three primary conflicts are holding up progress on the US crypto bill. These are not minor details but fundamental questions about how the digital asset ecosystem should operate under U.S. law. Ethics and Conflict of Interest Rules: A proposal for stricter rules for senior government officials dealing with crypto has reportedly been rejected by the White House. This issue aims to prevent regulatory capture but faces opposition. Interest-Bearing Stablecoins: Lawmakers are divided on whether to permit these popular digital tokens, which peg their value to traditional assets like the dollar. Their treatment is a central pillar of the US crypto bill. SEC Jurisdiction and DeFi: Perhaps the most contentious issue is defining the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s power. The industry has firmly opposed regulations it believes would infringe on the operational freedom of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. What Does the Industry Say About the Delay? Despite the setback, key stakeholders indicate that work continues behind the scenes. Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, confirmed that both parties are actively negotiating the bill’s text. He expressed optimism, stating he expects substantial progress to begin in early January once Congress reconvenes. This suggests the delay is a tactical pause rather than a collapse of talks. The industry’s “red line” on DeFi regulations shows how fiercely it will defend certain principles, even for a desired US crypto bill. What Happens Next for Crypto Regulation? The push to January creates a narrow but crucial window for action. All sides recognize the need for regulatory clarity, but achieving it requires compromise. The outcome of this US crypto bill will set a precedent, influencing not just American markets but global policy. Will lawmakers find a balanced approach that fosters innovation while protecting consumers? The next few weeks of private negotiation will be decisive. The world is watching to see if the U.S. can establish a coherent framework for the digital age. In conclusion, the delay of the US crypto bill is a reminder that crafting landmark legislation is a complex dance. The core issues of stablecoins, SEC authority, and DeFi are monumental. However, the continued dialogue offers a glimmer of hope. The January timeline represents a new opportunity to get this pivotal regulation right, potentially unlocking the next phase of growth for the entire crypto ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the US crypto bill trying to achieve? A: The bill aims to establish a clear market structure for digital assets in the United States, defining rules for trading, stablecoins, and which agencies regulate different parts of the crypto ecosystem. Q: Why is the bill being delayed until January? A: Key disagreements on major issues like stablecoins, SEC jurisdiction, and ethics rules could not be resolved before Congress’s year-end recess, requiring more negotiation time. Q: What is the “red line” the industry has drawn? A: Industry advocates have stated they will strongly oppose any part of the US crypto bill that they believe would impose overly restrictive regulations on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, arguing it would stifle innovation. Q: Who is involved in the negotiations? A: Discussions involve industry representatives, the White House, and both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the Senate, indicating a high-stakes, cross-party effort. Q: Is there still hope for the bill to pass? A> Yes. Stakeholders like the Digital Chamber’s CEO expect substantive progress in January, suggesting the delay is for further refinement, not abandonment.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granted the approvals on December 12, according to public filings and people familiar with the matter. The decision covers Circle and Ripple through new national trust bank charters, while BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos received approval to convert existing state trust entities into federally regulated institutions. Together, the moves expand the list of crypto firms operating under direct OCC oversight. The approvals remain conditional. Each firm must still meet capital, governance, compliance, and operational requirements before launching under its new charter. However, the step signals growing regulatory acceptance of federally supervised crypto custody and settlement services. What the OCC Approved and Why It Matters Circle and Ripple received approval to establish new national trust banks. These charters allow firms to provide custody and trust services nationwide under a single federal regulator, instead of navigating separate state rules. BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos followed a different path. The OCC approved their conversions from state chartered trust companies to national trust banks, a move that places them directly under federal supervision while keeping their business models focused on custody and settlement. National trust banks differ from commercial banks. They generally do not accept retail deposits or issue traditional loans. Instead, they specialize in safeguarding assets, managing fiduciary accounts, and supporting institutional financial infrastructure tied to digital assets. Conditional Approval and the Regulatory Context Conditional approval means the firms cannot yet operate as national trust banks. The OCC requires each applicant to complete supervisory conditions related to risk controls, compliance systems, and internal governance before receiving final authorization. This framework mirrors the approach taken with Anchorage Digital, which remains the only crypto firm currently operating with a finalized national trust bank charter. Regulators have cited that model as a reference point for integrating digital asset firms into the federal banking system. The approvals arrive as policymakers push for clearer oversight of crypto infrastructure rather than enforcement through fragmented state regimes. By expanding the number of federally supervised trust banks, regulators aim to bring core crypto custody and settlement activity under consistent national standards.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-13 12:41:44

This time around, the fintech seeks to gain permission to make its own equity available directly on a public blockchain with this recent IPO submission. This move comes just a few days after Figure Technology’s recent listing on Nasdaq . The latest public offering aims to expand the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Solana blockchain. Figure reveals another IPO submission to explore Solana ecosystem Mike Cagney, the co-founder and CEO of financial services company Figure Technology Solutions, announced their latest decision to file an IPO with the SEC during the Solana Breakpoint conference. According to Cagney, this recent public offering aims to establish what he refers to as “a new version of Figure equity on a public blockchain,” with a particular focus on Solana. Afterwards, the co-founder made it clear that this blockchain-based equity would not be made available for trade on regular exchanges, such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. Cagney also noted that it will not rely on brokers such as Robinhood or leading firms like Goldman Sachs. Preferably, it will be issued and made available for trade directly on the blockchain via Figure’s alternative trading system. Cagney referred to this trading system as “essentially a decentralized exchange.” The American entrepreneur also argued that investors can utilize the tokenized security within DeFi protocols, which will enable them to borrow against it or lend it out, following the introduction of equity directly on Solana. Meanwhile, sources close to the situation mentioned that the firm’s main objective extends further than merely tokenizing its own shares, citing an earlier statement from Cagney. In this statement, the CEO outlined intentions to provide assistance to other firms, enabling them to offer equity directly within the Solana ecosystem. “One of our main goals is not only to bring equity into the Solana ecosystem but also to allow for native Solana equity issuance,” he said. Solana positions itself as one of the largest public blockchains by activity Following Figure’s latest decision, analysts acknowledge that Solana has already positioned itself as one of the largest public blockchains by activity. With this classification, they also discovered that Solana is increasingly becoming a crucial player in the tokenized assets market, gradually boosting its holdings in the real-world asset (RWA) market over the past year. Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise Asset Management, a leading crypto asset manager, shared his belief that Solana will probably become the main network for stablecoins and tokenized assets preferred in the financial industry in the future. He made these remarks although Ethereum has solidified its position as a leader in tokenization today. On the other hand, analysts anticipate that blockchains offering accelerated, high-capacity, and swift transaction finality will draw the interest of most investors in the financial sector. This prediction was released when Wall Street announced that it was carefully examining the viability of tokenized assets over time. In the meantime, Hougan claimed that Solana has a competitive edge in this sector over several other networks. To support this claim, research from RedStone highlighted that Solana is a “high-performance challenger” in the RWA field, particularly in tokenized US Treasury markets.

He said traders should wait for a break above roughly $2.20, with at least a daily candle to confirm bullish structure. He reported that the highest traded volume over the past year clustered around $2.2. The asset also currently shows a big liquidation cluster around that level . He also pointed to a green support zone near $1.9 to $2 that has held since December 2024. He identified the 200-day moving average near $2.7 as a critical confirmation level. He compared XRP to Bitcoin in 2023, noting Bitcoin triggered a big rally after clearing its 200-day MA near $28k. He suggested a similar break above $2.7 for XRP could signal higher prices. The analyst flagged a confirmed bearish crossover on the monthly MACD for XRP. He said this monthly signal has occurred twice previously and led to major declines. He referenced 2019 and 2022 as past cases and said those crossovers preceded steep selloffs, including a decline of 84% following the 2019 event.

This transfer, valued at approximately $205 million, originated from the prominent mining pool Antpool and was sent to an unknown wallet. Such significant movements often trigger intense speculation about market intentions and future price action. Let’s break down what this means. What Does This Major Bitcoin Transaction Tell Us? When a Bitcoin transaction of this magnitude occurs, analysts immediately look for clues. The source, Antpool, is one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pools. The destination, however, is labeled ‘unknown,’ meaning the wallet’s owner is not publicly identifiable on the blockchain. This lack of transparency is common but fuels questions. Is this an institutional investor repositioning assets? Could it be an exchange’s internal wallet consolidation? The sheer size suggests this is a ‘whale’—an entity holding a large amount of Bitcoin—making a strategic move. Why Do Large BTC Transfers Cause Market Jitters? Large Bitcoin transactions can signal several things to the market. First, they demonstrate substantial liquidity and movement among major holders. Second, the destination is key. Transfers to known exchange wallets often precede selling, potentially increasing sell-side pressure. Conversely, moves to private, cold storage wallets suggest a long-term holding strategy, which is generally viewed as bullish. In this case, the unknown nature of the receiving wallet leaves the market in suspense, watching for the next move. Understanding the context is crucial. The crypto market is highly sentiment-driven. Therefore, a single large Bitcoin transaction can influence trader psychology, even if it’s just a routine transfer. Key aspects to consider include: Timing: Where does this transfer fall in relation to current price trends? Source Reputation: Antpool is a legitimate, major player, reducing fears of illicit activity. Market Impact: While $205 million is significant, it’s a fraction of Bitcoin’s daily trading volume, limiting direct price impact. How Can Investors Interpret Whale Movements? For everyday investors, reacting to every whale alert is not a viable strategy. However, monitoring these large Bitcoin transactions can provide valuable context. They are pieces of a larger puzzle that includes macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and on-chain metrics. A prudent approach is to note the activity but not make impulsive decisions based solely on it. The history of crypto markets shows that whale movements are sometimes precursors to volatility, but they are rarely the sole cause of major trend reversals. In summary, the transfer of 2,265 BTC from Antpool is a noteworthy event that underscores the active and sometimes opaque nature of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It highlights the constant movement of large capital and serves as a reminder that major players are always maneuvering. While the intent behind this specific Bitcoin transaction remains unknown, it reinforces the importance of transparency and the ongoing narrative of institutional-scale activity in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does an ‘unknown wallet’ mean in a Bitcoin transaction? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ is a cryptocurrency address not publicly linked to a specific identity, exchange, or institution. It is simply a string of characters on the blockchain whose owner has chosen to remain anonymous. Q: Should I be worried when I see a large BTC transfer to an unknown wallet? A: Not necessarily. While it can indicate a whale moving funds, it doesn’t automatically mean selling. It could be secure cold storage, an OTC (over-the-counter) trade settlement, or internal accounting. Context from other market data is key. Q: How does Whale Alert track these transactions? A: Whale Alert uses software to monitor public blockchain data in real-time. It filters for transactions exceeding a certain value threshold and posts alerts to social media, providing transparency into large-scale movements. Q: Can a single $205 million Bitcoin transaction crash the market? A> It is highly unlikely. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume often exceeds $20 billion. A $205 million transfer is significant but represents about 1% of daily volume, so its direct price impact is usually limited unless it triggers widespread panic selling. Q: What is Antpool’s role in this? A: Antpool is a Bitcoin mining pool where multiple miners combine computational power. It earns block rewards (new Bitcoin) and transaction fees. This transfer likely involved Bitcoin accumulated by the pool, which was then moved to another entity, possibly a paying out to miners or a corporate treasury action.

Support at $13.30–$13.40 holds, showing buyers defending demand. Compressed short-term structure with lower highs limits bullish momentum below $14–$14.20. On December 13, 2025, Chainlink (LINK) trades at $13.82, marking a 1.65% decline over the past 24 hours. Price action remained volatile, with LINK fluctuating between an intraday high of $14.33 and a low of $13.34, as traders responded primarily to short-term technical dynamics rather than headline-driven catalysts. The failure to sustain levels above the $14 psychological threshold pointed to active distribution and fading bullish control. Chainlink 1-day price chart: LINK range rejection and structural cooling On the daily timeframe, Chainlink (LINK) remained under pressure after failing to hold above the $14.20–$14.30 resistance zone, confirming strong overhead supply. The rejection produced extended upper wicks and a sharp pullback, signaling short-term buyer exhaustion and reinforcing a range-bound structure rather than a sustained bullish continuation. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView Price stabilized above the $13.30–$13.40 support band, a previously defended demand zone that limited further downside. Momentum indicators showed cooling bullish strength, while declining volume during consolidation suggested the pullback was corrective, leaving LINK structurally neutral-to-bearish unless buyers reclaim $14.20 with conviction. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK intraday sell-off followed by base formation On the 4-hour chart, LINK saw a sharp sell-off after losing support near $14.00, driving the price quickly toward the $13.40 low. The move unfolded with strong bearish candles, reflecting aggressive short-term selling and technically driven liquidations rather than a change in fundamentals. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView After the decline, the price consolidated between $13.50 and $13.70, forming a short-term base as buyers began absorbing supply. Despite emerging higher lows, descending resistance and lower highs kept momentum capped, leaving a break above $14.00 necessary to negate the short-term bearish structure and confirm renewed upside.

Chainlink (LINK) is likely to remain range-bound in the short term, with support at $13.30–$13.40 limiting downside and overhead resistance at $14–$14.20 capping upside. A decisive break above $14.20 could signal renewed bullish momentum, while failure to reclaim this level may keep LINK in a neutral-to-bearish structure. Traders should watch for higher lows forming near support and volume trends, as these will indicate whether buyers are regaining control or if the market continues consolidating within the current range. Is Chainlink a good investment? Chainlink’s short-term price action suggests a neutral-to-bearish structure, with strong resistance at $14–$14.20 and support at $13.30–$13.40 keeping it range-bound. For investors, this means LINK may not offer significant upside until it decisively breaks above the $14.20 level. Traders with a short-term horizon might look for opportunities near support or on a confirmed breakout, while long-term investors should consider LINK’s fundamentals, adoption in the Oracle ecosystem, and broader crypto market trends. As always, risk management is essential, as technical consolidation indicates potential volatility remains. Why is the LINK price down today? Chainlink’s decline today is driven primarily by short-term technical factors rather than fundamental news. The price failed to hold above the $14 psychological level, triggering active distribution and short-term profit-taking. On the intraday and daily charts, LINK shows lower highs and extended upper wicks, signaling cooling bullish momentum and buyer exhaustion. Additionally, a sharp sell-off occurred after losing support near $14.00, pushing the price toward $13.34 before consolidating. Overall, the drop reflects a combination of range-bound trading, profit-taking, and cautious positioning by traders, with the market waiting for a decisive break above $14–$14.20 to reignite bullish sentiment. Will Chainlink reach $50? Based on long-term forecasts from industry experts, Chainlink (LINK) is projected to reach $50 by 2028, The Chainlink forecast indicates potential future price movements as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow.

However, finding support at the $2 mark has been a consistent theme during the altcoin’s period of decline. Most recently, the XRP price fell this week from its local high close to $2.20 before bouncing back from the $2 mark. While the coin’s value continues to hover around this psychological price point, below is a look at other relevant levels that could determine its future trajectory. Key On-Chain Levels For XRP In a December 12 post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared on-chain insights into the current market outlook for the XRP token. Using Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap, the market pundit identified three key levels for the XRP price. Related Reading: Crypto Exchange Binance To Assist Pakistan In Tokenizing $2 Billion In Government Bonds The Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap tracks the average cost basis of the total XRP token supply. With the help of a heatmap, this metric highlights different price levels and the density of investors who purchased their tokens within and around these price levels. The deep red shade on the heatmap indicates an investor cluster with their cost basis around the highlighted price regions. These zones often act as dynamic support and resistance, depending on whether the current XRP price is below or above them. Martinez highlighted that the $1.96 and 1.78 zones are the next support cushions for the price of XRP. As seen with recent rebounds around the $1.96 level, the altcoin will likely also bounce back (if it loses the current immediate support) at $1.78, as investors tend to double down and defend their positions by buying more when the price returns to their cost basis, thereby keeping the token’s price afloat. Meanwhile, Martinez noted that the $2.17 level is a resistance zone for the XRP price, as several investors with their cost basis around it are likely to sell when the price returns to this zone. This selling activity, in turn, puts downward pressure on the altcoin and prevents its price from breaking out. Ultimately, this on-chain observation reveals that the XRP price needs to at least break the resistance at $2.17 to kickstart any fresh upward trajectory. On the flip side, a loss of the $1.96 support could see the fourth-largest cryptocurrency fall to as low as $1.78. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of XRP stands at around $2.01, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the altcoin is down by nearly 2% on the weekly timeframe, according to CoinGecko’s data.

55731885,644705,1765630832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55731885.jpeg,Hyperliquid’s Latest Announcement: Why It Could Be A Game Changer For HYPE Investors,https://bitcoinist.com/hyperliquids-latest-announcement-game-changer-hype/,"Hyperliquid (HYPE), one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in the industry, has announced the pre-alpha launch of a portfolio margin system on its testnet, marking a significant advance for traders by unifying spot and perpetual (perps) trading to enhance capital efficiency. This system supports various trading strategies, such as carry trades, wherein spot balances can collateralize short perps. Additionally, idle assets will automatically earn yield, creating a more dynamic trading environment. Hyperliquid’s New Upgrade In this initial rollout, users can only borrow Circle’s USDC stablecoin, with the exchange’s native token HYPE designated as the sole collateral asset. However, Hyperliquid plans to introduce Native Market’s USDH and Bitcoin (BTC) before transitioning to the alpha version. The portfolio margin framework is designed to be applicable across all HIP-3 decentralized exchanges and is expected to extend to future asset classes under the HyperCore umbrella. An upcoming upgrade will provide smart contract access via CoreWriter, allowing developers to create on-chain strategies using ERC-20-based wrappers, which will further broaden the platform’s functionality. Market expert Austin King recently articulated the importance of this launch in a post on X (formerly Twitter), noting on the historical significance of portfolio margin, reflecting on its introduction in traditional finance (TradFi) that added an impressive $7.2 trillion to the derivatives market within a few years. The Essential Role Of Portfolio Margin The expert recalled that the government had introduced margin requirements in 1934 in response to excessive leverage during the 1929 crash. While well-intentioned, these regulations simplified the complex nature of liquidity and often exacerbated volatility in markets . The inability to run delta-neutral strategies efficiently meant that significant margin was required for each position, presenting a challenge for traders. The introduction of portfolio margin by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1988 transformed this landscape by reducing margin requirements through a comprehensive analysis of overall risk across combined positions. Yet it wasn’t until 2006 that retail customers gained access to these benefits, as they had been historically limited to broker-dealers and market makers . So, what does this mean for Hyperliquid? According to King’s thesis, the introduction of portfolio margin is poised to significantly enhance liquidity growth on the platform. Increased Open Interest and trading volume can be expected for every dollar of margin in the system. Effectively, this will create a substantial liquidity multiplier for every new dollar that enters Hyperliquid. Moreover, portfolio margining serves as an essential tool for large-scale liquidity providers in the traditional financial sector. The expert asserted that without this capability, it would be economically challenging for significant TradFi players to participate in providing liquidity on Hyperliquid, as the returns per dollar of margin would be considerably lower compared to traditional exchanges that offer portfolio margin. King concluded the following: There is more work to be done, but with this rollout one of the biggest issues I repeatedly heard cited will no longer be a blocker. At the time of writing, HYPE was trading at $28.83, having recorded significant losses of 18% and 25% over the fourteen- and thirty-day time frames, respectively. However, it is one of the few tokens that remains in the green zone on a year-to-date basis, with gains of 60% recorded in this period.

The senators argued that letting Nvidia sell its second-most advanced AI chip in China breaks from past efforts to limit the use of American tech in China’s military programs. The letter came four days after Trump told China’s leader Xi Jinping that the U.S. would allow Nvidia to ship the H200 “under conditions that allow for strong national security.” Nvidia agreed to give 25% of the revenue from China sales to the U.S. government. Senators said the White House made the decision at the exact moment federal prosecutors announced charges against smugglers who moved thousands of H200 chips into China. Senators press Trump as export-control fight grows Senators Elizabeth Warren, Elissa Slotkin, Chuck Schumer, Tim Kaine, Michael Bennet, Andy Kim, and Ron Wyden said the decision “gives away critical national security controls” and could boost China’s military programs. They reminded Lutnick that Nvidia had been blocked from selling any advanced chips to China since April, when the administration tightened rules on high-end hardware. They also noted that Trump had approved a smaller deal in August for Nvidia’s H20 chip. Nvidia agreed then to give the government 15% of sales, but the plan collapsed when China told buyers not to purchase the downgraded chip. Nvidia’s chief executive Jensen Huang later pushed for approval to sell a weaker Blackwell model in China. Cabinet officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, warned that it created too much risk. Trump said no. But the administration changed position this week and allowed H200 exports, even though the chip is almost six times stronger than the H20 China rejected months ago. The senators wrote that the Justice Department’s new smuggling cases show how valuable the H200 is, since prosecutors described Nvidia’s chips as the “building blocks of AI superiority” and essential for “modern military applications.” They said giving China legal access hurts U.S. startups, labs, and universities during a period when advanced chips remain scarce in America. Agencies fire back as Nvidia defends its position The Commerce Department dismissed the senators’ warnings. A spokesman said, “These same Democrats were silent when the last administration sold out our national security to the world,” and added that Lutnick supports strict rules on advanced technology. The White House also weighed in. Spokesman Kush Desai said there is “an obvious difference between chips being illegally smuggled to unknown buyers without regulatory oversight and chips being exported following national security inspections to specifically designated end users.” Nvidia defended the approval, saying that Trump’s decision “strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America” and argued that China already accelerated its own chip development after the earlier U.S. ban. Nvidia also said it is managing its “supply chain to ensure that licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact” on U.S. supply. The senators also flagged what they called the “appearance of corruption and insider access,” pointing to Nvidia’s recent “charm offensive” in Washington. They noted Huang’s private meetings with Trump and Nvidia’s donation to the White House ballroom construction fund. The letter marks the second Senate push in weeks aimed at blocking Nvidia’s plans to restart China sales. Nvidia has told investors that renewed access to the Chinese market could bring tens of billions of dollars in yearly revenue . Last week, a bipartisan group led by Tom Cotton introduced the Safe Chips Act, which would force the Commerce Department to deny export licenses for 30 months for certain advanced chips going to China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

Digital assets are no longer operating at the margins of finance. Regulatory reform, institutional adoption, and government-backed policy shifts are now merging blockchain technology with core banking infrastructure. This evolution marks a decisive break from the experimental phase of crypto finance. SMQKE’s insights show how this change is playing out in the U.S. His analysis connects recent regulatory actions, stablecoin legislation, and banking charters to a deeper integration of crypto-native firms. Within this framework, XRP’s role increasingly aligns with mainstream banking architecture rather than parallel financial systems. U.S. Policy Signals a Strategic Pivot The U.S. administration has formally embraced digital finance as a national priority. President Donald Trump’s Executive Order 14178 establishes a clear mandate for blockchain leadership. The order promotes regulatory clarity, innovation, and integration across financial markets. It directs Congress and regulators to close oversight gaps that previously stalled institutional participation. This approach makes digital assets more about building the future of finance, not just trading. The policy shift reflects a recognition that financial competitiveness now depends on digital settlement technologies. XRP is officially integrated into the mainframe of banking. Documented. https://t.co/3WoSK07BTx pic.twitter.com/Ru3q91ZZzN — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 12, 2025 Regulatory Clarity and Market Enablement The SEC and CFTC are now tasked with using existing authorities to support digital asset markets. Their mandate includes guidance on registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping. This clarity is essential for institutional-scale adoption. Proposed legislation also strengthens the CFTC’s role over spot markets for non-security digital assets. This change resolves years of jurisdictional ambiguity. As a result, compliant digital assets can operate at the federal level with defined oversight. Stablecoins and Dollar Preservation The GENIUS Act represents a critical pillar of this transition. It proposes strict standards for stablecoin issuance and reserve transparency. Stablecoins must be fully backed by liquid assets, including dollars and U.S. Treasury bills. This framework reinforces dollar dominance rather than weakening it. Stablecoins become digital extensions of U.S. monetary power. They also create regulated pathways for blockchain settlement systems to integrate with traditional finance.

Ripple has received conditional approval from the OCC to charter Ripple National Trust Bank . These charters allow crypto companies to operate within federal banking structures. This model bypasses traditional correspondent banking layers. Blockchain-based settlement systems move directly into regulated banking operations. For Ripple, this aligns precisely with its long-standing payments strategy. XRP’s Role in Mainframe Banking XRP’s design supports fast, capital-efficient settlement between institutions . As crypto firms gain banking legitimacy, XRP’s utility becomes structural. It functions within regulated financial rails, not alongside them. This marks a shift from experimental adoption to infrastructure-level integration. XRP is no longer positioned as an alternative system. It is increasingly embedded within the evolving core of modern banking. A Structural Turning Point The convergence of regulation, legislation, and banking access confirms a broader reality. Digital assets are becoming part of financial infrastructure. XRP’s integration reflects this systemic transition, not a speculative narrative. What emerges is a banking system redesigned for speed, transparency, and global interoperability. XRP’s now part of this bigger financial shift, marking a key moment in how money moves.

Meanwhile, another setup warned of a potential flag driven drop toward $2,400 as ETH also drew fresh comparisons with IWM, a Russell 2000 proxy. Ethereum MACD Turns Green as Chart Marks $3,900 Resistance Ethereum’s momentum indicator flashed a fresh bullish signal after the Moving Average Convergence Divergence line turned positive for the first time in about three months, according to crypto trader Merlijn The Trader in a post on X. Ethereum USD 2 Day Price Chart with MACD: Source: Merlijn The Trader via X However, the same chart showed a sharp two day downswing on Coinbase. ETH USD printed an open near $3,325, then fell to a low around $3,058, before closing near $3,063, a drop of about $262, or 7.88%, based on the price panel shown in the post. At the same time, the chart highlighted a broad support band near the mid $2,000s. Price dipped into that zone during the recent slide and then rebounded, which the post described as support holding. Still, the graphic flagged the area around $3,900 as the key overhead level. The chart labeled that zone as the level Ethereum “needs to break,” while the MACD panel below showed a bullish crossover and a shift back to green histogram bars. Chart Compares Ethereum With Russell 2000 Proxy Crypto commentator Mister Crypto said Ethereum is “starting to catch up” to the Russell 2000, in a post on X that paired ETH price candles with a line representing IWM, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. Ethereum vs IWM Russell 2000 Comparison Chart. Source: Mister Crypto via X The graphic plotted both series across the same timeline, with IWM shown as a blue line and ETH shown as candlesticks. The two traces moved in broadly similar waves through 2024 and 2025, including a sharp selloff and a later rebound, based on the chart’s layout. On the far right, the chart highlighted a recent ETH bounce after a steep drop, while the IWM line appeared to remain higher relative to its prior range. Mister Crypto framed that gap as room for Ethereum to close, while the image included a vertical marker suggesting a potential catch up move. Ethereum Chart Shows Flag Risk as $2,400 Target Appears Crypto analyst Ali Martinez, known as @alicharts on X, said Ethereum could slide toward $2,400 if a flag pattern on his chart plays out.

The latest move on the chart broke below the channel and extended into a projected downswing, which aligned with Martinez’s $2,400 level. The graphic placed that downside area near the lower right of the price scale, with the projection moving from the low 3,000s toward the mid 2,000s.

Speaking on FOX News, Dimon offered a blunt assessment of what is coming as artificial intelligence continues to spread across the United States. While Dimon notes the negative effect, his message to American workers is that they should not panic. He highlighted that survival in the AI age will hinge less on technical wizardry and more on the great human skills that machines cannot replicate. AI will eliminate jobs, Dimon said. That doesn’t mean that people won’t have other jobs. He advised the populace to learn skills that could be in demand even in the face of artificial intelligence adoption. Jamie Dimon warns the populace over job losses tied to AI Jamie Dimon’s warnings come as artificial intelligence moves from being just a science project to a hard reality for millions of workers. Across the United States , executives are currently at loggerheads over its effect, especially on the job changes of younger and white-collar employees. Some labor experts already see AI as the main factor in the rising unemployment rate among young workers. However, Dimon has pushed back on the claims, noting that the current labor market is softer. The JPMorgan Chase CEO claimed that today’s market has more to do with caution than code. Jobs have gotten a little weaker, wages have gotten a little weaker, Dimon said to host Maria Bartiromo. “You talk to businesses, they’re going to be a little more cautious hiring. That’s not because of AI. That’s just because they want to do more with less.” While he admitted that AI could displace workers, Dimon rejected the forecast of a sudden collapse in employment because of the technology. “Look, I don’t think AI is going to dramatically reduce jobs,” he said, describing the technology as a long-term force for progress. “For the most part, AI’s going to do great things for mankind like tractors, fertilizers, vaccines did.” Dimon noted that the benefits might eventually transform everyday life, predicting that in the future, people would need to work less while living a better life. “Maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives,” he said. “It’ll cure a lot of cancers.” AI is predicted to open up better job opportunities Jamie Dimon also warned that the gains of AI would only come if the technology is properly governed. “Now, of course it needs to be properly regulated,” he said. “There are downsides just like there are to airplanes, pharmaceuticals, cars. All things get used by bad people.” However, he noted that even with the guidance, job losses associated with the technology are still inevitable. He highlighted that it will eliminate some jobs, but would be able to provide people with other jobs. In addition, Dimon talked about the pace of change rather than the technology itself. He said that is exactly where the risk lies. “If it does happen too fast for society, which is possible, you know, we can’t assimilate all these people that quickly,” he said, comparing the transition to past economic upheavals caused by farming automation, electricity, and the internet. He noted that governments and firms need to learn from past mistakes and learn to transition carefully and deliberately. He also argued that investment in artificial intelligence could increase employment in the future. “You have a huge amount of construction that needs to take place,” he said. “You need roads and trucks and drivers. You need servers, you need fire — all of that. So it’s going to cause probably more jobs in the short run in total,” Dimon added. Dimon’s statement comes after Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei mentioned in May that AI could erase up to half of all white collar jobs over the next five years. Get seen where it counts.

This approval marks a major breakthrough, especially for RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin. A national trust bank charter would place RLUSD squarely within the U.S. federal banking system, under OCC supervision and NYDFS state oversight. Together, these top-tier regulators set the gold standard for financial compliance, establishing a new benchmark for how stablecoins are issued, governed, and trusted in the United States. For years, critics, particularly banking lobbyists, have claimed crypto firms exploit regulatory gaps while posing systemic risks. Ripple’s move directly upends that narrative. Instead of evading oversight, Ripple is embracing it, voluntarily subjecting its stablecoin and trust operations to the same regulatory standards as traditional financial institutions. This is more than a symbolic win. An OCC-chartered national trust bank would enable Ripple to custody assets, operate payment rails, and issue regulated digital dollars within a clear federal legal framework. For consumers and enterprises, that means greater transparency, stronger protections, and higher confidence that blockchain-based financial products can operate safely within the traditional banking system. More importantly, it signals a broader shift in U.S. crypto innovation. Rather than clashing with regulators, Ripple is charting a compliance-first path, showing that blockchain and regulation can coexist and, together, strengthen the future of finance. Well, Brad Garlinghouse’s message to banking lobbyists is clear: claims that crypto refuses to “play by the rules” no longer hold up. When a major blockchain firm is actively seeking, and securing, direct OCC oversight, the narrative collapses. Resistance to innovation now looks less like risk management and more like anti-competitive protectionism, especially when consumers stand to gain faster, cheaper, and more inclusive financial services. If finalized, the Ripple National Trust Bank charter could mark a watershed moment, not just for Ripple and RLUSD, but for regulated stablecoins in the United States. It sets a powerful precedent: the next era of finance will be driven by trust, compliance, and innovation, not fear or obstruction. Conclusion With conditional OCC approval for its national trust bank, Ripple is setting a new standard for responsible crypto in the U.S. By placing RLUSD under federal and state oversight, it demonstrates that stablecoins can achieve the highest levels of transparency, consumer protection, and trust. This milestone challenges the narrative that crypto operates outside the rules, showing that blockchain-based finance can thrive fully within them.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-13 13:25:56

Major banking associations have launched a fierce protest against the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s decision to grant national trust bank charters to cryptocurrency companies. This move toward OCC crypto charters represents a bold experiment in regulatory integration—one that banking groups claim could fundamentally weaken our financial system’s foundations. Why Are Banking Groups So Concerned About OCC Crypto Charters? The coalition of banking associations presents a clear argument: these special charters create a dangerous hybrid. Companies receiving OCC crypto charters gain bank-like status without the traditional safeguards. Most importantly, they operate without FDIC deposit insurance—the bedrock of consumer confidence in traditional banking. This creates what experts call “regulatory arbitrage,” where firms might choose the path of least resistance rather than the most protective framework. Consider what this means for consumers. When someone sees “national trust bank” in a company’s title, they naturally assume certain protections exist. Without FDIC insurance and with different capital requirements, those assumptions could prove dangerously wrong. The banking groups argue this confusion isn’t just theoretical—it’s an inevitable consequence of creating two classes of “banks” with fundamentally different rules. Which Companies Received These Controversial Charters? The OCC granted conditional approval to five notable companies on December 12, including: Ripple – Known for XRP and cross-border payments Fidelity – A financial services giant expanding into digital assets Paxos – A blockchain infrastructure platform BitGo – A leading digital asset custody service The agency maintains these firms underwent the same rigorous review process as traditional banks. However, banking associations counter that the review standards themselves may be inadequate for crypto companies’ unique risks. The heart of their concern? These OCC crypto charters might create systemic vulnerabilities that only become apparent during market stress. What Does Regulatory Arbitrage Mean for Financial Stability? Regulatory arbitrage occurs when companies exploit differences between regulatory regimes. In this case, cryptocurrency firms might pursue OCC crypto charters specifically to avoid stricter state-level regulations or more demanding traditional banking requirements. This creates several potential problems: Uneven playing field – Traditional banks face heavier compliance burdens Risk concentration – Similar vulnerabilities might emerge across chartered crypto firms Consumer confusion – Different protections for similarly-labeled institutions Systemic risk – Interconnected failures could spread through the financial system The banking groups’ warning carries particular weight because they’ve witnessed how small regulatory gaps can create massive problems. Their experience with the 2008 financial crisis makes them especially sensitive to anything that might weaken the system’s overall resilience. How Might This Battle Shape Crypto’s Future in America? This conflict represents more than just bureaucratic disagreement—it’s a fundamental debate about how to integrate innovative technologies into established systems. The OCC crypto charters approach represents one vision: gradual integration through existing frameworks. The banking groups advocate for a different path: either full equivalence with traditional banks or distinct regulatory categories that don’t borrow banking terminology. The outcome will influence everything from consumer protection to America’s competitive position in global finance. If the OCC prevails, we might see more cryptocurrency firms pursuing these charters as a path to legitimacy. If banking groups succeed in their opposition, cryptocurrency integration might follow a slower, more cautious trajectory with entirely new regulatory categories. The Bottom Line: Balancing Innovation and Protection This controversy highlights the eternal tension in financial regulation: how to foster innovation while maintaining stability. The OCC crypto charters represent an attempt to bridge two worlds, but banking groups warn the bridge might not be strong enough to bear the weight. Their concerns about consumer confusion, regulatory arbitrage, and systemic risk deserve serious consideration as we shape the future of finance. Ultimately, the path forward requires acknowledging both realities: cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly integrated into our financial system, but integration must not come at the cost of weakening the protections that make that system trustworthy. The debate over OCC crypto charters will likely continue as regulators, traditional institutions, and crypto companies negotiate this new landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What are OCC crypto charters? OCC crypto charters are special national trust bank charters granted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to cryptocurrency companies. They provide bank-like status but without requiring FDIC deposit insurance. Why do banking groups oppose these charters? Banking groups argue these charters create an uneven playing field, allow regulatory arbitrage, and could confuse consumers who expect traditional banking protections when they see “bank” in an institution’s description. Which companies received OCC crypto charters? Five companies received conditional approval: Ripple, Fidelity, Paxos, BitGo, and one additional firm. These companies underwent what the OCC describes as the same rigorous review process as traditional banks. What is regulatory arbitrage? Regulatory arbitrage occurs when companies take advantage of differences between regulatory regimes. In this context, it means crypto firms might choose OCC charters specifically to avoid stricter state regulations or traditional banking requirements. Are consumer funds protected under these charters? Unlike traditional banks with FDIC insurance, consumer funds held with OCC-chartered crypto firms don’t have the same federal deposit insurance protection, which is a primary concern raised by banking groups. What happens next in this regulatory battle? The debate will likely continue through regulatory comments, potential legal challenges, and congressional attention. The outcome will significantly influence how cryptocurrency integrates into the broader US financial system. Found this analysis helpful?

According to reports, the Agnelli family, which controls Juventus, has stated that it does not intend to sell its majority stake in the club. Tether announced on Friday evening that they had tabled a “binding all-cash proposal” to purchase Exor’s shares in the club. Exor is the holding company owned and controlled by the Agnelli family, who have owned Juventus since 1923. However, the Agnelli family has sternly rejected the proposal, stating that it is not willing to reduce its ownership to Tether or any other party, as the asset is not for sale. Tether sets a proposal to acquire Exor’s holdings Tether’s proposal is aimed at acquiring Exor’s holding, which accounts for about 65.4% of Juventus’ outstanding shares. Subject to regulatory approvals and acceptance by the seller, Tether stated that it would launch a public tender offer for the remaining shares at the same price. JUST IN: Tether has submitted an all-cash offer to acquire Juventus by buying Exor’s controlling stake. pic.twitter.com/PmjjtiL1c6 — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) December 13, 2025 The offer is priced at €2.66 per share, valuing 100% of the company at approximately €1.1 billion. This is a massive sum, which would have marked one of the most sensational deals in recent European football history. Additionally, Tether stated that, if the acquisition were to proceed, it would provide Juventus with approximately an additional €1 billion to strengthen the first team and support the club’s overall development. “ Tether is in a position of strong financial health and intends to support Juventus with stable capital and a long horizon,” CEO Paolo Ardoino said Tether has pushed aggressively into new sectors over the past year. It has invested in artificial intelligence, robotics and health-tech ventures. However, its move into football has been gradual. So far, Tether has acquired an 11.5% stake in Juventus, making it the club’s second-largest shareholder. Both Tether and the Agnelli family’s investment company have shown commitment to the club. In November, they participated in a €97.8 million capital increase aimed at reducing debt and supporting the club’s strategic plan. Tether has gained influence inside the club. In October, the crypto giant nominated Deputy Investment Chief Zachary Lyons and Francesco Garino to Juventus’s board, and shareholders approved Garino’s appointment last month. Meanwhile, Juventus is valued at roughly €944 million ($1.1 billion). It saw its share price rise 2.3% after Tether’s interest to €2.23 ($2.62). Tether surges 50% amidst scrutiny over money laundering Analysts say that Tether will make almost $15 billion this year. Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise, has said that Tether might become the most profitable corporation in the world, possibly even more so than Saudi Aramco. It’s the world’s third-largest digital asset with a market cap of $183.8 billion, up 50% compared to this time last year. Tether maintains strong cash reserves. However, recent reports suggest that the company may seek $20 billion in new capital for a 3% stake in ownership. The firm has simultaneously expanded its precious metals holdings, with its gold reserves now exceeding $12 billion. Meanwhile, Tether remains under scrutiny over its role in the global crypto system. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists said that investigations have linked a lot of USDT transactions to wallets that US authorities later found to be tied to money laundering.

Hilton cited the Federal Reserve’s recent 25-point rate cut, one projected 2026 cut, and the $40 billion monthly T-bill purchase. He highlighted how quickly market sentiment can shift in response to policy. Critical XRP Discussion pic.twitter.com/RYm5oYdzbW — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) December 11, 2025 Hilton’s View on Federal Reserve Actions The Fed announced another 25-point rate cut on Wednesday, following a similar move in September . The $40 billion purchase plan has also drawn significant interest. Hilton said the plan serves as a liquidity injection and marks the early stages of quantitative easing. He highlighted how many observers celebrated the move at first. However, critics quickly induced fear by claiming the banking system might be fragile. He emphasized that these competing voices remain normal parts of the financial environment. He urged viewers to recognize that such reactions occur regularly and should not dictate long-term decisions . Long Term XRP Focus Hilton then moved directly to his investment stance. He stated his position clearly. He buys XRP at current levels because he considers them “ basement levels .” XRP also briefly dipped below $2, and he revealed plans to accumulate more tokens. He argued that future market growth could make today’s prices look attractive. He projected a period when Bitcoin might reach $150,000 to $200,000, and the crypto market could hit $10 trillion to $15 trillion. At those levels, XRP might trade between $15 and $20 .

Bret Johnsen, SpaceX’s CFO, described a secondary share sale that lets the company and eligible shareholders sell up to $2.56 billion at $421 a share. The road to this $800 billion is tied to the explosion of Starlink, the direct-to-mobile roadmap, and new steps taken in the Starship program for moon and Mars missions. The valuation would equal 62.5 times sales, putting SpaceX in a bracket where only Palantir sits at about 70 times. On Friday, Elon asked his fans on X that:- “Wouldn’t it be amazing if anyone who wanted to experience the wonder of space, the Moon or Mars could do so?” The man wants orbital AI data centers, Starship runs that bring people to Mars, and factories operating on the moon. These ideas sit under a single theme, owning a huge piece of the future space economy built on AI systems, robotic labor, and travel networks outside Earth. And our boy depends on charm, credibility, and his ability to make investors believe that this is the only company capable of building that world. Pushing investors with vision and hard numbers The strategy mirrors what happened at Tesla, where Elon attracted retail investors long before institutions ever took him seriously. SpaceX is seeing the same pattern now. A group of analysts and fund managers argues that the mix of fast Starlink growth and the long-term roadmap could move SpaceX into the same class as Nvidia and Microsoft. Jeremy Abelson, founder of Irving Investors and an investor in SpaceX, said the company is “an N of 1” and that its IPO would “likely have the biggest retail bid of all time,” adding that the valuation “does not need to make sense when it comes public.” Morgan Stanley estimated in October that Starlink could exceed one billion subscribers by 2040, covering nearly three-quarters of SpaceX’s projected $122 billion in sales. Starlink already produces most of the company’s revenue, and Elon has plans to get into mobile service soon too, specifically through a partnership with T-Mobile, meant to connect remote users through satellite signals. Analysts led by Adam Jonas said Starlink will lift its direct-to-mobile capacity by more than 100 times, helped by a spectrum agreement with EchoStar , which enables full 5G connectivity. Not everyone agrees the EchoStar spectrum is enough though. See, Michael Rollins of Citigroup said the amount purchased would not support a disruptive mobile network. Morgan Stanley argued that cross-selling to carriers could still bring high returns without competing with them head-on. And Ali Javaheri of PitchBook said Starlink could “theoretically beam into every cell phone on planet Earth,” describing an “almost unlimited total addressable market.” The author of this article is also a bit concerned about SpaceX’s control of the launch business. The company flies missions for NASA and the US Department of Defense, and even AST SpaceMobile, a competitor to Starlink, uses Falcon 9 rockets to move its satellites into orbit. Weighing the market hunger, the froth, and the Elon effect Analyst George Ferguson pointed out that the timing for an IPO is “as good as it gets,” considering SpaceX’s strength in low-Earth-orbit internet and launch operations, though he warned that the market is frothy. He also said firms like Blue Origin , backed by Jeff Bezos, could close the competitive gap in the next few years. George explained that waiting too long could reduce how unique investors believe SpaceX is: “The more you sit on it, the more other companies can build, have success launching into space, and the less people will value you as if you’re a one of a kind company.” Evelyn Chow of Neuberger Berman said low sensitivity to valuation gives SpaceX space to operate as a public company. But building orbital data centers requires large capital, complex hardware, and answers for radiation, maintenance, and energy needs in orbit. Aviation analyst Rob Stallard called the IPO plan a “sure sign that the equity market is frothy.” With expected $15 billion in sales this year, an $800 billion valuation equals 80 times revenue. Even the $800 billion figure being set in the share sale would place SpaceX ahead of the combined value of the six biggest U.S. defense firms and put it just behind 12 companies in the S&P 500, Morgan Stanley said. Javaheri described the trust investors place in him as the “Elon premium,” tied to his record of building companies through nothing but charm.

Apollo took short positions on loans from software providers, including Internet Brands, SonicWall, and Perforce, because it feared that those institutions’ traditional business models might face earnings pressures as AI platforms automate functions once sold as high-margin software services. However, the bets, which represented a fraction of its $700 billion credit portfolio and were maintained for much of the year, have now been closed. Apollo warns that AI could harm the enterprise software industry Apollo claims that AI poses risks to enterprise software , the largest target for private capital over the past decade. Other private lenders have also argued similarly, stating that software stands out as one of the most exposed sectors to AI, as the technology can automate many functions currently handled by coding tools, customer support software, and routine financial systems. Nonetheless, Apollo’s short bets were just a small slice of its $700 billion credit book—less than 1%—according to a person familiar with the matter, with some of the funds used as hedges. However, the software loans that Apollo bet against fell in value at times this year, but they’re all now trading above 80 cents on the dollar, halting concerns about near-term trouble. Though since the early 2010s, buyout specialists have borrowed hundreds of billions to acquire software firms, as lenders increasingly value recurring revenue and strong margins. Apollo still recognises that AI could benefit software companies, but its top executives have decided to cut exposure, preferring not to take directional industry positions. Marc Rowan, at a recent conference, even commented, “I don’t know whether that’s going to be enterprise software, which could benefit or be destroyed by this. As a lender, I’m not sure I want to be there to find out.” Apollo is working to push software exposure across its credit portfolios below 10%. Apollo has steadily reduced its exposure by lending to the sector throughout the year. At the start of 2025, roughly a fifth of Apollo’s private credit funds were tied to software groups, but that exposure has now been almost halved, Rowan said in closed-door investor meetings at a Goldman Sachs conference on Wednesday, a source in attendance said. According to Rowan, the firm aims for software exposure across its credit funds to fall below 10% of net assets. It has been internally assessing which companies may be most vulnerable to AI disruption, and many other investors share similar concerns. At an FT conference in October, Blackstone’s president, Jonathan Gray, warned that investors were underestimating the potential for disruption from technology, stating that he has challenged dealmakers to prominently quantify AI risks in their investment memos and identify specific companies as particularly vulnerable. Gray commented, “We’ve told our credit and equity teams: address AI on the first pages of your investment memos.

These events often foreshadow broader market action, especially when sophisticated participants employ high leverage. Recently, a notable leveraged position in XRP has drawn attention , prompting discussion across on‑chain analytics communities and social platforms. On-chain analyst Xaif says a big wallet, 0x8aae, just went 20x long on XRP via Hyperliquid – that’s a huge bet. The leveraged entry was placed at about $2.0191, with a notional position size of roughly $1.4 million. This move suggests a confident directional bet by a whale‑class trader. Such positioning signals that some smart money may be anticipating significant upside for XRP ahead of broader market recognition. WHALE ALERT A Hyperliquid whale (0x8aae) just went LONG on $XRP with 20x leverage • Entry: $2.0191 • Position size: $1.40M Smart money is positioning early. Are they seeing what’s coming? pic.twitter.com/dq2Jv1mJC1 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 13, 2025 Hyperliquid and Its Leverage Dynamics Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform that supports high‑leverage exposure on crypto assets like XRP. The venue uses smart contracts and a hybrid on‑chain/off‑chain matching engine to process trades quickly and with tight spreads, rivaling centralized exchanges. Traders can access leverage up to 50x, though available multipliers can vary by asset and liquidity conditions. High leverage amplifies both risk and potential reward. A 20x position means that even modest price movements can create outsized gains or losses. This capacity for rapid profit or loss attracts institutional and whale traders looking to maximize efficient use of capital. However, it also raises the specter of forced liquidations if the market moves against the position. Whale Behavior: Contrasting Trends in XRP This big bet on price rise is different from what other big investors have been doing lately. Multiple large traders have been trading XRP with varied positions. Some large wallets have recently placed substantial short positions at 20x leverage, betting on downward moves in the token. In earlier periods, other whale trades, including leveraged XRP shorts, have dramatically impacted market price action and triggered liquidations when the price spiked. Such mixed whale behavior reflects broader uncertainty and strong conviction on both sides of the market. While some analysts interpret large leveraged shorts as indicative of bearish pressure, the entry of a big leveraged long suggests that at least some sophisticated traders see potential catalyst events or technical strength emerging for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context and Structural Signals Beyond isolated whale trades, on‑chain data recently show changing trader flows. According to market research, investors are stockpiling XRP while bets on Bitcoin and Ethereum are actually decreasing. This suggests some rotating preference toward assets with clearer utility narratives. At the same time, broader derivatives markets have experienced volatility, with elevated liquidation events across platforms like Hyperliquid. Recent crypto market liquidations have included large positions as prices moved sharply, reflecting the high‑risk nature of leveraged trading. Risks and Implications While the leveraged long may signal bullish intent by a whale, traders should remain cautious. High leverage on any derivatives exchange carries the risk of rapid liquidation during sudden price swings. Decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid also come with their own set of risks, like smart contract vulnerabilities, changing liquidity, and reliance on oracle data feeds. Moreover, whale moves—whether long or short—do not guarantee future price direction. They reflect the views of individual traders and can themselves exacerbate volatility as funding rates and liquidations respond. In conclusion, the decision by wallet 0x8aae to establish a 20x leveraged long on XRP at about $2.02 is noteworthy. It exemplifies how large traders leverage the advanced features of decentralized derivatives venues like Hyperliquid to express conviction. While other whale trades show mixed sentiment, this long suggests some smart money is positioning for a potential bullish phase in XRP. Observers and other market participants should monitor how price action unfolds and whether similar positioning emerges across whale cohorts.

Perhaps many of the token’s investors are curious whether a significant rally or a major pullback is on the way, so we asked four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots to gauge the most likely price on Christmas. ‘No Miracle, No Collapse’ As of this writing, ADA trades at around $0.42 (per CoinGecko’s data), and ChatGPT thinks the price may increase to almost $1 by December 25. It sees this as “the most realistic expectation” given that Cardano remains “a long-term, fundamentals-driven project.” At the same time, it assumed that ADA could stop at roughly $0.70 on Christmas should the broader crypto market not show muscles. “No miracle, no collapse – just a steady, sentiment-driven holiday rally,” ChatGPT concluded. Google’s Gemini also claimed that the $1 mark seems reasonable for Christmas. It went even further, predicting that the price could soar above $1.50 and even $2 if a spot ADA ETF sees the light of day in the United States or if Cardano announces a major partnership with a renowned corporation. Grok, the chatbot integrated into the social media platform X, stated that forecasting the price of a cryptocurrency is “inherently speculative” and noted the volatility of the digital asset sector. Still, it highlighted the recent rate cuts announced by the Federal Reserve as a bullish factor that could pump up ADA and other leading altcoins. It also reminded that December has been kind to the asset in some previous years, predicting that its valuation could climb to $0.55 on Christmas. How About More Modest Gains? Perplexity also sees a chance of an increase, albeit not as substantial as the targets set by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok. It suggested that ADA’s Christmas price may reach $0.48 and will heavily depend on bullish news surrounding Cardano’s ecosystem. “$0.48 aligns closely with detailed December 2025 forecasts from technical models, representing the month’s maximum and average price targets and current bearish trends,” the chatbot stated.

OKX is accusing coordinated groups of manipulating the OM token’s price, and MANTRA’s chief executive officer (CEO) is demanding transparency about tokens held by the exchange. The conflict centers on preparations to migrate OM tokens to MANTRA’s new blockchain. But it has reopened wounds from April, when the OM token crashed more than 90% in hours, wiping out over $5 billion in market capitalization. Why did MANTRA’s CEO call out OKX? John Patrick “JP” Mullin, MANTRA’s founder and CEO, posted an open letter on X , addressing OKX’s concerns about the migration timeline. The letter confirmed that the ERC-20 OM token would be deprecated on January 15, 2026, followed shortly by a chain upgrade and 1:4 token split handled at the protocol level, requiring no user interaction. But Mullin made a pointed request, asking OKX to disclose how many OM tokens belong to users versus how many sit on OKX’s own balance sheet. “As part of our commitment to regulatory compliance, it is our longstanding policy to verify the background of any significant movements of OM tokens,” Mullin wrote, later adding, “For this reason, we reiterate our request for OKX to confirm (i) the number of OKX users’ $OM tokens to be migrated and (ii) the number of $OM tokens held by OKX on OKX’s balance sheet.” On December 8, he characterized OKX’s post on the OM migration as misinformation, containing “factual errors” adding that “OKX’s unilateral creation of specific dates without consultation with MANTRA has caused unnecessary market confusion.” The following day, the CEO, who has been calling for all OM holders to migrate their tokens to MANTRA, against their own set deadline, mentioned that OKX just responded to them recently for the first time since the April crash. Exchange hits back with manipulation claims OKX responded , stating that it was clarifying “the facts, since MANTRA team continues to push a misleading narrative.” It added that it had “identified evidence that multiple connected and colluding accounts used large quantities of OM as collateral to borrow significant amounts of USDT, artificially pushing OM’s price up.” The exchange said its risk team flagged the abnormal activity and requested corrective action, but the account holders refused to cooperate. “To contain the risk, control of these related accounts was taken,” OKX said in its statement. “Shortly afterwards, the OM price crashed. OKX liquidated only a very small portion of OM, yet the sharp price collapse resulted in substantial losses that were fully absorbed by the OKX Security Fund.” The exchange said it has submitted full evidence and documentation to regulators and law enforcement agencies, and that multiple litigations are underway. OKX questioned where the unusually large quantities of OM originated and why certain groups controlled such a substantial portion of the token supply. Observers continue to speculate on April’s event Taran Sabharwal, CEO of crypto trading firm STIX, offered his analysis of the mechanics behind April’s crash. He speculated that accounts borrowed USDT against OM collateral through spot margin trading. Supposedly, the accounts went on to use those funds to purchase more OM, which inadvertently drove the price higher. When the price fell below liquidation levels, automatic selling by OKX triggered a cascading effect across multiple exchanges. The STIX CEO also wrote, “My guess, as a complete outsider, is that JP may be suing OKX to unfreeze the accounts and return the remaining tokens back to him.” Mullin responded to the speculation post, clarifying his company’s current position with OKX. He stated, “I want to make it VERY clear. Neither MANTRA or myself have ANY ongoing litigation or legal actions ongoing with OKX. This is between them and other larger traders/investors of OM.” He mentioned that the situation had not been in the public domain until OKX totally misunderstood the migration timeline to MANTRA’s mainnet and put out incorrect information that he had to correct.

55735128,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=245243,1765637710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical Alert: BOJ Interest Rates May Trigger Bitcoin’s Next Major Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/boj-interest-rates-bitcoin-impact/,"BitcoinWorld Critical Alert: BOJ Interest Rates May Trigger Bitcoin’s Next Major Move Cryptocurrency traders are on high alert as the Bank of Japan prepares for a historic decision that could send shockwaves through global markets. With the BOJ expected to raise interest rates to their highest level in three decades, Bitcoin investors face a crucial test. This potential shift in Japanese monetary policy represents one of the most significant macroeconomic events facing digital assets this year. Why Are BOJ Interest Rates So Important for Bitcoin? The Bank of Japan’s monetary policy decisions create ripple effects far beyond Japanese borders. When the BOJ adjusts interest rates, it directly impacts global liquidity conditions and currency markets. For Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, these changes can alter investor behavior dramatically. The connection between BOJ interest rates and Bitcoin prices stems from how institutional investors allocate capital across different asset classes. Market analysts point to December 19th as the critical date when the BOJ might increase its key rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%. This move would mark the highest level for Japanese interest rates since the early 1990s. Such a significant shift after decades of ultra-low rates could fundamentally change how global investors approach risk assets like Bitcoin. How Could Rising BOJ Interest Rates Pressure Bitcoin? The primary mechanism through which BOJ interest rates affect Bitcoin involves the yen carry trade. For years, investors have borrowed cheap yen to invest in higher-yielding assets worldwide, including cryptocurrencies. However, rising BOJ interest rates could unwind this trade in several ways: Tighter global liquidity as Japanese capital flows back home Stronger yen value reducing the appeal of dollar-denominated assets Reduced risk appetite among institutional investors Increased borrowing costs for leveraged crypto positions Historical data supports these concerns. When the BOJ raised rates in July 2024, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline from approximately $65,000 to $50,000. This precedent suggests that BOJ interest rate decisions can indeed create substantial volatility in cryptocurrency markets. Is This Time Different for Bitcoin Markets? Some analysts argue that the impact of the upcoming BOJ decision might be more limited than previous rate hikes. Several factors could cushion Bitcoin from the full force of rising BOJ interest rates: First, market participants have had months to anticipate this move. Japanese government bond yields have already priced in the expected hike, reducing the element of surprise. Second, many investors have already accumulated long positions in the yen, meaning the currency’s appreciation might be less dramatic than in previous cycles. Additionally, the global context matters. The U.S. Federal Reserve appears poised to begin cutting rates in 2025, creating a unique divergence between Japanese and American monetary policy. This divergence could limit the negative impact of rising BOJ interest rates on Bitcoin, as cheaper dollar financing might offset more expensive yen borrowing. What Should Bitcoin Investors Watch Closely? Successful navigation of this potential BOJ interest rates storm requires careful attention to specific indicators. Bitcoin traders should monitor these key signals in the coming weeks: Yen exchange rates against major currencies Japanese government bond yields and their spread with U.S. Treasuries Global liquidity measures and capital flow data Bitcoin exchange reserves to gauge selling pressure The actual BOJ statement language will be crucial. Beyond the rate decision itself, guidance about future policy moves will determine whether this represents a one-time adjustment or the beginning of a sustained tightening cycle. Bitcoin’s reaction will likely depend more on forward guidance than the immediate rate change. Strategic Takeaways for Crypto Portfolio Management Given the potential impact of BOJ interest rates on Bitcoin, prudent investors should consider several strategic adjustments. First, maintaining appropriate position sizing becomes essential when facing known macroeconomic events. Second, diversifying across cryptocurrency sectors with different sensitivity to interest rates can provide protection. Finally, understanding that central bank policies create both risks and opportunities is crucial. While rising BOJ interest rates might pressure Bitcoin in the short term, they could also create attractive entry points for long-term investors. The key is distinguishing between temporary volatility driven by macroeconomic factors and fundamental changes in Bitcoin’s value proposition. The intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency has never been more apparent. As the BOJ prepares to make its historic decision, Bitcoin faces a test that will demonstrate its maturity as an asset class. Whether digital assets can withstand tightening monetary policy from one of the world’s major central banks will reveal much about their long-term resilience. Frequently Asked Questions What are BOJ interest rates? The Bank of Japan interest rates refer to the policy rate set by Japan’s central bank to control monetary conditions. These rates influence borrowing costs, currency values, and investment flows throughout the global economy. How do BOJ interest rates affect Bitcoin? BOJ interest rates affect Bitcoin primarily through the yen carry trade. When Japanese rates rise, investors may unwind positions in risk assets like Bitcoin to repay yen-denominated loans, potentially creating selling pressure. When will the BOJ make its interest rate decision? The Bank of Japan is expected to announce its interest rate decision on December 19, 2024. This meeting could result in the highest Japanese interest rates in approximately 30 years. Could Bitcoin prices rise despite higher BOJ interest rates? Yes, Bitcoin prices could still rise if other positive factors outweigh the impact of higher BOJ interest rates. These might include increased institutional adoption, favorable regulatory developments, or stronger-than-expected demand from other regions. What happened to Bitcoin after the last BOJ rate hike? After the BOJ raised rates in July 2024, Bitcoin declined from around $65,000 to $50,000. However, market conditions were different then, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Should I sell my Bitcoin before the BOJ decision? Investment decisions should align with your individual strategy, risk tolerance, and time horizon. While some traders might reduce exposure before known events, others might see potential volatility as an opportunity. Found this analysis of BOJ interest rates and Bitcoin valuable?

Husky Inu (HINU) Reaches $0.00023568 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00023567 to $0.00023658. ​The regular price increases are part of Husky Inu's pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. These increases help the project continue fundraising, empower its community, and reward token holders. The pre-launch phase’s primary goal is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake marketing initiatives, and support broader ecosystem growth. The project has raised $905,549 so far, but fundraising remains sluggish. Despite the market recovery, investors remain wary and have adopted a wait-and-watch approach. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. Crypto Market Retreats Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market slipped back into the red after trading in positive territory on Friday. The decline was attributed to AI stocks coming under pressure, dragging the equity and crypto markets lower. Bitcoin (BTC), which traded above $92,000 on Friday, briefly fell below $90,000 before recovering and moving to its current level of $90,482. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) registered a substantially larger decline, falling to a low of $3,056 before moving to its current level of $3,111. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down almost 4% over the past 24 hours. However, Ripple (XRP) is marginally up, trading around $2.03. Solana (SOL) is down over 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $133, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 1.30% at $0.138. Cardano (ADA) is down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, while Chainlink (LINK) is marginally down, trading around $13.92. Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines over the past 24 hours. As a result, the crypto market cap is down over 2% at $3.07 trillion, while the 24-hour trading volume is up 11% at $142 billion.

While ETH is being monitored for a break above a resistance point, other projects are also being highlighted as part of current news in the world of cryptocurrencies. In this list, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been highlighted as a new crypto that has been receiving strong attention. This has been highlighted in relation to a discussion on which cryptos to invest in 2025. Ethereum Nears Technical Turning Point Ethereum has been fluctuating around $3,103 as it has moved back to the bottom of its declining channel. This has been a support area for Ethereum a couple of times, and is above the 9-day moving average. Analysts are waiting to see if Ethereum can manage to stay long enough to test the $3,300-$3,400 area, which has been a key resistance area. There has been a bit of a momentum increase for the pair ETH/BTC, as it has managed to move above the shorter-term moving averages, which indicates a potential reversal in market outlook. Nevertheless, Ethereum also has a prominent bearish setup, in which all forthcoming market movements will depend upon how it performs around its midway point of resistance in this channel. If support in the market remains at $3,000, this pair also has the potential to move up to $3,700 for this month. A bearish move would lead to a return to support values that were highlighted in an earlier analysis. Mutuum Finance Evaluation There has been steady progression for Mutuum Finance, referred to as MUTM, during its presale. The presale has reached Phase 6 with a price of $0.035, setting a 250% increase from the initial value of $0.01. Phase 6 is 98% full, as many are closely watching the new crypto’s structured pricing model before proceeding to Phase 7, where it will be valued at $0.04. According to official project data, a total of $19,330,000 has been raised since the presale began, with a total number of holder accounts of 18,450. This project data has put MUTM in a debate of which crypto to invest in. MUTM has rolled out an interactive dashboard where there is a list of the top 50 holders. There has also been a development that has brought a new 24-hour leaderboard, which resets every 00:00 UTC. This has brought a 500-dollar MUTM prize for the top buyer daily. In this project, it has been announced that their V1 protocol has been scheduled to launch in the Sepolia testnet in Q4 of 2025. This version of their protocol will be accompanied by a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, as well as a liquidator bot. The initial assets that will be used for loans as well as for collateral purposes will be ETH and USDT. An independent audit of their project’s smart-contract architecture has also been initiated by Halborn Security. To this end, investors are taking notice of MUTM for reasons including their presale model, as well as an upcoming testnet launch, among other factors, that has seen it among the top cryptos being developed. The current period of consolidation for Ethereum offers MUTM a chance to shine with their rapidly rising presale. Invest in MUTM presale now when it’s in Phase 6.

However, recent on-chain data reveals a concerning trend around BTC’s bullish structure. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Reaction To Fed Policy Turns Bearish After Each FOMC Update Bitcoin IFP Indicator Suggests Market Has Reached Turning Point Popular analytics page Arab Chain has shared a cautionary insight on the Bitcoin market despite the moderate price recovery in recent weeks. After Bitcoin suffered a 36.5% correction from its all-time high at $126,000, the market leader has lately experienced a significant rebound, rising from $80,000 to as high as $94,000 in the past three weeks. However, data from the Bitcoin Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) suggests the upward price momentum might be short-lived. For perspective, the Bitcoin IFP measures the net movement of Bitcoin between exchanges over a given period. Arab Chain explains the IFP indicator continues to trend downward, after breaking below its 90-day moving average (MA), suggesting a weakening market participation amid fewer “bullish” flows between exchanges. Furthermore, the IFP also sits in the red zone, which historically coincides with or precedes a correction period or weak structural momentum that could precede a broader downtrend. Combined, these developments imply the Bitcoin market is at a critical junction, as there is a reduction in exchange flows that has historically supported the price rallies in past market phases.

Amidst the structural weakness highlighted by the IFP indicator, Arab Chain also noted that the price remains relatively high compared to previous levels in similar situations. The analysts explain that this suggests price and inflows are temporarily moving irrespective of each other. Based on historical data, such detachments usually indicate a prolonged price consolidation or a significant period of extended sideways movement until inter-exchange flows can reestablish market dominance. Therefore, the Bitcoin bullish structure is not collapsing into a bearish state. However, the IFP metric developments suggest there may not be sustained upward movement in the short term due to the structural slowdown in inter-exchange flows. Moreover, price is likely to become sensitive to changes in the market liquidity. Therefore, there is also significant potential for another correction. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $90,338, reflecting a 1.82% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is up by 34.64% and valued at $82.68 billion. According to Arab Chain, a continuous price rebound will only occur if the IFP successfully reclaims its 90-day MA, thereby signaling an increase in bullish exchange flows.

Crypto pundit Stern Drew highlighted what this means for the crypto firm and also XRP, which it uses for its payment services. What The OCC Approval Means For Ripple And XRP In an X post , Stern Drew stated that Ripple just broke the system following the OCC’s grant of a conditional approval to the crypto firm. He further noted that Ripple now has federal and regulatory oversight locked in with this approval. The pundit added that the RLUSD stablecoin has become the gold standard for compliant stablecoins, while XRP has stepped straight into the heart of the U.S. financial system. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also reacted to the OCC’s grant of a conditional approval, stating that it was huge news. He remarked that this was a massive step forward, mainly for the RLUSD stablecoin, which is setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal and state oversight. In a press release , the firm also indicated how this development positions RLUSD and XRP by extension for greater adoption. The firm stated that as traditional finance firms continue to enter the crypto market, they will look to leverage stablecoins with the highest regulatory rigor and compliance, which offer the trust and reliability required for enterprise adoption. Meanwhile, the payment firm confirmed that its banking services will also extend the same regulatory rigor behind RLUSD into its broader payments and institutional service offerings, which utilize XRP. The firm further noted that utility is already driving adoption as its stablecoin has surpassed $1 billion in market cap in less than a year. The company added that the stablecoin is actively used in its payment solutions and as collateral by prime brokers, including its prime brokerage . An “XRP Wake Up Call” Crypto pundit BarriC described the OCC’s grant of a conditional approval to Ripple as an XRP wake-up call for those who may still be skeptical of the altcoin. He stated that for those who said that banks would never use XRP or partner with Ripple, the crypto firm has now also been granted a banking license . The pundit noted that this is significant as over half of Ripple’s transactions for its payment services go through XRP. The altcoin has also received a huge boost as Swiss bank AMINA bank has become the first European bank to integrate Ripple’s payment services. BarriC highlighted that the bank will ultimately use XRP through its integration with Ripple payments. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dark Defender indicated that Ripple’s status as a Trust bank could be one of the catalysts that lead to higher prices for XRP. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading $2.01, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|Altcoin|AMINA Bank|BarriC|Dark Defender|OCC|ripple|RLUSD|stablecoin|Stern Drew|The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|FIAT|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-13 15:00:35

Despite a narrative rooted in robust adoption, market pressure has ramped up. This article will explore the current climate and reveal which other coins may be poised for a surge. Sei on Rocky Road: Is a Comeback Possible? Source: tradingview Sei is trading between 12 to 14 cents, showing a mixed trend. Over the past week, its price is up by about 3%. Yet, the last month saw a drop of a quarter in its value. The coin is hovering close to its 10-day average but below the 100-day average. If bullish trends pick up, Sei could test the 15-cent resistance, reflecting a rise of around 9%. A further push might see it aim for 17.5 cents, marking more than a 25% gain. However, a dip to 10 cents seems possible if sentiment turns negative. The RSI suggests a balanced activity, but with a hint of optimism. Conclusion SEI is currently facing short-term pressure due to weakening sentiment in the altcoin market. Despite its strong adoption narrative, other coins like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Cardano are also affected. SEI continues to show promise for the future. However, the altcoin market's current state suggests a cautious approach in the near term. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Prepare Accordingly",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-the-moment-this-ends-everything-changes-prepare-accordingly/,"For weeks now, XRP’s price action has felt subdued and grinding. Traders watch sideways markets with frustration. Investors question if the recent stagnation masks a deeper shift in market structure. Yet, when historic accumulation phases conclude, they often usher in transformative trends that reshape both sentiment and price. In a recent X post, STEPH IS CRYPTO highlighted on‑chain and market data that underscore a profound accumulation dynamic unfolding in the XRP ecosystem. The details of his findings signal that the current quiet phase may not be mere listless trading but rather a critical buildup before a meaningful market pivot. Exchange Outflows and Liquidity Contraction One of the most striking developments in XRP’s market landscape is the dramatic decline in exchange‑held supply. According to recent on‑chain tracking, over 1 billion XRP has left centralized exchanges within the past three weeks , pushing supply down to historic lows relative to circulating volume. This exodus reflects a broader trend of withdrawals from trading venues into long‑term custody. When holders remove tokens from exchanges, it typically signifies intent to hold rather than trade. This $XRP accumulation feels painful now… but the moment it ends, everything changes. Prepare accordingly! pic.twitter.com/IXDxEULJgi — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 12, 2025 Reduced exchange inventories tighten liquidity, making prices more responsive to buying pressure when demand increases. This dynamic is widely seen as a classic accumulation indicator that can precede notable uptrends. Institutional Demand and ETF Inflows As XRP leaves exchanges, big investors are getting more interested. Spot XRP ETFs have recorded persistent inflows recently, with products adding over $1 billion in assets under management. These flows hint that institutions are allocating capital via regulated vehicles, distancing themselves from direct exchange exposure. Such demand helps absorb available supply, effectively reducing sell‑side pressure and supporting price stability even during sideways markets. This institutional participation may also act as a stabilizing anchor once volatility returns. Technical Structure and Range Compression Throughout the accumulation phase, XRP has traded in a narrow band, with price often oscillating between key support and resistance levels. This compression reflects indecision among short‑term traders but strategic positioning by long‑term holders. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The prolonged range suggests that the market is coiling, building energy for a potential breakout. Technical analysts often view such consolidation as preparatory structure rather than exhaustion. Price compression combined with declining exchange supply and increasing institutional inflows paints a picture of a market transitioning from speculative churn to strategic accumulation. Historical Patterns and Future Outlook Historical patterns in crypto markets show that extended periods of quiet accumulation frequently precede expansive moves. For example, prior cycles in altcoins exhibited similar dynamics before dramatic rallies. While no outcome is guaranteed, the confluence of low liquidity, strategic accumulation, and institutional demand strengthens the case for a potential shift in XRP’s trajectory. However, traders must also balance optimism with caution. Technical indicators, such as moving average crossovers highlighted by analysts, may signal profit‑taking or deeper corrections in certain scenarios. Thus, prudent risk management and clear planning are essential. Preparing for Change For XRP holders, the key takeaway is that current market discomfort may not signal weakness but structural groundwork. When accumulation phases conclude, volatility often returns with force. This renewed movement can redefine support levels, test liquidity, and trigger fresh directional trends. In essence, the current quiet is not the absence of action—it is the prelude to it. As the market digests shrinking supply and increasing institutional demand, the moment this phase ends could mark a pivotal shift. XRP holders should prepare accordingly, with clear strategies suited to both breakout and volatility scenarios.

The digital market witnesses a shuffle in layer-1 capital, turning heads towards other rising stars. What's driving this rotation and which cryptocurrencies are poised to leap ahead? This article delves into the dynamic changes and highlights potential growth leaders in the crypto space. Polkadot Battles Ups and Downs as It Eyes Higher Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Polkadot is currently trading between just under two to a little over two dollars. It struggles slightly below its 100-day moving average of just above two dollars. This signals that DOT is finding it tough to push upwards. The nearest price hurdle is at two dollars and fifty-eight cents. If it breaks through this level, it could aim for a second resistance point at three dollars. Achieving this would mean a substantial jump of more than thirty percent from its current range. However, with a slightly high RSI and a steep six-month decline of about forty-six percent, DOT's immediate future remains a watchful battle between bulls and bears. Conclusion DOT continues to experience a decline as funds shift towards other alternatives. Interest has grown in coins like Solana, Avalanche, Terra, and Fantom. Investors are exploring these options due to their unique features and potential for growth. DOT's performance is under pressure as attention and capital flow to these newer projects. This trend indicates a shift in focus within the market. Other coins are capitalizing on this by attracting more interest and investment.

New data reveals that SOL spot ETF products have notched seven consecutive trading days of net inflows, pushing cumulative investments toward the $700 million mark. This sustained demand signals growing confidence in Solana’s ecosystem, even as daily investment rhythms fluctuate. What’s Driving the SOL Spot ETF Buying Spree? This consistent inflow into SOL spot ETF products is a clear vote of confidence from institutional and accredited investors. Unlike periods of speculative frenzy, a multi-day buying streak suggests a more calculated, strategic accumulation of Solana exposure. Analysts point to several factors fueling this trend: Broadening Institutional Adoption: ETFs provide a familiar, regulated gateway for traditional finance players to access Solana. Ecosystem Growth: Continued development in DeFi, NFTs, and other sectors on Solana enhances its long-term value proposition. Portfolio Diversification: Investors are increasingly viewing major altcoins like SOL as essential components of a diversified crypto portfolio. Which SOL Spot ETF Funds Are Leading the Charge? While the overall trend is positive, capital distribution among the available SOL spot ETF products is highly concentrated. Bitwise’s BSOL fund has emerged as the dominant force, attracting a staggering $608.9 million in assets. This commanding lead highlights investor preference for specific fund structures and management teams. Grayscale’s GSOL follows, securing $97.8 million in inflows. This breakdown is crucial for understanding where the ‘smart money’ is placing its bets within the Solana investment vehicle landscape. What Does the $700M Milestone Mean for Solana? Approaching $700 million in cumulative SOL spot ETF inflows is more than just a impressive number. It represents a significant layer of stable, institutional capital now underpinning the Solana market. This capital is generally considered ‘stickier’ than retail investment, potentially reducing volatility and providing a stronger foundation for price support. However, it also ties Solana’s performance more closely to traditional market flows and regulatory sentiments surrounding ETFs. Therefore, while the current SOL spot ETF trend is a powerful bullish indicator, it introduces new dynamics. The market must now consider factors like ETF creation/redemption activity and the decisions of large, institutional holders alongside traditional on-chain metrics and ecosystem news. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Institutional Solana Investment The seven-day inflow streak pushing SOL spot ETF totals toward $700 million marks a pivotal moment. It validates Solana’s position in the top tier of crypto assets and demonstrates that institutional demand extends well beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This sustained investment provides not just capital, but also legitimacy, potentially paving the way for broader adoption and more innovative financial products built around the Solana blockchain. The journey toward mainstream crypto integration is accelerating, and Solana is firmly in the driver’s seat for this leg of the race. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a SOL spot ETF? A: A SOL spot ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Solana (SOL) tokens. It allows investors to gain exposure to SOL’s price movements through a traditional stock brokerage account without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency. Q: Why are the inflows into SOL spot ETFs significant? A: Consistent inflows indicate strong and sustained demand from institutional investors (like hedge funds, asset managers). This brings new capital, stability, and legitimacy to the Solana market, differentiating it from short-term retail-driven speculation. Q: Which SOL spot ETF has the most assets? A: Currently, Bitwise’s BSOL fund is the clear leader, with over $608 million in assets under management, far surpassing other available funds like Grayscale’s GSOL. Q: Do these ETF inflows directly increase the price of SOL? A: They can. To create shares of a spot ETF, the fund provider must purchase the underlying asset (SOL). This creates direct buying pressure on the open market, which can positively influence the price. Q: Are SOL spot ETFs available to all investors globally? A: No, availability depends on local regulations. Currently, these spot ETFs are primarily available in specific regions like Canada and are accessible to accredited investors in others, such as the United States. They are not yet available as fully registered, public securities in all major markets like a Bitcoin spot ETF might be. Q: What are the risks of investing through a SOL spot ETF? A> Risks include the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency, potential tracking error between the ETF price and SOL’s market price, management fees, and the regulatory risks associated with the fund itself, separate from the risks of holding SOL directly.

This conviction highlights the dangerous intersection of entertainment financing and high-risk digital asset investments that can lead to catastrophic financial and legal outcomes. What Exactly Happened with the Netflix Funds? Carl Erik Rinsch, known for directing the 2013 film ’47 Ronin,’ received $11 million from Netflix to produce a science fiction drama called ‘White Horse.’ However, instead of using the money for its intended purpose, Rinsch transferred the funds to his personal accounts. The director then engaged in what prosecutors called “cryptocurrency gambling” and other speculative investments. According to court documents, Rinsch’s cryptocurrency speculation included purchases of Dogecoin (DOGE) during the 2021 crypto market surge. While he reportedly made some profits from these investments initially, the overall pattern showed reckless financial behavior with someone else’s money. How Did the Money Get Misused Beyond Crypto? The misuse extended far beyond cryptocurrency speculation. Rinsch allegedly spent the Netflix production budget on: Five luxury Rolls-Royce vehicles A high-end Ferrari sports car Various luxury goods and designer items Legal fees for his divorce proceedings Risky stock options and securities trading This spending spree represents a clear violation of the production agreement with Netflix. The streaming giant provided the funds specifically for creating content, not for personal enrichment through cryptocurrency speculation or luxury purchases. What Were the Legal Consequences of This Cryptocurrency Speculation? The U.S. Department of Justice pursued the case aggressively, resulting in Rinsch’s conviction on seven criminal counts. These charges included: Wire fraud for transferring funds improperly Money laundering related to the cryptocurrency speculation activities Multiple counts of financial misconduct Sentencing is scheduled for April 2026, where Rinsch could face substantial prison time and financial penalties. This case serves as a cautionary tale about the legal boundaries surrounding production funds and cryptocurrency speculation. Why Does This Case Matter for the Entertainment Industry? This conviction sends shockwaves through Hollywood and streaming platforms. Production funds come with strict usage guidelines, and diverting them for cryptocurrency speculation represents both contractual breach and criminal activity. The case demonstrates that: Streaming platforms will pursue legal action against fund misuse Cryptocurrency speculation with company funds carries severe consequences The entertainment industry faces new financial oversight challenges Moreover, this incident may lead to stricter financial controls in entertainment contracts, particularly regarding cryptocurrency speculation and other high-risk investments. What Can We Learn About Responsible Cryptocurrency Investment? While cryptocurrency speculation offers potential rewards, this case highlights critical lessons for responsible investing: Never invest funds that aren’t yours – Using production or company money for personal cryptocurrency speculation is illegal Understand the risks – Cryptocurrency markets are volatile and unpredictable Maintain proper separation – Keep business and personal finances completely separate Follow contractual obligations – Funds provided for specific purposes must be used as intended The cryptocurrency speculation in this case wasn’t just poor judgment—it was criminal behavior with serious consequences. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale About Cryptocurrency Speculation Carl Rinsch’s conviction serves as a powerful warning about the dangers of mixing professional resources with personal cryptocurrency speculation. The $11 million Netflix fund misuse demonstrates how quickly ambition can turn into criminal activity when financial boundaries are crossed. As cryptocurrency continues to attract investors, this case reminds us that all investments must be made ethically and legally, using properly sourced funds. The entertainment industry—and all sectors—must implement stronger safeguards against such cryptocurrency speculation risks. Frequently Asked Questions What cryptocurrency did Carl Rinsch invest in with Netflix’s money? Court documents confirm Rinsch purchased Dogecoin (DOGE) as part of his cryptocurrency speculation activities. He reportedly made some profits during the 2021 crypto boom before the legal consequences caught up with him. How did authorities discover the fund misuse? The U.S. Department of Justice investigated after Netflix raised concerns about the production’s progress and fund usage. Financial tracing revealed transfers to personal accounts and cryptocurrency speculation platforms rather than legitimate production expenses. What happens to the “White Horse” project now? The Netflix sci-fi drama “White Horse” was never produced due to the fund diversion. The $11 million intended for production was largely spent on cryptocurrency speculation, luxury vehicles, and personal expenses instead. Could Rinsch have legally invested in cryptocurrency with these funds? Absolutely not. Production funds are contractually designated for specific purposes—in this case, creating content for Netflix. Any cryptocurrency speculation using these funds constitutes breach of contract and, as proven here, criminal activity. What sentence might Rinsch face in 2026? While sentencing won’t occur until April 2026, wire fraud and money laundering convictions typically carry substantial prison sentences, potentially years, along with significant financial restitution requirements. Has this affected how streaming platforms handle production funds? While specific policy changes haven’t been announced publicly, this high-profile case likely encourages platforms like Netflix to implement stricter financial oversight and more frequent auditing of production funds to prevent similar cryptocurrency speculation misuse.

Odds shift within seconds, markets suspend without warning, and even small delays in balance updates can affect execution. Stablecoins remove that variable, allowing bettors to focus on market behavior rather than currency fluctuations. By using assets like USDT or USDC on online crypto sports betting sites , live bettors gain predictable bankroll value, faster settlement, and clearer risk management during in-play markets. This makes stablecoins especially effective for high-frequency betting, cash-outs, and rapid re-entries during live events. Best Online Crypto Betting Sites 1.

It covers over 35 sports and offers deep in-play markets, especially for football, where hundreds of betting options are often available. Stablecoin deposits and fast settlement help maintain smooth execution during live action. Cash-out features, player props, and live streaming are integrated into a clean interface. KYC is only required at higher withdrawal levels, though bonus wagering requirements are relatively high. Best for: serious live bettors looking for deep markets and reliable in-play execution. 6. BetPanda — Anonymous Stablecoin Betting with Simple Live Markets BetPanda offers a privacy-first approach with instant crypto deposits and withdrawals, including stablecoins. Live betting is available across major sports, but market depth and advanced features are limited compared to larger sportsbooks. The platform avoids complex mechanics and focuses on fast, frictionless play. Sports promotions are modest, but anonymity and quick transactions remain its main appeal. Best for: users who prioritize anonymity and simplicity over advanced live betting tools. What Makes a Live Betting Site “High-Odds” In live betting, high odds are not just about headline prices. They reflect how efficiently a platform updates markets, manages exposure, and processes bets under pressure. Sites that consistently offer better in-play odds tend to share a few structural advantages rather than aggressive pricing tactics. Key elements that define a high-odds live betting platform include: Low in-play margins — tighter spreads on live markets, especially during high-liquidity events Fast odds refresh rates — minimal delay between real-time action and price updates Stable market availability — fewer unnecessary suspensions during momentum shifts Accurate cash-out pricing — realistic exit values rather than heavily discounted offers Quick settlement — immediate balance updates that allow rapid re-entry Stablecoin support strengthens all of these factors by removing currency volatility and settlement friction. Platforms that combine USDT or USDC betting with efficient live trading infrastructure are typically able to maintain sharper odds throughout a match, giving active bettors a measurable execution advantage. Conclusion Stablecoins have become a natural fit for live sports betting, not because they increase profits by default, but because they remove friction. When balances stay stable, settlements are fast, and pricing is predictable, bettors can focus on timing, odds movement, and execution rather than currency noise. The platforms that stand out in this space are not simply those that accept USDT or USDC, but those that pair stablecoin support with solid live betting infrastructure. Sites like Stake and Vave offer deep markets and tight in-play odds for high-volume bettors, while Thunderpick excels in esports-focused live action. Mega Dice and BetPanda appeal to users who value fast access and flexible crypto use, and Dexsport stands out for those seeking live betting with full anonymity and on-chain transparency. In the end, stablecoins are a tool — not a strategy. Used on the right platforms, they help bettors act faster, manage risk more precisely, and avoid hidden costs. Used on the wrong ones, they simply accelerate mistakes. In 2026, the edge belongs to bettors who combine stablecoin efficiency with disciplined live betting on platforms built to handle real-time pressure.",More News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|USDT|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-13 15:16:26

Understanding this need for constant clarity, Bitcoin World is making a strategic adjustment to enhance our service quality. We are announcing new Bitcoin World weekend service hours, designed to ensure you receive the most critical updates while our team recharges to deliver the insightful analysis you trust. What Are the New Bitcoin World Weekend Service Hours? To maintain our high standards of reporting, Bitcoin World will operate with limited coverage during specific weekend periods. Our full, real-time 24/7 news service will temporarily scale back. Here are the key details you need to know: Limited Coverage Period: This begins at 3:00 p.m. UTC every Saturday. Focus During This Time: Our team will focus exclusively on reporting major breaking news and significant market-moving events. Full Service Resumes: Our comprehensive 24/7 coverage will restart at 10:00 p.m. UTC every Sunday.

We believe this focused approach during the Bitcoin World weekend service window allows us to prioritize quality over quantity, ensuring you’re never left in the dark during crucial moments. Why Is Bitcoin World Adjusting Its Weekend Coverage? You might wonder why a crypto news outlet would ever reduce its hours. The answer is rooted in our commitment to the EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) principles that Google values and, more importantly, that our readers deserve.

By implementing these structured Bitcoin World weekend service hours, we empower our editorial team. This dedicated time allows for research, analysis, and preparation, ensuring that when we report a story—whether on a weekend or a weekday—it is thoroughly vetted, context-rich, and truly valuable. This strategic pause is an investment in the quality of information you receive every single day. How Will This Affect Your Crypto News Access? The practical impact for you, our reader, is minimal for major events but positive for overall content quality. Consider this scenario: a sudden, sharp Bitcoin price movement or a significant regulatory announcement occurs on a Sunday. Our team will be on hand to deliver a clear, accurate, and timely report. However, routine market fluctuations or minor updates may see a delayed analysis until full service resumes. This model is common among top-tier financial news providers. It ensures that when our byline is on a story, it carries the full weight of our expertise. The temporary scaling of our Bitcoin World weekend service is not a reduction in commitment but a refinement of our process to serve you better.

55736028,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/betting-on-sports-with-stablecoins-2026-why-dexsport-leads-usdt-btc-betting,1765639557,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/55736028.jpeg,Betting on Sports with Stablecoins 2026: Why Dexsport Leads USDT & BTC Betting,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/betting-on-sports-with-stablecoins-2026-why-dexsport-leads-usdt-btc-betting,"By 2026, stablecoins are no longer a niche payment method in crypto betting — they are the default settlement layer for serious sports bettors. As volatility cycles continue to shape the broader crypto market, an increasing share of users now prefer to bet with assets that preserve value between kickoff and payout. USDT, USDC, and BTC have become the backbone of this shift, especially on platforms built natively for crypto rather than adapted from fiat sportsbooks . Against this backdrop, a clear divide has emerged between sportsbooks that merely accept crypto and those designed around stablecoin and Bitcoin betting from day one. Dexsport sits firmly in the latter category. Why Stablecoins Became the Preferred Betting Currency Sports betting is fundamentally different from long-term investing. Bets are short-lived, outcome-driven, and highly sensitive to timing. As a result, price volatility — attractive for traders — becomes friction for bettors. Stablecoins solve several structural problems: Capital preservation between bet placement and settlement Predictable bankroll management, especially for live betting Faster accounting, without recalculating exposure due to price swings Easier profit tracking across multiple betting sessions By 2026, USDT has effectively become the operational currency of crypto sports betting, with Bitcoin increasingly used as a reserve or high-liquidity alternative rather than a speculative asset inside bets. Bitcoin vs Stablecoins in Sports Betting While stablecoins dominate daily betting activity, Bitcoin still plays a strategic role. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC): Ideal for live betting and high-frequency wagers Reduce emotional and financial noise Preferred by disciplined bettors and syndicate-style players Bitcoin: Favored for larger, longer exposure bets Appeals to users holding BTC as core capital Benefits from deep liquidity and universal acceptance The strongest platforms in 2026 are not choosing one over the other — they support both seamlessly. Dexsport’s Stablecoin-First Betting Model Dexsport was built around crypto-native betting flows rather than retrofitting blockchain payments into a fiat sportsbook framework. This design choice matters. From a bettor’s perspective, Dexsport treats USDT and BTC not as alternative payment options, but as primary operating currencies. Deposits, bets, cashbacks, and withdrawals are structured around crypto speed and settlement logic, not banking rails. Key structural advantages include: No conversion layers between fiat and crypto Stablecoin payouts without hidden delays Multi-chain USDT support, reducing congestion risk BTC betting integrated alongside stablecoin markets, not siloed This makes Dexsport particularly well-suited for users who actively rotate capital across sports, markets, and betting styles. Stablecoins and Live Sports Betting Live betting is where stablecoins show their full advantage. Odds change rapidly, margins are thin, and execution speed matters more than bonuses or branding. Using USDT eliminates the need to factor in sudden price fluctuations while markets are moving. Dexsport’s live betting environment benefits from: Fast bet confirmation Minimal latency between stake and placement Stable bankroll value throughout a match Immediate reflection of wins and losses in stablecoin balance For bettors operating with discipline and volume, this stability is not a luxury — it is a requirement. Transparency and Settlement in a Stablecoin Environment One of the quiet advantages of stablecoin betting is clarity. When bets are placed and settled in a unit designed to remain at parity, disputes over value disappear. Dexsport reinforces this clarity with: Public bet tracking Transparent settlement logic Weekly cashback paid directly in stablecoins No wagering attached to cashback compensation This approach aligns with how experienced crypto users expect financial platforms to behave: verifiable, predictable, and auditable. How Dexsport Compares to Other Crypto Betting Platforms Many sportsbooks support USDT or BTC in name, but operate on custodial or hybrid systems where: Stablecoins are converted internally Withdrawals are throttled or delayed Betting balances are abstracted from on-chain reality Dexsport’s differentiation is architectural, not cosmetic. Stablecoins remain stablecoins throughout the entire betting lifecycle — from deposit to payout — without unnecessary transformation or opacity. Who Stablecoin-Based Sports Betting Is For in 2026 This model increasingly appeals to: Bettors who treat sports betting as capital allocation, not entertainment Users managing larger, rotating bankroll Live bettors and arbitrage-aware players Crypto natives who avoid fiat rails entirely For these users, stablecoin betting is not about convenience — it is about control. Conclusion By 2026, betting on sports with stablecoins has moved from innovation to infrastructure. Platforms that fail to adapt to this reality increasingly feel outdated, regardless of branding or market size. Dexsport’s stablecoin-first design, combined with Bitcoin support, no-KYC access, and transparent settlement, positions it as a reference point for how crypto sports betting operates when built correctly from the ground up. As volatility continues to define the broader crypto market, stablecoins remain the quiet constant — and sportsbooks that understand this are the ones shaping the future of betting.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-13 15:25:57

As crypto adoption continues to reshape online gambling, a growing number of bettors are moving away from traditional sportsbooks toward Web3 platforms that prioritize speed, privacy, and transparency. Instead of bank cards and identity checks, these sportsbooks allow users to place football bets directly with crypto — often without KYC and without handing custody of funds to a centralized operator. This article explores how Web3 sportsbooks are changing crypto football betting, what defines a truly decentralized betting platform, and which crypto sportsbooks reliably cover major football leagues. We begin with Dexsport, a Web3-native sportsbook built specifically for anonymous, high-performance crypto betting, before examining other notable platforms in the space. What Makes a Crypto Sportsbook “Web3”? Not every sportsbook that accepts crypto qualifies as a Web3 platform. Many traditional operators simply add Bitcoin or stablecoins as a payment method while retaining the same custodial structure, KYC requirements, and opaque settlement systems. A Web3 football sportsbook is typically defined by several core characteristics: Minimal or no identity verification, allowing users to access betting markets without submitting personal documents Crypto-native infrastructure, with deposits and withdrawals handled directly on-chain Fast settlement, especially important for live football betting Greater transparency, reducing reliance on black-box odds and bet resolution User-controlled access, often via wallet connections or lightweight accounts These features appeal particularly to football bettors who value speed, privacy, and predictable payouts over traditional loyalty schemes or fiat integrations. Dexsport : A Web3 Sportsbook Built for True Fans Dexsport is a decentralized sportsbook and casino platform launched in 2022, positioning itself early in the Web3 betting space. Unlike many crypto sportsbooks that remain semi-custodial, Dexsport was designed around anonymity, fast execution, and transparent betting flows from the start. The platform operates under a license issued by the Government of the Autonomous Island of Anjouan (Union of Comoros) and has undergone independent security audits by CertiK and Pessimistic. Registration is instant and does not require KYC — users can sign up via email, Telegram account, or by connecting a DeFi wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. For football bettors, Dexsport’s value lies not in novelty, but in infrastructure. Bets are placed quickly, withdrawals are processed in crypto without unnecessary delays, and users retain full control over how they access and manage their funds. Football Coverage on Dexsport: Leagues, Markets, and Live Betting Dexsport focuses on high-demand sports rather than flooding the platform with low-liquidity categories. Football is one of its strongest verticals. Bettors can access markets across major domestic and international competitions, with deep coverage that includes both pre-match and in-play betting. Each football match typically features a wide range of betting options — from standard outcomes to live props and advanced in-play markets. Live betting is a key strength. Odds update quickly, and users can follow matches in real time, with live streaming available even without an active balance. This setup is particularly attractive to traders who rely on momentum shifts and in-play strategy rather than long-term accumulator bets. Margins remain competitive for a crypto sportsbook, averaging around 4–6% for pre-match football markets, with slightly wider spreads during live betting — a standard trade-off for speed and liquidity. Transparency and Trust in Crypto Football Betting One of the major concerns for crypto bettors is trust — especially when betting live on fast-moving football markets. Dexsport addresses this through a public bet tracking system that allows users to view bets and outcomes in real time. This level of visibility is uncommon in online sportsbooks and reduces reliance on opaque settlement mechanisms. Instead of asking users to “trust the platform,” Dexsport provides verifiable data that allows bettors to independently observe how bets are processed and resolved. Combined with its no-KYC access model and audited infrastructure, this transparency is a core reason Dexsport is often regarded as a benchmark for Web3 sportsbook design rather than just another crypto betting site. Other Crypto Sportsbooks That Cover Major Football Leagues While Dexsport represents a Web3-native approach to football betting, several other crypto sportsbooks also offer coverage of major leagues — each with its own structure and trade-offs. Vave Vave is a crypto-friendly sportsbook and casino offering football markets alongside a broader entertainment focus. It supports multiple cryptocurrencies and covers major football competitions, though it follows a more traditional custodial model compared to Web3-native platforms. Stake Stake is one of the most recognizable brands in crypto gambling, with extensive football coverage and strong liquidity. However, it operates as a centralized platform, meaning users rely on custodial balances and platform-level controls rather than self-directed Web3 access. Lucky Blo Lucky Block combines casino products with sports betting, including football. While it supports crypto deposits, football is not its primary focus, making it better suited for casual bettors rather than users seeking deep football markets. Thunderpick Thunderpick is best known for esports betting but also offers football markets. Its football coverage is secondary to esports, which may limit depth for bettors focused exclusively on major leagues. Conclusion Crypto football betting has evolved beyond novelty. Web3 sportsbooks now offer serious alternatives to traditional operators, particularly for users who value privacy, speed, and control over their funds. Dexsport stands out by combining deep football coverage with no-KYC access, transparent bet tracking, and fast crypto settlement — making it a strong reference point for what a Web3 sportsbook can look like in practice. While other platforms like Stake, Vave, Lucky Block, and Thunderpick each serve specific audiences, the broader trend is clear: football betting with crypto is moving steadily toward a more decentralized, user-controlled model.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-13 15:33:20

This choice matters even more in volatile markets, where selling too early can cut into upside and realize gains at unfavorable times. Borrowing against crypto has emerged as a practical, tax-efficient alternative to selling. It allows users to unlock liquidity while keeping ownership of their digital assets. This article explains how the two approaches differ, why borrowing may offer significant tax advantages, and how modern platforms such as Clapp simplify the process. Selling Crypto for Fiat: What Happens? When you sell crypto—whether Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other asset—you typically create a taxable event. Depending on your jurisdiction, this may involve: Capital gains tax, based on the difference between purchase price and sale price Short-term vs. long-term tax rates Higher tax obligations if selling after a rapid price increase Selling also reduces your market exposure. If the asset appreciates after you sell, the potential gains are lost unless you re-enter the market at a higher price. While selling is straightforward and provides cash immediately, its tax implications—and impact on long-term strategy—can be significant. Borrowing Against Crypto: How It Works Borrowing against crypto replaces the taxable sale with a collateralized loan. You deposit digital assets into a lending platform and receive cash or stablecoins while maintaining full ownership of your crypto. The mechanics are simple: Deposit collateral (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.). Receive liquidity in fiat or stablecoins. Pay interest only on borrowed amounts, depending on the platform. Withdraw collateral once the borrowed amount is repaid. Because the transaction is a loan—not a sale—it typically does not trigger a capital gains tax event, making it a tax-efficient method for accessing cash. This approach allows investors to keep exposure to long-term growth while meeting short-term liquidity needs. Clapp: A Modern Tool for Tax-Efficient Crypto Borrowing Among the platforms offering crypto-backed borrowing, Clapp Credit Line provides an efficient, borrower-friendly structure tailored to long-term investors. Clapp operates as a revolving crypto credit line, not a fixed loan. Users deposit BTC or other supported assets and receive a credit limit they can draw from at any time. Interest applies only to what you use, while unused credit sits at 0% APR. This makes Clapp especially cost-efficient for managing liquidity. Clapp offers one of the lowest borrowing costs in the market. It also supports multi-collateral borrowing across 19 assets, enabling users to combine Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins into one credit line. Repayment is entirely flexible. Borrowers can repay partially or fully at any time, and repaid amounts immediately restore the available credit. This gives users full control over timing—an advantage when managing taxes or market exposure. Clapp provides instant access to USDT, USDC, or EUR, and collateral can be withdrawn instantly once balances are cleared. For investors focused on tax-efficient liquidity, Clapp offers a practical, low-cost solution. When Does Borrowing Make the Most Sense? Borrowing is especially useful when you: want liquidity without triggering a taxable event expect long-term appreciation in your crypto need flexible, on-demand access to capital want to avoid selling during market dips are managing business or personal cash flow prefer predictable, low ongoing costs In these scenarios, borrowing aligns with both short-term needs and long-term investment strategy. Final Thoughts Selling crypto provides immediate cash, but it comes with tax obligations and reduced market exposure. Borrowing against crypto, on the other hand, preserves long-term upside, offers liquidity without triggering taxable events, and provides flexibility that selling cannot match. Platforms like Clapp show how tax-efficient borrowing can be implemented in a simple, transparent, and user-centric way. For investors who want to stay positioned for long-term growth while unlocking near-term liquidity, borrowing against crypto has become one of the most effective financial tools available.

Its presale is picking up speed, and that does not look like it will stop anytime soon. The crypto world is gearing up for a solid run, especially with AI, DePIN, and cross-chain setups leading the way. Ozak AI stands out as a real leader in that mix. The team has pulled in more than $4.9 million already. That puts it right up there with the quickest AI presales this year. It is sparking some big ideas, too. Folks think it might hit 700x returns when the bull market really takes off. Ozak AI ($OZ) Ozak AI is taking over the talk around AI and DePIN for a few good reasons. The project mixes AI automation with decentralized physical infrastructure, or DePIN, and it works across chains too. Most AI tokens stick to just one main thing. Ozak AI feels more like a full smart layer for Web3 overall. The agents it uses create quick market alerts. They handle trading moves on their own. They improve data flows and make risk checks better across different chains. All of that comes with clear audits and a community that keeps growing. Investors look at Ozak AI as something beyond just another AI bet. It sets up as a fresh kind of AI network for infrastructure. That can help the whole crypto space move forward. The real uses it offers explain why people who got in early feel it will beat out regular presales in gains. The presale for Ozak AI keeps building fast, now past $4.92 million, and Phase 7 is getting intense. Even old hands in crypto are surprised by how quickly it has grown. Right now, tokens sit at $0.014 in Phase 7. They have moved over 1 billion of them already. Each new phase bumps the price up a bit. That means early folks are watching their holdings climb on paper. From Phase 1, the value has risen by over 1,300%. Plenty think there is more to come still. What pushes this along is the idea that once it lands on big exchanges, those first buyers could see gains way bigger than from solid old tokens. The market mood is turning to AI options with strong uses. Demand for Ozak AI picks up more each week. The way Ozak AI sets up its tokens aims at growth that lasts. They put a good chunk of the supply toward rewards for the community. That includes staking perks, adding liquidity, building the ecosystem, and planning for the network down the line. It keeps the token from being just a quick flip. Instead, it drives real action on the platform and gets users involved. This setup gives early holders a lot of room to grow, particularly when staking starts, governance kicks in, and cross-chain parts launch after it lists. The Potential Partnerships of Ozak AI Partnerships play a big role in making Ozak AI look solid. They team up with SINT for automation through agents. Hive Intel handles smart systems. Weblume builds the base for the ecosystem. Pyth Network gives price updates in under a second. Dex3 dives deep into on-chain data. Every link adds something special. That widens what Ozak AI can do. It helps mark it as a leading AI token for infrastructure. Conclusion Ozak AI could really deliver 700x returns. The presale grows quickly. It has a firm base in AI and DePIN. Partnerships build a strong ecosystem. All that makes it one of the top tokens for the coming cycle. Bitcoin and Ethereum might give steady climbs. Ozak AI offers a chance for big jumps to early ones who jump in. If the speed holds, that 700x idea might play out. Those getting in before the presale wraps could end up ahead of the rest.

As a result, traders faced a tighter liquidity setup even as price held near recent highs. Bitcoin Faces Liquidity Test as Inter Exchange Flows Turn Negative Bitcoin traded at a critical point as inter exchange liquidity signals weakened, according to data shared by analyst Kamran Asghar on X. The Inter exchange Flow Pulse, or IFP, slipped into the red zone, a level that has historically aligned with periods of consolidation or market corrections. While Bitcoin’s price remained relatively firm, the underlying flow data pointed to fading liquidity support across exchanges. Bitcoin Inter exchange Flow Pulse IFP Chart. Source: CryptoQuant via Kamran The IFP tracks how Bitcoin moves between trading venues, offering insight into whether capital flows support bullish continuation or signal stress. In the current setup, the indicator moved below its neutral range, suggesting that inter exchange demand is no longer expanding. Past cycles on the same chart show that similar red zone readings often preceded sideways trading or deeper pullbacks, even when spot prices initially held steady. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price line continued to hover near recent highs, creating a divergence between price action and liquidity flows. Analysts often view such gaps as warning signs, as prices can struggle to sustain momentum without strong inter exchange activity. According to the chart, previous periods where price remained elevated while IFP weakened eventually resolved through either prolonged consolidation or sharp corrections once selling pressure increased. The chart also shows that earlier bullish phases aligned closely with sustained green IFP zones, where inter exchange flows expanded alongside rising prices. In contrast, the current red reading indicates that liquidity conditions have shifted, even though broader market sentiment has not fully adjusted. As a result, the data suggests Bitcoin may remain range bound in the near term unless inter exchange flows recover and return to positive territory. For now, the IFP signal places Bitcoin at a crossroads, where price stability depends heavily on whether liquidity reenters the market. Without renewed flow support, historical patterns imply that upside momentum could stall, leaving the market vulnerable to corrective moves. Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Historically Low Levels as Supply Tightens Meanwhile, Bitcoin reserves held on exchanges fell to historically low levels, according to data shared by analyst Quinten François on X, citing Glassnode metrics. The chart shows a steady decline in total Bitcoin balances across trading platforms, even as price trended higher over the long term. The divergence highlights a structural shift in how Bitcoin is held and supplied in the market. BTC Balance on Exchanges Total Deribit BTC Chart. Source: Glassnode via Quinten François on X The exchange balance metric tracks how much Bitcoin remains available on centralized venues for immediate trading. Over time, declining balances often signal that investors are moving coins off exchanges into long term storage or self custody. In the current cycle, reserves continued to trend lower despite periods of sharp price volatility, suggesting that available sell side supply has not rebuilt meaningfully. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price has remained elevated compared to earlier cycles when exchange balances were higher. Historically, similar setups appeared during phases when reduced liquid supply amplified price sensitivity to demand shifts. With fewer coins readily available on exchanges, even moderate buying pressure has the potential to move prices more aggressively, while sell offs may depend on new inflows rather than existing reserves. The chart also shows that past market tops often aligned with rising or stabilizing exchange balances, as holders moved coins back to exchanges to realize profits. In contrast, the current structure shows no sustained rebound in reserves, despite Bitcoin trading near cycle highs. This imbalance suggests that many holders remain reluctant to deploy supply, reinforcing tighter liquidity conditions. Overall, historically low exchange reserves point to a constrained supply environment for Bitcoin. While this does not dictate short term price direction, the data indicates that market structure has shifted toward lower immediate liquidity, making future price moves more dependent on changes in inflows rather than existing exchange inventory.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-13 15:46:25

Until recently, traditional bank loans were the default option. Today, crypto holders have an alternative: using digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum as collateral to access instant liquidity without selling their positions. This article breaks down how each model works, compares their strengths, and explains how a modern crypto credit line—particularly from platforms like Clapp —can offer a more flexible, cost-efficient way to borrow. How a Traditional Bank Loan Works Traditional loans follow a predictable structure. A bank evaluates your income, credit score, existing debts, financial history, and—depending on the loan type—your collateral. Approval can take days or weeks. Once approved, you receive a fixed amount and begin paying interest on the entire balance immediately. Repayments are made according to a strict schedule. Bank loans are common for major expenses because they offer regulated terms, but they also come with limitations: repayment timelines are rigid, credit checks are mandatory, and funds are not available instantly. How Borrowing Against Crypto Works Crypto-backed borrowing replaces traditional qualifications with crypto collateral. You deposit Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, or other supported assets into a lending platform and receive stablecoins or fiat in return. Approval is instant because your collateral secures the loan. Borrowers maintain full exposure to their crypto’s market performance while accessing liquidity. This is particularly useful for long-term investors who want to avoid selling during market dips or triggering taxable events. There are two models for borrowing against crypto: fixed crypto loans and revolving crypto credit lines. Crypto Loan vs. Crypto Credit Line A crypto loan issues a fixed sum upfront and charges interest on the full amount from day one. It functions much like a traditional loan, only with crypto collateral instead of income verification. A crypto credit line, in contrast, gives you a borrowing limit based on your collateral. You can withdraw funds whenever you need them, repay at your own pace, and draw again without reapplying. Interest applies only to what you use, not the entire limit. Crypto Credit Line vs Traditional Bank Loan: Key Differences Both options provide access to capital, but their structure, speed, and requirements are fundamentally different. 1. Approval Requirements Bank loans require income documentation, a strong credit score, proof of employment, and a full financial review. Crypto credit lines require none of this. Approval depends solely on the value of the crypto you deposit. 2. Speed of Access Bank loans can take days to weeks from application to funding.Crypto credit lines typically provide liquidity instantly after collateral is deposited. 3. Repayment Flexibility Bank loans include fixed monthly payments and strict timelines. Late payments impact your credit score.Crypto credit lines allow fully flexible repayment. If you repay early, the limit becomes instantly available again. 4. Interest Structure Bank loans charge interest on the total loan amount immediately.Crypto credit lines charge interest only when you actually draw funds. 5. Liquidity Without Selling Assets Bank loans rely on traditional collateral such as real estate or income.Crypto credit lines let you borrow without selling your digital assets, preserving long-term upside. 6. Tax Considerations Selling crypto may trigger capital gains taxes. Borrowing against crypto typically does not, depending on jurisdiction, making credit lines tax-efficient. Clapp: Flexible and Cost-Efficient Crypto Credit Line Among the platforms offering crypto-backed credit lines, Clapp provides one of the most efficient structures for long-term holders. Clapp assigns a credit limit based on your collateral and charges interest only on withdrawn amounts. Any unused portion of the limit remains at 0% APR, allowing borrowers to maintain liquidity readiness at virtually no cost. Clapp offers one of the lowest borrowing costs in the crypto-lending space. It supports multi-collateral borrowing across 19 assets—including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins—giving users broader risk distribution and higher borrowing power. Repayment is entirely flexible. Borrowers can repay at any time, in any amount, and the available credit line adjusts immediately. Liquidity is available 24/7 in USDT, USDC, or EUR, and collateral can be withdrawn instantly once balances are cleared. In functional terms, Clapp offers a crypto-native version of a revolving credit facility—simple, responsive, and designed around user control rather than fixed obligations. When a Traditional Bank Loan Still Makes Sense Traditional loans remain valuable in certain scenarios. Borrowers who need large, long-term financing for real estate, business expansion, or regulated institutional activities may prefer the structure and documentation of bank loans. Banks also offer long repayment horizons, which some borrowers find useful. However, for liquidity needs tied to fast-moving markets, cash flow smoothing, or preserving crypto exposure, traditional loans are simply not as adaptive. Which Should You Choose? A crypto credit line is generally the better choice when you want: fast access to liquidity no credit checks flexible repayment interest applied only when funds are used to preserve exposure to crypto lower carrying costs A traditional bank loan may be preferable when: you need regulated, long-term financing your needs align with fixed repayment schedules you lack crypto collateral your jurisdiction restricts crypto borrowing The decision ultimately depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and how much flexibility you require. Final Thoughts Borrowing against crypto has transformed liquidity management for digital asset holders. With crypto credit lines, users can unlock cash without selling their assets, incur minimal ongoing costs, and repay on their own terms. Traditional bank loans still serve important roles, but they cannot match the speed, flexibility, or user autonomy of crypto-backed credit lines. Platforms like Clapp demonstrate how this new borrowing model can work at scale—efficiently, securely, and with a borrower-first design. For anyone seeking liquidity while staying invested in crypto, a credit line is one of the most compelling tools available today. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In earlier cycles, attention was often driven by rapid price movements and short-term narratives. Today, a growing number of traders are taking a more research-driven approach, evaluating not just individual tokens but the infrastructure that supports trading across entire ecosystems. Solana has become a central part of this discussion. Known for its speed and low transaction costs, the network continues to attract active traders, developers, and liquidity. As activity increases, demand is shifting toward platforms that can handle more complex trading behavior. This is where infrastructure-focused projects are beginning to stand out. L.xyz is emerging within this trend as a decentralized exchange project built on Solana, designed to support advanced trading rather than simple token swaps. Why Altcoin Research Is Shifting Toward Infrastructure Large-cap assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain core holdings for many traders. However, as ecosystems expand, the platforms that facilitate trading often become just as important as the assets themselves. Decentralized exchanges sit at the center of this infrastructure layer. They determine how efficiently traders can enter and exit positions, manage risk, and deploy strategies. As volumes increase, execution quality becomes a differentiating factor. This is why some traders researching the best altcoins to buy now are also researching trading platforms like L.xyz . Instead of evaluating price charts alone, they are looking at whether a platform can support the next phase of on-chain trading activity. Solana’s Role in Shaping Next-Generation Trading Solana’s technical characteristics make it well-suited for active trading. Fast transaction finality allows real-time adjustments, while low fees reduce friction for frequent trades. These advantages have led to growing adoption across DeFi and trading applications. However, many existing decentralized exchanges on Solana rely exclusively on automated market makers. While AMMs provide accessibility, they can struggle during periods of volatility, particularly when liquidity becomes fragmented. L.xyz addresses this by implementing a hybrid AMM and order book architecture. Liquidity pools ensure continuous market access, while the order book allows for structured execution through limit orders and stop orders. This design is intended to improve price discovery and reduce slippage during active market conditions. Designed for Traders Who Value Control L.xyz is being developed with a clear focus on trading functionality. The platform is designed to support spot trading, futures markets, and l everage up to 100x on select pairs . These features are complemented by tools for monitoring positions and managing exposure. Rather than simplifying the experience to appeal to casual users, the platform emphasizes control and precision. This approach aligns with the needs of experienced traders who require predictable execution, particularly when managing larger positions. As Solana trading activity grows, platforms that prioritize reliability and performance are likely to become more relevant within the ecosystem. Transparency and Verified Structure Transparency plays a significant role in how traders evaluate early-stage altcoin projects. L.xyz has completed independent audits with SpyWolf and QuillAudits, confirming several important properties of the LXYZ token. The total supply is permanently fixed at 500 million tokens. Mint authority has been revoked, ensuring no additional tokens can ever be created. Freeze authority is disabled, meaning no entity can restrict user balances. The audits also confirm that there are no hidden taxes, transfer fees, or blacklist mechanisms embedded in the contract. These findings are publicly verifiable through SolidProof’s TrustNet listing, allowing traders to independently confirm details during their research process. Early Exposure Through Infrastructure Alignment The LXYZ token enables governance participation, staking rewards, and liquidity incentives within the platform. Presale participation is framed as early alignment with a trading ecosystem rather than a short-term speculative opportunity. For traders researching best altcoins to buy now, this infrastructure-first approach offers a different lens. Instead of focusing solely on asset appreciation, it emphasizes participation in the systems that support trading activity itself.

L.xyz is often included in this research because it focuses on trading execution and liquidity within the Solana ecosystem. What is the best crypto to buy now?Some traders prioritize early access to platforms with real utility rather than only established assets. L.xyz is evaluated in this context due to its trading-focused design and transparent structure. What is the best crypto to buy for a 100x return?Rather than targeting specific return figures, experienced traders typically research early-stage infrastructure projects with fixed supply and audits. L.xyz is reviewed in this category based on its platform fundamentals. Is L.xyz a good project to invest in?L.xyz is being researched as a decentralized exchange built on Solana. Its hybrid trading architecture and audit-verified token properties are key factors traders consider during evaluation. Should I invest in L.xyz?Investment decisions depend on individual goals and risk tolerance, but L.xyz is commonly reviewed by traders seeking early exposure to audited trading infrastructure with long-term relevance.

Initial investment actually points out to the fact that this trend could be laying the foundation of escalating long term prospects as subsequent phases come close. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Creating Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an organized DeFi crypto borrowing and lending protocol created in the state of two interdependent markets. The platform would apply to provide predictable yield to suppliers and flexible borrowing among those in need of loans. Users who inject the assets into the liquidity pool are given mtTokens that increase in redeemable value as the interest is deposited into the protocol. Lending regulations that are based on LTV limits, liquidation threshold, and rate patterns that change with utilization allow borrowers to take loans secured by collateral. MUTM was initially introduced at the price of $0.01 in early 2025. The token lent and climbed up a number of pre-planned sequences to eventually reach a high of $0.035 in presale. It has over 18,400 users who have enabled the project to raise over $19.30M. No less than 820M has been bought till now. Phase 6 is now past 95% allocation. This will be followed by the introduction of a price rise, and according to the analysts; this process is a demonstration of consistent involvement as opposed to short bursts. V1 Launch and Security Foundations On its official X channel, Mutuum Finance assured that in Q4 2025, V1 will be deployed on the Sepolia Testnet. The rollout of the V1 involves the mtToken engine, liquidity pool, Liquidator Bot and debt token. The initial assets to be supported will be ETH and USDT. The fact that its launch window is clear is one of the reasons why the project is increasingly becoming visible in the realm of top crypto leaders. Security preparation is a big subject. Mutuum Finance has already passed a CertiK audit of 90/100 Token Scan and Halborn Security is looking into the finished code. There is also a bug bounty of $50K to be used in order to identify code vulnerabilities early. According to some of the analysts, this risk management of the steady growth and evident communication of the roadmap and security checks would potentially lead to a successful post-launch run. Under a bullish estimation, it is estimated that MUTM can increase multiple times of its current price, when the V1 activity starts and the number of users increase. Buy and Distribute Model and Second Price Forecast The use of mTtokens will have a core part in the structure of Mutuum Finance in the long run. The more borrowers repay interest the greater the redeemable value of mtTokens. This links user rewards to actual protocol activity as opposed to inflation. Analysts consider this to be among the multi-core causes that might see the token perform effectively once V1 is activated and borrowing demand is on the rise. Another growth factor is the buy and distribute mechanism. Part of the protocol fees is utilized in purchasing MUTM via the market. Open market MUTM will be redistributed to users of the safety module staking mtTokens. According to market commentators, such consistent buying behavior enhances long-term token behavior. In a second price model, analysts indicate that MUTM could reach a significant 10x levels upward on its present output of $0.035 on the assumption that its usage has a steady rise after implementations of testnet. Long-Term Significance Mutuum Finance will also roll out an interest-earning stablecoin pegged to interests earned within the protocol according to the official roadmap. This stablecoin is aimed to facilitate the support of the activity of borrowing, to enhance the liquidity and assist users to manage collateral in more efficient ways. The other roadmap milestone is layer-2 expansion. Using the L2 network would reduce transaction costs and speed. Lending procedures are usually relying on cheap operations so that there is an incentive to borrow more. According to several analysts, these two developments are significant regarding long-term scalability and can assist Mutuum Finance in positioning itself in the next phase of the DeFi crypto expansion. Phase 6 Movement Mutuum finance has sustained its bond with the community by using a 24-hour leaderboard that grants the best contributor $500 in MUTM daily. The system maintains a steady state of activity and it grows more visible as the project increases in size. A significant milestone in phase 6 is passing the 95% mark. When allocation is tight, interest will rise as the user poises up in anticipation of the next price step. The next step will be to increase the price of the token by close to 20% and this is one of the reasons why people have been engaging in the activity faster in the past couple of weeks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) turns out to be one of the most promising crypto projects whose price is below $0.05. As Phase 6 is coming to an end, there is a definite V1 plan, good audit reports, an established system of stablecoins and developing mtToken functionality, the project is moving into the next phase of its roadmap. Many top crypto investors believe, in the event of an increase in the activity of individuals following launching, MUTM may experience significant price improvement backed by actual developing application protocol utility.

According to analyst Axel Adler Junior, the cryptocurrency is in a rare holding pattern: technically in a correction, but still far from the deep drawdowns that have historically defined full bear markets. $90K Range Standstill In his latest analysis, Adler said that Bitcoin’s current maximum correction stands at roughly -32% from its all-time high. This is milder than the -60% to -80% declines seen at the end of major cycles since 2011. In previous cycles, a steady break below -40% served as the gateway to a far deeper decline, but Bitcoin has not crossed that threshold in the current 2025 cycle. This positions the market in an unusual middle zone, where the correction is unmistakable, but its severity does not match past bearish extremes. Unrealised loss metrics further validate this picture. Adler explained that only 12% of the supply is currently in loss, while an overwhelming 88% of coins remain in profit. Even the recent local peak, around 17% of supply in the red, sits dramatically below historical capitulation levels, where roughly 60% of supply fell underwater in previous cycle bottoms. Such limited unrealised losses indicate strong resilience among holders and suggest that this downturn more closely resembles a mid-trend correction within a broader bullish supercycle than the terminal phase of a bear market. However, the same strength also introduces risk, as so many holders are still in profit. Therefore, any negative trigger could accelerate profit-taking and push drawdowns deeper. Adler argued that Bitcoin is effectively balancing between two possible paths. If the correction holds above the -35% zone and unrealised losses remain moderate, it would boost the case for a structurally “flatter” market shaped by institutional demand and ongoing supply constraints. But a slide beyond -40% would sharply raise the probability of a classic bear cycle, opening the door to -60% to -70% declines and a more severe capitulation phase. For now, Bitcoin’s frozen price action indicates this delicate equilibrium. The next major move will hinge on whether drawdowns continue to deepen and unrealised losses begin climbing toward historically important thresholds. Those signals will decide whether Bitcoin remains in a mild correction or transitions into a classic bear market. Bearish Flag Alarm Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also warned that Bitcoin could be setting up for a deeper correction after observing a potential bearish flag formation. The 12-hour chart shows BTC consolidating within a narrowing ascending channel after a sharp downward move. This is a classic continuation pattern that often leads to another leg lower. Martinez noted that if this pattern breaks down, the technical target sits near $70,000, which points to an over 22% drop from current levels.

As liquidity tightens and traders anticipate seasonal strength, several altcoins are showing strong positioning ahead of the 2025 Christmas rally. Among them, REACT, DOGE, SOL, and AVAX stand out for their utility, community strength, or improving market structure. 1. REACT — Revenue-Driven Token With Active Platform Usage Reactor ($REACT) remains one of the most compelling early-stage assets heading into the holiday season. The token powers Reactor, a live trading terminal that consolidates: Spot execution with smart routing Perpetual DEX trading A unified yield dashboard Automated memecoin and token discovery tools With nearly 10 million tokens already sold during its presale, REACT has clear early traction. Why REACT Is Positioned for the Christmas Rally Real revenue backing: Reactor uses platform fees for buybacks and token burns, tightening supply as usage rises. Strong incentives: Zero-fee trading, boosted staking APY, and priority access to new features reinforce demand. Operational product: Traders are already using the platform — adoption is not hypothetical. In a market that increasingly rewards real utility, REACT enters the holiday period with a strong structural advantage. Secure Your $REACT Tokens Ahead of the Holiday Rally 2. DOGE — High-Liquidity Meme Asset With Seasonal Momentum Dogecoin historically sees renewed attention during periods of rising market sentiment, making it a frequent outperformer during holiday rallies. Its strength comes from: A large, highly engaged community Deep liquidity across all major exchanges Strong sensitivity to broader market movements DOGE remains speculative, but when risk appetite increases, liquidity often flows into assets with high brand recognition and strong memetic power. Why DOGE Matters This December Historically reactive to BTC-led rallies Extremely high social engagement Low barrier to entry for new retail participants If positive sentiment builds into late December, DOGE could benefit from renewed retail demand. 3. SOL — Strong Developer Activity and High-Throughput Performance Solana continues to be one of the most active layer-1 ecosystems, with high network throughput, fast settlement, and strong application growth across DeFi, gaming, and payments. Key Drivers Ahead of the Christmas Rally High transaction capacity supports scaling for active applications. Growing ecosystem: Solana consistently attracts new developers and projects. Rising user activity: DeFi volume and on-chain participation remain strong. SOL typically responds quickly to improving market sentiment, and with network fundamentals intact, it is well positioned as liquidity rotates toward high-performance chains. 4. AVAX — Expanding Subnet Adoption and Institutional Interest Avalanche remains a leading platform for custom blockchain deployments through its subnet architecture, allowing teams to build tailored networks optimized for gaming, DeFi, compliance environments, or enterprise use. Why AVAX Has Holiday Upside Potential Subnet growth: More projects deploying custom chains increases AVAX’s utility. Institutional experimentation: Financial institutions continue testing Avalanche for tokenization pilots. Scalable architecture: High throughput and flexible design appeal to complex applications. As subnet activity expands, demand for AVAX as the asset used for security and engine-level operations may rise. Final Thoughts The 2025 Christmas rally could offer meaningful opportunities for assets with real adoption trends, high liquidity, or strengthening technical setups. REACT leads with a revenue-backed model and an operational trading ecosystem. DOGE remains a high-sentiment asset that often moves quickly in rising markets. SOL benefits from strong fundamentals and heavy developer activity. AVAX continues to grow through its subnet architecture and enterprise engagement. As year-end momentum builds, these four altcoins are among the most compelling to track in the weeks leading into the holiday season.

Despite several short-term relief rallies, sellers have maintained control, keeping the market confined below major resistance zones and preventing any meaningful trend reversal. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, XRP is firmly trading inside a descending channel that has defined the price action since the October peak. Each recovery attempt has been capped by the upper boundary of this channel, reinforcing the dominant bearish structure. The asset is currently hovering around the $2.03 level, well below both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. The 200-day moving average near the $2.50 region has acted as a dynamic resistance, coinciding with a major daily supply zone that previously triggered aggressive sell-offs. Above current levels, the $2.25 to $2.50 zone remains the most critical resistance area. This region represents a former consolidation range and overlaps with the descending trendline, creating a strong confluence that sellers are likely to defend. On the downside, the $1.90 to $1.75 demand zone stands out as the most important support area. This region marks the strongest bullish reaction during the correction and sits near the lower boundary of the descending channel. A deeper pullback into this zone would still be considered structurally consistent with the ongoing corrective phase. As long as XRP remains below the $2.25 level, the broader daily structure favors continuation rather than reversal. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights persistent compression within a smaller descending structure nested inside the larger daily channel. The price is forming lower highs and higher lows, resulting in a tightening range that reflects indecision rather than accumulation. Recent attempts to push higher have been rejected around the $2.10 to $2.15 supply zone, which aligns with a minor 4-hour order block and the local descending trendline. Each rejection from this area has led to renewed selling pressure, pushing the price back toward the $2.00 psychological level. If XRP fails to hold above $2.00, liquidity is likely to be drawn toward the $1.90 to $1.85 region, where the next cluster of demand is positioned. This area also aligns with the lower boundary of the short-term structure, increasing its technical significance. For any bullish shift to materialize, XRP must reclaim the $2.15 level and hold above it with strong momentum. Until that occurs, short-term rallies are likely to remain corrective and vulnerable to rejection.

Traders and investors watch closely when high‑profile voices share strong convictions about future price action. Recently, one such statement has focused attention on Ripple’s native token, XRP, sparking fresh discussion about the asset’s potential. YoungHoon Kim, widely known online as the world’s highest IQ holder with a claimed score of 276, has turned part of his analytical spotlight toward XRP. In a December X post, he expressed confidence that XRP could reach a new all‑time high before the end of 2025. His endorsement has quickly reverberated through crypto communities and brought renewed focus to XRP’s prospects heading into the final weeks of the year. In my view, #XRP has a strong possibility of reaching a new ATH by the end of this year. – World's Highest IQ 276 Holder https://t.co/3Tx9i7wSmv — YoungHoon Kim, IQ 276 (@yhbryankimiq) December 12, 2025 XRP’s Recent Market Environment XRP’s price performance in 2025 reflects the broader crypto market’s mixed signals. Although there have been periodic rallies, the token remains below its mid‑year high of approximately $3.66. Slower movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum have often weighed on altcoin sentiment, including XRP’s price action. Recent corrections in major assets have tempered overly aggressive forecasts across the board. However, XRP’s landscape is shifting. Legal clarity has improved notably with Ripple’s extended regulatory progress through 2025. After years of uncertainty, XRP’s status is better defined, easing a major overhang that previously discouraged institutional participation. This development has helped stabilize sentiment and open doors for broader integration. Institutional Adoption and Regulatory Catalysts Key catalysts that support bullish narratives include institutional adoption and a clearer regulatory path. Financial products tied to XRP, such as exchange‑traded funds, are making waves . Institutional inflows have historically shifted market dynamics in crypto, and similar trends could impact XRP’s trajectory. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additionally, regulatory endorsements have progressed, with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granting conditional charters that could benefit Ripple and similar firms. These regulatory advancements may encourage increased institutional engagement with XRP and associated products. Market Perspectives Beyond Kim’s Prediction While Kim’s endorsement adds to the bullish chatter around XRP, broader market commentary remains balanced. Some analysts forecast modest gains toward key technical levels like $4–$6 by year‑end under favorable market conditions. Bullish technical setups and rising institutional interest form part of the optimistic scenario. Conversely, bearish cases emphasize that systemic crypto weakness could stall substantial gains. The variance in forecasts underscores the uncertain nature of predicting exact price levels. An all‑time high for XRP would require an aggressive rally from current levels, exceeding typical market expectations in the final quarter of the year. Even Kim’s bold view — while garnering attention — faces the same market realities as other projections. Weighing Optimism With Market Realities Kim’s optimistic stance on XRP has added fuel to an already active discussion about the token’s future potential. His confidence, coupled with growing institutional interest and regulatory progress, provides compelling narrative material for traders and holders alike. Yet reaching a new all‑time high remains a challenging target in a market defined by volatility and macro pressures. Investors should consider both the bullish signals and the market risks before concluding. XRP’s path to a fresh peak will depend on continued regulatory clarity, inflows of institutional capital, and broader trend shifts in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

55737282,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/top-6-crypto-pr-agencies-delivering-high-impact-communications-in-latam,1765642013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/55737282.jpeg,Top 6 Crypto PR Agencies Delivering High-Impact Communications in LATAM,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/top-6-crypto-pr-agencies-delivering-high-impact-communications-in-latam,"Latin America is rapidly emerging as one of the world’s most dynamic regions for crypto adoption and blockchain entrepreneurship. From fintech-powered economies to grassroots Web3 communities, the pace of growth is accelerating—bringing new projects, capital, and users into the ecosystem at scale. However, this rapid expansion also creates pressure on how crypto companies are perceived, understood, and trusted. Regulatory complexity, uneven media literacy around Web3, and heightened scrutiny mean that strong, specialized PR is no longer optional. For crypto projects operating in Latin America, effective communications are essential to give growth the right direction, shape credible narratives, and build long-term trust with media, regulators, and users. Below is a curated ranking of the top 6 crypto PR and communications agencies specializing in Latin America, selected based on strategic depth, crypto fluency, media credibility, and proven regional execution. 1. Outset PR — Data-driven crypto communications engineered with the focus on AI-era visibility Outset PR distinguishes itself in the LATAM crypto PR landscape by approaching public relations not as a creative guessing game, but as a measurable, data-led discipline. At the core of its methodology is the belief that where and how a story appears matters just as much as what is being said, especially in Web3, where credibility, discoverability, and long-term visibility directly impact growth. Unlike traditional PR agencies that focus on single placements or vanity metrics, Outset PR designs communications strategies around syndication intelligence, and future-proof discoverability across both human audiences and AI-driven systems. A proprietary, data-driven PR methodology At the center of this model is Outset PR’s proprietary Syndication Map : a body of internal know-how built from analyzing how stories propagate across media ecosystems, particularly within crypto, fintech, and Web3 coverage in LATAM and global markets. Rather than pursuing coverage indiscriminately, Outset PR uses its proprietary syndication map to: Target outlets that trigger organic downstream pickup Avoid redundancy across overlapping media networks Design placements that compound visibility over time This enables a single high-quality placement to generate cascading exposure across multiple publications and aggregators—often without additional spend. Especially in LATAM, where syndication networks are deeply interconnected, this approach materially increases ROI. Making Web3 projects visible to LLMs and AI search systems Outset PR also places strong emphasis on AI search optimization , ensuring Web3 companies are discoverable, accurately represented, and contextually understood by large language models (LLMs) and AI-powered search tools. As AI increasingly mediates information discovery, Outset PR integrates: Entity consistency across authoritative sources Clear narrative structures that LLMs can parse and reference Reinforcement of core positioning through credible media signals Alignment between PR coverage, owned content, and thought leadership This work goes beyond traditional SEO or press coverage, helping Web3 projects become machine-readable authorities, not just media mentions. Such an approach is particularly valuable for projects operating in high-noise markets, entering LATAM, or scaling globally—where credibility, efficiency, and future-proof visibility matter more than raw volume. 2. Blockchainpress Media — Crypto-native PR and announcement amplification Blockchainpress Media positions itself as a crypto-focused PR and media distribution agency, purpose-built to serve blockchain, Web3, and digital asset projects. The agency operates within the crypto media ecosystem, emphasizing visibility, announcement delivery, and consistent presence across industry-specific publications. In the context of crypto and Web3, Blockchainpress Media’s role is centered on announcement amplification rather than deep narrative strategy. They help projects ensure that launches, partnerships, token updates, and milestones are seen by relevant crypto audiences, making them a practical partner for teams with well-defined messaging that need efficient reach and frequency. Key services Crypto press release writing and distribution Announcement amplification across blockchain and Web3 media Visibility campaigns for product, token, and partnership launches 3. AWISEE — Long-term digital authority building through SEO-led PR AWISEE approaches communications from a performance-driven, digital-first perspective. The agency blends PR, SEO, and content marketing to help brands build lasting online authority rather than short-lived attention. Its work is structured around data, search behavior, and sustained visibility. Within the crypto and Web3 space, AWISEE plays a complementary role to traditional PR by strengthening how projects are discovered online. Their campaigns are designed to improve search presence, accumulate credibility signals, and ensure that blockchain companies remain visible well beyond individual announcements—an increasingly important factor as search and AI systems shape discovery. Key services Digital PR campaigns with SEO outcomes Authority and backlink-building initiatives Content strategies aligned with search demand Performance and visibility analysis 4. LatAm Intersect PR — Regionally grounded communications for LATAM ecosystems LatAm Intersect PR focuses on helping organizations communicate effectively within Latin America by grounding messaging in regional realities and stakeholder dynamics. The agency emphasizes cultural awareness, ecosystem relationships, and long-term engagement rather than transactional media outreach. For crypto and Web3 projects, LatAm Intersect PR supports ecosystem integration, helping companies communicate with local partners, fintech players, communities, and media in a way that feels credible and locally informed. This approach is particularly relevant for projects building sustained operations or partnerships in the region. Key services LATAM-focused communications strategy Local media and stakeholder outreach Ecosystem and partnership messaging 5. Seletana Marketing — Campaign-led growth with communications alignment Seletana Marketing operates primarily as a growth and marketing partner, supporting brands through campaign execution, content development, and go-to-market initiatives. The agency’s work emphasizes activation and momentum, translating messaging into action across digital channels. In the crypto and Web3 context, Seletana Marketing often complements PR efforts by ensuring that launches and campaigns are reinforced through consistent messaging and audience engagement. While not PR-centric, their execution helps extend the impact of communications strategies into measurable growth activities. Key services Campaign and content execution Go-to-market support Growth-oriented messaging and activation 6. Blue Manakin — Web3 & crypto marketing with strong LATAM reach Blue Manakin positions itself not as a traditional PR agency, but as a pioneering Artificial Intelligence–driven digital agency operating at the forefront of AI, Web3, crypto, and emerging technologies. Their core value lies in helping businesses accelerate digital transformation through AI-based services, advanced analytics, and technology-enabled growth strategies. In the context of crypto and Web3, Blue Manakin’s role is primarily enablement and amplification, rather than classic media relations. They focus on using AI-powered tools and frameworks to support market visibility, community growth, and adoption—often working alongside PR-led strategies rather than replacing them. Key services AI-driven marketing and growth optimization Web3, crypto, and NFT marketing support Community growth and engagement strategies Content, SEO, and digital visibility powered by data and automation Consulting at the intersection of AI, Web3, and emerging tech Final thoughts As crypto and Web3 continue to scale across LATAM, PR is no longer about volume alone—it’s about credibility, efficiency, and lasting visibility. The agencies featured here reflect the range of approaches shaping the region’s communications landscape.

Despite the recent bounce from sub-$85K levels, the overall market tone still leans cautious. There’s been no meaningful breakout, and sentiment hasn’t shifted bullish yet. BTC Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, the price is still trapped inside the broader descending channel that’s been active over the past couple of months. BTC recently bounced from the $81K support zone and has since printed a series of higher lows. However, each push has been capped at around $95K, right below the channel’s higher boundary and the key bearish order block. The asset is now trading below both the 100-day and 200-day MAs, which are curving downward around $107K. This is a clear sign that buyers are still fighting the macro trend. Unless a strong daily close above $96K occurs, the structure remains bearish to neutral. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, BTC is forming a clear ascending triangle between $80K and $95K. This kind of structure often resolves upward, but only if volume and momentum support the breakout. Right now, the breakout attempts near $94K keep getting rejected. There is a tightening squeeze between the trendline support and horizontal resistance, and the price is nearing the apex. So a breakout or breakdown is likely within the next few sessions. Buyers would want to see a clean breakout above $95K with volume to target the $100K zone. Sellers, on the other hand, would look to a break below the ascending trendline, aiming for a retest of $85K or even the critical $80K area. On-Chain Analysis Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Exchange reserve data paints a more interesting picture. BTC reserves on exchanges continue to fall sharply, now hitting multi-year lows around 2.75M BTC. This typically suggests long-term holders are not interested in selling, and supply is drying up. However, this hasn’t translated into price strength yet. The divergence between falling reserves and sideways price action shows one thing: demand is still not strong enough to push prices higher, despite low exchange supply. This could be because institutional flows and retail interest remain weak at current levels, or because capital is sitting on the sidelines waiting for macro clarity. Until spot demand kicks in, the falling reserves alone won’t be enough to ignite a sustainable rally.

With sentiment improving and capital cycling back into risk assets, several altcoins are showing strong fundamental and technical setups worth monitoring closely. Among them, REACT , XRP, and ADA stand out as key assets to track as the 2025 holiday rally approaches. 1. REACT — Early-Stage Utility Token Backed by Real Platform Revenue Reactor ($REACT) leads the list because it offers something increasingly rare in early-stage crypto: a live, working product with direct token-linked revenue. The Reactor ecosystem consolidates the entire DeFi trading workflow into one professional interface, including: Smart-routed spot swaps Perpetual DEX trading with real-time PnL A unified yield-farming and vault hu Automated token discovery tools This solves a core problem in DeFi — tool fragmentation — and gives traders a seamless, efficient experience. Why REACT Deserves Attention Before Year-End Revenue-backed token model: Platform fees are used for buybacks and token burns, reducing circulating supply over time. Strong presale demand: Nearly 10 million tokens sold signals early traction. Meaningful incentives: Reduced trading fees, boosted staking APY (10% → 28%), and early access to new products. Security and credibility: Audit by Hacken and listings on top rating platforms strengthen trust. As user activity grows, REACT’s value loop becomes stronger. With its ecosystem already live — not hypothetical — the token is well positioned heading into a seasonal period when traders often rotate into high-upside projects. Buy $REACT at Presale Rates Before the Holiday Rally 2. XRP — Improving Momentum and Expanding Institutional Use Cases XRP remains a major asset to watch as it continues to see renewed momentum on both the technical and adoption fronts. Recent price action has pushed XRP back above important short-term indicators like the 7-day SMA and the 50% Fibonacci retracement levels. The MACD histogram turning positive reinforces the shift in momentum. Beyond charts, XRP’s long-term narrative remains tied to institutional adoption, cross-border settlement, and liquidity provisioning. Why XRP Matters for the Christmas Run Strengthening technical structure: The recovery from oversold conditions signals reduced sell pressure. Rising settlement activity: Continued partnerships across remittances and fintech broaden ecosystem usage. Key resistance nearby: Clearing the 200-day EMA would confirm a larger trend reversal. If market sentiment improves into December, XRP is one of the higher-liquidity assets capable of absorbing inflows quickly and extending gains during year-end rallies. 3. ADA — Network Improvements and Developer Growth Support Long-Term Potential Cardano (ADA) continues to develop at a steady pace, focusing on scalability upgrades, governance milestones, and improved developer tooling. While it is no longer an emerging asset, ADA remains a closely watched altcoin because of its active research-driven roadmap and commitment to sustainable blockchain infrastructure. Recent improvements to throughput, dApp tooling, and governance frameworks have strengthened the foundation for broader ecosystem activity. Why ADA Is Worth Tracking in Q4 2025 Strengthening development activity: Updates to Plutus tooling and scaling solutions improve dApp readiness. Evolving governance: Community-controlled decision-making enhances network decentralization. Seasonal performance: ADA historically reacts well to rising market liquidity late in the year. As more projects deploy on Cardano and infrastructure matures, ADA may benefit from renewed investor interest during the Christmas market run. Final Thoughts The period leading into the 2025 Christmas rally could present strong opportunities for altcoins with real fundamentals and improving market structures. REACT stands out as an early-stage, revenue-driven token backed by a functioning trading ecosystem. XRP offers improving momentum and ongoing institutional relevance. ADA continues to build long-term value through steady development and scalable infrastructure. As Bitcoin stabilizes and market sentiment shifts, these altcoins are well positioned to benefit from renewed attention and potential year-end buying pressure.

Jamie said he believes Kevin Hassett would likely support Donald Trump’s call for faster rate cuts if he becomes chair, but Warsh would be harder to bend. That closed-door meeting came during a busy week in Washington. Trump had just met Kevin at the White House on Wednesday alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and many other senior officials. Cryptopolitan reported that the meeting saw Kevin facing a direct round of questions, because Trump plans to make his final decision “in the coming weeks.” As you should know, the president has been pushing the Fed to lower borrowing costs and has repeatedly attacked current chair Jay Powell, calling him a “numbskull” and a “moron.” Powell has said earlier this week that the Fed is “well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves” after cutting rates for the third straight meeting, which brought the policy rate to a three-year low, as Cryptopolitan reported live. Trump moves markets while the Fed faces internal split Prediction traders reacted fast after Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Kevin “is” his leading pick. On Kalshi, Kevin’s odds for the job rose from about 15% to 40%. Hassett’s chances dropped below 60% after sitting near 80% earlier in the week. Trump played up both men by saying, “I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They’re both — I think the two Kevins are great.” Investors treated the remarks as a fresh read on the race and priced them in quickly. Inside the Fed, Wednesday’s policy meeting revealed deep disagreement, with some regional bank leaders arguing against more cuts, while Powell said the bar for more easing is high. The meeting was described as tense, with some presidents pushing to hold rates steady. Jamie warned earlier this year that “the independence of the Fed is absolutely critical” and said that interference “can often have adverse consequences.” JPMorgan declined to comment on what he said Thursday night. His current stance comes as Trump tests the limits of presidential power over the central bank. Supreme Court weighs Trump’s authority as other candidates fade The Supreme Court is set to hear a major case next month on Trump’s ability to fire agency officials even when Congress gave them job protection. The court’s conservative majority appears open to expanding Trump’s removal powers, but they have shown hesitation about applying that to the Fed. Last May, the court said the Fed has unique traits that separate it from other agencies. Even with that view, Trump moved in August to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, igniting a legal fight that could reshape the boundaries of Fed independence. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a brief urging the court to treat the Fed differently. The group pointed to the Sinking Fund Commission created in 1790 as proof that monetary bodies have long operated outside presidential control. Some legal scholars dispute that reading and say it misrepresents the Fed’s design. Other names once in the mix included Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, who runs fixed income at BlackRock. They were part of an original list of 11 candidates, but traders on Kalshi have now pushed their odds near zero. The contest is now treated as a two-person race, and Jamie made it clear which Kevin Wall Street wants for the job.

As small as it is, the EU country is now registering impressive results, just as it marks the onset of a new crypto era in Europe by issuing its first MiCA licenses. Fintech firms pay Latvia over €90 million in taxes The Latvian industry centered on advanced financial technologies is accelerating in its development, Invest in Latvia revealed this week. The information portal, the main purpose of which is to attract foreign investors to the Baltic nation, released a few stats supporting the claim on Friday. According to a post on its website, nearly 130 companies are currently engaged in the sector, employing more than 3,600 people in the EU member state with a population of less than 2 million. Their combined turnover approaches 400 million euros a year (nearly $480 million), and they pay the government more than 91 million euros in annual taxes (almost $107 million), the report detailed. The figures were highlighted during a working ‘Fintech Breakfast’ with participants trying to answer the question: “What is needed to realize Latvia’s fintech ambitions?” The meeting was hosted by the RTU Riga Business School (RBS) and was organized by the Fintech Latvia Association and the RBS Baltic Financial Center (BFC). Guests were acquainted with the latest numbers, with particular emphasis on the industry’s impact on the national economy and potential for future strengthening. The data has been compiled as part of a pilot project to create a comprehensive database of domestic fintech platforms called “Latvian Fintech Observatory.” Presenting the tool, BFC Director Kristīne Dambe stressed: “We can shape our own narrative and learn from our neighbors, but it is crucial to base decisions on data reflecting real trends.” Latvian Minister of Economy Viktors Valainis urged to position Latvia as a place where fintech businesses can grow and develop both regionally and globally. “We all want Latvian-founded companies not only to strengthen the local economy but also to become export-capable technology firms,” he elaborated. Mārtiņš Kazāks, governor of Latvijas Banka, the Latvian central bank, highlighted that the country has talent, entrepreneurs, and sound financial infrastructure, insisting: “Latvia can become a significant European fintech hub not merely because of ambition, but because the foundations are already in place.” Latvia aims to be the next MiCA gateway in the Baltics Officials and representatives of the industry agreed in their discussions on the need for predictable regulation and cooperation between banks and fintechs. The key goal is to leverage Latvia’s advantages in the crypto space, particularly in light of the already started licensing under the EU’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) rules. Earlier this week, Invest in Latvia announced that the country has issued its first MiCA licenses, signaling its ambition to become one of Europe’s most friendly jurisdictions for crypto platforms. The news came from a press conference of the monetary authority in Riga, which unveiled that it has authorized two companies, BlockBen and Nexdesk, to work from Latvia as providers of crypto-related services to customers across the European Union. The portal emphasized: “The licenses allow both firms to operate across all EU member states under MiCA’s passporting regime, positioning Latvia as a competitive entry point for global crypto and Web3 businesses seeking a regulated base inside the single market.” Latvia is thus taking a path, well-trodden by another Baltic nation, right across its southern border. Lithuania was recently ranked third in digital-asset exchange Bybit’s World Crypto Rankings report for 2025, quoted by Cryptopolitan, and praised as a MiCA hub. Invest in Latvia commented: “Looking at our neighbor … we see what is possible when a country backs innovation with an innovative regulatory framework. Latvia intends to build its own success story.” Over 100 companies in various corners of Europe and the world, from Poland to Japan , are exploring Latvia as potential base for their EU operations, its central bank revealed during the briefing. Five have already submitted their applications, while another 12 are preparing to do so, the regulator added.

The project’s initial funding stage concluded in under two weeks, securing a formidable $500,000 and proving immense early interest. This momentum has intensified in Phase 2, which has now raised an impressive $800,000 from the sale of 13 million tokens . With this stage rapidly approaching its conclusion, market watchers anticipate the imminent launch of Phase 3, signaling a crucial turning point for early participants. Ripple Fortifies, GeeFi Innovates Ripple is strengthening its market position with a landmark OCC approval for a national trust bank, bolstering its RLUSD stablecoin as a compliance leader. While Ripple solidifies its foundation, investors are flocking to GeeFi for its groundbreaking utility. The core of GeeFi’s ecosystem is a state-of-the-art non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX). This platform ensures that users never surrender their private keys, offering a supremely secure and transparent trading environment where assets remain under their absolute control. Further enhancing its value, GeeFi is preparing to launch its Crypto Cards, a revolutionary product backed by payment titans VISA and Mastercard. These cards will empower users to spend their digital assets at millions of retail locations worldwide, seamlessly converting crypto into daily purchasing power. This practical application is underpinned by the GEE token’s deflationary design. A built-in token burn mechanism continuously reduces the total supply, creating inherent scarcity designed to drive value as the platform’s user base expands. A Presale Structure Primed for Monumental Returns The financial incentives of the GeeFi presale are creating a buzz throughout the investment community. During the current Phase 2, GEE tokens are priced at an accessible $0.06 , a figure that stands in stark contrast to the confirmed exchange listing price of $0.40 . This strategic pricing guarantees early backers a 667% return the instant the token debuts on public markets. The long-term projections are even more extraordinary. With analysts forecasting a potential price of $2, a $1,600 investment today could transform into $60,000 , unlocking a staggering 3,233% ROI . The market’s reaction speaks volumes. Having sold over 13 million tokens and raised $800,000 in Phase 2 alone, demand is clearly surging. This intense buying pressure has prompted analysts to predict a swift sell-out of the current phase. Amplifying the excitement are ongoing discussions about listings on premier Tier-1 centralized exchanges, a move that historically ignites dramatic price appreciation for projects with strong fundamentals. Generate Substantial Passive Income with GeeFi Staking GeeFi offers more than just capital appreciation; it provides a powerful engine for generating passive income through its versatile staking program, managed within the intuitive GeeFi Wallet. The platform presents several tiers to match different investor profiles. A flexible, no-lock option provides a generous 10% APR . For those ready to commit their tokens for fixed terms, the rewards are even greater: 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and a remarkable 55% APR for a twelve-month lock . The ecosystem also rewards community builders with a 5% bonus on all funds invested through their referral links. This Is Your Final Call to Get in Early GeeFi is distinguishing itself as a project with genuine 100x potential, grounded in real-world utility and strategic tokenomics. This presale offers a finite window to secure a stake in a burgeoning ecosystem before it captures mainstream attention. As Phase 2 rushes toward its hard cap and a price increase for Phase 3 becomes inevitable, the time to act is now. The powerful combination of guaranteed listing gains and high-yield passive income is generating undeniable FOMO, compelling smart investors to secure their allocation before this opportunity vanishes.

The Ether token failed to hold at multiple support zones throughout November, as it plunged downwards. While Ethereum appears to be gaining bullish momentum to signal an imminent price reversal, a bearish continuation looks like the more probable scenario after the latest decline to $3,000. A popular analyst has recently put forward a prognosis, which paints a worrying picture for the second-largest cryptocurrency. $2,400 Might Be The Next Price Cushion For ETH In a December 13 post on the social media platform X, market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the Ethereum price is showing an interesting sign of a potential bearish continuation over the coming weeks. Martinez’s analysis hinged on the bear flag pattern, a technical analysis pattern that is often used to confirm the continuation of a downtrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Tightens Up: Symmetrical Triangle Converges With High-Timeframe Wyckoff Setup Typically, the pattern has two components — the flag and the flag pole. Price initially displays a sharp downward move, forming the flagpole. Afterwards, there is usually a brief period where the price displays upward movement or even sideways consolidation; this period of choppy price action makes up ‘the flag.’ What gives the flag its integrity is its upper and lower boundaries, which serve as resistance and support zones. Because breakouts beneath support zones typically indicate that the market could be bearish, a failure of the flag’s support would then be the needed confirmation of the earlier-seen sell signal. In the scenario where this happens, the crypto pundit pointed out that Ethereum’s possible target could be the $2,400 price level. This is likely the case because all preceding regions may present with insufficient liquidity to sponsor any significant price reversal. Ethereum Whales’ Realized Price Of $2,400 Comes In Sight — What To Expect Interestingly, on-chain data adds credence to $2,400’s reputation as a relevant price level. In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous pundit, OnChain, revealed that Ethereum is currently happens to be trading very close to a significant price level. According to the analyst, Ethereum whales — with holdings of at least 100,000 ETH — mostly procured their coins close to $2,400. Interestingly, the Ether token barely ever falls to price levels close to the realized price of this group of investors. Since the last five years, there have only been four instances where the ETH price nearly reached the acquisition price of these whales, before eventually seeing major recoveries. If this historical pattern thus plays out, the second-largest cryptocurrency might have seen the beginning of yet another bullish rally. As of this writing, Ethereum holds a valuation of $3,086, reflecting a 4% price decline in the past day.

However, it appears that the firm’s overall view of crypto and the digital asset industry has not changed very much over time. Hence, the reversal of its longstanding position on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seems to be a purely business decision rather than a change in belief. This revelation came from one of the trillion-dollar company’s top executives at a Bloomberg conference on Thursday, December 11. No Evidence BTC’s Technology Offers Economic Value: Vanguard’s Quant Head According to a Bloomberg report, John Ameriks, Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, revealed that the asset management firm’s view of crypto remains unchanged despite recently offering its investors access to Bitcoin ETFs. The senior investment executive likened BTC to a speculative “digital Labubu”—a popular plush toy collectible. Ameriks posited that Bitcoin could be seen as a speculative collectible rather than as a productive asset, as it lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow properties Vanguard typically checks for in long-term investments. The global head of quant said there is no clear evidence that Bitcoin’s underlying technology delivers durable economic value. It is for this not-so-optimistic view of cryptocurrencies that Vanguard has refrained from issuing its own crypto-linked exchange-traded funds . However, the asset management firm welcomed select crypto funds to its platform earlier this month after seeing the successful record of the US-based Bitcoin ETFs since their launch. Ameriks said in a separate interview at the Bloomberg conference: We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion. We’re going to not give them advice as to whether to buy or sell or which crypto tokens they ought to hold. That’s just not something we’re going to do at this point. Nevertheless, the Vanguard global head of quantitative equity did admit that he sees Bitcoin potentially offering non-speculative value in certain contexts. The top executive listed high-inflation environments and periods of political instability as some of such scenarios. Ameriks concluded: If you can see reliable movement in the price in those circumstances, we can talk more sensibly about what the investment thesis might be and what role it could play in a portfolio. But you just don’t have that yet – you’ve still got too short of a history. Bitcoin Price At A Glance The price of BTC has been in a sustained downtrend over the past few months, sitting nearly 30% away from its all-time high of $126,080. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at around $90,380, reflecting an over 2% decline in the past day.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BTC news|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto news|Vanguard,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-13 17:00:47

Fractals capture recurring price structures. XRP, widely used for cross-border payments , is currently forming one of these notable patterns. This fractal has attracted attention because it may define price action into 2026. According to ChartNerdTA, XRP is displaying a fractal that favors bullish scenarios if the multi-month trading range holds. This analysis is based on October 2025 data. ChartNerd identifies a convergence of technical indicators reinforcing a potentially strong upward move. The pattern combines classic chart structures with advanced technical confluences, making it notable for both retail and institutional traders. $XRP : The bulls love this fractal. The bears hate it. Hold the multi-month trading range to keep this play valid https://t.co/A0DN6ftmTU pic.twitter.com/KmMiCyT6qX — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 12, 2025 Symmetrical Triangle Breakout At the core of this fractal is a symmetrical triangle breakout. XRP has spent months confined between narrowing support and resistance levels. This compression signals equilibrium between buyers and sellers. A breakout above the triangle’s upper boundary would indicate buyers’ dominance. Such a move could trigger a sustained bullish phase. Confluence of Technical Signals ChartNerd emphasizes multiple supporting indicators. Retests of the three-month exponential moving average (EMA) validate buyer strength. A Gaussian channel provides visual guidance on probable support and resistance. These signals strengthen the fractal’s bullish thesis. They suggest that XRP buyers are defending key technical layers critical for a continuation move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Fibonacci Extensions and Targets Another important factor is Fibonacci extensions. They project potential price targets after a confirmed breakout. ChartNerd identifies three main levels: $8, $13, and $27 . These levels are derived by extending prior price swings. They provide a roadmap for traders watching the fractal’s progression. Conditions for Bullish Continuation The bullish scenario depends on the multi-month trading range holding. A breach below key support could invalidate the fractal. Falling below the triangle’s lower boundary may trigger deeper corrections. Currently, XRP consolidates near critical support zones, making this pattern technically constructive. Broader Market Context XRP’s fundamentals support optimistic interpretations. Legal clarity, institutional adoption, and on-chain developments enhance long-term confidence. This backdrop strengthens the impact of technical patterns like ChartNerd’s fractal. The combination of fundamental and technical factors provides a compelling bullish narrative. Bulls vs. Bears For bulls, this fractal represents a potential roadmap to strong gains. For bears, it is a structure yet to be broken. Price action will ultimately determine the outcome. Traders should monitor support levels closely to validate or invalidate this fractal.

Investors want extra pay to hold government debt because they see big deficits, firm inflation, and louder fights over central bank independence. Yields on long-dated debt have climbed back to levels last seen in 2009, and traders say this shift is tied to expectations that the cycle of rate cuts is almost done and could soon flip to new hikes in some countries. Investors are worried that politicians do not have plans, or the power, to fix public finances, and they warn that persistent price pressure could limit how central banks react. Traders who move long-term notes say the appeal depends on fixed payments that stretch across decades, and the longer that money sits out there, the more can go wrong. Bonds with terms of 10 to 100 years offer higher interest than short-term bills to make up for that risk. When an economy weakens, yields usually fall because investors expect lower policy rates and smaller returns in stocks. Lately, the US has broken that pattern. The economy is not booming, but it is strong enough to lift share prices to records, while inflation has run hotter than forecasts, and that has pushed long-term yields higher. Governments face pressure as debt climbs Global debt hit $324 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Institute of International Finance. China, France and Germany led the jump. Governments borrowed heavily after the 2008 financial crisis, then borrowed again during the pandemic. That spree was easy when interest rates sat near zero. It got harder when inflation spiked and central banks lifted policy rates. Many of them also slowed or reversed their quantitative easing programs. Some are even selling the old bonds they bought during stimulus rounds, which adds more pressure on yields. Investors say the danger comes if yields stay high while governments fail to fix budgets. Servicing large piles of debt becomes more costly. In the US, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act from President Donald Trump could add $3.4 trillion to deficits over ten years, based on the Congressional Budget Office. Moody’s Ratings cut the last top US credit score in May because the growing debt and deficit may hurt America’s role as a top destination for global capital. Tariffs brought in about $240 billion through November 2025 and narrowed the fiscal gap, but analysts say even if those tariffs survive court fights, they are too small to close it. Politics drive new moves in bond markets Politics have fueled more of the recent swings. Trump has criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates faster. Powell’s term ends in May 2026. Kevin Hassett, who runs the White House National Economic Council, is seen as the top candidate to replace him. Investors expect him to favor Trump’s push for lower rates. Some investors say that risk of political pressure forces them to seek higher yields because a new Fed chair could cut too quickly, spark faster inflation and lift bond yields further. Traders say the rise in term premia reflects these risks. They want stable markets because bonds help balance out more volatile assets like technology stocks. When long yields rise, mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other types of borrowing get more expensive. That can squeeze households and weaken growth. High long-term yields also raise the cost for governments to borrow, which can set off a “doom loop,” where high yields drag economies down and debt keeps growing. Past market pushback forced leaders out, like the fall of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss in 2022, and in the 1990s, bond vigilantes pressured President Bill Clinton to slow debt growth. Japan’s low bond yields once pulled global yields down, but that anchor is gone. In the UK, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been working to show markets she can manage public finances while dealing with tensions inside her party. In the US, investors worry that inflation remains sticky and that new tariffs may add more pressure while also threatening to slow the economy. That mix could force central banks to choose between slowing inflation or supporting growth. Analysts say stagflation is possible if prices rise while output stalls.

He revealed he’s actively purchasing “XRP from now on,” a development analysts interpret as bullish for the XRP price prediction outlook. Crypto Community Reacts to XRP High-IQ Endorsement Popular crypto commentator Gordon noted that when the smartest individual on the planet starts accumulating XRP, it signals that the current $2.00 price stabilization may mark the beginning of a rally toward record highs. The smartest man in the world is buying XRP. XRP is now on Solana too. Is this the start of an XRP rally? https://t.co/cknh70II4z — Gordon (@GordonGekko) December 12, 2025 Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted that barely four weeks after the XRP ETF debut, the regulated product has become the fastest crypto spot ETF to reach $1 billion in assets under management (since ETH) in the United States. Data from Sosovalue shows that over $20 million in XRP inflows are recorded daily since launch, with cumulative inflows approaching $1.2 billion. Analysts at Sistine Research suggest that if XRP continues defending the $2 range support levels and ETF inflows maintain this trajectory, seeing XRP trade around $10-$15 in 2026 wouldn’t be surprising. XRP Price Prediction: $2.40 Pivot Holds the Key for 2026 Rally On the 1-day chart, XRP is consolidating just above the critical $2.00 support following an extended pullback, with price repeatedly defending this zone and establishing a short-term foundation. The $2.00-$2.05 area is functioning as a demand region, and provided it maintains, downside risk remains limited, with the next significant support positioned lower around $1.80. On the upside, the chart clearly demonstrates that the $2.38-$2.40 region represents the crucial pivot point. Source: TradingView This zone has capped multiple recovery attempts and now constitutes the level that must be reclaimed to validate a bullish continuation pattern. Momentum indicators are beginning to stabilize, with the MACD flattening and suggesting a potential bullish crossover, indicating that selling pressure is dissipating. If XRP can break and sustain above $2.40, the structure opens pathways for stronger movement toward $2.81 and subsequently the psychological $3.20 area highlighted on the chart. PEPE 2.0? Pepenode’s Browser Mining Game Raises $2.3M If XRP finally breaks through $2.40 resistance and establishes a new high above $4, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could experience substantial price surges. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite challenging market conditions. It’s a game where you can “mine” coins without needing expensive computer equipment. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining nodes, and upgrade your facilities to earn more tokens . The project is replicating PEPE’s success strategy, which surged massively during XRP’s 400% rally from $0.50 to over $3.50 during the last summer run. Now that more people are starting to purchase Pepenode’s mining rigs, the token price is expected to rise rapidly. To join the presale before the price increases, visit the official Pepenode website and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet. You can buy tokens now for $0.001192 each and pay with crypto coins like ETH, BNB, or USDT. You can also use a regular credit or debit card to complete your purchase in just seconds.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction.

Currently, buyers are dominating, resulting in a surge toward $0.196. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price surges toward $0.196 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price failed to hold below immediate Fib levels. As a result, buyers are now aiming for a hold above $0.196. The 24-hour volume surged to $1.79 million, showing a surged in trading interest today. dYdX is trading at $0.196, surging by over 3% in the last 24 hours. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades around 30.81, hinting that sellers are controlling momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bulls strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are holding the price around the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.4, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.3574 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.3118 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.2855 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.2691 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.2934 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.4314 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.5438 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.2642 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.3040 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.3885 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.4841 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.5536 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.5863 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.6858 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.2687, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.3930. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1794, beginning a bearish trend to $0.0979. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bullish as sellers failed to defend resistance channels. This resulted in a push toward $0.196. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.2 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX The dYdX community has proposed a three-month experimental buyback program, running from November 1, 2025, to January 31, 2026, that will use the protocol’s net transaction fees to repurchase DYDX tokens. The initiative, expected to buy back between $5 million and $10 million worth of tokens, aims to boost token value and assess the protocol’s capital efficiency. dYdX price prediction December 2025 dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.44 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $0.6, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.2. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction December 2025 $0.2 $0.44 $0.6 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.2 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June. By the end of June, dYdX had declined toward $0.41. In July, the token surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain buying demand and dropped below $0.6. In August, dYdX again surged toward $0.76 but declined later toward $0.6. By the end of September, dYdX price declined toward the low of $0.55. In October, the price of dYdX dropped further and touched a low below $0.3. By the end of November, the price of dYdX dropped below $0.23.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|DYDX|WLD|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-13 17:20:08

The pace exceeds early inflow trends recorded by Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs, signaling strong institutional appetite for XRP-linked investment products. Flow data shows inflows have remained consistently positive, with no notable net outflows reported so far. Meanwhile, XRP has continued to trade near the $2 level, a key psychological zone. However, the asset has been weighed down by the broader cryptocurrency market downturn. XRP spot ETF overview. Source: XRP Insights XRP price prediction With the first $1 billion effectively confirmed, attention has shifted to the next potential milestone of $10 billion. In this context, Finbold sought insights from OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which outlined several pricing scenarios. Notably, ChatGPT’s price modeling suggests XRP could undergo a substantial repricing if cumulative ETF inflows reach $10 billion. In a base-case scenario, ChatGPT projects XRP trading between $4.50 and $6. At that scale, ETF holdings would likely absorb an estimated 20 to 30% of XRP’s effective liquid supply, materially reducing sell-side pressure as tokens are locked into long-term custodial vehicles. The projection draws on demand dynamics observed during the early stages of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF adoption, where prices expanded by roughly two to three times after inflows crossed major psychological thresholds. If XRP is trading in the $2 to $2.50 range as inflows accelerate, a similar twofold to two-and-a-half-fold repricing is viewed as structurally reasonable. ChatGPT’s more optimistic outlook places XRP in the $7 to $9 range, contingent on sustained net inflows, declining exchange balances, and a broadly risk-on crypto market . Under these conditions, XRP could enter price discovery, with ETF-driven demand amplified by momentum trading and supply-shock effects. XRP conservative target A more conservative scenario still points to appreciation, with ChatGPT estimating a range of $3.20 to $3.80 if whale distribution offsets ETF accumulation or if inflows slow after the initial surge. Even in this case, ETF demand at the $10 billion level would likely support XRP above prior cycle highs. According to ChatGPT’s analysis, ETF inflows do not linearly move prices. The most significant repricing typically occurs between $3 billion and $8 billion in cumulative inflows, when markets begin to recognize a structural shift in available supply. By the time $10 billion is reached, expectations of future inflows often become the dominant price driver. XRP price prediction.

Technicians analyzing crypto news for today are able to identify that SHIB has a falling wedge, an inverted head and shoulders formation, as well as a bullish divergence. On a different note, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tops the list of cheap cryptos that are now being described as some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy. SHIB Market Situation Shiba Inu has been seen in a noticeable bear trend for a period of a few months now due to a lack of investments by larger investors as well as an emerging market rebalancing. The current stabilization around $0.0000082 has also seen a number of positive technical formations. Also, the presence of bullish divergence for oscillators like RSI and PPO adds further strength to the idea that SHIB has the potential to test $0.000010, which would be around 20% above the prevailing market price. Analysts also point out that the supply available in exchanges has added an interesting twist, where over 53 trillion SHIB has been taken out of exchange supply in the past few days, which has further reduced the float available to 287 trillion. Historically, a sharp decrease in exchange supply has been perceived as a sign of re-positioning of funds among long-term investors. However, traders are also aware of the support zone of $0.00000753, which has been identified as the major determining factor for a negative market mood in the near term, as investors are faced with a challenge of determining which crypto to buy now. Progress of Presale in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been rising swiftly in its presale. The presale has progressed to Phase 6, which now has a price of $0.035. 98% of Phase 6 has been accomplished, and when Phase 7 starts, the value of the token will be $0.04. A total of $19,330,000 has been raised, with 18,450 holders. These developments make MUTM relevant in relation to recommendations for which crypto to invest in. The listing price for this project has been set at $0.06, which would indicate a 300% ROI for those involved in Phase 6. One of the latest features that has been incorporated into the ecosystem of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a leaderboard that showcases the top 50 token holders. This design has proven effective in providing users with better insights. This has been attributed to a project that aims to maintain transparency, especially in its early development life. Buy and Distribute Mechanism Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates on a buy and distribute model, which seeks to align all activities of the protocol with the use of their token. In this model, part of the fees acquired from any form of loan or borrowing operation being carried out in the protocol is used to buy MUTM. These MUTM are then given to mtToken stakers, who are part of the liquidity flow of this protocol. The mechanism works with the aim of developing a closed-loop feedback mechanism, whereby actively using the protocol has a direct bearing on the overall flow of tokens. Market analysts debating which crypto to invest in have highlighted that strategies like these are effectively measured in terms of functionality and sustainability as opposed to mere performance, further confirming the objective format of MUTM. Leaderboard Activity and Community Engagement There is a leaderboard that runs for 24 hours. This leaderboard resets every day at 00:00 UTC. The person with the biggest investment for 24 hours will walk away with $500 in MUTM. This leaderboard also comes with a project analysis system that provides a live feed of all transactions taking place in relation to the presale. All these features fall under community engagement. While SHIB attempts to check for sufficient patterns in their charts to form a potential comeback, Mutuum Finance takes the lead as a top crypto to buy now.

With the current investor interest in the Musk-led venture, SpaceX could raise more than $25 billion with its potential public offering expected to launch next year. According to a letter from SpaceX CFO Bret Johnsen reviewed by Reuters, the company has approved an arrangement where investors can buy shares at $421 each, raising its value to approximately $800 billion. The company is also moving forward with its plans to go public in 2026. Industry analysts project Starlink will generate between $11.8 billion and $15 billion in revenue for 2025. The service operates through a constellation of over 7,500 satellites in low Earth orbit, making it the largest active satellite network ever deployed. Back in July 2025, the company sold shares at $212 each and held a $400 billion valuation. The new valuation would place SpaceX among the top 20 publicly traded companies globally and make it the most valuable private startup in the world, surpassing OpenAI’s recent $500 billion valuation. Elon Musk’s SpaceX valuation In the shareholder letter dated December 12, Johnsen acknowledged that it’s still uncertain whether the IPO will happen and at what valuation, but said that the offering could raise significant capital if the company executes well and markets cooperate. SpaceX could raise over $25 billion in an IPO that could come as early as June 2026. SpaceX’s soaring value is due to its satellite internet business, Starlink. The service grew from 1 million subscribers in December 2022 to over 8 million active customers worldwide as of November 2025, according to multiple reports. This rapid expansion has made Starlink SpaceX’s largest revenue stream, generating $7.7 billion in 2024, approximately 58% of the company’s total revenue. Government contracts contributed about $2 billion in Starlink revenue in 2024, and it’s expected to contribute $3 billion in 2025. The military version, called Starshield, has been extensively used in Ukraine and represents a growing revenue stream for the company. SpaceX is a leader in the commercial launch market thanks to its Falcon 9 rocket and Starship, which is still in development but is described as the most powerful rocket ever built. According to the shareholder letter , SpaceX plans to use IPO capital to increase Starship’s flight rate, deploy AI data centers in space, build Moonbase Alpha, and send missions to Mars. The company recently purchased over $17 billion in wireless spectrum licenses from EchoStar, enabling direct-to-cell service and allowing standard smartphones to connect directly to Starlink satellites without special equipment. SpaceX has partnered with T-Mobile on this technology. Is there an IPO craze? After reaching a peak of 1,035 IPOs in 2021, the public offering market declined sharply, with just 154 IPOs in 2023 and 225 in 2024. The downturn was driven by higher interest rates, inflation concerns, and general market uncertainty. However, after improving financial conditions, easing monetary policy, and strong performance from recent IPOs , the global deal volume of IPOs has increased by 19% YoY. The market has also witnessed an 89% surge in proceeds in the third quarter of 2025. Through the first nine months of 2025, 176 IPOs generated over $30 billion, marking a 20% increase compared to the previous year. September 2025 was the busiest month for new listings since November 2021 as investors poured nearly $8 billion in that single month. Artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure companies have generated particularly strong investor interest in the IPO market this year. The technology, media, and telecommunications sector represented a third of IPO deals and more than half of the proceeds raised in the third quarter of 2025.

According to Reuters, the company told clients in China that it is studying ways to add capacity because orders have gone past its current limits. The push began after U.S. President Donald Trump said the government would let Nvidia export the H200 into China as long as the company pays a 25% fee on those sales. That rule turned the H200 into the one chip every major Chinese firm now wants to secure. Chinese companies jumped on the news fast. Firms like Alibaba and ByteDance contacted Nvidia this week to ask for large batches and requested details on how soon they can get them. Nvidia also allegedly said that it is working to “manage our supply chain to ensure that licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States.” But Chinese approval is still missing. Three people aware of the situation said officials in Beijing held emergency meetings on Wednesday to decide whether the chip will be allowed into the country at all. China weighs approvals and demand pressures Chinese buyers are stressed because supplies are tight. Reuters reported that only very small amounts of H200 chips are being made right now. Nvidia is busy building its Blackwell line and preparing its Rubin line, which has pulled resources away from the H200. China wants answers, and Nvidia has been briefing clients on current supply levels, though it did not give them a hard number. The H200 started mass use last year. It is the fastest chip in the older Hopper family and is built by TSMC using its 4nm process. TSMC did not comment on how much capacity is allocated to Nvidia but pointed back to comments from its chairman C.C. Wei about rising AI demand and how the company plans long-term production. Chinese firms want the H200 because it is the strongest chip they can legally buy. It delivers about six times the performance of the H20, a chip Nvidia designed for China in late 2023 with limits to meet U.S. rules. China is pushing its own chip ecosystem at the same time. Domestic firms have not reached H200-level performance, and that gap has triggered worries that letting the H200 into the country could slow local progress. Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital Partners, said the H200’s compute power is “approximately 2-3 times that of the most advanced domestically produced accelerators.” He added that cloud providers and enterprise users are placing huge orders and lobbying the government to relax restrictions. Demand in China is much larger than what local production can cover. Officials also discussed tying H200 imports to purchases of domestic chips. Two people aware of the talks said the idea is to require buyers to purchase a set amount of local chips for every H200 they import. Nvidia studies new capacity as industry tensions rise Any capacity increase is tricky for Nvidia. The company is shifting to Rubin and competing with firms like Google for limited high-end manufacturing slots at TSMC. Even if Nvidia wants more H200 units, it must fight for room on the same production lines everyone else wants. China is also trying to boost its own chip capabilities through SMIC. The Kirin 9030 chip, used in Huawei’s Mate 80 phones, is built with SMIC’s updated 7nm process. Research firm TechInsights said the chip uses SMIC’s N+3 process, which is a scaled extension of its N+2 node. But it also said the N+3 process is still far behind the 5nm technology used by TSMC and Samsung. China even placed TechInsights on its unreliable entity list in October after the firm published reports on Huawei and SMIC’s progress. Get seen where it counts.

When price action slows, uncertainty replaces conviction, and narratives multiply. XRP is currently navigating such a phase, hovering within a defined range while traders search for clarity. To some, this stagnation suggests weakness. To others, it signals preparation. According to Egrag Crypto, a market analyst known for structure-driven analysis , the latter interpretation carries more weight when viewed through a broader technical lens. The Structural Break That Changed XRP’s Trajectory Egrag Crypto’s outlook begins with a development many market participants overlook. XRP already broke out from a multi-year accumulation base and delivered a clear impulsive move higher. In technical analysis, such a breakout typically marks a regime shift. The market transitions from accumulation, where smart money builds positions, into expansion, where price discovery begins. Once that shift occurs, corrections tend to be pauses within a trend rather than signals of its end. This context is central to understanding XRP’s current behavior. #XRP – 3 to 6 Month Outlook Ignoring the percentages on the formation and focusing purely on market structure, the higher-probability scenario is UP, not down. Here’s why 1⃣Regime Shift Already Happened: #XRP broke out of a multi-year base and printed an impulsive leg.… pic.twitter.com/XN2JwZpO7h — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 13, 2025 Why the Current Range Reflects Consolidation Following its impulsive advance, XRP entered a period of compression . Price has narrowed, volatility has reduced, and directional momentum has temporarily stalled. Egrag Crypto argues this structure aligns with consolidation, not distribution. Distribution phases are usually characterized by aggressive selling and widespread euphoria. XRP’s market structure shows neither. Instead, price appears to be balancing supply and demand, a process often required before the next directional move emerges. EMA Structure Keeps the Trend Constructive Trend indicators further reinforce this interpretation. XRP remains above its long-term 21 exponential moving average, preserving the broader bullish structure. Although price currently trades below the faster 9 EMA, that relationship reflects short-term hesitation rather than structural weakness. According to Egrag Crypto, the trend bias remains bullish as long as XRP continues to close above the 21 EMA on higher timeframes. This alignment suggests the larger trend remains intact despite near-term uncertainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Time Symmetry Strengthens the Bullish Case Historical behavior adds another layer to the analysis. XRP has repeatedly shown a tendency to consolidate for extended periods after major breakouts. These pauses often last several months and serve as preparation for the next expansion leg. Egrag Crypto notes that the current consolidation falls well within this historical timing window. When time symmetry aligns with structure, the probability of continuation increases, provided key levels continue to hold. The Line That Separates Bullish From Bearish Despite the constructive outlook, risk remains clearly defined. Egrag Crypto identifies the $1.80 to $1.60 zone as a critical structural region. A sustained monthly close below this range would invalidate the bullish thesis and shift the market bias bearish. Until such a breakdown occurs, downside scenarios remain secondary to the prevailing structure. Outlook for the Next Three to Six Months Looking ahead, Egrag Crypto maintains that XRP is more likely to move higher than lower over the next three to six months. Volatility is expected, but within a broader digestion phase rather than a topping structure. Market tops rarely form quietly or without emotional excess. In this case, the evidence suggests XRP is not ending a trend, but preparing for its next chapter. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
