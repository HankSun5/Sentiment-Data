After months of anticipation and complex legal proceedings, the team overseeing the FTX bankruptcy process has officially launched the second phase of its repayment efforts. This is a pivotal moment for FTX creditors who have patiently waited to recover assets lost in the exchange’s dramatic downfall. According to reports, this phase is expected to see a substantial FTX distribution of over $5 billion. The initial disbursements are slated to begin within a short window of 1–3 business days from today, marking a tangible step towards resolution for many. What Does This FTX Repayment Phase Entail? This isn’t the first step in the recovery process, but Phase 2 represents a major wave of distributions. The bankruptcy estate, managed by administrators, has been working diligently to locate, secure, and liquidate assets belonging to the collapsed exchange and its affiliated entities, such as Alameda Research. The goal has been to maximize the value available to repay creditors whose funds were frozen or lost. The specifics of this FTX repayment phase include: Significant Capital Outflow: The commitment to distribute over $5 billion indicates the significant progress made in asset recovery and valuation. This figure represents a large portion of the total estimated value available for distribution. Targeted Audience: These funds are specifically earmarked for eligible FTX creditors who filed claims during the bankruptcy proceedings. The complex process involved verifying claims, determining their value (often based on asset prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing in November 2022), and establishing a distribution hierarchy. Initial Timeline: The 1–3 business day window for the start of distributions suggests that the administrative and technical infrastructure for payout is ready. While distributing funds to a large number of creditors is a complex task, this initial timeframe provides a clear expectation for when the process will commence. Method of Payout: Creditors are typically being repaid based on the USD value of their holdings at the time of the bankruptcy filing. While some distributions might involve in-kind crypto where feasible and approved, a significant portion is expected to be in fiat currency or stablecoins, depending on the creditor’s preference and jurisdictional requirements. This helps manage volatility during the payout period. This phase follows extensive work, including asset sales, legal battles, and negotiations to consolidate assets and create a pool of funds for distribution. It’s a testament to the efforts of the bankruptcy administrators and legal teams involved. A Ray of Hope for FTX Creditors? For the thousands of individuals and institutions who had funds locked on FTX, this announcement is more than just a financial update; it’s a moment of potential relief. The past year and a half have been filled with uncertainty, frustration, and financial strain for many. The start of this major crypto payout offers a tangible outcome after a prolonged period of waiting. While the total recovery percentage for creditors is still subject to the final outcome of the bankruptcy process and asset liquidation, the fact that such a significant amount is being distributed in this phase is generally seen as a positive sign. Early estimates and market conditions (particularly the rise in value of some crypto assets held by FTX) have sometimes suggested a potentially higher recovery rate than is typical in large-scale bankruptcies, though this is not guaranteed for all claim types. This step helps to restore some faith in the process, demonstrating that even in the aftermath of a catastrophic failure like FTX, structured legal processes can yield results for affected parties. It moves the narrative from the collapse itself to the active resolution and restitution phase. Navigating the FTX Bankruptcy Update: What Should Creditors Do? With the distribution phase beginning, it’s crucial for FTX creditors to be informed and cautious. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed via Official Channels: Rely exclusively on official communications from the FTX bankruptcy administrators (like Kroll Restructuring Administration) or the court-appointed representatives. Be wary of unofficial sources, social media rumors, or direct messages claiming to facilitate your payout. Verify Your Payout Details: Ensure the payment method and destination you provided during the claims process are correct and up-to-date. If you need to update information, do so only through the official creditor portal or designated channels. Beware of Scams: Unfortunately, major events like this attract scammers. Be extremely cautious of any unsolicited contact (emails, texts, calls) asking for personal information, wallet keys, or fees to ‘expedite’ your FTX repayment. The administrators will not ask for this information via unofficial channels. Understand Your Claim Status: If you haven’t already, log into the official creditor portal to understand the status of your claim, the approved amount, and the expected method of distribution. Consult Financial/Legal Advisors: For complex claims or significant amounts, considering consulting with a financial advisor or legal counsel who specializes in bankruptcy recovery can be beneficial. Patience remains key, as distributing funds to a large number of creditors across various jurisdictions will take time, even after the initial phase begins. The 1–3 day window is for the *start* of the process, not necessarily the completion of all payouts. The Road Ahead for FTX Distribution and Resolution While the distribution of over $5 billion is a massive step, it’s important to remember that the FTX bankruptcy process is incredibly complex. There may be further phases of distribution as more assets are recovered or legal disputes are resolved. The administrators are tasked with maximizing recovery for all creditors, which can involve liquidating a diverse range of assets, from traditional investments to venture capital stakes and remaining crypto holdings. The successful execution of this phase will build confidence in the remaining steps of the resolution. It demonstrates the operational capability of the bankruptcy estate to handle large-scale financial movements and communicate progress to affected parties. The ultimate goal is to conclude the bankruptcy proceedings and provide as much restitution as possible to those who suffered losses. This FTX bankruptcy update is a critical turning point, shifting the focus from the failure of the exchange to the active process of making amends to those affected. While challenges remain, the commencement of this significant crypto payout is a positive development that offers tangible hope to the multitude of FTX creditors around the globe.

His stance directly opposes Mayor Adams, who is famous for his love of crypto. The division on the topic could be settled when the city heads to the polls, as both men are candidates for November’s mayoral election. Mayor Adams is running as an independent, and Lander is the Democratic candidate. Caught up with @NBCNewYork this morning to call out @andrewcuomo for his absurd attempts to rewrite history on his abysmal labor record. I fought DoorDash to deliver a $21 minimum wage, while Cuomo is taking $1M bribes to do their bidding. pic.twitter.com/zrdP5d8FpY — Brad Lander (@bradlander) May 28, 2025 Mayor Adams’ crypto plans may stall if he does not return to office Mayor Adams has been campaigning to make New York City a hub for crypto in the near future and has even set up an advisory council to that end. However, if he is unable to keep his seat as mayor, and a man who believes “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” takes over, there’s no telling what will happen to the things Mayor Adams sets in motion. Lander also believes that “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” Mayor Adams talked about his Bitbond proposal on Wednesday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, a speech that came a week after he hosted New York City’s inaugural crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion. At the event, he reiterated his pledge to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and announced the creation of a digital assets advisory council to “bring fintech jobs and investment right here to the Big Apple.” Lander called Mayor Adams’s proposal “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,” adding that “the current Federal Tax Law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs.” Lander does not buy the crypto hype While politicians like Adams, Francis Suarez, Cynthia Lummis, Andrew Yang, Tom Emmer, Pat Toomey, Ron DeSantis, and Kirsten Gillibrand have all taken a pro-crypto stance, others are either indecisive or suspicious of crypto. Aside from Lander, another famous critic of crypto is Elizabeth Warren . She is outspoken as a crypto critic and is famous for introducing the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023, which aimed to impose strict regulations on crypto transactions to curb illicit activities. She believes crypto is a “preferred tool” for terrorists, drug traffickers, and money launderers, and has made many other interesting claims. Warren’s stance on crypto is shared by Bernie Sanders and both of them have also worked together on regulations to restrict banks’ engagement with crypto, arguing it lacks “real public purpose” and primarily benefits speculators while causing financial losses for others. Sanders also supports measures to limit crypto’s environmental and economic impacts. These politicians who seem to be anti-crypto all share concerns about the industry’s volatility, potential for criminal use, environmental impact, and lack of consumer protections. Lander’s unenthusiastic response to Bitbonds reflects a cautious stance that aligns with broader Democratic skepticism about crypto’s stability and public utility. Landers and the other anti-crypto politicians have been pushing for stricter regulations in hopes that it will address perceived gaps in oversight, a concern Lander echoed in his critique of Bitbonds’ legal viability.

Recently, the TST Memecoin experienced a sharp reminder of this reality, undergoing a significant and sudden drop on major trading platforms, including Binance. This event underscores the inherent volatility and significant Cryptocurrency Risks associated with such speculative assets. What Triggered the TST Memecoin Crash? According to a report by Wu Blockchain shared on X, the Test (TST) memecoin saw a precipitous decline. Specifically, the token plummeted by a staggering 40% to a price point of $0.03456 across both the Binance spot and futures markets. This kind of rapid price movement is not uncommon in the memecoin space, but a 40% drop in a short period certainly grabs attention and causes concern among holders and traders involved in Binance Trading . While the exact catalyst for this specific drop wasn’t immediately clear from the initial report, memecoin crashes can be triggered by various factors: Whale Movements: Large holders selling off significant portions of their supply can overwhelm buy orders and drive prices down rapidly. Sentiment Shifts: Negative news, rumors, or a general shift in market sentiment away from speculative assets can lead to panic selling. Market-Wide Corrections: Sometimes, a memecoin crash is part of a broader downturn in the overall crypto market, driven by macroeconomic factors or regulatory news. Lack of Fundamentals: Memecoins often lack underlying technology or real-world use cases, making their value purely dependent on speculation and community hype. When that hype fades, the price can collapse. Understanding the Impact on Binance Trading The fact that the drop occurred on both Binance spot and futures markets is significant. The spot market reflects the immediate supply and demand for the asset, while the futures market allows traders to speculate on future price movements, often using leverage. A sharp drop like this affects traders in different ways: Spot Traders: Holders on the spot market see the value of their assets decrease directly. Futures Traders: Those with leveraged long positions (betting on the price going up) face potential liquidations, where their positions are automatically closed by the exchange because they can no longer cover potential losses. This can accelerate the price decline. Conversely, those with short positions (betting on the price going down) profit from the crash. The incident highlights the amplified risks involved in futures trading, especially with highly volatile assets like TST Memecoin . The potential for rapid and substantial losses is ever-present. Why Does Crypto Market Volatility Hit Memecoins Hardest? Crypto Market Volatility is a well-known characteristic of the entire digital asset space. However, memecoins often experience volatility to an extreme degree. Why is this the case? Unlike established cryptocurrencies with developed ecosystems or Bitcoin’s status as a digital store of value, memecoins derive their value primarily from community hype, social media trends, and speculative trading. This makes them incredibly susceptible to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. A viral tweet can send the price soaring, while a large sell-off or negative rumor can cause a rapid Memecoin Crash . Their low prices and high circulating supplies also mean that relatively small amounts of capital, compared to larger cap coins, can cause significant percentage swings in price. This low barrier to entry for price manipulation (intentional or unintentional) contributes to their extreme volatility. Navigating Cryptocurrency Risks in the Memecoin Space The TST incident serves as a stark reminder of the significant Cryptocurrency Risks present, particularly within the memecoin niche. For anyone considering or currently involved in trading these assets, understanding and mitigating these risks is paramount. Key Risks to Consider: Risk Type Description Impact on Memecoins Market Volatility Prices can change drastically and rapidly. Extreme price swings, potential for rapid crashes (like the TST Memecoin Crash ). Liquidity Risk Difficulty buying or selling large amounts without significantly affecting the price. Sudden large orders can cause disproportionate price drops or spikes. Rug Pulls/Scams Project developers abandon the project and steal funds. Complete loss of investment. High risk in unverified memecoins. Sentiment & Hype Driven Value based on social media trends and community excitement. Price is highly unstable and can collapse if hype disappears. Lack of Fundamentals No underlying technology, use case, or revenue stream. Value is purely speculative, making long-term holding risky. Actionable Insights for Traders on Binance (and Beyond) Given the inherent risks, especially with assets prone to a Memecoin Crash , what steps can traders take, particularly when engaging in Binance Trading or on other platforms? Strategies to Consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are investing in, even if it’s a memecoin. Look for community strength, developer activity (though often limited), and understand the tokenomics. Risk Management is Crucial: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Memecoins are highly speculative. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically sell your position if the price drops to a certain level, limiting potential losses during a sudden crash like the one seen with TST Memecoin . Avoid Excessive Leverage: While futures trading offers the potential for high returns, leverage magnifies losses during volatile swings. Be extremely cautious with leverage, especially on memecoins. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into one highly speculative asset. Spread your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies. Beware of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Don’t buy into a coin just because it’s pumping. You might be buying at the peak right before a crash. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources (like Wu Blockchain) and community sentiment, but verify information before acting on it. These strategies are not guarantees against losses, but they are essential tools for navigating the unpredictable landscape of Crypto Market Volatility and mitigating Cryptocurrency Risks . The Broader Picture: Crypto Market Volatility Remains While the TST specific event is noteworthy for its severity, it’s a symptom of the larger reality of the crypto market. Price swings of 10%, 20%, or even 40% in a day are not unheard of, especially further down the market cap ladder. This volatility is driven by a confluence of factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. Successful navigation of this environment requires a long-term perspective, robust risk management, and continuous learning. Summary: Lessons from the TST Memecoin Crash The recent 40% plummet of TST Memecoin on Binance serves as a potent case study in the extreme volatility and significant Cryptocurrency Risks inherent in the memecoin market. It highlights how quickly fortunes can change for those involved in Binance Trading of such assets. Understanding the factors contributing to a Memecoin Crash and implementing strict risk management strategies are vital for anyone venturing into this highly speculative corner of the crypto world. While the potential rewards can be high, the risks, as demonstrated by TST, are equally substantial.

Priced at $0.00000035 per token, investors receive 80% bonus tokens upon purchase. The Ethereum Price Sets Sights On $4,000 Amid Growing Bullish Momentum. Currently down 45.8% from its December 2024 peak of $4,000, the Ethereum price has arrived at a key resistance point. With limited historical barriers beyond this point, conditions appear favorable for the Ethereum price to move toward $4,000. A bullish continuation pattern is forming, hinting that another impulsive leg upward for the Ethereum price may be just around the corner. Crypto analyst Astronomer, in a lengthy post, emphasized the long-term inverse relationship between the Ethereum price and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). He noted that with the DXY dropping significantly, the Ethereum price is likely to range high, possibly reaching $4,000, calling the setup “flawless.” Trump Coin Faces Steep Decline As Retracement Threat Persists The Trump Coin surged in the lead-up to a fancy dinner hosted by President Donald Trump. Some investors spent nearly $150 million for access; however, prices dropped by 16% immediately after the event within hours. The Trump Coin reached a high of $16.50 before the May 23 black-tie gala but quickly fell back to $12.76 soon after. Technical charts show several large wallets sold a significant amount of the Trump coin right after the event. Crypto Analyst Kamil suggests that unless the Trump coin breaks above $15 again, a retracement risk remains high. Without a unique technology or use case, the Trump Coin value may struggle to hold its ground. As hype fades post-event, investors are moving on.

This declaration isn’t just a statement; it signals a renewed focus on a contentious area of US trade policy that has significant implications beyond borders, potentially even rippling into financial markets watched closely by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Understanding the Trump Tariffs and the Trade Court Battle When we talk about Trump tariffs , we’re referring primarily to the duties imposed during his presidency under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (citing national security concerns, mainly on steel and aluminum imports) and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (in response to unfair trade practices, notably targeting China). These tariffs sparked significant opposition, leading to legal challenges in various courts, including the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The trade court battle involves complex legal arguments. Opponents argue that these tariffs were unlawfully imposed, exceeding presidential authority or violating procedural requirements. The government, under Trump, defended them as necessary measures to protect domestic industries and national security. The ongoing legal disputes center on the scope of presidential power under these trade statutes and whether the executive branch followed the correct legal procedures. Here’s a simplified look at the key legal fronts: Section 232 Cases: Challenges against tariffs on steel and aluminum, often arguing they weren’t truly based on national security or that the process was flawed. Section 301 Cases (China Tariffs): Lawsuits contending these tariffs were an unauthorized escalation of trade disputes beyond the scope of Section 301’s original intent or that the process lacked proper public notice and comment. Constitutional Challenges: Some cases touch upon the separation of powers, questioning whether Congress improperly delegated too much tariff authority to the President. Why is Winning the Court Battle So Crucial for Trump’s Political Strategy? Donald Trump’s political identity is heavily intertwined with his ‘America First’ economic agenda, where using tariffs as a tool for negotiation and protection was a centerpiece. Vowing to win the court battle isn’t just about the legal outcome; it’s a critical part of his ongoing political strategy . Securing legal victories would: Validate Past Actions: A court win would retroactively legitimize a core policy of his presidency, allowing him to claim vindication against critics who argued his tariffs were illegal or poorly implemented. Empower Future Policy: Winning sets potential precedents that could provide a stronger legal basis for implementing similar or expanded tariffs if he were to return to office. Reinforce Political Narrative: It aligns with his message of being a strong leader willing to fight for American workers and industries against foreign competition and perceived unfair practices. It’s a way to demonstrate resolve and commitment to his base. Maintain Leverage: While the specific cases might pertain to past actions, the legal principles at stake could influence the executive branch’s power regarding trade measures, impacting future negotiation leverage. This isn’t merely a legalistic stance; it’s a strategic move aimed at shaping public perception and solidifying his policy credentials ahead of potential future political endeavors. Challenges and Hurdles in the Trade Court Battle Despite Trump’s confident declaration, winning these legal challenges is far from guaranteed. The trade court battle presents significant challenges and legal hurdles: Legal Arguments Against Tariffs: The core of the opposition’s case often rests on challenging the statutory basis or the implementation process. For Section 232 tariffs, opponents question whether the national security justification was genuine or merely a pretext for economic protectionism, which is typically outside the scope of the act. For Section 301 tariffs, arguments often revolve around whether the actions taken directly addressed the ‘unfair practices’ identified and whether the process adhered to administrative law requirements, such as providing adequate opportunity for public input. Judicial Scrutiny: While courts often grant deference to the executive branch on matters of foreign policy and national security, this deference is not unlimited. Courts will examine whether the executive branch acted within the authority granted by Congress and followed the procedures mandated by law. Judges are tasked with interpreting complex trade statutes, and different panels of judges can arrive at different conclusions, leading to appeals and prolonged litigation. Precedent and Interpretation: Trade law is a specialized and often complex area. The outcome of these cases can depend heavily on how judges interpret specific phrases within decades-old statutes and how they apply existing legal precedents regarding executive power and administrative procedure. Novel arguments or interpretations could sway decisions. Winning requires successfully defending the administration’s interpretation of its authority and demonstrating that all legal procedures were correctly followed, a task made difficult by the complex and often controversial nature of the tariff decisions themselves. What is the Potential Economic Impact of the Tariff Court Outcomes? The outcome of the trade court battle carries potential implications for the economy. While specific impacts are debated among economists, here are some potential areas of influence: Certainty vs. Uncertainty: A definitive ruling, whether upholding or striking down the tariffs, could reduce uncertainty for businesses. If tariffs are upheld, companies that adjusted supply chains or absorbed costs might see the status quo confirmed. If struck down, it could lead to refunds of duties paid (potentially billions of dollars) and a reversal of trade flows, requiring new adjustments. Industry Competitiveness: Industries that benefited from tariff protection (like domestic steel and aluminum producers) could face renewed foreign competition if tariffs are removed. Industries that were harmed by retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports could see markets reopen. Consumer Costs and Inflation: Tariffs are taxes on imports, often leading to higher costs for consumers or businesses that use imported goods. Removing tariffs could potentially lower costs, while upholding them maintains this upward pressure on prices, contributing to inflationary concerns. Global Trade Relations: The legal outcome could influence the U.S.’s standing in global trade negotiations and its relationship with key trading partners. A ruling that limits presidential authority might necessitate a different approach to trade disputes in the future. For those watching the broader markets, including cryptocurrency, significant shifts in trade policy or large-scale refunds/impositions of duties could add to macroeconomic volatility, which sometimes correlates with movements in digital asset prices, although this link is indirect and complex. Exploring the Broader Implications for US Trade Policy The legal fight over Trump tariffs is more than just about past duties; it’s about the future of US trade policy . The court’s decisions will help define the boundaries of executive power in using tools like Section 232 and Section 301. Potential Outcomes and Their Effects: Tariffs Upheld: This would affirm broad presidential authority under these statutes, potentially making it easier for future administrations (including a potential second Trump term) to implement similar unilateral trade measures. Tariffs Struck Down: This would constrain presidential power, potentially forcing future administrations to rely more on congressional action or international trade bodies like the WTO (despite its current challenges) to address trade grievances. Mixed Rulings: Courts might uphold some tariffs while striking down others based on the specific legal arguments, leading to a more nuanced definition of executive trade authority. The outcome will be closely watched by trade partners, international organizations, and businesses worldwide, as it will signal how the U.S. government can and will likely use its trade levers in the years to come. This foundational aspect of economic interaction is a key factor in global stability, which in turn, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean? While this trade court battle might seem distant from the day-to-day world of cryptocurrency, understanding its potential ramifications offers valuable insights: Monitor Macro Trends: Pay attention to how major economic policy disputes like this progress. Outcomes could influence inflation, supply chain stability, and overall market sentiment – factors that can indirectly affect the crypto market. Understand Political Influence: Recognize that political strategies and legal battles over economic policy are interconnected. Trump’s vow highlights how trade remains a potent political tool, and its use can create volatility or shift economic landscapes. Diversification Awareness: The uncertainty generated by such high-stakes legal and political battles underscores the importance of understanding diverse market drivers and potentially considering diversification strategies, whether within crypto or across different asset classes (this is not financial advice, merely an observation on market dynamics). Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources covering trade law and economic policy. Understanding the potential legal precedents being set can provide context for future government actions impacting the economy. The declaration by Trump to win the court battle is a reminder that fundamental economic policies are still being shaped and challenged through legal and political means, with consequences that can extend into various facets of the financial world. Conclusion: The Stakes of the Tariff Court Battle Donald Trump’s pledge to secure victory in the ongoing legal challenges against his administration’s tariffs underscores the significant stakes involved. This isn’t just about past policies or collecting duties; it’s a pivotal trade court battle that will help define the future scope of presidential authority in setting US trade policy . The legal complexities, combined with the potential for substantial economic impact on industries, consumers, and global trade relations, make this a closely watched issue. For Trump, winning is also a crucial element of his ongoing political strategy , aiming to validate his ‘America First’ approach and position himself for future influence. While the direct link to cryptocurrency might seem tenuous, the broader implications for economic stability, market volatility, and the global political landscape are factors that informed participants in any market, including digital assets, should consider. The outcome of these legal battles will contribute to the complex web of forces shaping the economic environment for years to come.

For industry participants, the lack of a defined framework has created uncertainty and hindered innovation. However, a recent development on Capitol Hill is sparking optimism, particularly within companies navigating this complex landscape. Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at Ripple, has voiced strong support for a newly introduced bill, signaling a potentially pivotal moment for Crypto Clarity in the United States. Why the CLARITY Act is a Potential Game Changer for US Crypto Regulation On X (formerly Twitter), Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty lauded the introduction of the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , commonly referred to as the CLARITY Act , in the U.S. Congress. He described the bill as a significant stride towards establishing comprehensive rules for digital assets in the country. His sentiment, “Clarity shouldn’t be controversial — and this bill moves us closer to a smart, workable framework,” encapsulates the industry’s deep-seated desire for regulatory certainty. But what exactly is the CLARITY Act and why is it being hailed as such a crucial step forward? At its core, the bill aims to provide much-needed definitions and guidelines for digital assets, particularly concerning the distinction between a commodity and a security. This has been a major point of contention and the source of significant regulatory confusion, leading to enforcement actions and uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Here are some key areas the CLARITY Act seeks to address: Defining Digital Assets: Establishing clear legal definitions for different types of digital assets. Regulatory Jurisdiction: Providing clarity on which regulatory body (like the SEC or CFTC) has oversight over specific digital asset activities. Market Structure: Offering guidance on how digital asset markets should operate under U.S. law. How Does the CLARITY Act Address Industry Concerns? The existing regulatory environment in the U.S. for cryptocurrencies has often been criticized for being fragmented and relying on enforcement actions rather than clear rules. This has led to what many perceive as regulation by enforcement, making it difficult for companies to innovate and operate with confidence. For a company like Ripple , which has been embroiled in a high-profile legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of its XRP token, the call for clarity is particularly resonant. Stuart Alderoty’s comments reflect the industry’s frustration with the current state and its hope that legislative action can provide a more predictable path forward. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act aims to provide a framework that could potentially: Reduce regulatory uncertainty for businesses operating in the digital asset space. Foster innovation by providing clear rules of the road. Offer greater protection for consumers and investors by establishing clear market standards. What Are the Challenges and the Path Ahead for Crypto Clarity? While the introduction of the CLARITY Act is undoubtedly a positive development and a significant step towards comprehensive US crypto regulation , the legislative process is often lengthy and complex. The bill will need to gain traction, navigate committee reviews, and secure votes in both the House and the Senate before potentially becoming law. Furthermore, achieving true Crypto Clarity will likely require ongoing dialogue and collaboration between lawmakers, regulators, and industry participants. Different stakeholders may have varying perspectives on how digital assets should be regulated, and finding a consensus can be challenging. Stuart Alderoty’s statement highlights the importance of this legislative effort but also implicitly acknowledges that it is just one piece of the puzzle. The industry will be watching closely to see how the bill progresses and whether it can indeed deliver the smart, workable framework that is desperately needed. In conclusion, the introduction of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , championed by figures like Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty, represents a beacon of hope for those seeking a more defined and predictable regulatory landscape in the United States. While challenges remain, the bipartisan effort signifies a growing recognition in Congress of the need for legislative action to bring much-needed Crypto Clarity to the digital asset market. It is a crucial step that could pave the way for greater innovation, investor protection, and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies under a clearer regulatory umbrella.

At its current entry price of just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI is attracting comparisons to Ripple’s early days, when low-priced tokens with practical applications had the scope to dominate the market. With analysts projecting its value could hit $1 by Q4 2025, this fledgling token is offering a potential 100x return for investors eager to get in early. But what sets Ruvi AI apart, and could this truly be the next crypto giant? What makes Ruvi AI stand out? Unlike many cryptocurrencies driven by hype, Ruvi AI is rooted in real-world utility. The token leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to solve problems across industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. While Ripple gained recognition for revolutionizing cross-border payments, Ruvi AI aims to bring similar transformation to its chosen fields. Its practical applications include: Healthcare: Automating diagnostics, enhancing operational efficiency, and reducing costs. Logistics: Optimizing supply chain networks by identifying bottlenecks and improving performance. Finance: Strengthening fraud detection and boosting transactional security through AI-driven solutions. By focusing on utility from the outset, Ruvi AI has positioned itself as much more than a speculative asset. It’s a technology platform designed to impact industries that are increasingly dependent on innovation. Breaking records with its presale Ruvi AI’s market presence has already made waves. During its record-breaking presale, the project sold over 130 million tokens and raised an impressive $1.4 million, highlighting strong investor confidence in its potential. This early success, combined with an accessible starting price of $0.015, has laid a strong foundation for further growth. Strategic partnerships strengthen Ruvi AI’s prospects Ruvi AI recently announced a collaborative partnership with Weex Exchange, a significant step in its roadmap. This partnership bolsters its visibility and enhances trading accessibility, making it easier for new and seasoned investors to trade Ruvi AI tokens. Strategic alliances like this echo Ripple’s early successes with institutional partnerships that cemented its credibility and fueled adoption. Weex Exchange’s robust trading ecosystem allows Ruvi AI to expand its market reach while offering investors a seamless trading experience. Such a partnership not only ensures liquidity and stability but also reinforces Ruvi AI’s commitment to strategic growth. Ripple vs Ruvi AI: how they compare Ripple made headlines in its early days for introducing a blockchain solution that simplified international transactions, gaining adoption across banks and financial institutions. Ruvi AI echoes this sentiment by addressing inefficiencies across crucial sectors like healthcare and logistics, where the need for intelligent automation is growing more urgent. However, while Ripple eventually faced legal and regulatory hurdles, Ruvi AI operates in a landscape shaped by lessons learned from its predecessors. Its emphasis on compliance, utility, and functionality positions it as a strong contender to avoid similar pitfalls. Boosting returns with VIP investment tiers Ruvi AI isn’t just making waves with its utility and partnerships. Its VIP investment options are attracting numerous investors eager to maximize their returns. These tiers provide lucrative bonuses designed to reward early participants. Here’s how they work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens = 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07/token = $4,900. Value at $1/token = $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens = 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07/token = $15,680. Value at $1/token = $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens = 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07/token = $89,600. Value at $1/token = $1,280,000. For investors seeking exponential returns, these options create a clear incentive to back Ruvi AI early in its lifecycle. Is Ruvi AI the next big thing? Cryptocurrencies with low entry points and tangible use cases often generate long-term success, provided they can back up their potential with real outcomes. Ruvi AI combines the accessibility of an affordable token with the strategic vision of a technology designed for impactful applications. Its collaboration with Weex Exchange, robust presale performance, and projected valuation of $1 by Q4 2025 make it one of the most talked-about tokens today. Ripple’s meteoric rise stemmed from its early focus on streamlining finance. Similarly, Ruvi AI’s focus on solving inefficiencies across multiple industries positions it for comparable, if not greater, success. Final thoughts At just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI offers an opportunity that’s hard to ignore. Drawing comparisons to Ripple’s early days is not just a testament to its potential but also its readiness to redefine how modern industries utilize AI and blockchain. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, Ruvi AI’s commitment to utility, innovation, and strategic growth makes it a compelling case for the future.

With $277 million raised, over 21.6 billion coins sold, and a price of $0.0262 in batch 28, the momentum keeps building. The clock is ticking on its limited-time $0.0018 price, available only until June 13, creating a rush for buyers eager to lock in the best deal. Add in the exciting Buyer Battles, where top contributors are rewarded daily, and it’s clear why BlockDAG is being talked about as a 10,000x opportunity. This is more than just a presale, it’s a race. Why BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Are a Game Changer BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles add a new layer of excitement to the presale experience. Instead of simply buying coins, participants are ranked daily based on how much BDAG they accumulate, with the leaderboard resetting every 24 hours, and the top buyer of the day gets any unsold amount of a 150 million BDAG daily pool. The result? A thrilling, competitive atmosphere where top buyers get rewarded, and everyone has a chance to rise to the top. This strategy goes beyond just creating buzz, it builds a community. Buyers aren’t just holding; they’re actively engaging in a race to outdo each other, and that competitive energy drives momentum.

This comes just as the analyst predicted that the altcoin could hit a $1.5 trillion market. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $22 As Bullish Candle Forms In an X post, Egrag Crypto predicted that candle 13 on the yearly chart could be the breakout candle that sends the XRP price to $13 or $22. He also raised the possibility of the altcoin surging above these price levels, with a wick extending even higher. Based on his analysis of Candle 9, the 2021 yearly candle, the analyst noted that Candle 13 points to a target of around $17. Related Reading: XRP Holds Midline Support That Has Led To Breakout In The Past, Why $2.9 Could Be Next Egrag Crypto remarked that this aligns perfectly between $13 and $22 for the XRP price. He also commented on Candle 12, noting that it was the strongest Bullish Engulfing pattern. This engulfing process started from Candle 5 and continued through Candle 11. The analyst added that the body of these candles closed above all previous candles, which is a “classic bullish sign.” It is even more bullish when it occurs on a yearly or 12-month chart, as in this case. Commenting on the current XRP price action, Egrag Crypto stated that the noise is still loud on the high timeframes. He noted that the body of Candle 13 is above $1.85, and the wick extends up to around $3.40. The analyst claimed that a close below $1.85 could mark the end of the bull run, while a close above $3.40 confirms that XRP is heading to double digits. Interestingly, the crypto analyst declared that December 31 this year will be a date to remember in XRP history. He remarked that market participants will see where the XRP price stands and what kind of candle formations are shaping up for the legendary year. XRP At A Critical Level In an X post, Crypto analyst CasiTrades noted that the XRP price has returned to the $2.25 range, which is one of the most important levels on the chart. She stated that this zone has acted as both resistance and support since the $0.50 breakout, and now a proper backtest is underway. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Could Shoot To $12 Soon The analyst revealed that the smaller timeframes show that this level could hold. However, she warned that higher-timeframe confirmation is key and that the XRP price needs daily closes above $2.25 to confirm a bullish pivot. CasiTrades added that whether or not this is the final pivot, this level remains a high-probability zone for buyers. She noted that the next major support is at $1.90 if this $2.25 support fails. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.21, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Cardano Eyes a Rally & Tron Trends Upward,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-presale-hits-8-2-million-cardano-eyes-a-rally-tron-trends-upward/,"Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Unstaked each offer a different path for crypto utility, and all three are showing potential heading into 2025. TRX’s current price activity remains steady, holding above $0.20. If the resistance barriers near $0.30 and $0.45 are cleared, there’s a path toward $0.73 that analysts are beginning to take seriously. Cardano’s recent 20% push to $0.74 has brought it back into the spotlight despite recent community issues. But Unstaked , the AI-focused project priced under a cent, has already started showing real traction. Now in stage 17 of its presale, priced at $0.01043, and projecting a launch price of $0.1819, it could deliver a 2,700% return for early participants. TRON’s Stablecoin Progress Raises Eyes Toward $0.73 Goal TRON (TRX) has maintained strong momentum by staying above the $0.20 range, and some market watchers suggest that a climb toward $0.73 is possible if it can push past the hurdles at $0.30 and $0.45. TRON’s increasing use in DApps and its fast-speed infrastructure have made it attractive for those following scalable networks. Consistent growth in developer interest and active users on TRON helps strengthen this outlook. Still, success depends on TRX breaking through technical resistance. For those following projects with steady user adoption and network development, TRON remains in focus as the market moves toward 2025. ADA’s Price Targets Take Shape Despite Community Tensions ADA’s rebound to $0.74, following a notable 20% climb, has stirred fresh speculation about its ability to rise to $2.80. Experts point to $0.85 as the next key resistance, and if that’s surpassed, the possibility of further gains becomes real. Much of this optimism is based on Cardano’s consistent focus on research-backed growth and development. However, allegations linked to a $600 million ADA issue, though denied by founder Charles Hoskinson, have caused some uncertainty. Still, ADA’s stability and technical strength keep it in the conversation as a contender for higher returns. Unstaked: Growing Fast, Still Below a Cent, With AI Agents Coming After Launch Unstaked is building a platform meant to support creators and marketers in growing their reach using AI. Users will be able to design their own AI agents to manage engagement across platforms like Telegram, X, and Discord. These agents will post, respond, adapt, and improve based on data in real time. As confirmed in its whitepaper, the agents will go live after the presale ends and the platform launches. Now in stage 17, Unstaked is priced at $0.01043, with an expected listing price of $0.1819. This creates a projected return of 2,700%. With $8.2 million already raised, the platform is gaining attention rapidly. What makes Unstaked stand apart is how directly it connects its features with user benefits. Access to automation tools and platform utilities is linked to ownership, offering creators a powerful edge. As more digital brands look for faster ways to grow and stand out, Unstaked is becoming one of the most practical plays in Web3. At under a cent, this price range might not last much longer. Final Takeaway! TRON is showing strong technical structure, and Cardano continues to push upward through mixed sentiment. Both are advancing, but Unstaked brings something fresh: a product ecosystem about to go live. The crypto presale price is still just $0.01043, with a target launch price of $0.1819 and over $8.2 million already raised. With its unique AI angle and post-launch agent rollout, Unstaked is positioning itself as a serious contender for big gains in 2025. While TRX and ADA navigate the broader market, Unstaked is moving forward with clear momentum.

Recent market reports show structural optimism returning across the crypto sector, with macro players forecasting bullish patterns not just for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for platforms with deep real-world functionality. While VeChain focuses on supply-chain impact and Hedera inches closer to becoming a top Ethereum alternative, a lesser-known name— Qubetics —has shocked the market by surpassing 514 million $TICS tokens sold and $17.5 million raised in its ongoing presale. It’s this emerging trio that many are now calling the most potential crypto lineup of the quarter. And while Hedera’s HBAR is getting serious attention thanks to unique technical upside projections, and VeChain strengthens partnerships across logistics and ESG, Qubetics introduces a modular infrastructure with an on-chain tokenization marketplace that may reshape how physical and digital assets get exchanged in Web3. Each of these projects is riding its own wave of traction—whether technical, institutional, or community-driven—offering completely different angles for what the most potential crypto could actually look like in a complex 2025 market. So what sets Qubetics apart? Why does its presale price rise by 10% every single Sunday? And how exactly are Hedera and VeChain leveraging their latest expansions? Let’s break down the details. Qubetics Builds a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace That Solves What Others Couldn’t Qubetics isn’t another generic altcoin. It’s Web3’s first fully integrated aggregator, uniting the functionality of several top blockchains into one interoperable hub. But what truly defines its application is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace—a cross-chain protocol that enables real estate, commodities, luxury goods, and even private equity shares to be securely tokenized, bought, and sold. That alone is making it stand out as a most potential crypto candidate among seasoned market watchers. Imagine a small real estate firm in Miami. With Qubetics, they can tokenize fractional ownership of properties and offer them to global participants without involving centralized intermediaries. Or consider a collectibles startup in Los Angeles that wants to create transparent, tamper-proof NFT records tied to physical luxury watches. Qubetics provides the infrastructure to bridge those assets with on-chain smart contracts across Solana, Polygon, and Ethereum—all within one dashboard. That’s not theoretical. That’s what the Qubetics ecosystem is built for. With tokenized assets becoming a high-demand vertical for both retail and institutional participants, Qubetics’ use case aligns perfectly with the next chapter of Web3. It takes what traditional platforms promised—but couldn’t scale—and gives it frictionless, audited functionality. That alone gives $TICS the kind of narrative momentum typically seen in projects that later end up among the most potential crypto leaders of the cycle. Qubetics Presale Stats and ROI Forecasts Signal Why It May Be the Most Potential Crypto Now Right now, the Qubetics presale is in its 36th stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.3064. Over 27,300 participants have joined the Qubetics presale, pushing the total raise past $17.5 million and confirming demand through the sale of more than 514 million tokens. What makes this even more exciting for early adopters is that every presale stage lasts just 7 days, and price jumps by 10% at midnight every Sunday, creating a clear incentive structure for early entries. And here’s where the ROI math gets compelling. If $TICS hits just $1 after the presale, that’s a 226.32% return. But analysts are looking far beyond that, projecting scenarios where Qubetics reaches $5 to $15 following its Q2 2025 mainnet launch. If $TICS reaches $5, the ROI becomes 1,531.58%. At $10, returns expand to 3,163.16%, and a $15 milestone would deliver an eye-watering 4,794.74% ROI. Consider a simple $100 buy-in right now. At a $15 post-launch price, that same $100 would turn into $4,894.74—and the momentum suggests that possibility isn’t far-fetched. It’s this kind of structured growth opportunity that has community members dubbing it the best crypto pre sale of 2025. And with 10% weekly jumps, missing a Sunday could mean missing a major discount. Hedera Forecasts a Faster 5x Growth Than Ethereum In a detailed analysis published by Brave New Coin, Hedera’s native token HBAR is forecasted to grow 5x faster than Ethereum based on its efficient consensus model, sustainability, and active enterprise-grade integrations. Unlike typical proof-of-work platforms, Hedera utilizes the hashgraph consensus mechanism, which dramatically boosts speed and scalability while keeping costs low. That alone has drawn interest from institutions tired of ETH gas fees and throughput bottlenecks. One of the key signals in the report is Hedera’s institutional alignment. It is governed by a council that includes tech giants like Google, IBM, LG, and Boeing, ensuring both trust and innovation at the enterprise level. With over 33 council members and consistent mainnet transaction growth, Hedera’s infrastructure supports high-value apps in DeFi, gaming, and carbon offset markets. From a technical standpoint, HBAR’s fundamentals and adoption metrics suggest an exponential curve, especially as the market prepares for a post-Ethereum-scaling era. These factors combine to place Hedera as not just a competitor—but potentially one of the most potential crypto projects if its growth continues at this pace. VeChain Boosts Enterprise Ecosystem With X Node Upgrade In a recent update published by Binance Square, VeChain’s foundation has activated new X Node benefits to incentivize long-term participation and expand enterprise use. This strategic change increases node rewards and unlocks new staking options, directly targeting the network’s most active backers. These upgrades come as VeChain’s roadmap aligns deeper with real-world enterprise logistics, ESG tracking, and carbon footprint transparency. What makes this interesting is the dual-token economy of VeChain—VET for value transfer and VTHO for gas—which is being optimized through ecosystem upgrades to enhance scalability and reduce congestion. Additionally, with partnerships across the automotive, food safety, and logistics industries, VeChain is being looked at by stakeholders in Europe and Asia as a compliance-ready solution for blockchain-based supply chain traceability. From a tokenomics and corporate engagement standpoint, VeChain’s current positioning is more mature than many altcoins in its tier. And with structural upgrades and governance improvements underway, VET is re-entering expert watchlists as a most potential crypto—especially among ESG-conscious communities and real-world business platforms. Why These 3 May Be the Most Potential Crypto Trio to Watch This Quarter In a market that’s regaining its footing, these three projects represent a powerful blend of innovation and execution. Qubetics is bringing real-world asset tokenization to the forefront while climbing its presale ladder with clear ROI modeling and strong momentum. Hedera, backed by elite corporate nodes, is forecasted to outpace Ethereum in speed and efficiency, which could trigger a large-scale narrative shift. VeChain, meanwhile, is tapping into the tangible enterprise world, reinforcing its supply chain relevance while rolling out strategic upgrades. Together, they’re not just riding hype—they’re anchoring real-world utility to the blockchain promise. And that’s why Qubetics, VeChain, and Hedera are currently regarded among the most potential crypto opportunities on the table. Whether you’re searching for the top crypto presale , an enterprise-driven protocol, or a green, scalable layer-1, this lineup covers all bases. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the most potential crypto in 2025? Qubetics, Hedera, and VeChain are considered the most potential crypto projects due to their real-world applications, presale growth, and enterprise-grade infrastructure. How much can $100 grow in Qubetics presale? At a $15 post-launch price, a $100 investment in Qubetics presale could grow to $4,894.74 based on current ROI projections. Why is Qubetics called the best crypto pre sale? Due to weekly 10% price hikes, strong real-world applications, and over $17.5M raised, many participants call Qubetics the best crypto pre sale opportunity of the year.

Yet as the court weighs its options, new artificial intelligence rivals may already be chipping away at Google’s dominance faster than any judge’s ruling could take effect. A key issue at trial has been the rise of AI tools that appear to be eroding Google’s lead in the search engine game. Mehta is set to hear final arguments this Friday from the Justice Department and Google on remedies meant to boost competition in search. His ultimate decision could also shape how AI services gain ground in the search market. The Justice Department, which sued Google in 2020, wants sweeping changes. It has urged the court to force the company to sell its Chrome browser, restrict it from paying Apple to remain the default search engine, and require it to share its search data with competitors. Regulators say these strong steps are justified by a legal benchmark set more than 20 years ago, when the government attempted to break up Microsoft. “All three of the DOJ’s major remedies are aimed at helping generative AI providers take share from Google,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at TD Cowen. Mehta has indicated he plans to issue his ruling in August The search engine giant counters that the government’s proposed fixes go too far and would cause irreparable damage to its business. Holding about 90% market share of online search queries in the U.S., the company has suggested a narrower approach: tweak its agreements with Apple, Mozilla, and Android to carve out space for rivals. The tech firm says it will appeal the judge’s ruling. Each year, the company pays roughly $20 billion to Apple for default placement in Apple’s Safari browser. Any change to that arrangement could erase billions from Apple’s profits. Mehta is weighing whether to stop Google from sharing revenue with Apple under the current deal, which could change how Google is embedded in the Safari browser. Lawyers and experts warn that his decision may also influence future contracts among tech giants over how AI features are featured on their platforms. The Justice Department is against Google paying Samsung and Motorola to pre-install Gemini In court, the Justice Department pointed to Google’s more recent efforts to dominate AI-driven search. According to testimony, Google has begun paying Samsung and Motorola to pre-install its new AI system, Gemini, on their devices. The department argues that this practice aims to capture the next wave of internet search and should be banned. Shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, fell sharply this month after an Apple executive testified that Google searches in Safari had declined for the first time in nearly twenty years. The same executive said Apple plans to offer AI options such as ChatGPT or Perplexity in Safari within the following year. Google responded in a blog post, saying that overall searches for Apple devices and services have actually risen. “A formidable question that hovers over the entire proceeding is how should the judge take account of emerging developments and the technology that affect the fortunes of all of these companies,” said William Kovacic, a professor of antitrust law at George Washington University and former FTC chairman. During the trial, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, testified that Google aims to finalize a distribution agreement with Apple by midyear. Under that deal, Apple would tap Google’s own AI model and chatbot, Gemini, to answer user queries—an option Apple already offers using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Last week, Google announced the U.S. launch of “AI Mode,” a new way to respond to searches with conversational answers rather than the familiar list of blue links. It represents the biggest overhaul of its search engine in years and is powered by Gemini. Google has been steadily improving Gemini , which supports AI Mode and other features across its products. Although Gemini’s user base has grown in recent months, it still trails ChatGPT in popularity.

Speaking at a U.S. Steel facility in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, Trump told an applauding crowd of employees that he had a “major announcement.” He said the higher tariff would “secure the steel industry in the United States” and warned that no one would be able to “get around that” new tariff rate. “We are going to be imposing a 25% increase,” Trump explained. “We’re going to bring it from 25% to 50%, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States. Nobody’s going to get around that.” He added that he had considered setting the rate at 40%, but industry leaders persuaded him to go further. “At 25% they can sorta get over that fence,” Trump said. “At 50% nobody’s getting over that fence.” Trump’s move builds on the sweeping tariffs he first imposed on March 12, when he set a 25% tax on all steel imports and a 10% levy on aluminum. At the time, Canada responded with its own duties, and American auto makers warned of higher costs. The European Union also announced countermeasures, which it later dropped. On Friday, Trump praised those original measures, claiming they saved the U.S. steel sector from collapse. He said that without the first round of tariffs, “all steel would have been foreign-made and factories would have closed.” Analysts warn that steel prices may increase due to the tariffs Still, analysts warn that higher levies could push up prices for steel, a critical material in construction and manufacturing, two industries Trump has said he wants to strengthen. Since March, the price of domestically produced steel has climbed, as American mills no longer face as much competition from abroad. A 2023 report by the International Trade Commission looked back to when Trump applied steel tariffs in 2018, finding that U.S. steel output did rise, but costs climbed for cars, tools, and machines. Those higher expenses cut production in affected industries by more than $3 billion in 2021, the agency said. Trump is using a law known as Section 232, which lets the president impose tariffs on imports deemed a threat to national security. Last year, the U.S. bought $31.3 billion worth of iron and steel. Canada topped the list at $7.6 billion, according to Commerce Department figures. Later in his remarks, Trump turned to another issue: the sale of U.S. Steel to Japan’s Nippon Steel. During his 2024 campaign, he had opposed the deal, and President Joe Biden had blocked it, citing security concerns. But Trump said he came to believe Nippon could save the company and keep jobs in America. “U.S. Steel was being sold into foreign hands with no protections for our great steel workers,” he said. “And I said there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen. I was watching over you.” But he added that Nippon and U.S. Steel leaders kept improving the terms. “They kept asking me and I kept rejecting them: No way, no way, no way,” he said. “Every time they came in, the deal got better and better and better for the workers.” A key change was a so-called golden share that gives the U.S. government a say in company decisions. “I’m going to be in Washington; I’m gonna be watching over it,” Trump promised.

He invited several employees onstage, and they spoke about the challenges the industry had faced. They thanked him for his actions. “This is going to be a very big day,” Trump told the workers. “This is going to be one of the biggest days in your life.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-30 23:59:56

Crypto Liquidations Have Surpassed $712 Million Over The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, chaos has occurred on the derivatives market following the volatility Bitcoin and the company have gone through during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet Below is a table that shows how the liquidations have looked for the cryptocurrency sector within this window. As is visible, almost $712 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure from their platform in the past day. About $477 million of these came during the last twelve hours alone. Bitcoin and the altcoins, especially, have seen a decline in this period, so it’s not surprising to see that the liquidations have overwhelmingly affected the long investors. More specifically, the holders betting on a bullish outcome have been involved in more than 90% of the flush. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze, and given the sharp imbalance toward the bulls, this particular event would be called a long squeeze. During a squeeze, a large amount of liquidations get triggered at once and feed back into the move that caused them. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations, making such events quite volatile. As for which of the individual tokens contributed the most to the long squeeze, the heatmap below shows it. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, have also come out on top in this list, with the former observing liquidations of $221 million and the latter that of $116 million. The third-ranked coin, however, hasn’t been XRP, but rather Solana, which is a couple of spots lower in terms of market cap. SOL’s $32 million in liquidations may be down to the fact that it has seen a larger decline than XRP. While Bitcoin has seen a push down during the past day, its downfall actually started much earlier, with the high around $112,000 from May 22nd acting as the top so far. According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this peak coincided with a spike in whale activity. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which tells us about how many whale-sized transfers are occurring on the BTC network every day.

It would appear that both versions of this metric (tracking transactions valued at more than $100,000 and $1 million) surged to a high level earlier in this month, a potential sign that profit-taking from these humongous entities forced Bitcoin toward a top. Bitcoin Price BTC saw a dip under the $105,000 level earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has since observed a small rebound as it’s now back at $105,800.

Data-breach hunter Jeremiah Fowler says he found an unprotected database of exactly 184,162,718 login records across more than 47 gigabytes of data. Fowler says a small sample of records he analyzed contained 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. The trove of data also includes Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, X, WordPress, Yahoo, and many other types of login info, reports Wired , adding that all of the data in its entirety has now been taken down. With the scope of information that was exposed, Fowler says the victims are now vulnerable to several kinds of attacks, including corporate espionage, phishing and social engineering, account takeovers, and more. He also mentions that government entities appeared to be included in the hack. “I saw numerous .gov accounts from countries around the world. These could be a serious potential risk if any of those compromised accounts had security clearance to sensitive areas of the state networks or data.” The exact origins of the database are unknown, but Fowler notes that the password field was labeled as “Senha,” which is “password” in Portuguese. Fowler says he believes it’s “highly possible” that a cybercriminal is to blame, calling it by far the most reasonable explanation for the massive collection of login data. According to Fowler, the length of time that the data was exposed and whether anyone else accessed the files remains unknown.

Rather than opting for a 19b-4 process for traditional ETF filings, REX Shares chose the 40-Act filing under the Investment Company Act 1940. This structure circumvents the protracted job of obtaining regulatory approval from the SEC and should expedite the launch in the market. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared this news on social media and confirmed the details about REXShares’ filing. BIG NEWS: @REXShares just filed an effective prospectus for Solana and Ethereum staking ETFs to list here in the US. Don’t know launch date but could be within the next few weeks. These are 40-act funds with a unique structure and do not go through the 19b-4 process pic.twitter.com/cqUCWlFAZW — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 30, 2025 The move is a major development in the growth of cryptocurrency investment products in the United States. Rex Shares uses C-Corp and Cayman subsidiaries to speed ETH & SOL staking ETFs Each fund will utilize a C-corporation structure, a rare choice in the ETF industry, to facilitate participation in staking activities while adhering to regulatory standards. The funds will gain exposure to ETH and SOL through wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiaries that will acquire and stake the cryptocurrencies. The launch date is uncertain, but Seyffart says these ETFs could be added within the next few weeks. Today’s filing comes in the wake of the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, having recently affirmed that staking through a PoS-based network is not considered securities. Commenting further on the Rex Shares filing, James Seyffart noted that it was a smart move “As you can see in screenshot above. They will be getting their spot exposure to ETH and SOL via Cayman subsidiaries. All of this, assuming they launch in near future, is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory work-arounds to get these products to market,” he said in the X post. SEC delays on spot crypto ETFs push Rex Shares to take alternative route Rex Shares opting for this not-so-traveled path is likely an indirect result of the United States not approving any crypto spot ETFs to date. The SEC recently delayed decisions on Grayscale’s Avalanche and Cardano spot ETF applications. This halt affects Grayscale’s work to transform its Avalanche Trust into a spot ETF and a similar application for Cardano. The SEC began the 240-day statutory review period of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF proposal in February, and expectations remained high as the deadline neared. Prediction markets like Polymarket put the odds at about 71%, suggesting investors were highly optimistic. However, the anticipation would be dampened by the delay. The SEC has also reopened comments to elicit feedback from the public, therefore continuing to assess both regulatory and market impact considerations. In related news, the SEC moved WisdomTree’s XRP spot ETF proposal to the next stage in the review process. The solicitation of comments is requested through public notice regarding investor protection and potential market manipulation concerns. This proposal is made pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B), which shows that continued review is appropriate. It would be one of the first spot XRP ETFs approved in the US if passed. Nasdaq has also filed a Form 19b-4 to list and trade shares of the 21Shares Sui ETF on its exchange, representing the launch of the initial regulatory review period. This comes after 21Shares filed an earlier S-1, signaling its interest in providing institutional exposure to the SUI token. Meanwhile, SUI — the native asset of the Sui network — saw a mere 2% price bump following the filing news. But it currently trades around $3.32, a drop of roughly 6.9% in keeping with the broader market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Cross River Bank reportedly holds all bank accounts associated with the payment system. The Good news for the XRP community is that Cross River Bank has been a Ripple partner since 2014, providing real-time international payments. This connection was brought to the community’s attention by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a prominent crypto proponent on X, who highlighted the bank’s role in the development of X-Money. JUST IN: ELON MUSK TO LAUNCH 𝕏-MONEY WITH ALL BANK ACCOUNTS HELD BY CROSS RIVER BANK! CROSS RIVER BANK ALREADY INTEGRATED RIPPLE FOR REAL-TIME INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS! #XRP X MONEY https://t.co/6NaoNRfdSU pic.twitter.com/IMz61LvRYT — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 30, 2025 Musk has recently confirmed that a limited-access beta version of the payment system will launch soon. For many in the XRP community, this is a significant moment, as they have long advocated for XRP to be used in Musk’s financial platforms. The presence of Ripple-enabled banking infrastructure at the core of X-Money’s backend raises new questions about the possibility of XRP becoming a part of the global payments functionality Musk is building. Ripple’s Relationship With Cross River Bank Ripple’s collaboration with Cross River Bank began in September 2014, when the bank announced its adoption of the Ripple protocol to offer real-time international payments. According to a blog post published by Ripple, Cross River Bank became one of the first U.S. banks to integrate the Ripple network. The goal was to provide instant, secure, and compliant cross-border transactions, particularly between the United States and Western Europe. Many experts believe XRP can lead an instant payment revolution , and this partnership shows the asset’s potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Will Musk Integrate XRP? Ripple technology enables financial institutions to send funds in any currency in real time, without the need for reserve funding. It is built to provide a fast, low-cost, and secure settlement layer that complies with regulatory standards. Suppose Cross River Bank is serving as the foundational banking partner for X-Money. In that case, this creates a clear pathway for Ripple technology, particularly XRP, to become part of the broader payment architecture on X. Recent rumors suggest that Musk will integrate XRP into the new payment system. Although the billionaire has not confirmed these rumors, the infrastructure is likely in place to make it happen without requiring major changes. Grok, Musk’s AI-powered chatbot, has named XRP as the best asset for cross-border payments . Meanwhile, Ripple’s enterprise-grade systems have already proven with Cross River Bank. The conditions for potential XRP use in X-Money are aligned, and if Musk approves this integration, it could change the digital asset landscape.

Lander warned that using volatile crypto assets to fund infrastructure and housing projects could undermine investor confidence in the city’s debt. Political tensions escalate as Lander (a mayoral candidate) positions himself as a fiscal pragmatist against Adams’s crypto-friendly agenda. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander has rejected Mayor Eric Adams’s proposal to issue municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin, calling the idea both “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” Lander, who shares responsibility for the city’s debt issuance alongside the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, made clear that the city will not pursue any crypto-backed borrowing while he remains in office. Bitbond Battle Brews in NYC as Election Rivals Clash Over Crypto Policy Lander said in a statement on Thursday that “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” according to a report by Bloomberg. He added, “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander opposed Mayor Eric Adams’s proposed Bitcoin-backed municipal bond (Bitbond) plan, calling the idea “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” He noted that under U.S. tax law, municipal bonds cannot be used to purchase cryptocurrencies or… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 The response follows remarks made by Mayor Adams on Wednesday during his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . Addressing a crowd of crypto enthusiasts, Adams called for the creation of a “Bitbond,” expressing his intention to make New York a national leader in crypto innovation. “We need to have a Bitbond, and I’m going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York,” Adams said. “If it grows in New York, it will cascade through the entire country.” The mayor’s comments come just a week after he hosted the city’s first crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion . There, he unveiled a digital assets advisory council designed to boost fintech investment and job creation in the city. But Lander pushed back hard on the idea. He pointed to legal and regulatory constraints that limit how municipal bonds can be issued and used. According to him, the city can only issue debt for specific public purposes and must do so in compliance with federal tax law. “The current federal tax law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs,” Lander said. He also emphasized that the city does not have any system in place to handle infrastructure financing in cryptocurrencies or to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars. Adams, who is seeking re-election this November as an independent, did not respond to requests for comment. Lander, a Democrat and a candidate for mayor himself, made clear that under his watch, Bitcoin-backed bonds won’t be part of the city’s fiscal strategy. With both candidates positioning themselves for November, the clash over crypto policy could become a defining issue in the race. Mayor Echoes Trump’s Crypto Playbook Amid Growing Political Embrace of Digital Assets Mayor Adams is doubling down on crypto as part of his re-election campaign, echoing Donald Trump’s strategy from last year when Trump vowed to make the U.S . the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump’s actions included issuing an executive order to create a digital asset task force and hosting the White House’s first crypto summit in March with top industry executives. Trump Hosts First White House Crypto Summit President Donald Trump hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, a landmark event bringing together top industry leaders, regulators, and government officials together. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 14, 2025 Adams, recently cleared of corruption charges by the DOJ, a move that sparked backlash and resignations, has now become a prominent face at crypto events. In Las Vegas, he spoke at the industry’s largest conference alongside figures like VP J.D. Vance and Senator Cynthia Lummis. These events, once dominated by industry leaders, now increasingly feature political figures. At a side event hosted by Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, Adams appeared again, showing a long-standing relationship dating back to his Brooklyn days. Last fall, Pierce even co-hosted a fundraiser for him in Puerto Rico. Adams has championed crypto since his 2022 mayoral campaign, famously converting his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum . Now, NYC is forming a digital asset advisory council to explore launching a “Bitbond.” A similar federal initiative, proposed by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, suggests bonds partly backed by Bitcoin for a potential strategic reserve.

With major players like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) cooling off after strong rebounds, new altcoins with low market caps and disruptive potential are beginning to steal the spotlight. While ETH and SOL continue to dominate in terms of utility and infrastructure, they may offer more modest upside compared to fast-rising Mutuum Finance, which are drawing interest for their exponential ROI potential. Mutuum Finance presale has raised more than $9.5 million and attracted over 11,400 participants, ahead of a token price rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 100% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. In a shifting market where crypto investing is increasingly focused on value-entry points, MUTM is quickly becoming a go-to option for those looking to get in early on the next big cryptocurrency. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.5 million and accumulated 11,400 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its launch price of $0.06. Certik Audit Finalized: Mutuum Finance Strengthens Position in DeFi Lending The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while consolidating its market position. A Certik smart contract audit has now been officially completed, and the results shared across various media platforms boosting investor confidence in the project. With this milestone, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. Gamified Leaderboard Engages the Community In addition to securing community ties, Mutuum Finance has established a leaderboard feature which displays the top 50 token holders in real-time. Bonus tokens will be received by the top 50 ranks, which becomes an entertaining, game-like incentive for users to move up and hold their positions. It is a smart merge of DeFi mechanics and community involvement. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance continues to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its growing investor community. To award early investors Mutuum Finance platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. One of the revolutionary aspects of the Mutuum Finance model is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. The Buy-and-Distribute mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction as the next altcoin to watch, with over $9.5 million raised and 11,400+ investors already in. With a current presale price of $0.03 and a launch price of $0.06, early buyers could see 100% gains, plus more if post-launch momentum continues.

With institutional money flowing back into digital assets and key tokens making sharp upward moves, the hunt for the best performing crypto today is heating up. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, some of the strongest action is happening just outside the top spot. From altcoins with real-world use cases to presale tokens with aggressive entry points, momentum is building fast. This list covers four names pulling serious attention right now, Web3 ai , TRON, Binance Coin (BNB), and XRP, each offering different entry angles for traders and investors looking for real upside. Whether it’s AI-powered innovation, high-speed chains, DeFi backbone tokens, or utility coins ready for an ETF breakout, these tokens are showing why they’re being tagged as the best performing crypto today. Let’s break it down starting with the project making early buyers rethink their entry levels, Web3 ai . 1. Web3 ai: Whales Are Buying at $0.000402 Web3 ai has already crossed $5.8 million in its presale and is currently priced at just $0.000402 per token in Stage 7. That alone is pulling in traders. But what really sets it apart is what comes next, $WAI unlocks a full suite of AI crypto tools on launch. These tools include trading bots, portfolio optimizers, and fraud detection modules that plug directly into real trader workflows. With a listing price locked at $0.005242, just entering the presale gives early buyers over 1,747% ROI baked in. It’s no surprise whales are front-running the crowd on this one. While the $777K giveaway might get retail attention, high-volume wallets are clearly stacking $WAI for its long-term potential. Web3 ai is gaining traction fast as the best performing crypto today, not just for the price action, but for what it offers post-launch. With AI dominating headlines across industries, this is one of the few tokens offering usable AI crypto products. If $WAI hits its projected $4 price in the coming years, missing the $0.000402 entry will feel like watching history from the sidelines. No fluff, just clear tokenomics, roadmap execution, and use-case-driven hype making Web3 ai the best performing crypto today right now. 2. TRON: Volume Surge and Expanding Use Case TRON (TRX) is currently trading at $0.2779, backed by a 24-hour trading volume of $590 million and a market cap of over $26 billion. That’s a strong signal of renewed interest, especially considering how consistently TRON’s ecosystem has expanded in 2024 and into 2025. The network continues to show reliability for hosting decentralized applications and stablecoins, with growing integration in digital identity platforms and data storage layers. TRON’s high-speed throughput and low fees keep attracting developers, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. With new partnerships forming around enterprise-level integrations, TRX isn’t just another old name hanging around, it’s being used. It’s already outperforming many tokens that were quiet just a few months back, putting it squarely on the radar as one of the best performing crypto today . The technical structure also supports short-term upside, with analysts noting buy-side strength around the $0.27–$0.30 range. It may not carry meme coin excitement, but in terms of steady market traction, TRON is making a very real case. 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Strong Utility, Stronger Price Action BNB is back in the spotlight with a current price around $684.75 and a market cap near $96.5 billion. While that size may make it seem less explosive compared to smaller cap coins, its recent performance tells another story. With daily trading volumes at $1.8 billion and consistent exchange-driven burn mechanisms tightening supply, BNB has been pushing up charts steadily. What makes it one of the best performing crypto today is that its demand is real. Traders need BNB for fee reductions, launchpad access, and liquidity provisioning across the Binance ecosystem. As Binance continues to expand its footprint into new regions and launch new financial tools, BNB scales right alongside. Analysts are pointing to $750 as the next resistance zone, and strong exchange inflows suggest BNB might be on that path faster than expected. The asset’s blend of utility, low volatility compared to peers, and firm institutional trust makes it more than just a coin, it’s a core trading asset in 2025. 4. XRP: ETF Buzz and Institutional Backing Fuel Momentum XRP is trading around $2.30 with volume surging past $2.6 billion in 24 hours. That’s big on its own, but with the launch of CME XRP futures and ETF speculation on the table, the entire XRP price structure is being reevaluated. Analysts are tracking short-term targets near $5, with longer-term expectations floating as high as $27 depending on how the institutional setup unfolds. With that kind of upside potential in play, it’s no stretch to call XRP one of the best performing crypto today. What makes XRP especially compelling right now is the alignment between retail buzz and institutional tools. With the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve considering XRP, and regulatory paths clearing up post-lawsuit, traders are starting to re-enter positions they exited long ago. The support range near $2.25 is holding firm, while futures open interest builds. Whether you’re day-trading patterns or watching ETF headlines, XRP is flashing signals that can’t be ignored. Summing Up In a market full of noise, some names are showing real substance, and those are the tokens making moves. Web3 ai is leading the pack with its aggressive crypto presale pricing and AI-powered utility suite, positioning itself as the best performing crypto today from both a retail and whale perspective. Meanwhile, TRON is gaining renewed momentum with increased use case adoption and transaction volume. Binance Coin (BNB) continues to prove why real-world utility and platform dominance matter in market cycles. And XRP is recharging its narrative with fresh institutional interest and bullish technical signals. Whether you’re looking for an early-stage gem or a large-cap with stable momentum, each of these projects is showing why they belong on your radar as the best performing crypto today. The market is moving, fast. And sitting on the sidelines means missing out. Entry windows don’t stay open forever. Choose wisely, and time it right.

Bitcoin Could Hit $200,000 This Year Speaking from the perspective of a macro quant hedge fund operator, Edwards was unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, stating, “If the data stays in the current trend we’re in, I think $150–200K is definitely possible this year.” The founder of Capriole, a fund known for pioneering on-chain valuation models like Hash Ribbons, Energy Value, and the Macro Index, grounded this forecast in a web of interlocking technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming “We’re printing new all-time highs on daily and weekly closes,” Edwards noted. “As long as we stay above $104K as long as the Macro Index trends up, and US liquidity continues to rise, this environment is very bullish.” Capriole’s proprietary Macro Index—a machine learning model aggregating over 100 inputs from Fed liquidity to bond and equity markets—has turned decisively positive. Bitcoin’s rally, Edwards emphasized, is further reinforced by metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Hodler Growth Rates, and Energy Value, all signaling room for expansion. But while Bitcoin shows strength across multiple dimensions, altcoins are telling a very different story. The Death Of The Old Altcoin Cycle Edwards refrained from naming specific altcoins but delivered a clear macro verdict: the capital flow dynamics have changed, and altcoins are no longer on an equal footing with Bitcoin. “Structurally, things are quite a bit different this cycle […] the biggest driving forces are Bitcoin ETFs and US policy. That’s creating a centralizing effect—funneling capital directly into Bitcoin,” he explained. He pointed to the historical cycles of retail-led altcoin rallies, followed by catastrophic drawdowns—often exceeding 99% losses. “Retail has just gotten destroyed,” he said bluntly. “There’s a fatigue in the altcoin space that wasn’t there four or five years ago.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock The legacy of failed ICOs, broken tokenomics, and events like the FTX collapse have left lasting scars. Meanwhile, institutions are avoiding the risks and complexity of smaller-cap digital assets, opting instead for regulated Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. “It used to be more of a level playing field. That’s no longer the case,” Edwards said. “The real money is flowing into Bitcoin—and that probably continues for a while.” When Will Altcoins Wake Up? Despite the grim tone, Edwards does not dismiss altcoins entirely. He views a strong altcoin cycle as conditional—not impossible, but dependent on clear Bitcoin dominance first. Using Capriole’s Speculation Index and Crypto Breadth models, which track the relative strength and price movement of altcoins, he made a key observation: “Right now, only 5% of altcoins are above their 200-day moving average. That’s not bullish.” He compared the current setup to late 2020, when Bitcoin surged from $10K to $60K before altcoins began outperforming. That rotation required Bitcoin to first breach previous all-time highs decisively. “You want Bitcoin to hit something like $140K while alts are still underperforming. That would be the ideal setup […] that’s when capital begins rotating downstream,” he explained. Conversely, if altcoins begin pumping prematurely, while Bitcoin remains range bound, Edwards sees that as a top signal. “That’s usually the last puff of air,” he warned. Cycles Are Changing, Risks Are Evolving Beyond price action, Edwards questioned the relevance of traditional halving cycles. He argued that the impact of miners—once the primary driver of Bitcoin supply dynamics—has diminished significantly due to ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign actors like Michael Saylor. “That four-year cycle is dead—or at least dramatically weaker. Miners are now just 2–3% of the total supply flow. The real drivers today are institutions,” he said. This evolution reduces the probability of 80% drawdowns and increases the risk of systemic leverage—particularly from publicly traded Bitcoin-heavy firms. While not an immediate concern, Edwards sees potential for long-term vulnerabilities if major players overextend. Edwards also discussed diversification within Capriole’s portfolio. While Bitcoin remains the firm’s core allocation, he revealed exposure to quantum computing equities like IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D-Wave (QBTS), and QUBT. “I think quantum is like Bitcoin in 2015. It’s early, it’s volatile, but the long-term CAGR could be even higher than Bitcoin’s.” He added that gold also plays a strategic role, not as a replacement but as a hedge. Capriole monitors the gold-to-equity ratio closely, and its breakout above the 200-day moving average is seen as a historically bullish signal—both for gold and Bitcoin. In closing, Edwards urged investors to tune out most of the financial news cycle. “Probably 99% of headlines don’t matter,” he said. Instead, focus on game-changing shifts: Fed pivots, global liquidity expansions, and true structural reconfigurations of capital flow. “We’re wired to overreact to bad news. The key is to filter it down to a few macro drivers that actually move the market—and Bitcoin right now has those working in its favor.” Until altcoins show meaningful breadth and break their long-term resistance structures, Edwards’ message is clear: Bitcoin will soar. Altcoins won’t—at least, not yet. At press time, BTC traded at $105,557.

Analysts suggest the move employs strategic regulatory workarounds to bypass conventional SEC procedures. Unique Structure Behind the REX ETFs According to ETF analyst James Seyffart, the REX filings utilize an unusual structural classification. “These ETFs are structured as c-corps. Which is very rare in the ETF world,” he explained on May 30. REX confirmed that the fund would be taxed as a C-corporation, meaning both current and deferred tax expenses will be factored into the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV). This model deviates from the norm and raises questions about its implications for investors. Staking as a Missing Puzzle Piece Staking has been one of the most anticipated features for spot Ethereum ETFs since their debut in July 2024. Many industry executives believe the absence of staking has made these products incomplete. ETF Store President Nate Geraci called REX’s approach a “regulatory end-around” and expressed confidence in their imminent launch. Bypassing the SEC’s Traditional Path Seyffart noted that the REX funds are 40-act funds and thus avoid the usual 19b-4 regulatory review process. This is a critical workaround, particularly in light of the SEC’s recent delay on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its own Ether ETF. “This was one way to get some level of signoff from the SEC,” Seyffart said. Fund Mechanics and Market Entry REX’s proposed ETFs will gain spot exposure to Ether and Solana through Cayman-based subsidiaries. The structure is designed to allow staking of at least 50% of each token, marking a significant shift from earlier offerings. Seyffart added, “All of this, assuming they launch in the near future, is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory workarounds to get these products to market.” The launch, though not yet dated, appears imminent based on regulatory patterns and market positioning. BlackRock Perspective Adds Weight On March 20, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, described their own Ether ETF as a “tremendous success.” However, he admitted the lack of staking made the product “less perfect.” The addition of staking capabilities is seen by many as essential for ETFs aiming to fully capture the benefits of Ethereum and Solana’s proof-of-stake networks. The developments from REX could potentially open the floodgates for similar fund structures, signaling a new phase of innovation in crypto-linked investment vehicles.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-31 01:30:29

45311723,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738180,1748655966,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45311723.jpeg,Ripple CLO backs CLARITY Act to clear crypto chaos,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-clo-backs-clarity-act/,"Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, has publicly endorsed the newly introduced Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act). He calls it a significant step toward establishing a clear and consistent regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. Alderoty argued that “Clarity shouldn’t be controversial” and that the bill would allow for a practical and intelligent regulatory environment . The Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer thanked some prominent lawmakers for their role in leading the charge. This list includes Representatives French Hill, Congressman Glenn Thompson, Angie Craig, the GOP Majority Whip Dusty Johnson, Don Davis, Bryan Steil, Ritchie, and Davidson. Their work underscores the need for new regulatory guidelines that can be spun up and revised quickly as the digital assets space accelerates. Rep. Bryan Steil released the following statement regarding the CLARITY Act on X. The post mentions that the bill is designed to bring clarity to digital assets during this golden period. Supporters of the bill are united by a desire to enable the digital assets sector to expand by establishing a trustworthy and predictable set of laws. Right now, businesses and investors are often uncertain about which of their activities may delay the future of the industry. Bipartisan CLARITY Act redefines crypto oversight Introduced on May 29, 2025, by members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, the CLARITY Act seeks to clarify the regulatory roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding digital assets. The bill is looking to categorize most cryptocurrencies as virtual commodities overseen by the CFTC rather than as a security regime, as is the current practice of the SEC. With the rising use of digital assets, now is a good moment for such a move. This is because their increasing adoption and market maturity offer opportunities for broader economic integration. The rising use of these assets is also a concept shared by MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor . Alderoty noted the bill’s significance in bringing “long-overdue clarity” to the digital asset landscape. The bill, he said, takes the industry closer to a “smart, workable framework” that creates an equilibrium between innovation and consumer protection. CLARITY Act safe harbor advances as Ripple calls for clear crypto rules The CLARITY Act also introduces a four-year safe harbor provision for primary token offerings if the underlying network reaches a “mature blockchain system” status and the total raise stays below $75 million during any 12-month window. Alderoty also supported the CLARITY Act, as Ripple remains committed to advocating for regulatory clarity regarding the cryptocurrency industry. He has sent a letter to the SEC requesting the commission to clarify when a digital asset ceases to be an investment contract . Not all of them, he contended, should be subject to the same securities regulations — especially not on secondary market transactions — and he offered a safe harbor to shield compliant crypto issuers from enforcement risk. As XRP regains attention as a top crypto buy with the Ripple SEC lawsuit nearing resolution, uncertainty lingers following SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s recent “New Paradigm” speech. Ripple’s letter directly responds to the pivotal question posed in the speech: “When does a digital asset separate from an investment contract?” Ripple referenced established securities law analysis from legal experts like Lewis Cohen in its response. Cohen’s analysis contends that current US investment contract law does not consider routine transfers of most fungible crypto assets in secondary markets as securities. With the CLARITY Act, the US may finally start taking concrete steps to provide regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. While the bill gets consideration in the legislative committee, its passage would lay a benchmark for the future of how US regulators will oversee digital assets.

He spoke after Ripple handed over the “Skull of Satoshi” artwork at the 2025 Bitcoin conference. Larsen said the gift was a way to recognize progress and to build a better rapport between the two camps. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?

The plan didn’t pan out as he had hoped. Still, Larsen seemed upbeat about moving past that setback. He made clear Ripple itself didn’t put any cash into the drive. In early 2023 when I funded the “Change the Code” campaign, my goal was to see if there was a way to turn Bitcoin into an accelerator for direct air capture. The campaign didn’t work, and that’s ok!

That includes wind, hydropower and even nuclear energy. Miners have also tapped into waste gas projects, turning flared natural gas into fuel for their rigs. Five years ago, those numbers were far smaller. Today, the shift shows that Bitcoin can clean up its act without rewriting its code.

The Skull will now have a permanent home at the Bitcoin Museum in Nashville. pic.twitter.com/Eo3kNqRvGp — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 Skull Of Satoshi Donation At yesterday’s conference, Ripple formally handed the skull sculpture to the wider Bitcoin community. The gesture was more than a photo-op. It signaled that Ripple wants to ease the tension between XRP supporters and Bitcoin purists. In the past, the two groups have sparred over fees, speed and now environmental impact. By giving away an artwork meant to spark debate, Ripple is saying, “Let’s talk, not fight.” Call For A United Crypto Front Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined in the show of goodwill. He called on all crypto players to pull together. He urged regulators to carve out clearer rules, and asked industry insiders to focus on serving the unbanked. Garlinghouse stressed that XRP and Bitcoin fans have more in common than they might think. He said it’s time to unite against outside pressures, like tightening regulations and market skepticism.

These projects are gaining traction through strong fundamentals, active communities, and real-world use cases that set them apart from the noise. In a market where utility matters more than hype, these five contenders, including BlockDAG (BDAG) , are building systems people want to use. From AI agents to privacy tools to decentralised marketplaces, each project brings something distinct to the table. If you are searching for the best crypto 2025 opportunities before they hit exchanges, read on to discover the presales that are making waves for all the right reasons. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): $277M Raised as Testnet and Tools Set the Pace BlockDAG has surged past $277 million in its presale, now entering stage 28 with growing attention from developers and analysts alike. Its hybrid architecture, which blends a Directed Acyclic Graph with Proof of Work, delivers scalability and speed without compromising decentralisation. Unlike many tokens still stuck in theory, BlockDAG already has a live testnet featuring full EVM compatibility. Developers can mint NFTs, run smart contracts, and interact through MetaMask, making it immediately usable for real-world applications. The broader ecosystem includes the X1 mobile miner app, and high-powered X Series mining hardware. Each product adds a layer of function and engagement that sets BlockDAG apart from typical presale tokens. With its GO Live Reveal scheduled for June 13, and a growing number of daily participants, BlockDAG is being widely discussed as a best crypto 2025 pick. Its momentum and utility are aligning for serious long-term potential. 2. Web3Bay (3BAY): Can Retail Be Rebuilt on Blockchain? Web3Bay is on a mission to decentralise e-commerce by eliminating third-party control and enabling users to trade directly using the 3BAY token. The platform rewards activity with lower fees, staking bonuses, and exclusive discounts, all governed by blockchain records that ensure fairness and traceability. This model reimagines digital commerce as something owned, not rented. Currently priced at $0.1959 in stage 5 with $2.1 million already raised, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the best crypto 2025 picks in the commerce sector. As transaction volume grows, token value could climb quickly. The potential here mirrors early BNB, only this time with a retail focus that’s drawing serious attention. 3. Unstaked (UNSD): Could AI Agents Replace Entire Web3 Teams? Unstaked is introducing decentralised AI agents that operate across Web3 ecosystems. These agents handle tasks like growth, moderation, and analytics without needing centralised management or software subscriptions. Every action is validated through Proof of Intelligence, recorded on-chain, and rewarded transparently, creating a self-operating infrastructure for digital communities. Now in stage 17 at $0.01043 with $8 million raised, Unstaked is drawing attention from DAOs and crypto builders searching for scalability. As automation becomes essential, many see this as a contender for best crypto 2025 based on utility alone. Its agent economy could soon become the operational core for countless decentralised platforms. 4. Cold Wallet (CWT): Privacy Is No Longer Optional in Crypto Cold Wallet is creating a secure wallet experience that protects user privacy with zero-knowledge proofs and cold-storage grade protection, while maintaining DeFi and staking functionality. Unlike typical wallets, it allows users to engage anonymously without sacrificing access to the broader crypto ecosystem. Control and stealth come standard, not as an afterthought. At $0.00853 in stage 11, and with a future launch price of $0.3517, Cold Wallet is capturing attention for its blend of privacy and utility. Its DAO-based governance and anonymous staking options add another layer of value. In a world pushing for more transparency, Cold Wallet is emerging as one of the best crypto 2025 plays for those seeking control without compromise. 5. Web3 ai (WAI): Merging AI and On-Chain Utility Web3 ai isn’t chasing hype around artificial intelligence. It’s focused on building tools that integrate large language models, risk engines, and NLP-powered bots directly into crypto workflows. These systems will help users automate trading, sentiment analysis, and wallet actions based on real-time blockchain data. Now in stage 7 with over $6.4 million raised, Web3 ai offers entry at just $0.000402 per token. With the right traction and utility rollout, it doesn’t need to reach astronomical prices to deliver exponential returns. Its $777,000 giveaway is also increasing investor participation and creating a sense of urgency around the presale. In Summary The 2025 presale season is not about hype, it is about substance. Projects like BlockDAG, Web3Bay, Unstaked, Cold Wallet, and Web3 ai are not just promising ideas, they are building real tools with clear use cases. Each one targets a gap in the market, from privacy to AI automation to decentralised commerce. BlockDAG leads the pack with its live testnet and full smart contract functionality, making it a strong contender for best crypto 2025. As these five projects continue gaining traction, they represent some of the most credible and utility-driven presales worth watching this year.

They are experimenting with XRP staking via Flare Networks. The company shared an X post : “Welcome to smart contracts and DeFi opportunities, #XRPArmy. The company then asked its users to “Stay tuned for the beta.” Uphold intends to take root in the US in following Trump’s pro-crypto stance In the last quarter of 2023, Uphold released Vault , a self-custodianship wallet that the company says empowers user to have more ownership of their digital assets. The wallet launched initially with XRP as an option, in keeping with Uphold’s existing dedication to the token. The company has also highlighted the Flare Network (an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain emphasizing cross-chain interoperability). The recent release of USDT₀, an omnichain variant of Tether’s USDT on Flare, has massively increased the network’s TVL, indicating surging demand for cross-chain DeFi utility. Uphold is further expanding its users’ functionality with the re-launch of its crypto debit card, which is available in the UK and US. It plans to extend the offering to other countries soon. The card (available in a virtual and physical version) offers people a way to spend digital currencies directly from their wallets and thus use crypto more as everyday money. The company’s broader push into the US market reflects a wider trend among crypto firms looking to capitalize on a more favorable regulatory climate under President Donald Trump’s administration. Uphold appears keen to position itself at the forefront of this shift. In March, Uphold reinstated staking rewards for US customers on 19 digital assets such as Ethereum, Solana, and NEAR. Concerning this, Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin highlighted that staking is important in how blockchain works and the online economy. Based on his argument, users should be able to back this activity and earn rewards. He further stated that with the new focus on blockchain in the US, they are excited to provide staking services to their customers in the US once more. Building on that momentum, Uphold announced on May 30 that it will soon offer direct deposits with integrated rewards for US users. This feature includes a “Direct Salary Deposit” option, paired with the industry’s first 4% XRP-back reward. Additionally, users can earn 5% rewards on RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-backed stablecoin. Through a mix of DeFi integrations, payment tools, and rewards, Uphold is aggressively expanding its footprint in the US while bringing greater utility to XRP and other digital assets. Uphold disabled staking amid regulatory uncertainties As of 2023, Uphold did not offer staking services in the US due to regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto staking. According to an SEC complaint, many staking firms failed to provide adequate information to clients, particularly regarding how they secured staked assets. The SEC also considered whether staking services could be considered unregistered securities offerings. Accordingly, many companies were forced to cease or limit their staking activities in the United States. One prime instance of this regulatory force was the SEC’s $30 million settlement with Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges, for unauthorized staking services. This high-profile case was a cautionary tale to the whole industry. It might have factored in Uphold’s decision to pause their staking offerings, shedding some light on why many companies still hesitate to offer staking services. Uphold’s recent consideration to take root in the US in the staking sector marks a significant milestone in the crypto community. This is because as investors earn passive income through staking, liquidity, and stability will be achieved, thus representing a giant bet on cryptocurrencies.

Here’s Why Qubetics is the Next Big Thing—Top Cryptos to Buy This Month,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-ethereum-heres-why-qubetics-is-the-next-big-thing-top-cryptos-to-buy-this-month/,"The crypto market has been buzzing with excitement lately, especially with Bitcoin’s market dips and rising interest in decentralized finance (DeFi). Recently, global institutions have been increasingly turning their attention toward blockchain platforms that offer real-world applications, utility, and scalability. This shift has caused some tokens to surge, while others fade into the background. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, which once dominated the scene, are now being eclipsed by emerging projects that promise even greater returns. Investors who missed out on Ethereum’s early stages may now find themselves regretting the missed opportunity—just as Qubetics ($TICS) rises as the next must-have token. Qubetics ($TICS) is steadily gaining attention as it moves through its presale phases, offering a unique opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the next big thing. Unlike Ethereum, which faced scalability issues early on, Qubetics aims to solve these challenges head-on. With its focus on interoperability and cross-chain capabilities, Qubetics stands out as a revolutionary blockchain project that could transform how businesses, professionals, and everyday users interact with decentralized technology. This presents an exciting opportunity to jump in early, before it gains mainstream adoption. The Missed Opportunity: Ethereum’s Peak and What Could Have Been Ethereum’s rise to prominence was nothing short of remarkable. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum opened the floodgates for decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Its impact on the crypto ecosystem cannot be overstated, and the platform became the go-to for developers and investors looking for a reliable blockchain. But as Ethereum grew, so did its challenges. High transaction fees, scalability issues, and slower processing times became increasingly apparent. Despite efforts like Ethereum 2.0, these problems have persisted, making Ethereum less appealing for new projects and business adoption. In hindsight, Ethereum’s early adopters reaped the benefits of being part of its ICO and presale phases. For those who missed those early opportunities, Ethereum’s price movements have made it harder to jump in now. Ethereum’s all-time high price of over $4,000 in 2021 may seem like a missed opportunity, especially when considering that early investors could have bought at less than $1 during its ICO in 2014. Now, at its current price range, Ethereum seems a bit overvalued compared to the early days. While Ethereum is still a significant player in the crypto world, its capacity for exponential growth may have plateaued, making it less exciting for newcomers looking for the next big thing. And this is where Qubetics enters the picture. Qubetics: The New Rising Star—Best Cryptos to Buy This Month Qubetics ($TICS) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about tokens in the crypto world, and for good reason. As of now, Qubetics is still in its presale, and its price is incredibly affordable—offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in early. The project is currently in its 36th presale stage, and it has already sold over 514 million tokens to more than 27,300 holders, raising over $17.5 million in funds. The price per token stands at $0.3064 in Stage 36, with predictions showing that it could rise significantly once the mainnet launches. Unlike Ethereum, which struggled with scalability and high fees, Qubetics offers a seamless multi-chain experience, allowing different blockchains to communicate with each other. This solves one of the most pressing issues in the crypto space—interoperability. Qubetics’ platform offers a variety of real-life applications, making it ideal for businesses, professionals, and individuals across different sectors. Whether it’s for financial services, supply chain management, or decentralized finance, Qubetics is poised to fill gaps left by Ethereum and similar platforms. For businesses, Qubetics offers a unique proposition: the ability to develop cross-chain decentralized applications without being restricted by the limitations of a single blockchain. Professionals can utilize Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet to manage assets across multiple platforms, improving efficiency and security. For individuals, Qubetics offers the potential for exponential returns, especially as the presale price remains low and analysts predict significant price growth. Real-Life Scenarios: How Qubetics Will Impact Different Sectors Businesses: In the world of finance and banking, Qubetics’ interoperability can drastically reduce the friction involved in cross-border transactions. By using its multi-chain platform, businesses can ensure faster and more cost-effective payment solutions. For example, a global supply chain company could use Qubetics to track the movement of goods across different regions and blockchains, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud. Professionals: Qubetics offers unique solutions for professionals in the tech and finance industries. Developers can create decentralized applications with greater ease, leveraging Qubetics’ cross-chain functionality. Financial advisors could integrate Qubetics’ technology into their systems to offer more secure and efficient investment solutions for their clients. Individuals: The potential for individual users to benefit from Qubetics is huge. By participating in the ongoing presale, they can secure TICS tokens at a low price, potentially reaping substantial rewards once the mainnet launches. With analysts predicting a 226% return if the token reaches $1 and a 4794% ROI if it hits $15 after the mainnet, the opportunity to buy early is undeniable. Interoperability: Bridging the Gap in the Blockchain Ecosystem Interoperability is a critical advancement for blockchain technology, as it allows different blockchain networks to communicate and work together seamlessly. Traditionally, blockchain networks have operated in isolation, limiting the transfer of assets and data between them. This fragmentation creates inefficiencies and barriers for developers, businesses, and users. However, with Qubetics’ cross-chain interoperability, this challenge is overcome by enabling seamless communication between various blockchains, ensuring that decentralized applications (dApps) can operate smoothly across multiple networks. This integration helps streamline processes, reducing friction and improving the overall user experience. For businesses and individual users, Qubetics’ interoperability opens up new possibilities by facilitating cross-chain transactions and services. Companies can utilize this technology to create more efficient solutions, such as cross-border payments or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that draw on liquidity from multiple networks. For users, it means greater flexibility, enabling them to interact with assets and services across different blockchain ecosystems without being confined to a single platform. By bridging the gap between disparate blockchain systems, Qubetics empowers a more interconnected and dynamic blockchain ecosystem, driving widespread adoption and innovation. Qubetics Presale Details: The Countdown to the Next Big Launch The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in Stage 36, with the token priced at $0.3064.

Trump says on Truth Social that he had previously decided to make a deal with China because his tariffs were plunging the Asian giant into “grave economic danger.” But according to Trump, his efforts did not pay off, as he says China breached a deal with the United States. “I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH the US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.32% on Friday, while the S&P 500 traded closer to even, only slumping by 0.0081%. Crypto, on the other hand, fell further, with the overall digital market cap dropping by more than 4%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by more than 1%. The Trump Administration announced multiple waves of tariffs on China in early April, which China responded to with retaliatory measures. Earlier this month, the White House announced that it had reached a deal with China to suspend and lower many of those tariffs, which kickstarted the equities market.

It joins a list of other Western technology companies pulling out of the Russian market. Geopolitical tensions are again affecting the technology industry as Microsoft is joining a list of other Western companies such as Google that are closing their Russian subsidiaries. Microsoft Corp.’s Russian subsidiary, Microsoft Rus LLC, has announced that it will declare bankruptcy. The announcement was made through a notice published on the official Russian registry Fedresurs on Friday, May 30. This decision seems like it was brought on by the ongoing pullback of Western technology companies from the Russian market, considering the escalating political tensions and economic isolation stemming from the war in Ukraine. Microsoft’s Russia unit is on the brink While Microsoft has not issued an official statement in response to inquiries, the notice signifies an end to the company’s already scaled-down presence in Russia. Over the last two years, the company has significantly reduced its presence in the country. The notice came just days after the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, publicly criticized and suggested that foreign digital service providers like Microsoft and Zoom should be “throttled” in favor of domestically developed alternatives. Microsoft was one of several Western technology giants that responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 by curtailing services and operations in the country. Initially, the company continued to provide essential services such as security updates and cloud support, but by June 2022, the company announced a substantial downsizing of its Russian operations due to the deteriorating economic environment and geopolitical instability. After the announcement, the company removed the RT (formerly Russia Today) app from the Windows App Store and banned advertisements from Russian state-affiliated media. The Fedresurs registry entry states that Microsoft Rus LLC is now proceeding with legal steps to enter bankruptcy, which would potentially dissolve its presence as a formal business entity in Russia. This is the pattern that other foreign companies exiting Russia have followed. Russia’s TASS news agency noted that Microsoft operates three other affiliated entities in the country, namely: Microsoft Development Center Rus, Microsoft Mobile Rus, and Microsoft Payments Rus. At this time, the status of these units remains unclear. Whether they will also initiate bankruptcy proceedings or attempt to continue operating under restricted conditions is yet to be seen. Other companies exiting Russia Earlier this week, President Vladimir Putin emphasized the need to wean Russia off Western digital tools, specifically naming Microsoft and Zoom. While Russia’s “technological sovereignty” policy is not new, the pressure to use regulation to suppress foreign firms to prop up Russian-developed alternatives has grown since the war in Ukraine began. In 2022, Google’s Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after authorities froze its bank accounts, making it impossible for the company to pay local employees or fulfill obligations to suppliers. Some foreign software continues to be used in Russia as of now and are often circulated through gray market channels or rebranded alternatives, but official policy increasingly favors domestic innovation, even at the cost of performance, reliability, or global integration. Microsoft’s exit might accelerate Russia’s domestic innovation ambitions as sectors that relied on the company’s productivity tools, cloud services, and cybersecurity infrastructure will now be left empty handed. Industry observers have noted that replicating the sophistication and integration of Microsoft’s ecosystem will be a significant challenge for Russian developers, at least in the short term.

Ethereum’s shift toward broader institutional use, Solana’s appearance in strategic reserves, Cardano’s fresh DeFi integrations, and BlockDAG’s surging presale have all sparked interest. Each project brings a unique angle, from scalability and smart contract utility to low-cost entry and active ecosystems, but one project is clearly drawing the most eyes. This isn’t just about who’s rising in price. When considering the top crypto to buy now, investors are evaluating technical strength, ecosystem development, and near-term momentum. Based on these factors, BlockDAG has emerged with standout traction, while ETH, SOL, and ADA continue to show solid reasons to stay on watch. Here’s a detailed look at how they compare. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0018 Pricing & Exchange Reveal Set the Stage BlockDAG is showing rapid growth as it moves toward a key milestone in its presale phase. The coin is still available at $0.0018, while total presale funding is now closing in on $277 million. What’s driving interest? On June 13, BlockDAG will reveal 20 centralized exchanges where BDAG will be listed, a turning point that could fuel its public breakout. The project’s strength goes beyond exchange plans. BlockDAG merges DAG scalability with PoW security and supports 2,000 TPS at launch, scaling to 15,000 TPS. Its mobile app, X1, already has over 1 million users, while community-focused features like Buyer Battles and a 25% referral program have increased user engagement. A refreshed Double Up Reset also gives buyers a renewed chance to increase their holdings. With low entry pricing, growing visibility, and a defined path to listings, BlockDAG is building strong fundamentals. These factors explain why many see it as the top crypto to buy now, especially for those looking at long-term upside with real near-term catalysts. 2. Solana: Testing Support With Strategic Boost From Institutional Backing Solana is trading at $163.19, down 5.5% over the past day. Despite the dip, it’s holding firm after a solid recovery from April lows around $115. The current zone between $158 and $163 is a crucial support range. If it holds, analysts say SOL could test resistance at $183, with potential upside toward $195 and $210. What’s reinforcing confidence in Solana is its inclusion in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a notable recognition of its broader utility. The platform continues to attract developers and users through its growing Web3 and DeFi ecosystem. If price stability continues, Solana remains a technically sound option. For swing traders and long-term believers, it continues to earn a place among the top crypto to buy now. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Demand & $4K Forecasts Support Strength Ethereum is currently priced at $2,620, having dipped 3.9% in the last 24 hours, with intraday movement between $2,591 and $2,732. This drop follows a strong monthly gain of nearly 45%, fueled by spot ETF inflows and renewed interest from institutions. Ethereum remains the leader in DeFi, holding more TVL than its closest competitors. The latest upgrade, Pectra, increased validator limits from 32 ETH to 2,048 and introduced faster, lower-cost network performance. While a $2.4 billion options expiry on May 30 may create short-term price swings, long-term targets remain high. Analysts at Standard Chartered see a $4,000 price point in 2025 and $7,500 by 2029. Ethereum’s continued relevance and technical strength make it a consistent pick among those scanning for the top crypto to buy now. 4. Cardano: Expanding Utility Through Bitcoin DeFi Cardano’s current price is $0.7009, showing a 6.7% decline on the day. Its trading range is sitting between $0.699 and $0.755. While price action has stayed muted, Cardano has been making quiet but meaningful moves. A major one is its integration of Bitcoin DeFi through the Lace Wallet, giving BTC users access to ADA-based financial tools. Alongside Solana, Cardano was recently added to the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that boosts its credibility. Analysts are projecting ambitious targets, including $2.05 by the end of 2025 and potentially $10 by 2030. These projections are tied to the blockchain’s ability to scale and integrate real-world use cases. While ADA isn’t stealing headlines right now, its developments and price range make it a relevant name in any discussion about the top crypto to buy now. Why BlockDAG Commands the Most Attention Ethereum brings institutional confidence. Solana continues to test important support levels while expanding its network. Cardano is quietly adding real-world use through Bitcoin integration. Yet BlockDAG is combining all the key elements, accessible pricing, strong technology, user incentives, and a confirmed roadmap to listings. With the presale target set at $600 million and the current price still at $0.0018, BlockDAG offers one of the most compelling setups. Its growing user base, solid architecture, and scheduled exchange reveal give it a clear advantage. For those searching for the top crypto to buy now , BlockDAG presents a rare opportunity to get in before the public launch and potential price shift begin. The days leading up to June 13 may represent the last chance to enter before a major wave of visibility and demand reshapes its market position. For buyers focused on value, growth, and timing, BlockDAG might just be the move worth making.

45313672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=762183,1748660451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45313672.jpeg,"Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-upward-momentum-highly-likely-to-continue-on-chain-data-shows/,"Although Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stalled in the mid-$100,000 range, on-chain data indicates that the top cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum is far from over. BTC recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980, prompting several crypto analysts to forecast even higher prices in the near term. Bitcoin Rally Far From Over, Data Suggests According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crypto Dan, Bitcoin is still “highly likely” to continue its upward trajectory. The analyst shared the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart to support this outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The NRPL chart highlights the scale of realized profits and losses by market participants who are selling BTC. A relatively low NRPL during price increases typically signals that profit-taking is limited, often indicating the continuation of a bullish trend. In the chart, the current level of profit realization is highlighted in right-most red box. While the recent price surge may trigger a short-term correction, the extent of realized profits does not suggest the end of the ongoing upward cycle. As Dan noted: Compared to the NRPL spikes at past cycle peaks, this round of profit-taking is relatively limited. In particular, when compared to the movements at the highs in March and November 2024, the current level of profit realization is notably lower. Dan concluded that the current level of profit-taking does not point to a major trend reversal. Instead, Bitcoin is poised to continue climbing, potentially targeting levels beyond $120,000 in the coming weeks. Despite the optimism, some market watchers remain cautious. Noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that Bitcoin’s current price action might be a bull trap, with BTC at risk of falling below the $100,000 threshold. For the uninitiated, a bull trap refers to when the asset briefly breaks above a well-established resistance range, leading traders to believe a breakout is occurring, but then quickly reverses and falls back below the resistance level. This move often plays out to lure in long positions before liquidating them as the price drops back into the previous range. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak, Retail Yet To Arrive On a more positive note, multiple on-chain indicators suggest Bitcoin is not yet near its cycle top. Notably, retail investor participation in the current rally remains limited – a sign that the market may still have room for a second wave of capital inflow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Massive 7,883 BTC Outflow From Coinbase – Are Institutions Loading Up? Likewise, Binance inflow data shows that certain investor groups are not eager to sell their BTC, possibly anticipating further gains.

Musk, wearing a black outfit and sporting a noticeable black eye, stood beside the president during a joint news conference. The gathering was meant to signal that Trump continues to support the billionaire entrepreneur. During the event, the president presented Musk with a golden key and described him as someone who has endured “slings and arrows,” suggesting that public criticism of Musk has been unfair. “He had to go through the slings and the arrows, which is a shame,” Trump said. Trump bids Elon Musk farewell. Source: FOX 35 Orlando In recent months, Tesla has faced protests, acts of vandalism, and a steep decline in its stock price. Many of these challenges have followed Musk’s growing involvement with DOGE and cost-cutting efforts. By publicly endorsing Musk, Trump aimed to show that he stands firmly behind the man who played a significant role in his own political comeback. The relationship between Trump and Musk, however, was not always smooth. At one point, Musk suggested that Trump should not run for office. In response, Trump even posted on social media in 2022 that he “could have said, ‘Drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it.” Despite that rocky start, the two eventually found common ground. Elon Musk donated generously to Trump’s political campaign and offered praise on social media. In turn, President Trump allowed Musk to be involved in various federal agencies without much resistance. In February, he even took to the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference carrying a chainsaw, saying it was “easy” to “save billions of dollars sometimes in, in an hour.” That display drew attention, but in practice, Musk’s team did not come near to achieving the goal of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget. Musk admits that cutting costs was far more difficult than he had anticipated By Friday, however, Musk admitted that identifying and securing huge savings proved far more difficult than he had anticipated. Standing alongside Trump, he described the task of reviewing government spending as “extraordinarily time-consuming and difficult,” involving careful scrutiny of countless line items. “It’s mostly just a lot of hard work,” he said. Even though Musk was stepping away from his formal role in DOGE, both men insisted the effort would continue. Trump noted that Musk had “installed geniuses with an engineering mindset and unbelievably talented people in computers” to carry on the work in multiple agencies. “Elon is really not leaving,” the President said. “He’s going to be back and forth. I have a feeling it’s his baby.” Musk reiterated that the cost-cutting effort is far from over Musk promised that DOGE will achieve $1 trillion in cuts eventually, even though the DOGE website currently lists $175 billion in proposed cuts. “This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,” he said, likening the effort to a way of life, “like Buddhism.” During the news conference, a reporter asked Musk about a recent report in The New York Times suggesting he had been using drugs more heavily than was previously known. Musk did not address the report’s specifics, instead criticizing the newspaper’s credibility and saying, “Let’s move on.” Another question focused on Musk’s black eye. He explained that it was the result of roughhousing with his 5-year-old son, X. “I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face,’” Musk recalled. “And he did.” His answer drew laughter and eased the tension in the room for a moment. Toward the end of the session, Musk rejoined the discussion to criticize federal judges who have upheld limits on the administration’s power.

The decline followed the release of the latest US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, which came in line with expectations and initially kept the crypto market steady. However, sentiment turned negative after Trump’s statement on Truth Social suggested that China had reneged on the terms of a previously negotiated deal. He emphasized the impact of his 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, claiming they had placed China in “grave economic danger” and triggered civil unrest, prompting him to strike a quick agreement to stabilize conditions. This development adds to the volatility traders have seen since February, when tariff threats on Canada and Mexico began surfacing. With Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing renewed volatility, retail interest is rotating toward high-risk, high-reward opportunities like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now in the final phase of its presale. As speculative capital seeks fresh momentum plays, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among traders looking to capture outsized returns. The appeal lies in the typical presale dynamic—low entry price, viral branding, and the potential for explosive upside once listings go live. BTC to slip to $100K? Bitcoin (BTC) is down 4.50% for the week to $103,332 and appears vulnerable to a short-term retest of the $100,000 mark. However, blockchain data suggests that any sustained move below that threshold may be short-lived. According to CryptoQuant, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which measures the realized gains and losses from Bitcoin transactions, shows only moderate profit-taking at current levels. This contrasts sharply with the elevated spikes seen during the March and November 2024 peaks, which preceded significant sell-offs and market tops. The relatively restrained selling now suggests that the market is not exhibiting signs of overheating, leaving room for further upside. Supporting the case for a strong bounce if BTC dips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, currently at $96,000. This metric reflects the average acquisition price of coins moved recently and has historically served as a reliable support during bullish phases. In prior cycles, Bitcoin has typically not stayed below this level for long, underscoring solid investor conviction and persistent demand. Taken together, the muted profit-taking and a key support near the $96,000 point to a high likelihood that any pullback under six figures would attract dip-buying interest, reinforcing the broader bullish trend. Why market attention is on Bitcoin Pepe Even as Bitcoin grapples with short-term volatility, its recent move to new highs has buoyed sentiment across the broader crypto market, an environment that has historically set the stage for wider rallies. In this risk-on backdrop, investor appetite is again turning toward speculative corners of the market, with meme coins among the early beneficiaries. One standout in this rotation is Bitcoin Pepe, which is positioning itself not just as another viral token but as a meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. The project claims to combine Bitcoin’s security with scalability comparable to Solana—an infrastructure edge that differentiates it from the majority of meme tokens, which typically offer little beyond branding. To build out its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has lined up several strategic partnerships. These include collaborations with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, as well as a tie-up with the GETE Network aimed at expanding into the cross-chain Web3 gaming segment. These moves suggest an effort to blend meme culture with real-world blockchain utility. Investor interest appears to be following. Bitcoin Pepe has raised more than $12.7 million in its ongoing presale, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0396. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, and a centralized exchange listing is expected shortly thereafter—an event that could act as a near-term price catalyst. As speculative capital continues to rotate into meme coins and early-stage projects, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself at the convergence of infrastructure development and retail-driven hype.

While traders keep an eye on Aave’s (AAVE) resistance zone after its bounce from key Fibonacci support, and Uniswap’s (UNI) breakout above $6.50 with bullish indicators flashing, another move may be brewing in the shadows. Web3 ai recently launched a $777,000 giveaway, but it’s not just about the giveaway. The true value lies in Web3 ai ($WAI) , now in stage 7 of its 50-stage presale at just $0.000402. With projections pointing to $4 in the future, this coin could offer a 10,000x return for early holders. Web3 ai is packed with real AI tools, such as auto-trading bots and scam detectors. For those serious about long-term gains, Web3 ai presents a compelling opportunity, going far beyond just the giveaway. AAVE Bounces at $250, Eyes $414 Breakout Target Aave (AAVE) recently bounced off the golden ratio at $250, with its resistance zone becoming the key focus for bullish traders aiming for a breakout. The coin is currently trading at around $265, up by 16% over the past week. Analysts predict a 43.8% price increase, potentially reaching $414.06 if momentum holds. The 0.618 Fibonacci level has acted as strong support, and breakout patterns suggest a shift from last year’s downtrend. AAVE’s fundamentals remain robust, particularly in lending and borrowing. Bulls are targeting $582 by year-end, but volatility remains a concern, and risk management is crucial. Uniswap Breaks $6.50, Targets $7.50 on Volume Surge Uniswap (UNI) has seen a significant breakout above trendline resistance, pushing the coin above $6.50 with a target of $7.50. UNI experienced a strong intraday move, with Open Interest rising by 14% to $400 million and trading volume up 54% to $467 million. Liquidations of short positions surged, indicating a potential short squeeze. Technical indicators back the bullish sentiment, with UNI breaking above the 50, 100, and 200-period EMAs on the 4-hour chart. If it holds the breakout level, UNI could test the May high of $7.50. Positive momentum signals solid gains in the near term. From $0.000402 to $4 Ahead for Web3 ai: Big Wins Are Hiding in Plain Sight Web3 ai has launched a $777,000 prize pool, divided between 10 lucky buyers. To enter, all it takes is a $100 purchase of $WAI coins. However, the real prize is what’s being built behind the scenes. In stage 7 of its 50-stage presale, Web3 ai has already raised over $6.2 million. Each $WAI coin is priced at just $0.000402, with analysts predicting a future price of $4 by the future. This could result in a 10,000x return, but the real story is that Web3 ai’s platform is already developing tools like auto-balancing portfolios and scam detection features. These aren’t just future promises; they’re already being developed. This makes Web3 ai more than a meme coin: it’s a practical, timely asset. For those serious about finding the best crypto for the future, Web3 ai ticks all the boxes: utility, timing, and massive upside. While the giveaway grabs attention, long-term holders are after sustained returns driven by real tools. The strategy is clear: get in early and hold through the growth. Whether someone wins the $77,700 prize or not, the real jackpot could lie in holding $WAI before it hits major exchanges. This is one of the best cryptos to consider for anyone building a future-focused portfolio. Key Takeaways Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI) both show bullish short-term potential, with AAVE reclaiming the 0.618 Fibonacci level, setting up for a 43% move. UNI’s breakout above trendline resistance targets $7.50. However, for those seeking long-term gains, Web3 ai presents a stronger opportunity. While the $777,000 giveaway garners attention, the real potential lies in the $WAI coin. Priced at $0.000402 in stage 7, with $6.2 million raised, Web3 ai offers automated portfolio tools, trading bots, and scam detection features powered by AI. This combination makes Web3 ai one of the best long-term crypto opportunities.

He suggested that cargo ships could speed up their transit through the Panama Canal if they paid in Bitcoin. It was a brief comment, but it set off a flurry of questions about how it might work in practice. Related Reading: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO Bitcoin Payments For Priority Passage According to reports from the panel, Mizrachi spoke alongside El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy leaders, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. He said that ships could “cut the line” by paying tolls in Bitcoin. He offered the idea as a way to reward early adopters. It was presented in a casual tone, but it touched on a serious topic: how fast payments could tie into a long-standing shipping process. Ships Could Pay Panama Canal Transit Fees in Bitcoin The mayor of Panama City, Mayer Mizrachi, said he is exploring bitcoin payment options for ships passing Panama Canals. “What if you have a perk for paying in bitcoin?” Mizrachi mused. “You’d get to go faster.” 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/zciROaSGjM — Ray (@ray4tesla) May 30, 2025 Questions Over Fees And Fairness Based on what was discussed, the Canal’s current rule is first-come, first-served. Changing that would need approval from the Panama Canal Authority and Panama’s national government. Shipping companies might push back if they feel smaller carriers are priced out. US President Donald Trump weighed in late last year, arguing that US ships faced “unfair tolls” and hinting at reclaiming the Canal in December 2024. That episode showed how sensitive Canal changes can be. Handling A $5 Billion Business According to the Panama Canal website, the waterway brought in around $5 billion in revenue between October 2023 and September 2024. Nearly 10,000 ships passed through, carrying about 423 million tons of goods. That’s about 5% of global maritime commerce. If Bitcoin payments were allowed, the Authority would need a plan to deal with price swings. One day’s checkout could be 50 BTC, the next it might jump to 60 BTC. Panama would likely need a quick exchange system to turn BTC into dollars or other stable currencies. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ A Push For City-Level Crypto Mizrachi has also backed letting people pay city fees—taxes, fines and permits—in Bitcoin, Ether and USDC. He raised the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which produces over half of the nation’s GDP. He noted he wouldn’t need more laws to start one. But real steps will depend on lawmakers and officials at the national level. For now, it remains a mayoral proposal, rather than a binding plan. Mizrachi claimed over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions happen in Panama every year, though much of it is “behind closed doors,” he said.

Speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum in California, Jamie said, “You are going to see a crack in the bond market, OK? It is going to happen.” He made the statement while criticizing the US government and the Federal Reserve for how far they’ve pushed spending and monetary policy since the pandemic. According to remarks reported by the Wall Street Journal , Jamie believes the government’s debt-driven policies are pushing the system toward instability. At the center of it is a House-passed tax plan supported by President Donald Trump that would blow up the federal deficit by about $2.7 trillion over ten years. The US national debt is already more than $36 trillion. That proposal has freaked out traders, with a spike in 10-year Treasury yields to 4.418% earlier this month and a credit downgrade from Moody’s, which pointed to the government’s “towering pile of debt.” Traders react to growing fiscal risk Jamie said things got unsteady back in early 2020 when Covid-19 shook the system. But the government’s reaction—which worked at first—eventually spiraled. “They massively overdid” the response in the following years, he said, leaving the economy bloated with cheap money and debt. The result now is a bond market that’s showing signs of real stress, starting with a lack of demand at a Treasury auction on May 21. The financial system has also been slowed down by rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Jamie pointed out that banks have less room to hold bonds under current regulations. That means they can’t easily step in when markets turn shaky. This creates a situation where, if sellers flood the market and there aren’t enough buyers, there’s no buffer to prevent a deeper freeze. To respond, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other financial officials have floated the idea of relaxing capital rules. The goal is to make it easier for banks to absorb more government bonds. But Jamie wasn’t exactly convinced that would fix the real problem. He warned regulators directly: “It’s going to happen, and you’re going to panic.” He added that he’s not sure if the breakdown comes in six months or six years, but he’s certain it’s on the way unless something changes soon. Jamie Dimon sees bigger risks beyond bonds While most of Jamie’s message focused on the debt situation, he also hit other areas he thinks are being ignored. He said investors are underestimating the damage from Trump’s tariffs , which were reintroduced after the president returned to the White House. Jamie said the market is too confident considering how these trade policies can hit real companies. “It’s an extraordinary amount of complacency,” he said. His concerns go beyond money. Jamie said America’s place in the world is at risk if it doesn’t stay strong both economically and militarily. He warned that the US dollar’s role as the global reserve currency could vanish in the future. “If we are not the pre-eminent military and the pre-eminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency,” he said. Jamie admitted that China, the main target of the trade war, is a “potential adversary”, but said the bigger issue is internal. “What I really worry about is us,” he said. “Can we get our own act together—our own values, our own capabilities, our own management?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On Friday, Commerce Department data revealed that consumer prices rose 2.1% in April compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. That puts inflation within touching distance of the Fed’s target, but officials aren’t ready to change course just yet, especially not while President Donald Trump is ramping up tariffs . According to Reuters , Fed officials are choosing patience, not action. The risk of cutting rates too early while tariffs continue to raise import costs is just too high. And they’re not convinced inflation is going to stay low either. Goods prices are already rising again, which means businesses are likely passing costs from higher import taxes straight to consumers. Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said the April inflation dip will probably be seen by the Fed “as the calm before the storm.” He said unless consumer spending collapses or job losses spike, the central bank will keep waiting. Fed freezes as tariffs drive caution On the same day the inflation data came out, the government also reported that consumer spending only grew 0.2% in April. That’s weak. Meanwhile, the personal saving rate jumped to 4.9%, up from 4.3%. Households are saving more and spending less, likely because tariff policy changes so frequently that people are bracing for whatever comes next. Karim Basta from III Capital Management put it simply: “There’s nothing to do but wait.” Since December, the Fed has held short-term rates between 4.25% and 4.50%. And after their most recent meeting in May, officials made clear they’re focused on inflation . Multiple policymakers said they’re worried that Trump’s tariffs could wipe out any progress on prices. Mary Daly, President of the San Francisco Fed, said on Thursday that inflation is still above target. “Inflation is going to be my focus,” she said. Daly also emphasized that rates have to stay “moderately restrictive” to keep downward pressure on prices. Later that evening, Lorie Logan, who leads the Dallas Fed, said it could be “quite some time” before the Fed knows if Trump’s trade policies will do more damage to jobs or prices. She said those risks are “in rough balance,” and that’s enough reason for the Fed to stay on hold. Still, traders are betting that by September, the Fed will start cutting rates slowly. They expect the policy rate to land between 3.75% and 4.0% by the end of the year. But unless inflation drops hard or unemployment jumps, the Fed is showing no sign of blinking.

One such token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently priced at $0.03, with analysts forecasting a $5 price target after launch. The experts point out that this token has the value proposition, coupled with the perfect time to support this breakout. At its current price of $0.03, a rise to $5 would represent an over 100x gain post-launch. While in the legacy financial world, these gains are almost unheard of, they are quite possible in the crypto world. However, for a crypto project to be worthy of such high price targets, it must fulfill several criteria, which Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has done perfectly. One of them is that its value proposition has to be built on solid fundamentals that point to long-term value addition for its community. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could achieve $5 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a unique protocol design that has left analysts amazed at how low its current valuation is compared to its fundamentals. The MUTM token is currently selling for $0.03 per token in Phase 5 of the presale, with over $9.4 million having been raised so far. Buyers who participate in the current phase are assured of a 100% ROI. In Phase 1, the pricing was even cheaper at $0.01 per token. Since then, the price has risen 200%, and it is set to rise another 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6. So far, over 11,300 unique buyers have participated in the presale, with many of them buying tokens since the start of the presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on utility The crypto market has gradually been shifting focus from quick flips that leave most of its community trapped due to low liquidity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focused on building a decentralized, dual-mode liquidity protocol that will deliver long-term growth for its community. In the first mode, called the P2C (peer-to-contract), lenders receive an annualized percentage yield on their assets when they deposit them in a smart contract. This yield rate is based on the utilization rate, and the pool is designed to be self-sustaining by constantly shifting rates based on demand and supply. When the utilization rate in a P2C pool rises, the rate increases, which encourages even more liquidity to enter the pool. That also makes it unfavorable for borrowers to participate, which pushes down the rate to more acceptable levels. In the other mode, which is peer-to-peer (P2P), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows lenders and borrowers to engage directly with each other in separate smart contracts. The focus of the P2P mode is on highly volatile assets like the PEPE meme coin. By placing it in a separate section, it ensures the high volatility does not bleed into the P2C pools, while also providing an avenue for holders of highly volatile assets to earn passive income. mtTokens for instant liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has correctly assessed that depositors in a liquidity pool are often discouraged from doing so since staking takes liquidity away from them. To solve this issue, Mutuum Finance has introduced a revolutionary concept called mtTokens. For instance, when a depositor places $2,500 worth of ETH in a pool, they receive mtETH tokens in return. The mtTokens ensure that depositors can take advantage of market opportunities as they arise. These tokens are built on the ERC-20 token standard, which means they can be freely exchanged on secondary markets or used as collateral for new loans on the protocol. Long-term dividend payouts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has created a smart solution for dividends that also supports the overall growth of the project. The team plans to use profits from the protocol to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which they will then distribute to the stakers. These purchases will support the price of the MUTM tokens while also incentivizing more stakers to sign up. Consequently, it will support the long-term health of the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating that with a commitment to utility in the crypto space, a new project can drive real value for its community. With the success of the recent Certik audit, the number of firm believers in the project has shot through the roof and is expected to keep climbing after launch. Consequently, the modest projection of a rise to $5 is feasible.

Borrowing costs have hit record highs, demand is collapsing, and investors are walking away. According to the Financial Times , policymakers are now scrambling to figure out how to stop things from spiraling further. Last week, 30-year bond yields hit 3.2%, up from 2.3% earlier this year. 40-year bond yields climbed to 3.7%, right after two auctions flopped in a row. Traders in Tokyo described it bluntly as a “buyers’ strike,” and it confirmed something deeper. Investors no longer want Japan’s super-long-term debt. Yields shot up because prices tanked, and that’s happening for one big reason: nobody is buying. Aging investors and the demand problem A major reason for the weak demand is demographics. Kevin Zhao, who leads global sovereign and currency strategy at UBS Asset Management, said the country’s wealthy postwar baby boomers aren’t investing for the long term anymore. Another chunk of missing demand is coming from life insurance firms. Last year, they were pushed to buy up long-term bonds, and they did. But traders now say that the buying wave has ended. Insurance companies aren’t reliable buyers anymore. They’re pulling back, and it’s showing up clearly in the auctions. A recent 20-year bond auction barely attracted interest, the lowest demand since 2012. Then came this week’s 40-year bond sale, which had the weakest bid-to-cover ratio in nearly a year. Traders said the lack of interest confirmed what’s been building for months. The usual buyers are gone, and new ones haven’t stepped in. BoJ policy changes and critical decisions ahead The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is making things even tighter. It raised interest rates to 0.5% and has been trimming its bond buying by ¥400 billion — about $2.8 billion — each quarter. That tapering will continue until March 2026. But without strong buyers, every cut in BoJ purchases adds stress to the system. The bank already owns around 52% of Japan’s bond market, and there’s growing concern about how much more pressure the market can take. All eyes are now on the week of June 16. That’s when the BoJ’s Monetary Policy Committee meets for two days. They’ll review the past year of reduced bond purchases. Some in the market believe the committee might slow down the tapering to keep a lid on yields. The BoJ’s decisions that week could decide whether things calm down or get worse. Just after that, the Ministry of Finance is expected to meet with market players to discuss its debt issuance plans. One likely move would be to cut back on sales of long-dated bonds. Yields dropped slightly on Tuesday after reports that the ministry had started asking brokers how they feel about the current bond market environment. At JPMorgan, economists told clients the spike in yields makes the upcoming BoJ meeting even more important. But Benjamin Shatil, a senior economist there, thinks the central bank is lagging behind. Japan is now in its fourth year of inflation above target, yet policies haven’t caught up. “It all begs the question — why buy?” Benjamin asked. He also pointed to Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, which has not shifted allocations toward domestic bonds despite the volatility. And with liquidity tightening fast in Japan’s commercial banks, fewer institutions are able — or willing — to buy this debt. On the trading desks in Tokyo, the long end of the bond market — the super-long JGBs — is flashing all the alarms. Shinichiro Kadota, a strategist at Barclays, said Wednesday’s failed auction shows the deep problems are now front and center. Issues like BoJ tapering, budget pressure from defense spending, and household savings moving into tax-free NISA accounts are all hitting at the same time. Income for life insurers is also shrinking, and their investment products are losing out to other alternatives. Shinichiro said he doesn’t expect the BoJ to reverse course. “There may be some tweaks . . . but the solution has to be the Ministry of Finance [reducing] issuance,” he said.

While the bulls have held higher lows in the short term, repeated rejection from the same level raises questions about buyer conviction at these highs. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Ethereum is currently consolidating below the major resistance at $2,800, which aligns with the 200-day moving average. The uptrend that began near $1,500 has paused, and the RSI has slightly dropped below 70, reflecting weakening bullish momentum. Despite this, the price remains above the 100-day MA and the previous breakout zone near $2,200, indicating structure remains bullish unless those levels are lost. A clean breakout above $2,800 would open the path toward the $3,400–$3,600 supply zone. On the other hand, failure to do so could trigger a retest of the $2,200 demand block. The 4-Hour Chart The 4H chart shows that the price has formed a clear ascending triangle between the $2,800 resistance and roughly $2,500 support. The structure resembles a potential distribution phase following two strong accumulation zones below $1,850 earlier this month. While ETH continues to set higher lows, the repeated rejection at the highs is starting to weigh on the short-term outlook. The RSI is also hovering near 47, suggesting a neutral momentum shift. A break below $2,500 and the lower boundary of the pattern would signal bearish reversal toward $2,100, while a confirmed breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the distribution idea and favor upside expansion. Sentiment Analysis The Coinbase Premium Index is currently holding slightly above zero, indicating moderate spot demand from US-based investors. Historically, a rising premium has often preceded strong bullish trends driven by institutional or high-volume retail buyers on Coinbase. Although the current levels are not aggressively high, they reflect underlying strength in the spot market and a willingness to pay slightly more for ETH on U.S. exchanges. If this premium begins expanding while ETH approaches resistance again, it could signal renewed confidence and front-running of a breakout. On the other hand, if the premium fades or turns negative, it may signal waning interest and a possible short-term top, which is the scenario that is seemingly occurring at the moment. Therefore, if the demand from the US declines, it would be highly likely for ETH to go into a correction phase once more.

Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485. This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. Related Reading: This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why Liquidation Disparity Between Bitcoin and Altcoins Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, market behaviors have demonstrated a notable divergence between Bitcoin and altcoin liquidations. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise. Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin’s value surged, pushing the price further upward. In stark contrast, altcoins have experienced a markedly different scenario. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts. This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. The sustained downward pressure on altcoins reveals the failure of expectations surrounding an “Altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies typically outperform BTC. Implications of Market Asymmetry The distinct patterns in liquidations between BTC and altcoins reflect critical shifts in investor risk sentiment and leverage usage. BTC’s favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception. Conversely, the altcoin sector’s persistent price declines have led to widespread liquidation of bullish positions, highlighting the misalignment between trader expectations and actual market behavior. According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning.

This trend has intensified following the ETF’s approval, as traders appear more confident betting on Bitcoin’s stability and growth potential compared to the volatility and unpredictability of the altcoin market. Moving forward, the current market conditions suggest that investors may continue to approach Bitcoin with measured optimism while maintaining a cautious stance toward altcoins.

The native token has been hit hard once again due to the overall market-wide crash, and has wiped out all the gains registered since the hype rally earlier this month. This One Is for Users, Gamers, Developers Pi Network’s Core Team often publishes (or refurbishes) guidelines and updates for all of its users, and the latest one, which went live hours ago, is mostly targeting gamers, developers, and PI investors. It reads that games, in general, and those built on its network, are particularly important for user participation as gaming is a “strong fit for driving fun, engagement, and utility in the Pi ecosystem.” The post highlights the launch of a new game app, called FruityPi, which “shows how integration with multiple Pi products like Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network can benefit developers.” It is also advertised that it can leverage what the project’s community has to offer, such as signups, attention, and the aforementioned engagement. The team also advised developers to integrate their newly minted games with Pi’s ecosystem, as it will allow them to take advantage of all of its products and collective resources. If the app manages to gain traction from Pi users, then they should also “apply to Pi Network Ventures.” As previously reported , Pi Network Ventures is a $100 million fund that launched in the middle of the month, which aims to invest in startups that advance the utility of real-world Pi adoption. PI’s Price Keeps Dropping Interestingly, when the team first hinted about a big announcement coming later in May (which was on May 8), the community was quick to pick up the news and blow it out of proportion. As a result, the native token exploded from $0.6 to roughly $1.7 within days. However, that hype-driven rally was short-lived, and the asset began to lose value even before the Pi Network Ventures announcement went live. Since then, PI’s price troubles have only deepened, and the market-wide correction in the past 48 hours didn’t help. In fact, PI is down by 10% in the past day alone and has returned to its starting position of around $0.6. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko Perhaps one other reason behind the substantial price dump is the growing number of unlocked PI tokens in the past few weeks.

The current price of $3.86 hovers just above the lower Bollinger Band at $3.77, which could act as short-term support. The RSI is at 45.46, indicating weakening bullish momentum and nearing oversold territory. The bearish candle formations confirm the downward pressure, while the drop from recent highs signals a possible correction phase. If support at $3.77 fails, Pendle may slide further. Otherwise, a rebound would need to reclaim the $4.23 level to restore bullish confidence. PENDLE/USD 4-hour chart PENDLE 4-hour price chart; Tradingview Based on the 4-hour chart of Pendle (PENDLE/USDT), the current outlook suggests intensified bearish momentum. The price has declined to $3.86, decisively breaching the lower Bollinger Band at $3.90, which may indicate oversold conditions or further downside risk. The Balance of Power indicator reads -0.57, signaling bearish dominance. Furthermore, the MACD has turned negative with widening histogram bars and a bearish crossover, reinforcing the downward trajectory. Unless Pendle reclaims the mid-Bollinger Band at $4.34 or higher, continued selling pressure may drive the price toward the next support zone near $3.60. Reversal signs remain weak and largely absent for now.

On the daily timeframe, the price has dropped to the lower Bollinger Band, and RSI is at 45.46, indicating weakening momentum but not yet oversold. This suggests more room for downside or consolidation. On the 4-hour chart, the RSI hovers near 40 with a bearish MACD crossover, reinforcing selling pressure. The Balance of Power also favors sellers. If the price fails to hold above the $3.76 support zone, a deeper pullback is possible. Caution is advised in the near term. Is PENDLE a good investment?

Between January and June 2021, the price remained relatively stable, fluctuating around the $0.90 to $1.0 range.

There was little to no significant upward or downward movement during this period. In June 2023, the price remained stable, with slight declines observed but staying well below the $1.0 mark. Pendle price movements showed no significant upward momentum and maintained a steady range. Starting from mid-2023, the price began to show slight upward movements, though it was still relatively low. By the end of December 2023, the price showed some initial signs of increase, moving closer to the $1.2 mark. $PENDLE experienced strong growth in 2024, reaching $5.5 in March and its ATH of $7.52 in April.

Though the price of Pendle recovered later toward $3.7, it failed to maintain that level and dropped toward $2.7 by February’s end.

The altcoins have it even worse, with massive price drops from the likes of SUI, LINK, DOGE, SOL, ADA, and more. CRO has defied the market-wide trend with a double-digit price surge. BTC Dumps to $103K Ever since it skyrocketed to almost $112,000 last Thursday to chart a new all-time high, bitcoin’s price has been unable to recapture or even sustain its momentum. It started to fall on the next day when US President Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. Although he delayed their implementation for over a month, BTC failed to bounce off decisively and was stopped at around $110,000 on a couple of occasions. The latest rejection, which came on Thursday at $109,000, was the worst one (for now) as it drove BTC down to $105,000. It recovered some ground to $106,000 yesterday, but the bears reemerged and pushed the cryptocurrency south to a 12-day low of just over $103,000. This decline transpired after Trump said China “violated” the trade agreement between the two, while Beijing responded kindly. Although BTC has regained some ground and now sits above $103,500, its market cap has slid to $2.06 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has shot up to 61.3%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out, Not CRO The alternative coins have marked some big losses over the past day. Ethereum is close to breaking below $2,500 after a 4.5% drop. XRP has plunged beneath $2.15, while DOGE, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX have plummeted by up to 9%. The situation with the lower-cap alts is even more painful, as many, such as ENA, INJ, VIRTUAL, and PEPE, have charted double-digit price declines. CRO is the only exception, having gained 17% in the past day and trading close to $0.11. The total crypto market cap has seen roughly $200 billion gone in the past two days and is down to $3.360 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

After days of bullish momentum, ETH now hovers around the $2,550 level—a line that could determine the short-term trajectory. Despite the pullback, Ethereum remains relatively strong compared to other assets, showing signs that bulls still maintain control of the structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support However, risks are rising. If Ethereum loses this key demand zone, bearish pressure could intensify and trigger further downside across the altcoin market. Investors are watching closely as ETH tries to stabilize after multiple attempts to reclaim higher levels in recent weeks. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical signal that could offer hope for bulls. According to Martinez, if ETH manages to hold above $2,550, the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart is flashing a buy signal, pointing to a potential rebound toward $2,650. This aligns with the idea that consolidation near strong demand often leads to upside continuation if momentum holds. Ethereum Builds Strength Amid Uncertainty Ethereum is holding up well despite widespread market volatility, trading confidently above the $2,400 level. The asset continues to show strength as it consolidates within a key demand zone, positioning itself for a potential move higher. This resilience is drawing the attention of analysts, many of whom believe ETH is preparing for an impulsive breakout that could ignite a broader altseason. While the technical outlook remains constructive, global tensions continue to shape investor sentiment. The ongoing trade friction between the US and China, combined with rising US Treasury yields, is injecting uncertainty into the macroeconomic landscape. These systemic risks have the potential to disrupt financial markets, but so far, cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin and Ethereum—have remained relatively firm. Martinez shared a technical setup that could validate the bullish thesis. According to Martinez, Ethereum is flashing a TD Sequential buy signal on the 4-hour chart, signaling a likely rebound if ETH continues to hold above $2,550. This would position the asset for a move toward $2,650—a level that could confirm bullish momentum and bring altcoins back into focus. If Ethereum can maintain its current support and break through immediate resistance, it could serve as a spark for renewed optimism across the crypto sector.

On the 4-hour chart, ETH has clearly lost momentum, slipping below the 34 EMA ($2,608) and also breaking beneath the 50 and 100 SMAs—levels that previously acted as support during consolidation. The recent rejection from the $2,800 range triggered a sharp correction, with increasing volume suggesting strong selling activity. The next key area to watch is around $2,450, which aligns with previous consolidation zones and could serve as short-term support. If this level fails to hold, ETH could retest the 200 SMA near $2,300, a crucial level that also lines up with early May breakout levels.

The TD Sequential buy signal, previously active above $2,550, has now been invalidated, signaling caution for traders. All eyes are now on the bulls to see if they can defend this region and reset the short-term structure for a rebound.

With a 2000% rise in trading volume, the LPT price triggered a strong rise from levels around $5 to mark local highs at around $13.48. The rise in the value is due to the listing on the popular South Korean exchange, Upbit, which has increased its trading volume and market exposure. Now that the token has triggered a strong upswing and the technicals surge over the upper threshold, is the LPT price heading for a correction? The historical price chart suggests the price has rebounded from the lowest support around $3.3. In the times when the price has been forming a consecutive higher high and lower low, the listing seems to have come as a blessing in disguise. The rally almost reached the pivotal resistance zone between $11.56 and $12.78 but failed to sustain which may point towards a small correction phase. As seen in the above chart, these levels have been the trend reversal zone before, and hence, they need to be either broken up or down to flip the ongoing trend. The price surged above the resistance zone during Q1 2024 and remained consolidated throughout the year as it offered a strong base, which turned into a resistance that persists till now. Therefore, rising above this zone is extremely important for the LPT price to reach the neckline of the v-shaped recovery above $21; otherwise, the token may continue to consolidate below the range. Technically, the bullish dominance over the rally has just started as the weekly MACD has turned bullish after remaining bearish since the start of the year. Besides, the weekly RSI has risen above the descending trend line, hinting towards the beginning of the bullish trend. Therefore, the Livepeer (LPT) price is believed to maintain a consistent ascending trend by withstanding the bearish pressure and eventually rising above the resistance zone. On the other hand, the token has been attracting significant volume at frequent intervals, which suggests the investors remain vigilant over the token. Therefore, a rise above the range may attract fresh liquidity that may lead the LPT price close to its ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|LPT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 06:28:08

Square's new biannual product launch cadence, the first of which included Square Handheld and a Square AI teaser, positions the company to reignite Square segment growth. AI integration into Square POS leverages proprietary data and distribution, offering robust upselling potential and should drive strong future subscription and services revenue. Block is among the best bitcoin businesses available on public markets, with a full-stack approach and the ability to deploy bitcoin services into enormous ecosystems of merchants and consumers. Further, the company earns a very lucrative yield on its Lightning channel, which is seeing booming growth. Block is at a crossroads; it has faced several years of multiple compression and poor stock performance, but recently has inflected EPS and is looking to re-accelerate Square and Cash App growth. Now, execution is everything. Just a few short weeks ago, I wrote one of the most uncomfortable articles in my time writing here for Seeking Alpha. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported objectively bad earnings, with slowing growth and meager guidance. The stock got decimated. It dropped from 20% from around $60 to $45 upon release. Block is personally my top holding and a stock I have written on several times with consistently bullish stances. Watching this stock underperform high-flying AI names and fintech competitors alike for the past few years has been a challenge, to say the least. Even worse, I have been recommending others to buy the stock, just to watch it consistently underperform. My conviction was shaken for the first time after seeing the market response to the recent earnings. But I read through the report with an open mind. What I saw didn't justify a 20% selloff. I began writing. The article was titled 'Don't Let This Selloff Go To Waste' and I rated XYZ a strong buy. It felt horrible at the moment, but I had to stomach that discomfort. Since then, the stock has returned to its pre-earnings level above $60. I didn't expect such a rapid recovery, but there are very clear reasons for such. Since the earnings report, the company has announced significant product launches, management has been far more engaged with retail, and there's been a major step toward the company's bitcoin (BTC-USD) inflection. The company is showing renewed focus on innovation and product velocity. The thesis underpinning my Strong Buy rating in this article is simple: Block will reaccelerate growth through product stack depth, innovation, and solid execution. I typically wouldn't cover a stock again so soon, but there's much to talk about here. Let's dive right in. Square Releases The recovery began with the company's first Square Releases, a new biannual product launch cadence for Square merchants. The first Releases announcement was on May 13th, which coincided with the J.P. Morgan 53rd Annual Technology, Media and Communications Conference. Both CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja presented at the conference. I have a detailed writeup of the conference on my X account . The core takeaways from their talk were: Four key priorities for the rest of the year: expand Cash App Borrow ramp Afterpay on Cash App card market share gains in square and re-acceleration of GPV growth launch of Proto, the Bitcoin mining ASIC business. Expansion of Cash App Borrow is not predicated on an expansion of risk appetite. It’s based on the improved unit economics by switching to SFS (Square Financial Services) for origination & the improved profitability thereof. They can now profitably lend to more users. Acceleration of Square GPV growth will be driven by a revamp of marketing strategy. Currently, 80% of Square customer acquisition is organic/self-serve. The company wants a 50/50 balance between self-serve and internal sales led/partnership driven. Meaning, the sales approach has changed to favor more outbound, free hardware, and contract-driven sales. This approach is what allowed competitors to gain share vs Square in recent years. The shift to field sales has resulted in positive early signs with larger customer wins. Cash App gross profit accelerated in April vs to the March run rate, which now makes the company's poor Q2 guide look ""uncharacteristically conservative"" since it assumed a weakening consumer. Such weakening has not materialized through April and May. The goal of codename: goose is to have a fully autonomous AI agent that can act as a CFO or COO for Square merchants and a personal financial assistant in Cash App. Product velocity and innovation are what will regain shareholder trust, belief, and enthusiasm Both Dorsey and Ahuja expressed far more optimism during the investor conference compared to the earnings call. The stock climbed from $55 to $58 on that day. On the morning of the conference, the company announced one huge product release and one huge teaser: Square Handheld and Square AI. Square Handheld is the best-in-class portable point-of-sale (""POS"") system currently available. It is the thinnest, lightest, has the best camera, offers the most payment methods, can process payments offline, and is very cost competitive. X.com user @nachunja A handheld POS is important for retail stores, restaurants, and any other business where it's advantageous for customers to check out at a non-fixed location. This product launch, alongside the company's revamped marketing strategy, aims to reaccelerate Square GPV growth. I believe it's a winning equation. Square Handheld was the flagship launch of the first Square Releases, but this also came with a host of other updates for each of the company's specific verticals (Food & Beverage, Retail, Services, and Health & Beauty). The most important software update was the launch of a new Square POS unified software interface . It enhances the cross-compatibility of Square software across different devices and is a critical step toward moving up the value chain from SMB's (small-to-medium business) to large enterprises. Finally, the company teased Square AI, an AI model that is native to the Square POS software. It's difficult to understate the opportunity that Square has here. I have consistently shared what, I believe, are the keys to success for AI companies: proprietary data and distribution capability. Square fits both of these very well. Data makes the AI smart and useful, and distribution makes the economics work. Integrating AI into the Square software stack moves it up the value chain once again: it started as a simple way to accept card payments, then became a POS solution for merchants, and then a full-stack ERP platform. Square AI will make it a full-stack business operating system. This is an incredibly robust value proposition for existing merchants and should also attract new merchants quite well. On the distribution front, it will be as simple as a software update. My assumption is that a base-level Square AI offering will be bundled into the Free plan with additional features available for both Plus and Premium plans. www.squareup.com This will help generate further subscription & services growth over time as AI has very clear upselling benefits for both existing and new merchants. In my recent article , I summarized my core long-term thesis as such: Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. The Cash App Borrow news referenced was that the company would begin originating Cash App Borrow loans internally within Square Financial Services, which has a US banking charter. This improves the unit economics of the segment and will generate further growth from the Cash App segment contribution. Square AI will accelerate subscription & services growth from the Square segment contribution. Combined with the company's renewed focus on outbound marketing and customer acquisition, I see a very clear path for Square to begin regaining market share and accelerating growth. Don't just take my word for it, though. Block CEO Jack Dorsey himself agreed with my take on X: x.com The seminal Square Releases Day was a great success and was met with excitement from the market. It encapsulates perfectly my thesis: execution excellence underpinned by deepening POS hardware offerings (deepening the product stack), enhancing software functionality (innovating UI/UX), and building hype for future product innovations with Square AI. This brings me to my next point: management engagement. Management Engagement I have been posting about Block for well over a year now on X but have never seen Jack Dorsey engage with the retail community as much as he has recently. It seems the response to the recent earnings call really did light a fire under him. Just look through his replies . He's been replying directly to retail analysts like myself that provide in-depth coverage of the company, its products, and its growth runway. X.com There are many such examples. Engaging with the retail community on X has become much more common in recent years, with many CEOs and other executives using it as a vehicle to communicate directly to a retail audience. Again, returning to my thesis: engagement with the retail community ensures investors understand the strategic direction the company is pursuing. It's not necessarily enough to launch innovative new products; you also need to market them well and ensure the market understands the innovation. The final component of the stock's recovery is Bitcoin. The company's full-stack bitcoin offerings are attracting more attention as the leading cryptocurrency hits new all-time highs and Bitcoiners gather at bitcoin 2025 . Block's Bitcoin Strategy Block has one of the most robust Bitcoin strategies of any publicly traded company. It offers products aimed at accelerating the adoption of bitcoin as a currency, the capability to buy bitcoin easily and hold it safely, and soon the ability to mine bitcoin. The company also has a Bitcoin treasury dollar-cost-averaging strategy. In other words, it holds bitcoin, allows users to buy bitcoin, is increasing access to bitcoin mining, offers cold storage capabilities, and supports the open-source development community. The biggest product announcement to date for Block's bitcoin strategy, however, came just recently on May 27th at the Bitcoin Conference. The company launched a pilot test allowing Square sellers to accept bitcoin as payment. It hopes to have this feature widely available by 2026. x.com These transactions will be processed on the Lightning Network , a payments protocol on the Bitcoin Blockchain that greatly improves processing time for transactions. Historically, a major criticism of bitcoin as a currency is that transactions take roughly 10 minutes to settle. This is due to the design of the blockchain itself, in which new blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes. Each block contains a variety of data, most importantly it contains a 'merkle root' expression of all transactions that were accepted by nodes during that block time. This is slow and clunky. Lightning, on the other hand, essentially allows two nodes to stow some bitcoin away in a multi-sig channel. The two parties within this channel can now transact privately and instantaneously in a private channel off the main blockchain. Next, many of these nodes can be interconnected to create a web of Lightning nodes, effectively creating the Lightning Network. The network supports multi-hop routing, where payments are forwarded throughout the web of connected channels. These transactions are enforced using hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) and can settle in milliseconds, as long as each node along the path has sufficient liquidity. Block's Cash App is Lightning compatible, and Square bitcoin payments will also rely on Lightning. This allows both Square merchants and Cash App users to transact with bitcoin instantaneously. It creates the most widely deployed bitcoin payment rail. Block's head of Bitcoin, Miles Suter, spoke at the bitcoin conference on May 28th. He mentioned that Cash App has seen a 7x increase YoY in Lightning payment volume and 25% of outbound transactions are now on Lightning. Why does this matter? It matters because Block operates a sizable Lightning channel (the 7th largest, known as c=) and earns nearly 10% bitcoin on bitcoin yield. With 189 bitcoins in the channel (according to mempool), this represents a yield of nearly 20 btc per year. At $100k per coin, this is $2m per year in passive yield on the company's bitcoin, which is otherwise sitting in its treasury. Yield is generated by Lightning nodes when they place BTC liquidity in a channel and open that channel up to route payments through it. This is non-custodial yield, meaning Block still maintains ownership of that bitcoin. They are generating yield with an asset on their balance sheet without introducing counterparty risk. If payments stop flowing, there is no risk to the bitcoin. The yield will just dry up. Bitcoin 2025 livestream The biggest question mark for Square payments, though, is on tax treatment. As it stands, bitcoin is classified as property, meaning it is a commodity and is regulated by the CFTC. Selling a commodity triggers a taxable event, requiring a calculation of profit by taking asset value at time of sale versus cost basis. On the back end of a Square bitcoin transaction, Block would sell bitcoin for the equivalent amount of USD, allowing the customer to pay in bitcoin and the merchant to receive USD. The issue is that this creates a taxable event. But how can you calculate the cost basis? It is conceivable that this is possible for bitcoin purchased through Cash App and held in Cash App, but for any bitcoin paid from an external wallet, it becomes prohibitively difficult to calculate tax. Further, this creates a two-tiered tax (capital gains and sales tax) for customers and disincentivizes use. This question is likely the reason that Block said ""The roll out... is expected to reach all eligible Square sellers in 2026, subject to applicable regulatory approvals."" in the first section of the announcement. Regardless, this move highlights how well the company is driving forward the bitcoin ecosystem. It is helping to bridge the gap of bitcoin adoption from enthusiasts to everyday people. It is building the infrastructure required to facilitate this and has the expansive two-sided merchant / consumer network required to greatly accelerate it. For those that believe that Bitcoin will play an integral role in the financial world of tomorrow, it's difficult to find a company better positioned to boom from that paradigm shift. Assuming that both bitcoin payments on Square and Proto's bitcoin mining chip reach mass rollout in 2026 (this is a fairly big assumption), Block will have successfully tied together its entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Again, this ties into my thesis of product stack deepening (bitcoin mining ASIC) and innovation in existing products (bitcoin payments on square). All that's left for the company's Bitcoin segment is to execute on this. Risks The biggest risk to the thesis of this article is in the thesis itself: execution. Block has faced challenges in the past with execution. The stock has tumbled a long way from the COVID-era highs around $280. In the past few years, Block has gone through layoffs, executive reshuffles, an influx of competitive threats, an ever-changing regulatory environment, a short report, countless analyst downgrades, mass inflation, and the fastest rate hike cycle in recent history. Not a favorable environment for a fintech. Throughout this time, they have been evolving as a company as well. Jack Dorsey sold Twitter and moved back to full-time CEO of the company and brought renewed focused on the ecosystem of ecosystems strategy. Amidst the challenging macro backdrop, the company lost focus on the Square segment. Square is still the market leader, but only by a narrow margin, with around 28% share. Cash App made up for much of this weakness for a while but hasn't grown monthly active users in 5 consecutive quarters. The stock has suffered severe multiple compression since. Despite reporting booming EPS growth, the stock is completely range-bound and has been for 3 years now. Data by YCharts Investor Takeaway We are now at a crossroads. Block's traditional finance segments, Square and Cash App, need to reaccelerate growth. The company is focused on the following things to achieve this: outbound marketing and large business acquisition for Square and network density and teen customer acquisition for Cash App. The company's bitcoin business is doing phenomenal, as we discussed, but this is largely ignored by the market. It is not yet very accretive to Block's financial results, but that will change over time. The execution risk remains. Should the company fail to reignite Square and Cash App growth, the stock will continue lagging the market. This is the opportunity, though. The market is basically pricing in a lack of execution. Despite exceptional EPS growth, the stock trades at only 22x forward PE. Using estimated 2026 earnings, the stock trades at 15x forward PE. Meanwhile, EPS is inflecting underpinned by robust subscription & services segment growth.

Known for drastically reducing gas fees while enhancing transaction speeds, Arbitrum is emerging as one of the most adopted scaling platforms. With its Orbit upgrade expanding compatibility and new dApps launching rapidly, the ARB token is gaining governance relevance. The network’s surge in usage highlights the growing demand for faster, more efficient Ethereum-compatible chains.Even with these advances, Arbitrum did not address the full spectrum of challenges facing blockchain today—developer friction, real-world onboarding, and cross-domain utility. Qubetics ($TICS) rises to meet those demands. Designed as a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain, Qubetics combines breakthrough development infrastructure with streamlined utility tools, making it a strong candidate for the top cryptocurrency to buy in 2025. With deep developer accessibility, security-first frameworks, and smart contract modularity, Qubetics sets a higher standard for future-ready digital finance ecosystems. Meanwhile, Near Protocol (NEAR) is riding a 20% monthly gain as it tests the neckline of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. Priced at $2.94, the token is nearing the $3 resistance zone, which could trigger a breakout if momentum sustains. Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network has climbed from $124 million in early April to $173 million, reflecting rising DeFi activity. While DEX volume is holding above $17 million, a 7% drop in the stablecoin market cap hints at looming liquidity constraints. Still, NEAR’s technical structure and increasing TVL show promise for growth and adoption. Qubetics: Developer-Centric Innovation That Defines the Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Qubetics is rapidly becoming a front-runner among the top cryptocurrency to buy for developers, businesses, and early adopters. At the core of its value proposition are two powerful tools— QubeQode , a simplified smart contract language designed for efficiency and security, and Qubetics IDE , a custom integrated development environment that allows professionals to build, test, and deploy applications with minimal friction. This developer-first ecosystem lowers the barrier to entry, offering intuitive tooling while ensuring formal verification and modularity remain intact. For businesses, Qubetics creates an accessible path to blockchain integration. The Qubetics IDE supports multi-chain deployment, on-chain automation, and dynamic permission systems that streamline enterprise operations. Professionals can build sector-specific tools without navigating steep learning curves. Individuals benefit from secure dApp engagement and decentralized access, backed by seamless updates and zero downtime architecture. Qubetics Presale ROI and Analyst Insight This foundation of utility is matched by surging community momentum. The ongoing crypto presale of Qubetics has reached stage 36, selling over 514 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,300 participants, with $17.5 million raised. At the current presale price of $0.3064, Qubetics provides a unique entry point into one of the fastest-growing Web3 ecosystems. Those who entered at stage 1, priced at $0.01, are already looking at a 2,964% ROI. Yet the presale isn’t over—participants entering now are still strategically positioned for compelling gains. If $TICS reaches $1 post-launch, stage 36 buyers see a 226% ROI. At $5, the return expands to 1,531%, and at $6 it climbs to 1,857%. A move to $10 implies a 3,163% return, while a post-mainnet rally to $15 could deliver up to 4,794% ROI. The presale continues to attract developers and backers seeking the top cryptocurrency to buy before market-wide awareness kicks in. With innovation, traction, and tools already in place, Qubetics is not just a potential contender—it’s setting the benchmark. Arbitrum: Ethereum’s Most Practical Scaling Layer Gains Traction Arbitrum’s rise as a Layer-2 solution has made it a staple for Ethereum-based projects aiming to minimize gas fees and accelerate execution. Full EVM compatibility allows seamless deployment of existing Ethereum apps, making the migration process effortless. Governance under the ARB token allows participants to vote on network upgrades, staking mechanics, and long-term development strategy. With the Arbitrum Orbit upgrade, new use cases continue to roll out, and projects are increasingly choosing the platform for its speed and affordability. Arbitrum is viewed as essential infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, especially as the demand for L2 adoption climbs across DeFi, NFT, and gaming. Arbitrum is among the top cryptocurrency to buy for participants seeking proven scalability and Ethereum synergy, but it lacks the holistic builder toolset and modular design offered by Qubetics. Near Protocol: Momentum Builds Amid Technical Reversal Hopes Near Protocol (NEAR) is testing a breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, suggesting bullish strength. With its current price nearing the critical $3 neckline, the next few sessions may define its short-term trajectory. The MACD indicator is nearing a bullish crossover, while TVL has steadily climbed to $173 million. Still, caution exists. The 7% drop in Near’s stablecoin market cap suggests some users are pulling liquidity, raising questions about the network’s short-term capital health. That said, strong on-chain metrics like consistent DEX volume and rising TVL indicate a rebound could be near. NEAR is positioned among the top cryptocurrency to buy for those seeking trend reversals backed by on-chain growth, but it lacks the early-stage ROI opportunity and developer integration edge seen in Qubetics. Final Thoughts Arbitrum delivers scalability. Near shows strengthening DeFi metrics and technical promise. Yet only Qubetics offers a comprehensive environment built for speed, flexibility, and real-world usability—all while enabling entry at an early presale phase with unmatched upside. Qubetics stands apart with QubeQode and Qubetics IDE—developer tools that simplify smart contract creation and streamline enterprise adoption. The numbers are clear: over 27,300 participants, $17.5 million raised, and more than 514 million tokens sold. With the presale still open at $0.3064, this is more than a blockchain opportunity—it’s a chance to gain early access to a network with foundational advantages. For those seeking the top cryptocurrency to buy with tangible utility, scalable potential, and immediate access—Qubetics delivers the full package.

45319694,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69123,1748673263,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Zumo Acknowledges XRP Powerful Use Cases As Bridge Currency,https://timestabloid.com/zumo-acknowledges-xrp-powerful-uses-cases-as-bridge-currency/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has drawn attention to a newly surfaced insight from a Zumo report, identifying Ripple’s XRP token as a highly suitable candidate for wholesale applications within single-currency domestic zones. The assessment appears in Zumo’s publication, titled “Digital assets 2023: identifying the opportunities across the enterprise landscape.” It refers to the specific benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in business-to-business (B2B) digital asset payments. Ripple’s XRP token—> “attractive for WHOLESALE applications in domestic/single-currency-zone contexts, where blockchain/DLT-derived advantages (cost/ speed/programmability/automated reconciliation) can potentially be realised without the awkwardness of the digital asset fiat… https://t.co/DDvBlO58Cb pic.twitter.com/PDa15AYV1N — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 28, 2025 Enterprise Friction in Crypto-to-Fiat Conversion The report makes the case that the inefficiencies and friction associated with converting cryptoassets into local fiat currencies remain a core challenge in early-stage enterprise adoption. The analysis specifically notes that many crypto-based payments currently require off-ramps back into fiat to complete transactions or satisfy regulatory, tax, and accounting requirements. This hinders their seamless integration into operational payment flows. Ripple and XRP Positioned for Domestic Optimization Zumo highlights several blockchain projects that aim to address these cost and conversion issues. Ripple is mentioned directly alongside Stellar in the context of working to reduce these frictions, with the report calling out XRP and its intermediary token role as part of this effort. In a key section, the authors write that the XRP token is “attractive for wholesale applications in domestic/single-currency-zone contexts, where blockchain/DLT-derived advantages (cost/speed/programmability/automated reconciliation) can potentially be realised without the awkwardness of the digital asset fiat bridge.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This analysis suggests that XRP’s architecture and integration features make it particularly well-suited for domestic wholesale environments, where the need to convert between different fiat currencies is removed. Institutions can more directly benefit from blockchain’s technical efficiencies. Gradual Adoption Within Enterprise Financial Infrastructure The commentary aligns with Ripple’s long-standing positioning of XRP as a liquidity and settlement token for financial institutions and enterprises. By eliminating the need for complex cross-border fiat bridges in domestic contexts, XRP may offer banks and corporations a viable path to DLT integration without requiring full-scale disruption of existing fiat systems. This has implications for how enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure may be deployed in the near term, focusing first on domestic efficiencies before scaling into more complex, cross-border models. CBDC Complexity Reinforces XRP’s Immediate Use Case The Zumo report also includes a statement from HSBC Managing Director Mark Williamson, reinforcing the broader challenges surrounding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and digital assets in cross-border use. Williamson emphasizes the need to solve what he calls the “CBDC Rubik’s cube,” encompassing wholesale and retail models, token- and account-based systems, as well as primary and secondary market integration. The inclusion of such commentary further contextualizes the digital asset landscape, within which XRP is positioned as a practical tool for enterprise-level financial applications. SMQKE’s tweet underscores growing institutional acknowledgment of XRP’s potential in practical, regulated settings. The recognition of XRP’s advantages—specifically cost reduction, speed, and programmability—adds to the token’s evolving narrative as a purpose-built settlement mechanism within tokenized finance frameworks. As enterprises continue to evaluate and adopt blockchain solutions, XRP’s utility in streamlined, domestic payment environments may become increasingly relevant.

The AI pace of change feels unlike anything we’ve witnessed before – distinct from the shifts brought by mobile, social media, or cloud computing. This isn’t just a feeling; it’s a reality underscored by data. Venture capitalist Mary Meeker, renowned for her previous ‘Internet Trends’ reports, has released a new, extensive slideshow report titled “Trends — Artificial Intelligence.” Across its 340 pages, the word “unprecedented” appears 51 times, specifically used to describe the speed of AI’s development, adoption, investment, and usage. As Meeker writes, “The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented, as supported by the data.” Understanding the Unprecedented AI Speed What exactly makes this wave of AI different? The data points highlighted in the Mary Meeker report paint a clear picture of acceleration. Here are some key indicators: User Adoption: Achieving 800 million users in just 17 months, as seen with platforms like ChatGPT, is a speed of consumer adoption never before recorded for a new technology. Company Growth: The rate at which new AI companies are reaching high annual recurring revenue (ARR) milestones is significantly faster than in previous tech cycles. Cost Reduction (Inference): The cost of using AI models (inference costs), calculated per 1 million tokens, has dropped dramatically by 99% over the past two years, according to research cited by Meeker. This rapid decrease makes AI more accessible and fuels wider adoption. Cost Increase (Training): While usage costs fall, the cost of training large AI models has surged, sometimes reaching up to $1 billion. This highlights the immense investment required at the foundational level of AI development. This combination of rapid user adoption and plunging usage costs, despite high training costs, creates a unique market dynamic. What’s Driving the AI Adoption Speed? Beyond user demand, several factors contribute to the astonishing AI adoption speed documented by Meeker. Competition is fierce, leading companies to quickly match and improve upon features offered by rivals, often at lower costs. The rise of open-source AI models, particularly from international players, further intensifies this competition and lowers barriers to entry. Hardware advancements are also playing a crucial role. Meeker points out significant efficiency gains in specialized AI chips. For example, Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell GPU is vastly more energy-efficient per token than its 2014 predecessor. Companies like Google and Amazon are heavily investing in developing their own custom AI chips (TPUs and Trainium, respectively) at scale for their cloud infrastructure. These are not minor initiatives; they are described as “foundational bets” that enable faster and cheaper AI processing, directly impacting the pace of adoption. Exploring Key AI Technology Trends The report delves into several critical AI technology trends shaping the current landscape. The shift towards more efficient hardware, the increasing sophistication of models, and the proliferation of specialized AI applications are all contributing to this accelerated pace. The competition between proprietary models and open-source alternatives is also a significant trend, driving innovation and potentially lowering costs for end-users and businesses. While the technological progress is undeniable and happening at an unprecedented AI speed, the financial returns story is less clear-cut. Venture capital is flowing into AI companies rapidly, but these companies, along with cloud providers, are also incurring massive expenses due to the infrastructure demands of AI development and deployment. The significant investment required for computing power, data storage, and talent means that profitability for many remains a future goal. Benefits, Challenges, and the Path Ahead The rapid advancements and dropping inference costs are largely beneficial for consumers and enterprises. They gain access to increasingly powerful AI tools and services at more affordable rates, fostering innovation and efficiency across various sectors. This is a direct result of the intense competition and technological progress highlighted in the Mary Meeker report . However, the primary challenge remains identifying which companies will successfully navigate the high investment requirements and intense competition to become profitable, long-term leaders in the AI space. As Meeker aptly puts it, “Only time will tell which side of the money-making equation the current AI aspirants will land.” For individuals and businesses, the actionable insight is clear: stay informed and be prepared for continuous, rapid change. The AI revolution is not slowing down; understanding its drivers and implications is crucial for navigating the future landscape, whether you are involved in technology, finance, or any industry being reshaped by AI. In conclusion, Mary Meeker’s report confirms what many have sensed: the current era of AI development and adoption is truly unprecedented in its speed and scope. Driven by technological advancements, fierce competition, and massive investment, the AI pace of change is reshaping industries and presenting both incredible opportunities and significant challenges.

Bitcoin is down over 2% today, trading at $103,700. Smart contract platforms also took a big hit as Solana fell 6.3%, Sui dropped 7.8%, and Avalanche slid 7.3%. Crypto stocks were also affected as Bitdeer (BTDR) sank 8.3% after a big rally, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) dipped 2.7% and Coinbase (COIN) lost 1.3%. U.S.-China Trade Tensions Startle Crypto Markets The rising U.S.-China tensions are back in focus after a brief truce earlier this month. President Trump accused China of violating the tariff agreement, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox interview that trade talks with Chinese representatives had “stalled.” In response, China called on the U.S. to “immediately correct its erroneous actions and cease discriminatory restrictions,” according to the BBC. Earlier, the easing of tensions had fueled a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin, but the renewed conflict could now erase those gains. Memecoins See Sharp Pullback Bitcoin has dropped 6% over the past week. Whale activity shows signs of a comeback, but technical signals are still flashing warning signs. A death cross also looms for Bitcoin, and if it falls below the $104,584 support, it could slide further toward $100,694. Bulls need to reclaim $106,726 to regain control and prevent deeper losses. Memecoins also saw a sharp pullback, with over $10 billion wiped from their market cap in just seven days. It dropped from $74 billion to $64 billion, which is the lowest since May 9. Over $11.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options were to expire yesterday , which had a major impact on their short-term price action. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Liquidations Nearly $1B Today: Time to Exit and Take Profits? , Open Interest Drops, Liquidations Hit $800M The Fear and Greed Index has also dropped from 74 to 69, a three-week low. Over 217,000 traders were liquidated recently, with over $800 million in total liquidations across the crypto market. Over the past 24 hours, there have been $716 million in total liquidations. Bitcoin futures saw a $3.7 billion drop in open interest as BTC fell from $108,000 to $104,500. This sharp pullback signals a healthy reset, clearing out overleveraged positions and cooling market hype. While Bitcoin could soon dip to $100,000, however, data shows that a drop below that level could be short-lived. CryptoQuant’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart shows there is only mild profit-taking, which is far less than the sell-offs seen at market tops in 2024. This hints that the market isn’t overheated and Bitcoin’s uptrend may still have room to run. If Bitcoin drops below $100,000, the $96,000 would be a key support level attracting buyers and limiting further drops. Trader Altcoin Sherpa points to a strong support zone between $102K–$104.5K and expects a bounce that could push Bitcoin above $107K in the coming days . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

An analyst suggests that holding the current range over the weekend will be key for the long-awaited rally back to $200. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Solana Hits Multi-Week Low Amid the crypto market pullback, most cryptocurrencies are recording a red Friday, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) momentarily losing some key levels. Solana, one of the cycle’s leading Altcoins, followed the rest of the market and registered a 6% retracement in the daily timeframe. SOL has seen a significant recovery from its multi-month downtrend, which led the token to hit a 14-month low of $95 during the early April retraces. Over the past month and a half, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed multiple crucial levels, setting the stage for a potential rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the key $180 resistance despite hitting a three-month high of $187 a week ago. A reclaim of this key barrier could push SOL’s price toward the $200 mark, enabling a rally to new highs. Today’s price action has sent Solana to a 22-day low of $156 after losing its $164-$180 price range and the $160 support zone for the first time since the May 8 breakout. Trader and analyst Crypto Bullet shared a bearish outlook for Solana, suggesting that the token will underperform for the rest of the year. He highlighted SOL’s trading pair against ETH, noting that the cryptocurrency has been in a rising wedge in the weekly chart since the Q4 2024 rally. According to the SOL/ETH chart posted by the trader, the cryptocurrency has broken down out of the formation after losing the 0.069 mark. To Crypto Bullet, this signals that “ETH will soon pump way harder than SOL.” All Eyes On SOL’s Weekly Close Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Solana is attempting to continue Weekly Closing within its Range High resistance, which is key for its long-term rally. He previously explained that the cryptocurrency re-entered its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range after successfully reclaiming the $120 barrier last month and consolidating within the $160-$175 range high. To the analyst, SOL’s price “needs to continue demonstrating price stability” around this zone, as that is what is “required for SOL to break out from this range into the $200+ levels.” He affirmed that Solana needs to aim for a retest similar to late 2024, when the cryptocurrency built a base around the Range High ahead of the breakout with multiple weekly closes near the resistance zone, which led to a massive breakout to the $200 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeating Early 2024’s Playbook – $3,800 Target In Sight? Rekt Capital highlighted that SOL has been successfully retesting this area as support over the past few weeks. However, he warned that cryptocurrency mustn’t close below the current price zone as it would “tease a possible loss of this region as support.” A drop below this range could lead to a retrace into the Range Low, between the $120-$135 mark. “Price stability at the Orange Range High going forward is thus key here,” he concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $159, an 11.6% decline in the weekly timeframe.

New U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings show Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 – a 6.64% increase in three months. According to the filing, Buffett has allocated most of the firm’s cash reserves to US Treasuries as of Q1 2025, followed by investments in equity securities at $263.735 billion. Berkshire also has a $36.892 billion cash position as of last quarter, which ended in March. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire’s trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan’s holdings at $297.8 billion. If Warren Buffett’s investment firm were a nation, it would be the 11th-largest foreign holder of Treasury Securities, just behind France’s $363.1 billion, Ireland’s $329.3 billion and Switzerland’s $311.6 billion holdings. Berkshire’s push for yield on its cash comes after the firm offloaded $3.23 billion worth of shares in three US banking giants last quarter. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million.

These texts detail Ripple’s compatibility with existing financial standards and networks, suggesting that Ripple’s distributed ledger technology can operate in conjunction with, rather than in replacement of, traditional systems. Yes, Ripple can integrate with NACHA, SWIFT and the Federal Reserve. Documented 4x. https://t.co/HYf3336Xd1 pic.twitter.com/DIoeS5v7wA — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 29, 2025 NACHA and Ripple: Parallel Roles in Payment Governance One excerpt underscores the idea that Ripple could be integrated into or modeled after a self-regulatory body like NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association). NACHA governs ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions in the U.S. and sets rules and responsibilities for financial institutions. The document indicates that Ripple’s structure, based on distributed and decentralized user participation, aligns with the framework NACHA provides. The implication is that Ripple could operate within the same regulatory scope without disrupting existing legal and operational frameworks. It also notes that NACHA’s rules could be extended to define how financial institutions interact with Ripple. SWIFT’s Messaging Standards and Ripple’s Settlement Layer Another section cited in the tweet distinguishes SWIFT and Ripple . While SWIFT operates as a messaging system that does not settle payments itself, Ripple offers a full settlement layer using its distributed ledger. Despite their functional differences, the document explicitly states that “SWIFT and Ripple could easily exist in the same space,” including scenarios where SWIFT could utilize Ripple’s distributed ledger . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This speaks directly to concerns about redundancy or conflict between traditional messaging systems and blockchain-based solutions. The documentation confirms that interoperability, rather than exclusivity, is a feasible and perhaps intended design goal. Ripple’s Settlement Protocol and Global Institutional Adoption A further excerpt outlines the possibility that several financial institution networks could be built on top of Ripple’s common settlement protocol. The example given involves NACHA using Ripple’s infrastructure to create standardized rules for dispute resolution, compliance, and other aspects of payment processing. This is further supported by the mention of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) region banks in Europe potentially adopting a similar approach. The potential scope of Ripple’s network is therefore not limited to the U.S., reinforcing its global relevance. Federal Reserve Compatibility and Standards Enforcement Finally, one document emphasizes the role of regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Reserve, in setting and enforcing standards for Ripple. The excerpt clearly states that messaging standards, such as those used by SWIFT, can be integrated into Ripple. This indicates that Ripple is built with compliance and interoperability in mind, allowing it to operate within the boundaries set by central regulatory institutions. The documentation highlighted by SMQKE provides concrete references to Ripple’s ability to work alongside and within existing financial systems such as NACHA, SWIFT , and the Federal Reserve. Rather than acting as a disruptive force that seeks to replace these institutions, Ripple is positioned as a complementary system capable of enhancing efficiency while remaining compatible with established regulatory frameworks. This perspective, backed by multiple citations from formal texts, reinforces Ripple’s potential role in the modernization of global payment systems.

45320746,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738264,1748675461,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45320746.jpeg,FTX begins its second payout round of $5 billion,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ftx-kicks-off-5b-payout-to-creditors/,"FTX has started its second distribution round of payments to its creditors. The exchange is set to pay more than $5 billion to holders in the Plan’s Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who met pre-distribution requirements. In a post on X on Friday, the FTX stated that creditors should begin seeing the funds reflected in their accounts within one to three business days. FTX revealed second round payout breakdown FTX previously announced that the second distribution would include a 72% payout for Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims, 54% for US Customer Entitlement Claims, and 61% each for General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims. Convenience Claims are set to receive a 120% payout. The exchange also stated that all eligible creditors will receive funds through its distribution service partners, Kraken and Bitgo. On Friday, John J. Ray III, Plan Administrator of the FTX Recovery Trust, commented on the rollout’s start, saying: “Today’s announcement represents continued progress returning cash to FTX’s customers and creditors. I am proud of the outstanding success of the recoveries to date. Our work continues on recovering more for creditors and resolving outstanding claims.” John J. Ray III On X, the exchange also asked customers to remain cautious of phishing emails and scam websites from channels that may appear to look like the FTX Customer Portal. Meanwhile, crypto investors and speculators are waiting for the impact of reimbursements, knowing how they could easily sway digital asset market prices if recipients sell or swap their funds on retail exchanges. In February, FTX completed its first round of repayments, distributing $1.2 billion to holders with claims under $50,000. At the time, Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, suggested that a significant portion of these funds might find their way back into the crypto markets. FTX payouts are based on 2022 crypto prices During its first round of payments, Julian Grigo, head of institutions and fintech at asset custody, argued that some creditors may have been dissatisfied. He claimed that while its reimbursements brought relief to some of its customers, there were still some concerns over the plan. He argued that most holders will only get a portion of their original holdings, and then again, they will only be repaid based on asset prices at the time of the exchange’s collapse. BTC-related repayments, especially, have troubled investors since they are calculated using November 2022 valuations, when it was only trading at around $20,000. Since then, the crypto asset has risen in value, currently trading between $90,000 and $112,000. The pricing differences have undoubtedly caused analysts to question fair value determination in bankruptcy proceedings. FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri and other creditors had previously filed a petition to have the exchange repay customers as per current market prices. However, the court ruled against the proposal, and Kavuri claims that, as a result, creditors received only 10%–25% of the current value of their crypto holdings. Earlier this year, Kavuri also called the people’s attention to multiple creditors in 163 countries who are ineligible to receive reimbursements. He stated that countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Greenland, Iran, Russia, and China have imposed restrictions on custodial exchanges Kraken and BitGo; hence, residents cannot claim distributions. He noted that China is the largest jurisdiction ineligible for FTX claim distributions, seeing that it makes up about 8% of the global customer base.

However, the whale still holds 497.5 billion PEPE tokens worth $6.41 million.

These are Shiba Inu (SHIB) with whispers of another potential 16,290% rally and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a rising altcoin challenging legacy tokens with aggressive growth momentum. Mutuum Finance is emerging as the best altcoin to invest in now, drawing eyes with its low entry point and high-return projections. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.4 million with over 11,500 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. As the market shifts and investors weigh what cryptocurrency to buy now, this matchup between legacy hype and fresh innovation may define which portfolios outperform in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Upside as Burn Rate and Community Fuel Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000014, with minimal downward action but resolute within the broader market consolidation context. Overall, all things considered, SHIB continues to gain speculative attention in spite of recent price stasis owing to its continuous burn programs, this week’s 41 million token burn among them, aimed at reducing circulating supply and enhancing scarcity. With long-term forecasts pointing to potential moves towards $0.0001, several analysts are forecasting over 600% returns are within reach in a healthy bull cycle. With SHIB building increasing utility via its Shibarium Layer-2 network and being well-supported by its community, it is a top pick among meme-based investments. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also attracting investor attention for its low-cap growth potential ahead of the next cycle. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built not to fall to the collapse risk of its algorithmic counterparts. This transparent and secure architecture, supported by open-source smart contracts and now formally attested through the completion of a Certik audit, guarantees healthy financial transactions. With the intersection of next-generation lending technology and robust infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is reshaping the future of decentralized finance. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.4 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,500 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. SHIB may offer explosive returns through speculation and burn mechanics, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings real DeFi innovation, strong utility, and audited security. With $9.4M raised, 11,500+ investors, and a presale price of $0.03 (set to rise by 16.67%), early buyers could see 100% gains by launch. Act now before the next price jump.

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum price of $19.30 with an average of $16.75. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $61.24 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $4.48 (+0.49%) Market Cap $7.08 Billion Trading Volume $200.27 Million Circulating Supply 1.58B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $4.61 24-hour Low $4.36 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.64% 50-Day SMA $4.25 14-Day RSI 48.32 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $4.78 Polkadot price analysis: DOT faces bearish domination around $4 Downtrend persists. DOT stays in a bearish pattern, with repeated tests of support and resistance levels showing continued seller control. Price pressure tightens resistance at $4.22, holds firm, while $3.91 is tested repeatedly, increasing the risk of a breakdown. Buyers’ weak recovery efforts have failed to regain momentum, leaving DOT near its session low and signaling hesitation to reverse the trend. Polkadot (DOT) is currently priced at $3.96, reflecting a 5.78% drop on May 31, 2025. The daily session opened with sharp declines, driven by increased selling pressure. The intraday low reached $3.91, while the high was capped at $4.22. The current price action signals a prevailing bearish sentiment with sellers dominating the market. DOT’s all-time high stands at $55.00 from November 4, 2021, and its all-time low is $2.69, set on August 20, 2020. This marks a steep 92.76% decline from its peak but a 47.86% rise from its historical low. Polkadot on 1-day chart: DOT has a persistent downtrend and bearish momentum DOT established a downtrend during the daily timeframe that persisted through May. The chart shows multiple failed attempts to break above $4.20, leading to further declines. The daily candlesticks exhibit strong bearish control, with long upper wicks and solid red bodies. Sellers are aggressively pushing prices lower, leaving limited room for recovery within the daily session. DOT/USDT Chart: 1-day Volume patterns indicate a substantial increase in sell-side activity, while the RSI trends toward oversold conditions. The MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, suggesting sustained downward momentum. If $3.91 breaks, DOT could slide further. However, if buyers manage to reclaim $4.22, a potential reversal may occur. Polkadot on 4-hour chart: DOT consolidation with strong resistance and weak support The 4-hour chart reveals a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows, confirming the bearish market structure. DOT’s resistance at $4.22 has held firm, preventing any upward move. Sellers have consistently rejected breakout attempts, with price levels returning toward support at $3.91. DOT/USDT Chart: 4-hour The RSI is below 30, indicating ongoing pressure. The MACD remains negative, with both lines diverging downward. If $3.91 is broken decisively, DOT could face deeper declines, with the next key support below. A breakout above $4.22 could signal an intraday reversal, but current momentum suggests this is unlikely without a shift in volume. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $4.62 BUY SMA 5 $4.93 SELL SMA 10 $4.78 SELL SMA 21 $4.47 BUY SMA 50 $4.13 BUY SMA 100 $4.42 BUY SMA 200 $4.9 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $4.35 BUY EMA 5 $4.17 BUY EMA 10 $4.07 BUY EMA 21 $4.13 BUY EMA 50 $4.44 BUY EMA 100 $4.95 SELL EMA 200 $5.4 SELL What to expect next? Polkadot’s (DOT) price remains under pressure as it consolidates between resistance at $4.22 and support at $3.91. If sellers continue to dominate and the $3.91 support breaks decisively, DOT may head lower toward the next key support, intensifying the bearish trend. However, a sudden reversal above $4.22 could shift sentiment, opening the way for a potential short-term recovery. The overall market mood for DOT appears bearish, with traders watching for either a breakdown or a rebound from these critical levels. Until a clear breakout occurs, consolidation with a downward bias is likely to persist. Is Polkadot a good investment? Currently, Polkadot (DOT) faces intense downward pressure, with technicals pointing to a prevailing bearish trend. Resistance at $4.22 and repeated testing of $3.91 support suggest limited upward momentum and heightened risk of further declines. The long-term potential of DOT depends on broader market recovery and the network’s continued development. However, the current price action and market structure indicate caution for new entries until an apparent reversal or strong support is confirmed. Traders should monitor key levels closely for signs of stabilization or further breakdown. Why is Polkadot down today Polkadot (DOT) is down 5.78% today, trading at $3.96, due to sustained selling pressure in the broader market and persistent bearish sentiment. The resistance at $4.22 has prevented any significant upward move, while repeated tests of the $3.91 support level have signaled market hesitation and vulnerability to further declines. Will Polkadot recover? Polkadot (DOT) shows signs of recovery with a recent upward trend. If favorable market conditions continue, we could see a bullish trend, and Polkadot has the potential to recover.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021.

In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space.

In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8.

This announcement follows a decision made earlier this year confirming that these tokens do not meet the legal definition of securities under U.S. law. Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasized that while meme coins are part of a vibrant crypto niche, they do not fall under the agency’s regulatory purview. Peirce made the statement during the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas , noting that investors in meme coins should not expect traditional protections from the SEC. SEC Takes a Hands-Off Approach — Similar to NFTs Peirce drew comparisons between the current surge in meme coin interest and the NFT boom of 2021. Like NFTs, meme coins often fall outside regulatory frameworks, meaning buyers are engaging with minimal oversight or recourse in the event of fraud or volatility. The meme coin segment has grown substantially, with a current market capitalization of over $62 billion and a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $10 billion. Top tokens in this category include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, $TRUMP, and Bonk. The $TRUMP Token: A Politically Charged Meme Coin Launched in January shortly before the presidential inauguration, the $TRUMP token surged to $44.28 before stabilizing around $10.71. Notably, around 80% of its token supply is reportedly controlled by the Trump Organization and its affiliates, raising concerns over potential conflicts of interest. Lawmakers such as Senator Richard Blumenthal have raised ethical questions about the Trump family potentially profiting from crypto projects while holding political influence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? , Regulatory Shift or Political Strategy? The SEC has also recently dropped its legal battle against Binance , a move many see as reflective of the current administration’s more crypto-friendly stance. While some speculate that these regulatory decisions may align with President Trump’s pro-crypto policies , Commissioner Peirce firmly denied any political motivation. “Our goal is to create a better regulatory environment for all participants,” she said . Peirce also defended the SEC’s decision to rescind Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which previously restricted banks from offering crypto custody services. Investor Takeaway: Proceed With Caution While the SEC’s clarification offers legal clarity, it simultaneously underscores the risk for retail investors. Without regulatory protection, meme coin investments remain highly speculative. As this space continues to grow and intertwine with political narratives, it is increasingly important for investors to conduct due diligence, verify token ownership structures, and consider the broader implications of their investment choices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

45321364,https://nulltx.com/?p=150090,1748676956,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Pump.fun Sends $25.7M in SOL to Kraken as Transaction Fee Revenue Surges,https://nulltx.com/pump-fun-sends-25-7m-in-sol-to-kraken-as-transaction-fee-revenue-surges/,"Pump.fun , a top platform in the Solana ecosystem for creating and trading meme tokens, has made the news again—but this time, it’s not about a new meme token. At 11:30 AM (UTC) yesterday, pump.fun moved a colossal 156,000 SOL (equivalent to $25.71 million) to the centralized exchange Kraken. This transaction represents almost three weeks’ worth of stale fee income. And it isn’t just another horn-blowing at what has to be regarded as an insane revenue-generating platform. This is more than a profit. The pump.fun team’s actions have serious implications for the Solana ecosystem and might lead to the latest token generation event on Solana. The platform’s revenue model, which charges fees on token launches and transactions, continues to rake in millions of dollars on a consistent basis. According to data from DeFiLlama, pump.fun has been averaging around $1.3 million per day in transaction fees. The timing of this recent transfer aligns closely with that daily figure over the past 19 days, pointing to a systematic off-ramping strategy employed by the platform to convert on-chain earnings into fiat or centralized holdings. Regular Transfers Suggest Systematic Revenue Strategy It is not the first time that pump.fun has made a move like this. On-chain data illustrates that the platform routinely accumulates transaction fees in SOL over a period of one to two weeks before transferring them out in bulk to Kraken. These withdrawals are part of a long-standing pattern — a well-oiled revenue engine quietly extracting value from one of the most speculative corners of the crypto market. According to reports, pump.fun has sold more than 4.025 million SOL over the past year. The total roughly amounts to $727 million. That volume has been liquidated at an average price of $180.70 per SOL, a not-so-obvious indication of what might be the first truly profitable crypto exchange. pump. fun 在半小时前将 15.6 万枚 SOL ($25.71M) 手续费收入转进 Kraken。 根据 defillama 上的数据，近期 pump. fun 每天的手续费收入在 $130 万左右。这跟他们本次隔了 19 天转出的 SOL 价值是比较吻合的。 pump. fun 每在积累了一到两周的手续费收入后就会将这些 SOL 转进… https://t.co/acS6GMtMrq pic.twitter.com/xsWvfhKqbV — 余烬 (@EmberCN) May 30, 2025 Most of our activity in crypto space happens on exchanges. So if you pay close attention to almost any crypto project or platform these days, you’ll notice they all say something like: “Watch us on exchanges!” Or, “Follow our price fluctuations on exchanges!” With this in mind, let’s try to understand the events of the last few days under an even_mi_meme umbrella. Meme Token Frenzy Fuels the Engine pump.fun has achieved current success due to the meme token frenzy, especially among those on the Solana blockchain. In recent months, there has been a wild uptick in the number of inexpensive, viral tokens being thrown around on Solana — many of which seem to be spun up within moments on platforms like pump.fun. Even if most of these tokens are bound to death spiral anyway, the sheer volume and transactional activity of them across the pump.fun ecosystem is generating huge fee income for the platform. What makes pump.fun unique is how straightforward its interface is and how large its user base is. Every new token that gets launched pays a fee, and every trade adds to the transaction fee pool — which the platform collects in SOL. With the hype around meme coins showing no sign of letting up, especially on Solana, pump.fun is perfectly positioned to capture more of this slice of the mania-fueled economy. The most recent $25.71 million payment to Kraken underscores the effect spinning into action here. More user speculation means more fees, and those fees lead directly to greater liquidity for pump.fun and its principals. What This Means for the Broader Solana Ecosystem Pump.fun consistently brings in a healthy income; this shows Solana is a healthy network. The mean transaction volume of pump.fun is a string of soloing on Solana; this means the pump.fun is confirming Solana’s claims of being a low-fee, fast-speed network. Some people suggest more and more that the meme coin activity is unsustainable, and that’s just a signal for the crypto whales to pull out. In fact, the raw numbers coming out of pump.fun suggest otherwise: They’re real, driving real volume, and they’re bringing in real dinero. Platform sends regular payments to Kraken; why? Periodic payments from the platform to Kraken raise more questions than they answer about pump.fun’s sustainability and long-term planning. Is the platform just a short-term liquidity extractor, or does it have some kind of long-term roadmap? So far, the team has kept largely mum on the question. No matter what happens from this point, pump.fun has made itself a potent presence in the current crypto world. As long as guesswork crypto trading remains alive and well — and as long as users are willing to pay for the privilege — pump.fun will likely continue to be one of the most minting-at-will entities in the DeFi space. For both watchers and merchants, the communication is evident: keep an eye on the fees. For in the midst of a speculative frenzy, pump.fun is almost assuredly right there at the peak, collecting its quiet, ancillary profits, and sending tens of millions in SOL out to Kraken.

Massive amounts of ETH have flowed out of exchanges, suggesting that a move into cold storage has taken place. Cold storage is when traders move their assets off exchanges and into hardware wallets, a storage solution that is much more secure than keeping crypto on an exchange. Ethereum appears to have very secure long-term holders. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Exchange Outflows Suggest Strategic Accumulation This week, Ethereum saw extremely large volumes of coins leaving centralized exchanges, which is an indicator that has usually foreshadowed an increase in the cryptocurrency’s price. When Ethereum and other altcoins are moving off exchanges in large amounts, it’s a net positive for their prices. Although Bitcoin has had a relatively stable price, Ethereum has performed significantly better and continued to do so over the same timeframe. This performance differential, along with net outflows, signals a change in sentiment. Investors seem to be moving into ETH as they anticipate major events that could catalyze the price. This sentiment has been intensified by recent spot inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds in the U.S. On May 29, those funds recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million. The funds, in fact, are riding a streak of nine consecutive days of positive net inflows. With these kinds of consistent inflows, Ethereum ETFs are a way for institutions and retail investors to access Ethereum in a regulated manner. And this kind of demand for something like an Ethereum ETF is a sign of growing accessibility for crypto. On May 29 (ET), U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net outflow of $359 million, ending a 10-day streak of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million, marking a 9-day streak of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 Dormant ICO Whales Awaken: Massive ETH Movements Raise Eyebrows Together with the wider market, two Ethereum wallets from the time of the ICO have awakened from long dormancy and are now making huge transactions that have caught the eye of blockchain analysts. An early participant in the Ethereum ICO has an address tied to it and at one time held a mind-boggling 1 million ETH. Just five hours ago, this address moved 959.69 ETH to the OKX exchange. At current market valuations, the transferred amount is approximately worth $2.54 million. Despite this massive transaction, the address still retains a whopping 50,704 ETH on-chain, valued at around $132 million. 这次是两个 ICO 巨鲸一起发力了，成本都是低至 0.31 美金的大佬 1⃣ ETH ICO 100 万枚 $ETH 巨鲸 5 小时前向 #OKX 充值 959.69 ETH，价值 254 万美元；链上仍剩余 50704 ETH，价值 1.32 亿美元 https://t.co/JFVlWHNe7N 2⃣ 2015 年 ICO 10 万枚 $ETH 的 OG 3 小时前向 #Kraken 充值 587 ETH，价值… https://t.co/xOj0szBX2C pic.twitter.com/5Rh5zgUmVE — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) May 30, 2025 Not only is this address’s holding large, but it also has a significant historical context. According to blockchain records, this wallet acquired its ETH during the ICO at the astonishingly low price of around $0.31 per coin. Such moves made by early adopters can be interpreted in various ways — they may have been profit-taking or involve a kind of strategic reallocation. This week also saw news emerge about a second wallet, believed to be associated with a participant in the 2015 Ethereum ICO and currently holding around 100,000 ETH. Just three hours ago, this wallet transferred 587 ETH to Kraken, which, at the current market rate, equates to about $1.56 million. Since March 13, 2023, the same address has sold a total of 14,398 ETH, bringing in approximately $28.47 million at an average price of $1,977. This slow and almost laboriously drawn-out sell-off pattern indicates that if this address is indeed a whale, it’s presently exiting either the Ethereum or Web3 space, or diversifying its assets. Market Implications and the Road Ahead These synchronized actions create a many-sided depiction of Ethereum’s contemporary condition. On one side, institutional investors are embracing Ethereum with a swift-paced buying frenzy, as shown by the ETF inflow now stretching across nine consecutive days. On the other side, a handful of very old and very large Ethereum holders — some of which have been clutching their assets since the Ethereum ICO back in 2014 — are starting to sell off portions of their holdings after nearly a decade. Even with these substantial sales, ETH’s price has held strong, thanks to the collective confidence in the crypto market and because of the dwindling supply of liquid Ethereum resulting from the cold wallet migrations. If the current trend of outflows holds, Ethereum may see less of an obligation to sell and more of a platform for price increases. Ethereum 2.0 is in a progressive stage of its upgrades, layer 2 adoption is rising, and ETF inflows are on the upswing, putting Ethereum (ETH) in a robust position. Yet, even with all these positive developments, there is a group of investors who could still negatively impact Ethereum’s price in the near term. Those investors are the ICO whales. Ethereum is proving its relevance yet again as the crypto market heads into the second half of 2025. It’s not just a smart contract platform; it’s a maturing financial asset drawing interest from both long-term believers and institutional capital.

In the wake of this notable development, a pseudonymous crypto journalist, known as Jungle Inc on X, has highlighted what this means for XRP and its teeming holders. VivoPower’s XRP-Focused Strategy VivoPower has successfully raised a total of $121 million in funding to implement what it describes as a comprehensive XRP-focused treasury and infrastructure strategy. Of this total, $100 million originates from Prince Abdulaziz, making his participation the most significant component of the fundraising round. This marks the first time a public company has officially committed to building its treasury operations around XRP rather than more established digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Jungle Inc, VivoPower’s strategy includes allocating capital to directly purchase and hold XRP as a reserve asset . The company also plans to build new infrastructure on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , which will support a broader pivot toward decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. As part of its strategic shift, VivoPower is preparing to spin off certain legacy divisions to focus its operations exclusively on cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. Leadership and Strategic Appointments In a notable personnel move, Ripple veteran Adam Traidman has been appointed as advisory chairman to guide the company’s transformation. Traidman, who has experience in the XRP ecosystem, is expected to assist in VivoPower’s transition into a crypto-first corporate entity with a focus on XRPL-based applications. Institutional Implications and Market Perception Jungle Inc emphasized the broader implications of this initiative. He referred to the investment as a “royal-level endorsement” of XRP and stated that the development “proves XRP’s growing DeFi and treasury use case.” He also highlighted that this move could lead to increased institutional interest in XRP, similar to how MicroStrategy’s acquisition of Bitcoin catalyzed corporate interest in BTC during previous market cycles. The announcement presents a notable inflection point in XRP’s institutional narrative. Unlike other public companies that have thus far preferred Bitcoin or Ethereum for treasury allocation, VivoPower’s decision to center its capital strategy around XRP introduces a new precedent. The involvement of Prince Abdulaziz further distinguishes this investment by providing it with geopolitical and economic weight, particularly given Saudi Arabia’s broader interest in emerging financial technologies. Jungle Inc concluded by stating, “The XRP narrative just changed. Institutions are watching.” This statement reflects a growing perception among market observers that XRP may be entering a new phase of institutional relevance, driven by high-profile endorsements and a maturing use case within both treasury management and decentralized financial infrastructure.

45321466,https://nulltx.com/?p=150088,1748677157,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Virtuals Daily Recap: AI Agent Sector Sees Pullback as Virtuals Dips Post-Echo Rally,https://nulltx.com/virtuals-daily-recap-ai-agent-sector-sees-pullback-as-virtuals-dips-post-echo-rally/,"The AI Agent economy gave back a hefty portion of its recent gains in the last 24 hours, with valuations across the sector declining after a not-so-sustained spike in $VIRTUAL. Total market cap for the AI Agent sector? Now at $10.59 billion, which gets us to an -8.77% change on the day. We see an ecosystem pullback that really hit some of the core layer tokens pretty hard, and a good example of that is the Virtuals ecosystem. They saw their ecosystem market cap dip a little bit to $2.59 billion, and we got an -8.28% price decline in the $VIRTUAL token. Even though prices are cooling, investor attention and market activity, which are gauged by mindshare, remain high. Indeed, mindshare rose 2.25% to 38.83%. This suggests that while some short-term holders may be rotating out of major tokens like $VIRTUAL, the overall interest in the sector remains robust. Vigorous investor attention is likely to lead to more market activity in the not-so-distant future. Volatility Follows Echo Rally as $VIRTUAL Retreats $VIRTUAL has seen a drop in its value, only a few days removed from a powerful price increase. That rally was largely attributed to a massive uptick in user engagement and trading activity post-“Echo” update. The update had propelled $VIRTUAL up by nearly 40% earlier this week, pushing it into the realm of the ecosystem “VIRTUAL”. However, as in most instances when a huge upsurge in value occurs, a retracement is now following. On May 30, the price of $VIRTUAL corrected by -8.33%, landing at $2.1851. With profit-taking underway and speculative interest cycling into newer entrants, the recent decline appears more technical than fundamental. Virtuals’ overall market cap dropped by a similar percentage, reflecting synchronized movements across its sub-projects and partners. Yet, the platform holds one of the most robust positions in the AI agent economy. Its total sector share of mind is 38.83%, suggesting that traders and developers are continuing to pay it heed, even amidst a broader cooldown. In fact, the potential for a rebound seems high, considering that in this fast-moving, AI-infused Web3 landscape, sentiment often rotates in a matter of days. Mindshare and Momentum Shift Toward Rising Stars Although $VIRTUAL has stepped back, a number of smaller projects in the Virtuals ecosystem and the broader AI agent space are beginning to attract investor interest. Traders seem to be rotating into these newer or more nimble plays, in search of the higher beta opportunities that might give us the next leg up. MISATO (@Misato_virtuals), which jumped by +8.08%. Its focus on lightweight, autonomous decision-making for micro-agents seems to have caught the eye of traders looking for next-gen performance assets, and the market seems to be rewarding that with a nice bump in price. Next in line is TRISIG (@tri_sigma_), reaping +5.70%, and not far behind is POLY (@polytraderAI) at +5.15%. Both projects are building agent frameworks geared towards decentralized trading and finance. These are two sectors where AI is starting to make significant inroads. GRPH (@soulgra_ph) and SIREN (@genius_sirenai) likewise saw modest gains of +2.41% and +1.18%, respectively, indicating that a shift in momentum toward the kind of under-the-radar projects with which they are associated may be in play. And that is a shift with which investors in speculative projects might be more than pleased. Virtuals Daily Update | May 30th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/SxfKmbD79H — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 30, 2025 Capital moving into smaller capitalized projects is common following a sector surge. When major tokens such as $VIRTUAL begin a consolidation phase, high-risk opportunity investors often move to the next tier, seeking potential micro-cap projects and aiming to catch the next early breakout wave of the sector. Looking Ahead: Temporary Reset or the Start of Rotation? The present decline is in the question—is it a temporary dip following the exuberant advance or a developing scenario of prolonged underperformance for certain segments in the AI agent ecosystem? At the rate of innovation we are seeing, and with the consistent level of new project launches across the ecosystem, the answer may well be both. It seems likely that for the large-cap leaders like $VIRTUAL, a cooling-off period may be in store. At the same time, we may see emerging projects take up the narrative in the short term. The ongoing increase in mindshare indicates that attention isn’t departing from the sector but is instead reallocating within it. This seems more indicative of a healthy AI Agent market than an unhealthy one—especially with the not-so-recent memory of some big-name players leaving the space. The project is able to maintain relevance and doesn’t seem likely to disappear anytime soon. It retains a foundational pillar in the AI ecosystem. With its price decline, it isn’t able to pick up too much momentum, and it covers a lot with only a few mechanisms in play. As the migration of smart capital continues and showroom forays made by speculative money in the crypto sector seem not yet to have ended, one can only emphasize the need to maintain a wary watch on the ever-evolving AI-crypto intersection. It’s not too soon, and it may not be too late, to keep a finger on the pulse of AI-driven crypto. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45321499,https://nulltx.com/?p=150087,1748677257,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Bitcoin Dips 5% from Last Week’s High, But Strong On-Chain Support Near $100K Signals Potential Rebound",https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-dips-5-from-last-weeks-high-but-strong-on-chain-support-near-100k-signals-potential-rebound/,"Recently, Bitcoin has had a notable correction and has come down about 5% from last week’s peak. This pullback has put around 1.27 million Bitcoin addresses in the red; these holders are now underwater compared to their purchase price. Despite this short-term decline, on-chain data reveals a pretty amazing narrative of historic buying activity just below the $100,000 mark—suggesting that this level could serve as a potent support zone if Bitcoin visits it again in the not-too-distant future. Historic Buying and Strong Support at Key Psychological Level Bitcoin’s price has swung widely over the past few weeks, but significant demand has emerged near the $100,000 mark. Erik Vorhees, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur based in Puerto Rico, likens the situation to a game with two players. On one side are the sellers, who have managed to push the price below $100,000. On the other are the buyers, who keep snapping up Bitcoin anytime the price gets near this level. Important psychological benchmarks often exist in financial markets, serving as levels where many buyers and sellers seem to congregate. With respect to Bitcoin, the $100,000 price level has taken on huge amounts of attention, both as a price that buyers might be attracted to and as a price that some traders might be selling into. We could describe it as the price level with the most dual attraction, given that it is also a round number. This paragraph is essentially a translation of the previous one with slightly different wording. Why is the price level with the most dual attraction also a good candidate for a psychological price level? Because, as way too many commentators have also already pointed out, it’s a.k.a. a round number. Moreover, this latent support correlates with larger market demand patterns that have stayed strong during this cycle—even following Bitcoin’s former all-time highs. Demand for Bitcoin is now approaching the peak levels of the previous bull market. On average, about $1.8 billion in fresh capital flows into the market each day – roughly on par with the November 2021 high around $64K. The largest inflows of this cycle occurred at approximately… pic.twitter.com/XdfdUMaaKL — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 30, 2025 Investor Demand Mirrors Peak Levels of Previous Bull Market The total demand for Bitcoin is still extremely high, almost reaching the demand levels that we saw in the last bull market. Daily, Bitcoin sees fresh capital inflows of around $1.8 billion on average. This is about equivalent to what was happening in the 2021 bull run when we were trading at about $64,000. This cycle’s, from about $73,000 and $92,000 price levels, most huge capital came in. At $73,000, the market recorded its most substantial peak inflows of $3.6 billion, while at $92,000, the inflows grew to even more extreme $4.5 billion levels. Investors keep on channeling wah-wah wealth into Bitcoin, despite its steady diet of ups and downs in the price department. This trend shows that the market still has a good appetite for Bitcoin, and it proves that investors are still willing to put down large amounts of capital even after Bitcoin has set new all-time highs. This also seems to act as a validation of sorts for the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin, and more than anything, it shows that amidst the short-term price corrections, the commitment to Bitcoin seems to be as strong as ever. ETF Outflows Signal Temporary Profit-Taking Amid Overall Strength On May 29 (Eastern Time), the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net outflow of $359 million. This halted a 10-day streak of consistent net inflows into these potential investment vehicles. Bitcoin has slid ~5 % from last week’s peak, putting 1.27M addresses in the red. But on-chain data shows heavy historic buying just under $100 k, suggesting this key psychological level could act as strong support; and perhaps fuel the next leg up if revisited. pic.twitter.com/38eGCnr1Kl — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 ETFs commonly see outflows interpreted as temporary profit-taking. Who could blame them? ETF inflows had reached dizzying heights of over $700 billion per year, and they were used to finance not just the 2017-2018 bull run in cryptocurrency prices but also the 2018-2019 recovery. Withdrawals from ETFs might raise some concerns, since they are such reliable tools that support the price of cryptocurrencies, but those withdrawals are not necessarily a sign of a weakening market. This movement also reflects the broader dynamics of Bitcoin investment, where participants in the market regularly seek to optimize returns and create better-performing investable products. That this outflow happened after a long run of not just inflows but also net inflows into the Bitcoin space highlights that there really is ongoing interest in not just investing in Bitcoin itself but also ongoing engagement in Bitcoin-related financial products. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Looking Ahead: Resilience and Potential for Next Rally In general, the Bitcoin price decline of 5% appears to be a healthy correction rather than a dip that foretells sustained weakness. A review of buying in the dip from the historic lows under the $100,000 level reveals not only unrelenting support from retail investors but also strong participation from institutional investors. Should Bitcoin return to the crucial support zone near $100,000, the collection of buying demand there might serve as a launch mechanism, propelling fresh enthusiasm among investors and very possibly signaling the start of the next bull market. Over the next few weeks, investors and analysts will be keeping an eye on whether Bitcoin can maintain this critical level and push on toward new all-time highs or if it’s going to be shoveled by market forces into a prolonged period of consolidation. Currently, the on-chain data and inflow trends paint a mildly optimistic picture despite the recent volatility. They suggest that Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a reliable digital asset that attracts a great deal of global capital. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A single user lost $20,000 worth of BSC-USD (a stablecoin from the exchange Binance that is pegged to the U.S. dollar) in a double address poisoning attack. Data flagged by the scam alerting service Cyver show that this user was targeted not just once but twice in the span of a single hour. In each instance, they sent $10,000 to two different bad addresses—both of which were designed to look like the user’s real address. This episode highlights the enduring danger of address poisoning in decentralized systems. It serves as a clear reminder that even the most mundane crypto transactions can be perilous if sound verification practices are not followed. The Mechanics of Address Poisoning Address poisoning is a form of clever trickery that scammers use to carry out their schemes. They send worthless transactions from addresses that look very similar to the ones that a target has previously interacted with. The idea is to get the target to think they’ve been sent a transaction and, when they go to look at their transaction history, to get them to use a poisoned address in future transactions. If you know you haven’t sent a transaction to the address in your history, then somebody might be trying to scam you. The common user practice of using past transaction history to recycle wallet addresses is what this scam relies upon. It mimics the appearance of a legitimate address, usually by matching the first character and the last character of the address you would expect to see. It certainly doesn’t match the middle, which is the part of the address that actually matters, especially if we’re talking about using your eyes to tell the difference between a valid and a scam wallet. Knowing that we tend to trust the first and last characters, it would appear that scammy addresses follow the principle of a good magic trick. In this specific instance, the victim committed two expensive blunders. The first transaction was for $10,000 sent to a phony address. Just one hour later, the same victim sent another $10,000 to a different scammer, using the same hoax to get the money. This quick, double-dipping took place because the crooks were watching the victim’s wallet so closely they must have been salivating to go in for another hit after the first one worked so well. It also makes you wonder how many times the same scammer has done this with other not-so-smart victims. ALERT Today, our system detected 20K $BSC -USD lost due to address poisoning scams. A single victim was targeted twice by two different scammer addresses. First, victim mistakenly sent 10K $BSC -USD to a scammer. Just 1 hour later, victim sent another 10K $BSC -USD to a second… pic.twitter.com/OTU07UAyLK — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) May 30, 2025 BSC Ecosystem and Security Concerns Among the fastest and most used blockchain platforms in the world, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) boasts rapid transaction times and a nominal fee structure. Largely for these reasons, it has drawn the attention of bad actors holding malicious intentions. Address poisoning, a technique used by a number of blockchain bad actors, poses a very real threat to BSC users. BSC, like other Layer 1 chains, has a decentralized nature; that is, it is not controlled from a single place. Instead, it is run by numerous independent operators all over the world. This brings with it a familiar set of advantages and enables many of the functions of a blockchain. But it also brings some disadvantages—primarily, perhaps, that the end user is responsible for the custody of funds held in, and for the movement of funds to and from, BSC. Although detection systems and real-time alerts might be improved by platforms like Cyver and other firms specializing in blockchain security, these firms cannot stop a transaction from happening in the first place. They can only issue a warning after the fact or in real-time, if they’re really good, flag a suspicious pattern that just happens to be associated with the transaction in question. And in the realm of security, where a system can be only as good as its last update, alerts and warnings are not even a close second to prevention. Best Practices for Users: How to Stay Safe Losing $20,000 in BSC-USD to address poisoning is a recent, painful lesson, but one that offers takeaways for the wider crypto community. First and foremost: never copy wallet addresses directly from transaction history. Always use verified, manually saved addresses, or better yet, use wallet features that allow for whitelisting or address tagging. The second step is to turn on the anti-phishing tools and browser add-ons that look at the addresses you are trying to visit and let you know if they are not what they are supposed to be, like if they are really close to the name of a legit site but not quite right, or if they’re just plain old scammer sites. A lot of wallets and interfaces now have this functionality built in, but it’s up to you to use it and keep it updated. For the third point, verify that the addresses are correct down to each character before you dispatch any meaningful amount of cryptocurrency. A moment’s worth of carefulness could conserve thousands in not having to replace lost funds. Finally, keep yourself updated. Crypto develops quickly, and so do the schemes of bad actors. Following alert services like Cyver, reading up on the latest scams, and keeping an overall suspicious disposition are musts for safely navigating the crypto world. The ecosystem keeps on growing and maturing, and so must the behavior and protective practices of its users. Today’s incident is yet another reminder that in the decentralized world, security is not just a feature—it is a personal responsibility. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It was an imaginative allocation that never got any traction, largely because the financial technology needed to make it work simply didn’t exist. Fast forward to 2025, and Coinbase is resurrecting the dormant standard with x402, a “crypto-native” payments protocol that’s supposed to allow for instant, automatic transactions across the web. x402 signifies a big shift from the web payment systems of today. Those systems depend on platforms. Visa, Stripe, and PayPal are among the platforms we use to make payments on the web. They are not the only platforms we use; in fact, we use many centralized platforms to make payments on the web. x402 is not a centralized platform. It does not attempt to replace our centralized platforms with just another platform. To these ends, x402 is also something else: it is largely payment-agnostic. A Protocol for the Internet of Value At its heart, x402 allows websites, APIs, and applications to directly ask for and receive payments in cryptocurrency through the HTTP protocol. It’s not necessary to use plugins, middleware, or third-party integrations. Now, you can have direct interactions through simple web requests with stablecoins like USDC. x402 fufills a vision of web architecture that is decentralized, open, and extensible. The modern internet is about lightning-fast communications and interactions among people, devices, and systems. Three are the demands that need to be met: 1. Costs of transaction must be near zero. 2. The speed of finality must be in the neighborhood of 200 milliseconds (a little faster, a little slower, take my word for it, and I’m the one saying this). 3. The throughput must scale beyond 100,000 transactions per second (you have to love those peak moments when a lot is going on all at once). x402 takes care of business on meeting those demands. 1/ The internet reserved HTTP 402 for payments over 30 years ago, then forgot about it. Now, @coinbase is reviving it with x402, a protocol that lets websites and APIs accept crypto payments (like USDC) natively over HTTP. pic.twitter.com/S32a2ri7wI — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) May 29, 2025 This method makes way for a new manner of online interaction: independent transactions between machines. It may soon be possible for AI agents, for instance, to pay for access to APIs in real-time and without human intervention. Or for a smart contract to pay an invoice at the moment the service it governs is rendered. Or for some app coordinating cloud resources to pay in microtransactions. But these aren’t magic uses to which x402 can be put, because it reimagines payments themselves as an internet-native primitive. Traditional Giants Are Fighting Back Although x402 presents a radically open method for handling digital payments, the traditional giants of the payment industry are not lying low. They are, of course, trying to remain relevant in a swiftly changing landscape. For example, this past week, Visa introduced artificial intelligence agents for link to its payment network. And as for Stripe, it claims to have adopted AI for front-line fraud detection and prevention. It too is trying to process an evidently crypto-involved future and has issued stablecoin-related communications that sound a lot like PayPal’s. Why? Because PayPal has, for some time now, been issuing rewards for the holders of its stablecoin, PYUSD. Even though these developments represent a change in direction, traditional platforms still are, at their cores, closed systems. They are platform-first, built on central control, proprietary infrastructure, and human-centric workflows. x402, in contrast, offers an open, permissionless protocol that can be embedded directly into the logic of apps, APIs, and services. Indeed, it can even be embedded into the apps of traditional platforms. Throughout this book, we will argue that using an open, permissionless protocol—whether it be x402 or any number of other such protocols—always results in better, app-centered, user-focused outcomes. This rising rift mirrors the wider digital economy—between old institutions making piecemeal changes and new protocols attempting to rethink the web from the bottom up. The Promise and Risks of Agentic Payments As AI technology grows and takes on more responsibilities, the concept of agentic payments—transactions started and completed by AI agents or applications—shifts from being a speculative concept to a practical occurrence. x402 is designed for this scenario, where machines are not only reading and writing data but also directly exchanging value over the web. The significance of these implications is hard to overstate. They suggest that AI agents could eventually take over some pretty meaty tasks currently performed by humans—tasks like managing subscriptions to digital services, purchasing those services, allocating resources among the many cloud platforms that exist today, and even negotiating and settling the contracts that bind all those services together. However, the freedom this technology promises is not without risks. It raises big questions about key custody, authorization, and abuse mitigation. If an AI agent makes an unauthorized payment, for instance, or if malicious bots exploit machine-native payment systems, who is responsible? This is something the developers and regulators of the technology will have to address—preferably before something goes badly wrong. Even with these obstacles, x402’s momentum indicates that a new kind of Internet economy, where web-native payments intermingle with data and content, is emerging. The fact that Coinbase raised the 402’s profile may say more about the economy’s potential than just that it was an endeavor to, as one might say, Web 2.0, raise the profile of an unfashionable number.

At the heart of this explosive growth is increasing institutional investment in Bitcoin, which continues to act as the touchstone for market sentiment. But this time, the vitality is not confined to Bitcoin alone. A closer look reveals a broad-based expansion taking place across decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto credit markets, and the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This complex surge indicates that the present bull cycle is structurally different from previous ones. Pursuant both to not just the ecosystem’s but also the segment’s growing maturity and to a presage of regulatory clarity, the current bull cycle seems well and truly different and—lacking any sign of a speculative mania—much more sustainable. DeFi Eyes Historic Highs as Institutions Return Perhaps the most impressive development is the way in which institutional capital has re-emerged in decentralized finance (DeFi). The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has bounced back to approximately $178 billion, which is close to where it had been at the top of the previous cycle. Ethereum is still the clear leader, holding more than half of that TVL. This is due in large part to Ethereum’s powerful configuration of decentralized apps and Layer 2 solutions that allow it to scale. 1/ The global crypto market cap has climbed above $3.5 trillion, driven largely by mounting institutional demand for Bitcoin.

The protocol’s strength lies in its steady and multifaceted growth across several blockchains, akin to that of a blue-chip DeFi project. Both professional institutions and retail users have favored using Aave because they can count on it to serve as a secure, scalable, and always-available solution. This resurgence has reopened speculation about a possible “DeFi summer” comparable to the one in 2020. Nonetheless, numerous analysts contend that the current excitement is now rooted in something more concrete—in real, fundamental growth. For one, they insist that the protocols themselves have matured to a point where we can now actually use them without pulling our hair out in frustration. For another, they note that the security practices of those using DeFi have improved. And finally, they point out that institutions now approach DeFi with a clearer sense of the frameworks they want to operate under and the risk management strategies they’re comfortable with. Crypto Credit Makes a Comeback A main indicator of the crypto market’s evolution is the revival of lending and credit markets. After the savage deleveraging and widespread defaults that afflicted CeFi and DeFi lending platforms from the middle of 2022 onward, the sector has made a strong rebound. By the end of Q4 2023, the Cerulli report indicated that the combined loan books of both CeFi and DeFi platforms had reached an estimated $30 billion, with a range of performance metrics suggesting that overall credit quality has improved significantly. That does not yet mean that defaults are nonexistent. Lending in the crypto space, however, seems to be healthy. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been making strides in moving a part of the traditional finance world on-chain. One part of traditional finance that is now partly on-chain is credit provision. Over the past year, DeFi’s share of this credit activity has been growing, thanks in part to the return of institutional borrowers and lenders. DeFi credit provision, as offered by platforms like AAVE, has in many, if not most, respects proven to be a straightforward, transparent, and much more sensible on-chain alternative to the opaqueness of off-chain credit provision by banking institutions. The health of crypto credit is a key indicator for the whole ecosystem. When capital moves freely and credit conditions are stable, innovation and liquidity are usually not far behind. Most of us see the reemergence of this segment as a major catalyst for growth across the entire market in 2024. Stablecoins Emerge as the Year’s Breakout Use Case While Bitcoin and DeFi have stolen the spotlight, the real star of 2024 may well be the stablecoin market. With a nearly combined capitalization of $250 billion—up an incredible 56% from just $160 billion a year ago—the stablecoin market is crypto’s silent revolution. This growth is largely being pushed by new players coming in from traditional finance. Stablecoins put out by large financial institutions—like Société Générale’s EURCV, PayPal’s PYUSD, JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, and the rumored Bank of America dollar token—are really starting to gain traction. These are bank-grade digital assets. And they are not only causing the retail and DeFi payments perception of stablecoins to evolve; they are starting to be seen as something that can underpin a global-scale financial infrastructure and not just retail payments. As use of stablecoins increases, regulation is emerging. The U.S. is preparing to issue federal legislation governing stablecoins—codenamed GENIUS/STABLE. This will occur alongside a follow-up to the FIT 21 framework recently passed in Congress. We expect SEC and CFTC guidance to also be in the mix—potentially clarifying things like bank custody of digital assets. A lot of this will shake out by 2027. To sum up, the latest climb of the crypto market is being driven by more than just a surface amount of speculative energy. What’s really going on is the much more substantial and serious transition of the crypto world toward dependable, institutional-grade financial vehicles and processes, from credit markets to the kinds of efficient personal transfer systems that stablecoins offer to the average consumer. It seems fair to say that the crypto market isn’t what it used to be. And what’s more, it seems likely that the kind of price ascent we saw during Bitcoin’s maturity period is also a thing of the past. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45321701,https://nulltx.com/?p=150083,1748677668,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,DeFi Roars Back to Life: TVL Soars Past $178 Billion as Market Eyes a New Season,https://nulltx.com/defi-roars-back-to-life-tvl-soars-past-178-billion-as-market-eyes-a-new-season/,"For several months, the decentralized finance movement within the crypto ecosystem seemed to be winding down. While its core group of developers continued to build, only a handful of projects maintained any sort of visibility. For most members of the crypto community, the sentiment seemed to be that DeFi was in hibernation, waiting for the winter of crypto’s current bear market to pass. But now, discussions on social media and within the crypto industry around DeFi are picking up again. Even though the crypto space has recently been filled with memecoins, Bitcoin ETFs, and Layer 2 scaling developments, a return to DeFi fundamentals marks a crucial change in our space. This recent uprising is being driven not only by higher asset prices but also by greater user engagement, improved protocol performance, and interest from institutional players. Ethereum Reclaims the DeFi Crown Even with new Layer 1 blockchains and Layer 2 networks popping up, Ethereum remains the reigning champ of DeFi. It now has well over 50% of all the assets locked in smart contracts across the entire DeFi space. The DeFi application of Ethereum attracts much development and usage. The liquidity and confidence in DeFi on Ethereum are coming back. From the looks of it, the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, which is built and interacts mostly with the Layer 1 base layer of Ethereum, is looking much healthier with a rapid upswing in total value locked which seems to be hinting at bringing back some liquidity to the core financial-grade decentralized applications that use the base Ethereum Layer 1. Ethereum continues to face significant ongoing challenges. These include its still high gas fees and a capacity-stretched main chain, which together make it hard for some types of Ethereum projects to get off the ground. But with the payoff from its long-planned transition to proof of stake now in hand, Ethereum has opportunity to work through those challenges. AAVE and Lido Lead the DeFi Protocol Rankings Among distinct protocols, AAVE shines as the leading light in many ways, with an incredible $25.41 billion locked up in its lending markets across the chains. Of course, many folks know AAVE. It operates under a decentralized governance model, supports a wide variety of assets, and is present in many chains. Its relevance and resonance in this ecosystem are testaments to its user-centric design. Beyond the governance and asset support, though, the platform has captured attention in a good many ways. DeFi is gaining serious momentum again. Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to $178.52 billion, signaling a strong resurgence in decentralized finance activity. Ethereum remains the dominant force, accounting for more than half of all TVL. Among individual protocols, AAVE… pic.twitter.com/e6Kp8JVM6e — OLOBA THE ARTIST (@IamOloba_) May 30, 2025 AAVE is closely followed by Lido, which has a value locked of $24.57 billion. Lido is a liquid staking solution that works quite well and has built significant momentum. It allows users to stake Ethereum (as well as a handful of other assets) while keeping their assets liquid with derivative tokens. This model has gained considerable popularity as Ethereum transitions to proof-of-Stake, allowing way more users than previously access to Ethereum staking rewards while also letting them do stuff with their assets. Alongside AAVE, Lido has emerged as a key anchor within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Together, they exemplify two critical, closely intertwined, and almost universally needed building blocks of DeFi: permissionless lending (AAVE) and permissionless staking (Lido). They are quietly serving up a potent combination of services that is boosting DeFi to that next level of confidence and making the space seem even more solid than before. Is a New DeFi Season on the Horizon? Once again, DeFi’s total value locked is climbing toward historic highs, and with it, speculation is building around the possibility of a new DeFi season. Observers of the market are noting not only the influx of capital but also the increased stability and maturity of many top protocols compared to previous boom cycles. The most recent DeFi season brought us new experiments, great yields, and lots of hacks. Today, leading DeFi protocols make clearer promises about what users can expect. They emphasize something that should come as no surprise in the wake of last season’s breaches: safety. DeFi’s path to safety is more grounded in traditional finance, with protocols now promising comprehensive auditing and stronger governance. They may be using institutional capital to get there. This momentum might bring us a full-blown DeFi revival; it’s not yet certain. But the signs are strong. As protocols get better, ecosystems evolve, and user experience becomes more seamless, decentralized finance seems set for another significant expansion. One thing is certain: traction is returning to DeFi, and with close to $180 billion in the system, all is primed for the next installment of the tale that this is a decentralized financial world.

According to reports, over 4.9 billion shareholders voted against the move, with about 8.9 million shares absent, and over 205 million non-votes. The move makes Meta Platforms the latest big tech firm to consider a shareholder push to add Bitcoin to its treasury following the previous push by Microsoft some months ago. However, just like this move, it ended in disappointment after shareholders voted to reject the proposal citing concerns about volatility. According to reports, the company said it was prioritizing a push into artificial intelligence over cryptocurrency investments. The Meta Bitcoin treasury proposal was submitted by investor Ethan Peck, who stands as a representative of the National Center for Public Research (NCPPR), asking the company to look into the likelihood of converting some of its cash and bond holdings into Bitcoin to preserve shareholder value better. At the time, the proposal gained noticeable attention, with Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor publicly drumming support for the initiative. Meta shareholders vote down Bitcoin adoption push According to filings, Meta, as of September 30, 2024, had about $72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which the proposal claimed the values were being eroded by inflation and low returns. The move presents Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and strong trading pattern compared to bonds, as a reliable store of value in the long term. Meta Platforms Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Proposal pic.twitter.com/ZeIrUHq2OK — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixNewsIO) May 30, 2025 According to the filing, there has also been an increased push in institutional Bitcoin adoption, mentioning Strategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions, BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation, and speculations about potential US federal and state-level Bitcoin reserves in 2025. It also mentioned that Meta’s leadership had been showing interest in the asset, though via informal means, highlighting that its CEO Mark Zuckerberg had named his goats “Bitcoin” and “Max”. However, the board of directors was against the push, calling it unnecessary. In their response, the Meta board mentioned that the company already had a robust management practice in place, noting that it prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity to support its operations. The board also added that the company usually evaluates these broad ranges of investable assets and upon their recent evaluation, there was no need for a separate assessment focused on Bitcoin. Gravitation towards stablecoins and AI on the agenda According to a recent statement, the board explained its decision to ignore the buzz of digital assets. “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury,” Meta’s board of directors noted in a statement. While the company may not be eyeing Bitcoin in the short term, there won’t be any surprises if it decides to shift focus in the future. This is because there has been a considerable number of firms that have made the shift in the past, including Strategy. In addition, there is also a rising trend of industry players making Bitcoin-focused investments over the last few months due to the now relaxed regulations in the United States. Also, there are reports that Meta may be looking into stablecoins in the time being, with the company also choosing to focus on its ongoing push into artificial intelligence . According to Forbes, Meta has explored integrating stablecoins into its platforms to facilitate global payouts, holding discussions with crypto infrastructure firms to that effect. The move marks a re-entry into the crypto space for the company after its exit from the industry some years back following a regulatory setback with its Diem project. The initial effort was looking into the use of stablecoins for cross-border payments, with the firm hoping to provide a cheaper and faster alternative to the traditional system.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1?

Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.16285180 -7.10% Market Cap. $ 6,878,821,145.3133 Trading Volume. $ 221,124,094.2324 Circulating Supply. 0.00 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 The external factors, like Trump’s tariff threat , have pushed the HBAR price into a consistent decline and have recently taken a strong rejection from the 200-day EMA band . Since mid-May, the HBAR crypto has shattered nearly 30%, coming from $0.233 to $0.162. Adding more fuel to the fire, the intraday sell pressure of 10% has broken the previous swing low of $0.170. On the daily chart, it is aiming for a decline towards retesting its critical support of $0.139, which also aligns with Q4 2024 momentum-based high volume profile level. This high volume profile showed strength in Q2 2025’s April month, where a recovery of over 80% from $0.125 to $0.228 was observed. This time, HABR approaching this level is critical, as it has become a “make or break level. If bullish forces step in again as seen last month, then a rally could spark, then there is a higher chance for its price to clear $0.401, and reach $0.750 by the 2025 year-end. But if the support has been weakened from a previous retest, then its break would be fearsome, which could even push HBAR price to the $0.072 level in a fast-paced momentum, as displayed in Q4 when bulls were in command. Unlike its price action, the internal fundamental factors are on the optimistic side. Its efforts have been reflected in significant progress in its ecosystem. In 2025, it introduced the first Hedera-native hardware wallet, Citadel, and AI-powered Hedera Agent Kit, allowing users to create tokens, reducing technical barriers. Another strong project is set to launch in Q3 2025, named HashSphere, a private, permissioned blockchain for highly regulated industries like payment providers and asset managers. To facilitate secure, low-cost cross-border transactions with stablecoins while ensuring regulatory compliance. Even in order to streamline their work, on May 15, 2025, Hedera rebranded, renaming the HBAR Foundation to the “Hedera Foundation” and the Hedera Governing Council to the “Hedera Council.” Overall, the internal factors suggest that optimism is not so shallow, right now, and we can see some big moves in 2025, if all things are aligned well. But, still, the external factors highlight great caution for market participants.

This latest distribution , which started on May 30, targets claimants in both the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who have successfully completed all pre-distribution requirements. According to a May 28 announcement, the payout covers various categories of claims. Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims will receive a 72% reimbursement, while U.S. Customer Entitlement Claims are set to receive 54%. Those holding Convenience Claims are being paid 120% of their entitled value, reflecting their priority in the distribution process. Meanwhile, General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims are slated to receive a 61% distribution. Recipients should expect to see the funds in their accounts within one to two business days via the official partners, Kraken and BitGo . Crypto Markets Watch Closely for Liquidity Impact Market analysts and crypto traders are watching the reimbursements closely due to their potential impact on digital asset prices. The release of billions of dollars back into the hands of retail and institutional investors could introduce short-term volatility, particularly if large sums are sold or exchanged for other assets on public platforms. This round of repayments follows the initial February 18 distribution, in which $1.2 billion was sent to creditors with claims under $50,000 . At the time, Bitget Wallet COO Alvin Kan noted that a significant share of those funds might find their way back into crypto markets, either as reinvestment or liquidity provision. Critics Continue to Question Fairness of FTX Payout Structure Despite the substantial funds being returned, the reimbursement process has not been without controversy. A key concern lies in the court ruling that determined payouts would be based on the value of assets at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy petition, rather than their current market prices. FTX creditor and vocal critic Sunil Kavuri highlighted that many creditors only received 10% to 25% of the current value of their crypto holdings due to the low market prices during the petition date. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $16,000—a fraction of its current value. Kavuri also raised alarm earlier this year over the exclusion of users in 163 countries , including Pakistan, Russia, Iran, and Greenland, who are ineligible to receive reimbursement under the current plan. As the FTX Recovery Trust continues its efforts , the broader crypto community remains divided on whether justice has truly been served.

Among the best cheap crypto to buy now, Dogecoin (DOGE), TRON (TRX), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as three promising coins, each offering unique fundamentals and bullish setups. DOGE remains a cultural force backed by strong community support and growing utility. TRX continues to lead in transaction volume across DeFi, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, a new crypto coin still in presale, is gaining momentum as a high-upside play for the next cycle. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). For those wondering what crypto to buy now or seeking the next big cryptocurrency, these sub-$0.50 gems offer real potential before the bull run takes full flight. DOGE and TRX: Affordable Altcoins Poised for Growth in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) is around $0.2051 being highly resistant despite the volatility in the market. Experts believe DOGE can reach as high as $0.37 in June driven by fan sentiment and potential ETF releases. TRON (TRX) is approximately $0.27 registering consistent growth. Forecasts say that TRX could reach $0.275 by the end of 2025 driven by its expanding DeFi system and increasing adoption. Both TRX and DOGE rank among the best cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in at present, with immense scope for investors seeking affordable entry points. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining popularity as potential future high-growth prospects in the cryptocurrency market. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those buying now will see a 16.67% profit when the next price phase starts. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. MUTM’s periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stablecoin Secures Future with Completed Certik Audit A new USD-pegged stablecoin running on the Ethereum chain is soon being launched by Mutuum Finance. The advantage of MUTM stablecoin being pegged to the dollar is that it stops the kind of collapse seen in algorithmic stablecoins. Using recently audited and confirmed smart contracts by Certik, Mutuum Finance can be trusted by all users and investors. Thanks to its special buy-and-distribute approach and an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM joins innovation, safety and trust among its members. Early investment gives daring traders a chance to join the project in its very initial days. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly rising to leadership among sub-$0.50 altcoins, and it has secured $9.7 million from 11,500+ investors. At a current price of $0.03 and an upcoming launch price of $0.06 in the next few weeks, early investors can reach for 100% gains. Backed by a Certik audited contract, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a new Buy-and-Distribute mechanism, MUTM offers innovation with long-term upside. While DOGE and TRX prepare for the next bull run, MUTM is a high-upside play to watch out for presale today.

But with more traders jumping in, especially through meme coins, the system gets overloaded fast. High gas fees, slow transactions, and risky trades can block Ethereum’s full potential. That is why projects like Pepeto matter. They do not just follow Ethereum’s rise , they make it easier for that rise to continue. PepetoSwap brings calm to the chaos of meme trading The meme coin space is full of hype, but also full of risk. Rug pulls and scam tokens flood basic swap tools, costing users money and trust.

While headlines focus on the lucky break, the broader market is digesting something more strategic—the underlying shift toward utility-driven projects with active ecosystems. As speculation dies down, names like Qubetics , Bitcoin Cash, and Tron are resurfacing as the top cryptos to hold for short term due to their unique positions in payments, smart contract utility, and developer tooling. Unlike overbought meme coins or stagnant layer-1 tokens, Qubetics is building a full-stack developer and application framework with multichain reach. Bitcoin Cash is gaining traction with increased whale interest and a strong technical pattern. Tron, meanwhile, is fast becoming the backbone of global stablecoin payments, according to newly released metrics. Whether for developers, power users, or ecosystem participants, these three names are shaping up as some of the top cryptos to hold for short term, and the data supports it. Qubetics Offers Real Utility With Developer-First Tools Not every token builds its name on hype—Qubetics has anchored its roadmap on something far more durable: usability. The platform’s key innovation lies in QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE, tools designed to simplify smart contract development across multiple chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Avalanche. This isn’t just a tech stack—it’s a structured approach to onboarding developers, enabling no-code and low-code deployment in real-world environments. Think of a small business wanting to tokenize event tickets on Ethereum while running loyalty rewards on Solana. Under current tools, they’d need separate dev teams and protocols. With Qubetics, they can use QubeQode’s drag-and-drop interface to design, test, and deploy those functions—all under one dashboard. Qubetics IDE complements this by offering preconfigured environments, GitHub-integrated workflows, and template libraries that speed up project delivery by weeks. As ecosystem adoption rises, projects that reduce development friction become critical. Qubetics bridges the fragmented world of dApp development and deployment, and that’s why it’s considered one of the top cryptos to hold for short term—especially as Web3 moves toward application-layer demand. Qubetics Presale Heats Up as ROI Potential Climbs The Qubetics crypto presale is already making waves. Currently in Stage 36, $TICS is priced at $0.3064. Over 514 million tokens have been sold, with more than 27,300 wallets already participating. The presale has raised over $17.5 million, and the clock is ticking—each stage lasts only 7 days, and the price jumps 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. Now here’s where things get compelling. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, early buyers are looking at 226.32% ROI. At $5, that rockets to 1,531.58%, while $10 hits 3,163.16%, and $15 tops it off at 4,794.74%. Even a modest $100 allocation could turn into $1,531 at $5 and $4,794 at $15. As the Qubetics mainnet gears up for its Q2 2025 launch, the potential is becoming harder to ignore. Structured pricing, finite timelines, and aggressive tech rollout make the Qubetics presale stand out as the best crypto pre sale in today’s market. And in the short term, the token’s momentum and stage-based urgency place Qubetics firmly among the top cryptos to hold for short term. Bitcoin Cash Shows Whale Momentum and Breakout Structure According to Binance Square, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading in a pattern that technical analysts describe as a symmetrical triangle, a setup typically associated with a strong breakout potential. The asset recently saw increased buying volume that pushed it above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating bullish momentum in the short term. More notably, BCH has been attracting the attention of large-scale participants. Whale wallet activity has risen, signaling accumulation at current levels, and social metrics around BCH have surged. Analysts are pointing to possible price targets in the $280–$300 range, contingent on volume follow-through and continuation of the current chart pattern. The symmetry in recent consolidation also supports the possibility of a measured upward move. With liquidity returning to the market and altcoins rotating into attention, Bitcoin Cash’s breakout structure and whale-backed support give it strong candidacy as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term—especially for those looking at legacy coins with renewed life. Tron and Tether Dominate Stablecoin Payments, Says Survey As per CoinDesk, Tron (TRX) is now home to over 50% of all stablecoin transactions, primarily driven by Tether (USDT) volumes. The newly released survey shows that $53 billion in USDT payments were settled on Tron in April 2025 alone—outpacing all other chains combined, including Ethereum. This dominance isn’t by accident. Tron has actively positioned itself as a low-cost, high-speed blockchain for financial settlement, especially in regions where stablecoins are a viable alternative to banking. The platform’s cost efficiency and integration with payment providers have allowed it to scale quickly in Latin America, Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe. In an industry where real-world usage often lags behind speculation, Tron’s dominance in stablecoin transaction volume speaks volumes. As the stablecoin narrative intensifies—especially with CBDC rollouts and regulatory clarity improving—Tron remains a core asset on the list of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Infrastructure, Usage, and Momentum: The Winning Short-Term Trio Crypto narratives are shifting. Memecoins and unsustainable APYs are losing steam, replaced by adoption-focused frameworks, cross-chain efficiency, and macro integration. Qubetics, with its robust IDE and developer ecosystem, targets the root of Web3 expansion: simplified deployment. Bitcoin Cash brings a high-probability technical pattern to the table, supported by whale accumulation and growing volume. And Tron, dominating stablecoin transactions at a global level, is the clearest signal of real-world utility meeting blockchain at scale. Each of these projects fits neatly into a strategy of short-term accumulation with medium-term potential. For community members seeking entries below peak pricing but above vaporware risk, Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Tron are currently ranked among the top cryptos to hold for short term. And when it comes to the best crypto presale with structured price increases, time-sensitive rewards, and true developer traction, Qubetics presale continues to stand out above the noise. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What’s the best crypto to hold for short term gains right now? Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Tron are currently seen as the most strategic short-term options based on news, volume, and adoption. How much can early participants earn from the Qubetics presale? A $100 entry could return over $4,794 if $TICS reaches $15 post-mainnet launch, based on current stage pricing and ROI estimates. Why is Tron dominating the stablecoin market? Tron processed $53 billion in Tether transactions in April 2025, thanks to low fees and global adoption for stablecoin-based payments.

Reaching this target would require a 99,900% climb, and while many see this as unrealistic, XRP Dragon’s statement draws on the asset’s historical rise to its all-time high in 2017/2018 and expectations that it can repeat that performance. A notable aspect of this belief in the asset’s potential is the contrast between the speculative nature of its earlier rally and the current push toward real-world adoption and utility. In 2017, XRP reached its all-time high largely on investor speculation amid a broader crypto market boom. Today, however, Ripple has expanded its partnerships , strengthened its payment infrastructure, and weathered prolonged regulatory battles. If it could perform so well with speculation alone, these factors could help it replicate or even outperform its previous rally . If $XRP went from $0.003 to $3.31 before… who’s to say $3 to $3,000 is impossible?” #XRP pic.twitter.com/pcR0mU73UP — XRP DRAGON (@DRAGON_XRP66) May 29, 2025 Community Reactions XRP Dragon’s statement has prompted a wide range of reactions from the community. One user acknowledged the historical price increase but pointed out that the asset’s early pricing, particularly around $0.003, occurred during the “initial-cap phase” when liquidity was extremely limited. According to this perspective, the more meaningful growth period began around the $0.02–$0.03 range, and the move to $3 from there was already a 100x gain. Applying the same magnitude of growth from $3 would suggest a target closer to $300 rather than $3,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Others noted that broader market conditions today differ significantly from 2017. Increased competition from other blockchain projects, market saturation, and ongoing regulatory risks are seen as potential constraints on the cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory. One commenter noted that without “unprecedented global adoption,” such a leap in value would be “extremely unlikely.” Utility as a Catalyst for Long-Term Growth XRP Dragon is convinced that XRP’s future price movement will mirror its past and reach new heights as a result. However, unlike the speculative-driven surge in 2017, future appreciation could be driven by large-scale XRP adoption and a more favorable regulatory environment. Some experts have predicted that becoming a bridge for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could send XRP as high as $10,000 . Widespread use could contribute to this potential growth. While many in the community continue to debate the plausibility of a 99,900% price surge, the discussion highlights a critical shift in focus from speculation to utility. As utility grows, the asset’s price will reflect this shift. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a press release issued by the central bank, it stated that its earlier warnings about the assets were mainly a precautionary measure. Over the last few years, the State Bank of Pakistan has issued an advisory, directing banks, micro-finance institutions, development finance institutions (DFIs), electronic money institutions (EMIs), and other financial service providers to refrain from dealing in virtual assets. However, it has now clarified that the directive was never an outright ban on dealing or using the assets, but a measure to slow the negative impacts on residents of the country. Pakistan central bank clarifies stance on digital assets According to a statement from the bank, the advisory was to protect the financial institutions and their users. “The advisory was issued solely to protect our regulated entities and their customers, not because VAs were declared illegal,” the central bank stated. However, the SBP said that establishing a formal framework will provide the much-needed clarity to the legal status of digital assets in the country, while also ensuring that investors are protected and consumer safeguards are put in place. The update comes in the wake of a recent briefing to the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance, where it was suggested that trading and holding digital assets in Pakistan remain illegal. According to reports, the committee was told that individuals and firms carrying out cryptocurrency transactions were mandated to report the activities to the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU), which then forwards it to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for more probes. During the committee meeting, SBP Executive Director Sohail Jawad addressed the attendees, confirming that the directive, which was first established in 2018, remains in force. However, the central bank has also mentioned that it is currently coordinating with the Finance Division and the recently formed Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to design a comprehensive regulatory and legal framework for digital assets in the country. Attendees query SBP’s clarification amid a wider crypto push While the SBP were quite clear in their clarification, attendees were not convinced of their stance on digital assets. Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal maintained at the committee briefing that digital assets were banned. He noted that if they were not banned, those dealing in the assets would not have to face investigations from the relevant authorities, including the FMU and FIA. The finance secretary also answered questions on why the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was established without consultations with the parliament or the SPB. He mentioned that the task force was created under the directive of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif via executive orders. He added that the PCC is taking on an advisory role that aims to propose a legal and procedural path forward for the crypto industry. The details of the planned allocation of 2,000 megawatts of electricity for crypto mining and AI data centers were also at the briefing, with Committee member Mirza Ikhtiyar Baig discussing government priorities. He mentioned that such an endeavor should have been used to support local industries in Pakistan instead. The country announced the move earlier this month, soaking debates about the country’s crypto stance going forward. Pakistan is currently ranked in the top ten countries in terms of crypto adoption, with the country previously taking the third spot according to the Global Crypto Index. With over 20 million active users and about $20 billion in crypto transactions, the potential for crypto innovation in the country remains high. The country also sees about $35 billion in annual remittances, with experts noting that it could benefit from blockchain-based financial solutions. Meanwhile, the Standing Committee on Finance is expected to summon the SBP, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and members of the Pakistan Crypto Council in its next meeting to seek further clarity on the legal and economic implications of digital asset adoption.

Whale Activity and On-Chain Signals Hint at Further Correction,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-at-risk-whale-activity-and-on-chain-signals-hint-at-further-correction/,"Ethereum’s price action has demonstrated a pullback in recent days, reacting to broader market cues, including geopolitical developments. As of the time of writing, the asset is trading at $2,621, marking a 3.2% decline over the last 24 hours. The drop follows recent reports of a federal court reinstating US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which appear to have triggered a brief wave of risk-off sentiment across the crypto asset space. Despite this short-term weakness, ETH remains up approximately 45% over the past month, supported by momentum built earlier in the quarter. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot Premium Signals Strength – $2,800 Resistance In Focus Large Ethereum Inflows to Binance Spark Caution This latest pullback coincides with a notable increase in on-chain activity, particularly surrounding Ethereum transfers to exchanges. On May 27, an unusually large transfer of ETH was observed moving to Binance, a trend that has caught the attention of a CryptoQuant analyst monitoring potential profit-taking behavior. Parallel to this, Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric has reached a key level historically associated with market cooling phases, hinting that broader sentiment may be at a transitional point. According to CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, Ethereum experienced a substantial net inflow of approximately 385,000 ETH to Binance beginning on May 27. This marks one of the largest daily exchange inflows for the asset in recent months. Exchange inflows of this magnitude are often interpreted as signals of increased selling intent, particularly when driven by larger holders or institutional entities. The movement of such a high volume of ETH to a centralized exchange may reflect preparations for liquidity provision or anticipated market volatility. At the same time, Bitcoin’s NUPL, a metric that calculates the difference between unrealized profits and losses relative to market cap, has approached the 0.6 threshold. Historically, this level has acted as a pivot point where investors begin realizing gains, typically leading to price consolidation or downward pressure. Previous occurrences in early March and late 2024 saw NUPL at similar levels, followed by pullbacks in Bitcoin’s price, which also influenced broader market direction. Signals Suggest Potential Consolidation Phase Taken together, these developments present key indicators that market participants are adjusting their positions amid heightened uncertainty. Taha emphasized that while not definitive sell signals, the 385,000 ETH inflow to Binance and the NUPL’s rise to 0.6 are noteworthy. In prior cycles, similar patterns coincided with phases where investors reduced exposure or rotated assets. As ETH remains near local highs, the potential for short-term correction or sideways movement cannot be dismissed. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Outlook: Technical Indicators Signal Possible Continuation of Uptrend Taha concluded that investors may consider monitoring exchange inflows alongside NUPL and other on-chain metrics to better gauge sentiment shifts. Additionally, developments in regulatory or macroeconomic narratives, such as US trade policies or broader equity market behavior, could further influence crypto price dynamics. While Ethereum continues to demonstrate long-term strength, recent signals point to a phase of caution and strategic reassessment in the near term.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00001328, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00001514. PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00001073, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000779. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price gained minor selling demand after sellers gained control and plunged the price toward $0.00001. This was triggered by the recent low buying activity and increasing profit-taking sentiment. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040.

Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005.

Tron , a long-standing blockchain network, has enjoyed steady growth this month, but its trajectory feels cautious compared to the explosive potential of Ruvi AI . Priced at an accessible $0.015 , with a bold projection of $1 by Q4 2025 , Ruvi AI is captivating smart investors who are looking beyond modest returns for high-impact opportunities. Here’s why Ruvi AI is attracting massive interest, leaving Tron’s steady pace in the dust. Tron’s Steady Yet Conservative Growth Tron has long been recognized for its role in decentralized applications and content sharing platforms. Its network has consistently delivered incremental advancements, and recent months have seen a steady rise in user adoption. While these gains are commendable, Tron’s growth, though positive, remains measured and lacks the explosive potential that defines higher-risk, higher-reward cryptos. For cautious investors, Tron presents a familiar and relatively stable haven. However, for those hungry to capture exponential returns in emerging markets, a project like Ruvi AI is impossible to ignore. Ruvi AI Emerges as a Game-Changer Ruvi AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to solve pressing challenges across multiple industries. It’s this focus on real-world utility that has positioned the project as a frontrunner in the crypto arena. Unlike Tron’s steady growth, Ruvi AI is in a rapid ascension phase, fueled by clear mission-driven goals. From healthcare and logistics to finance, the project delivers innovative solutions that cater to modern demands. Real-World Applications Redefining Utility Ruvi AI isn’t just promising; it’s actively delivering impact across sectors that drive global economies. Healthcare : Ruvi AI improves diagnostics, streamlines operations, and reduces costs, helping medical systems operate more efficiently. Logistics : Its AI-powered solutions tackle supply chain bottlenecks, enhancing productivity and reducing waste. Finance : By offering advanced fraud detection and secure transaction mechanisms, Ruvi AI provides practical tools to level up financial systems. Tron may provide stable blockchain fundamentals, but Ruvi AI is working toward reshaping industries right now. This capacity to provide immediate value is a key reason why over 130 million tokens were sold during Ruvi AI’s record-breaking presale , which raised an impressive $1.4 million . From Presale Success to Strategic Partnerships Momentum often defines a project’s trajectory, and Ruvi AI has been on an undeniable roll. Its collaboration with Weex Exchange , a user-friendly trading platform, ensures easy market accessibility for Ruvi AI’s utility token. Early accessibility through platforms like Weex supports liquidity, expands its audience reach, and offers seamless trading opportunities for retail and institutional investors alike. This partnership reflects Ruvi AI’s forward-thinking approach, contrasting with Tron’s predominantly developmental focus. VIP Investment Opportunities Another reason behind Ruvi AI’s surging popularity lies in its highly rewarding VIP investment tiers , which are designed to maximize returns for early adopters. With bonuses as high as 100% , these tiers amplify potential returns as the token’s value grows. Here are some highlights of Ruvi AI’s VIP tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens = 70,000 . Value at $0.07/token = $4,900 . Value at $1/token = $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens = 224,000 . Value at $0.07/token = $15,680 . Value at $1/token = $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens = 1,280,000 . Value at $0.07/token = $89,600 . Value at $1/token = $1,280,000 . These VIP opportunities are helping Ruvi AI generate unparalleled buzz, giving early movers a huge incentive to get involved now. Why Smart Investors Are Betting on Ruvi AI While Tron’s steady growth signals reliability, it’s Ruvi AI’s dynamic combination of innovation and execution that offers the potential for massive returns .

Ruvi AI’s affordable entry price and sheer upward potential make it an attractive opportunity for forward-thinking investors. Final Thoughts For those tracking cryptocurrency trends, the comparison between steady approaches like Tron and the disruptive rise of Ruvi AI offers valuable insight. While Tron appeals to investors seeking stability, Ruvi AI offers a rare opportunity to capture explosive growth by addressing pressing global challenges. With industry-specific use cases, record-breaking presale success, and future-focused strategies, Ruvi AI is not only just getting started but also setting the stage for long-term relevance in the crypto market. Smart investors are already making the shift toward Ruvi AI, preparing to be part of what could be a defining movement in blockchain innovation. Don’t miss the opportunity to be an early participant in Ruvi AI’s promising future.

The move is a copy of the Bitcoin purchasing script utilized by MicroStrategy and co-founder Michael Saylor, with SharpLink using Ethereum as its target asset. “We intend to utilize almost all of the net proceeds of this offering to buy Ether,” the company stated in a filing on May 30. Strategic Shift Toward Ethereum SharpLink announced the move on May 27 to an Ethereum-based treasury model and appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as board chairman. Shares of SharpLink surged 400% on one trading day following the announcement. SharpLink also plans to utilize part of the proceeds for operations, affiliate marketing, and general corporate purposes. Identifying Risks with ETH Holdings The filing identified regulatory and marketplace risks of holding Ether to the extent. Risks include the potential to treat ETH as a security, increasing compliance expenses, and the threat to CBDCs to undermine the acceptance of private cryptocurrencies. “The emergence of central bank digital currencies can potentially render private-sector issued cryptocurrencies obsolete or redundant,” SharpLink stated. Known as Ethereum’s Michael Saylor SharpLink’s move has drawn parallels with Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy holds in excess of 580,000 Bitcoin. Crypto commentators and analysts were quick to refer to SharpLink as “Ethereum’s Saylor.” Crypto analyst 0xBoboShanti on X, “Ethereum finally has its own Saylor.” Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano added, “You are not bullish enough.” Wider Ethereum Momentum This comes amidst rising institutional demand for Ethereum.

Legal expert and XRP advocate Bill Morgan has drawn attention to June 16, the date when the SEC’s 60-day deadline to submit a status update to the Court of Appeals will end. This report deadline stems from earlier court proceedings that left unresolved matters requiring appellate review. According to Morgan, the expiration of this window could signal upcoming activity in the case, as the regulatory body is expected to notify the appeals court of any material developments. I was expecting some filing in the SEC v Ripple case given what happened to the last motion that was dismissed two weeks ago, especially given that the 60 day period which the parties have before the SEC is required to file a status report with the court of appeals expires on 16… pic.twitter.com/I250sVGKLx — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 29, 2025 Background and Procedural Update The status report obligation arises in the context of a broader legal process following the dismissal of recent motions. Most notably, Judge Analisa Torres denied both Ripple and the SEC’s joint request for an indicative ruling, classifying the motion as procedurally inappropriate. Indicative rulings allow trial courts to express whether they would grant a motion if the appellate court were to remand the case. In this instance, the parties sought to resolve issues regarding a long-standing injunction and the distribution of escrowed funds. With Judge Torres declining to issue a position on the matter, future procedural steps will depend on whether the parties resubmit a properly formatted request. Unusual Filing Highlights Courtroom Tensions While developments from the primary parties are anticipated, an unexpected filing recently surfaced in the court docket. Bill Morgan noted the submission of a lengthy statement by a third party criticizing the application of the Howey Test, a legal standard used to determine whether an asset qualifies as a security. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The filing, which reportedly spans several pages, argues against judicial interpretations of the term “investment contract” and challenges the SEC’s use of the Howey test. Although unlikely to influence the outcome of the case, the document underscores the broader tensions and public interest surrounding the litigation. What Could Happen Next? If a properly submitted motion for an indicative ruling is accepted, Judge Torres would then need to clarify whether she would dissolve the standing injunction. This step is essential for the parties to proceed with requests involving the distribution of funds; $50 million would be transferred to the SEC, while the remainder would be released back to Ripple. Following a favourable indicative ruling, both parties are expected to jointly request a limited remand from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. If granted, Ripple and the SEC would return to Judge Torres’ court to formally seek the agreed-upon relief. Once those conditions are fulfilled, the appellate court could dismiss both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal, effectively concluding the current phase of litigation. As June 16 approaches, all eyes remain on whether the SEC will file its update and whether either side will submit the appropriate documents to move the case forward. The outcome will not only influence Ripple’s operational future but may also set precedents for regulatory oversight in the broader cryptocurrency industry.

However, if you have let past winning opportunities pass you by, 2025 is your year, thanks to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Just like all other millionaire-makers of the past, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently trading at less than $1 per coin. It also has a massive social media following of over 10k followers on X alone, which is rare for a presale token in the DeFi space. However, past whales that have minted millions in other projects are also looking to grow their wealth. As such, they have been quietly entering the MUTM presale. So far, over $9.4 million worth of presale tokens have been taken off the table. The presale is in Phase 5, where each token is going for $0.03, which marks a 200% increase from the Phase 1 pricing of $0.01. At the current price, investors stand to make a 100% return on the listing price of $0.06. However, this opportunity will not last long, with the price set to go up by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to a price of $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing the rules Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not paying by the well-established rules of hype before purpose. Instead, it is changing the rulebook and using utility to drive growth. As proof of this, the project recently posted the results of its Certik audit, which has provided a massive boost in trust. Naysayers who had been quietly watching from the sidelines have now fully committed, looking to be part of a new wave of innovation. A look at the protocol’s design reveals why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting so much attention. It is built as a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol, which features two modes. In the first mode, called P2C (peer-to-contract), lenders deposit their funds in a collective pool and earn an annualized percentage yield on their deposits. The interest rate is dynamically decided by the pool’s utilization rate. The second mode is called the peer-to-peer (P2P), where lenders and borrowers interact directly with each other to set the terms of a trade. They pick the interest rate, the repayment period, partial fills, and more. P2P contracts are maintained separately from the P2C mode to ensure that the high volatility used in this mode does not impact the overall DeFi marketplace. This mode is built for assets like the BONK meme coin, known for high volatility and low liquidity. Another unique aspect of this project is the mtTokens, which give depositors in the lending pools access to instance liquidity. For instance, when lenders deposit $1,500 worth of BNB in a pool, they receive mtBNB tokens, whose value is equivalent to their share in the pool, plus accrued interest. These mtTokens allow lenders to keep track of their portfolio in real time. Additionally, they ensure that holders do not need to actively compound their gains. The system is built to enhance transparency while ensuring non-custodial ownership. It also unlocks liquidity for lenders by allowing them to transfer their mtTokens to secondary markets or use them to acquire loans on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As such, they can benefit from all new market opportunities, even while still earning interest. Transparent dividend payouts Mutuum Finance aims to ensure transparency at all levels, which ensures that users make informed decisions while also promoting trust in the ecosystem. One example of this is dividend payouts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens at market rates and distributes them to stakers on the platform. These stakers are thus incentivized to continue playing their important role. Since all transactions are on the blockchain, it boosts trust, which will encourage more stakers to provide liquidity on the platform. This positive feedback loop is the hallmark of all products launched by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project relies on market forces and positive reinforcement to create a long-lasting project that will become a staple of DeFi once it goes live. The project recently revealed that it plans to launch a beta version of the platform on listing day, which could push up interest in MUTM to dizzying heights. A working proof of concept available for anyone to inspect and try should help eliminate doubt. All those still amazed at how such a brilliant project could be priced at the low entry price of $0.03 per token will finally be convinced.

Bitcoin fell over 2% to under $104,000 and traded just over $103,600 in Asian afternoon hours Saturday, while the CoinDesk 20 index slumped 4.2% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) fell nearly 4%, xrp (XRP), BNB Chain (BNB), Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL showed losses between 2-5%. Cronos Network’s CRO was the only gainer in the top 100 tokens with a 12% on no immediate catalyst. Analysts attributed the downturn to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. ""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email. “President Trump accused China on social media of violating the recent trade truce, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admitted in an interview that talks with Beijing had stalled.” The derivatives market also pointed to increasing investor caution. Open interest in Bitcoin futures is up 51% since April, while options have ballooned by 126%, according to data from Deribit. Whale wallets, which had been accumulating Bitcoin throughout the year, recently shifted to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges — a classic sign of profit-taking.

In a recent interview , Tischhauser pointed to what she calls a “supply shock” — a state in which Bitcoin’s liquid supply is dwindling while institutional demand continues to grow. “Large demand will have a strong multiplier effect,” Tischhauser said, estimating that for every $1 of net new demand, Bitcoin’s market capitalization could increase by $20 to $30. “We have already seen this multiplier effect after the launch of the BTC spot ETFs or around the US elections,” she added. BTC’s supply, particularly the portion actively traded, has been declining over the past 18 months. Tischhauser attributes this trend to the rise of long-term holding structures such as institutional acquisition vehicles, including Strategy and Twenty One Capital. These entities are accumulating Bitcoin with the intention of holding it off exchanges, which reduces the amount available to meet new demand. A Perfect Storm of Bullish Drivers Tischhauser also pointed to macroeconomic and regulatory developments contributing to her bullish outlook. With rising concerns over inflation and increasing global interest in BTC as a deflationary store of value, the narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” is gaining traction. Additionally, regulatory clarity in the United States and other major economies is encouraging institutional participation, which could further reduce supply available for retail investors. Since April 16, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have only seen four days of outflows , indicating steady institutional interest and capital inflow. This consistent demand, combined with structural supply constraints, sets up what some analysts believe could be a dramatic rally in the coming quarters. Healthy Pause in Bitcoin Price Nick Forster, founder of on-chain options protocol Derive, agrees that Bitcoin could be preparing for its next major move , but not before taking a breather. “The current price action suggests a phase of consolidation,” Forster said, calling it a “healthy pause” that allows the market to stabilize after reaching new highs. This period of sideways movement may also serve as a base for a strong upward push, with some analysts projecting BTC’s next peak between $200,000 and $300,000. As the supply continues to tighten and demand holds strong, the groundwork may already be in place for next bull run.

According to on-chain data, this whale address missed out on a potential profit of $42.64 million in total by “buying high and selling low.” The address in question sold 50,754 ETH at $1,754 on April 23, earning 89.03 million USDT. It was reported that 15,000 of these ETH were used to open a short position with borrowed assets. However, 27 days later, this USDT amount was only able to buy 34,343 ETH at $2,592. Thus, the investor suffered a loss of 16,452 ETH. The 35,754 ETH he initially owned fell to 19,302 ETH after the transaction. Related News: The Big Day Has Arrived: FTX's $5 Billion Payments Are Beginning - Here Are the Official Statements When compared to today’s market value of these transactions, the loss becomes even clearer. The 19,302 ETH in his hand is currently worth approximately $5004 million, while the current value of the 35,754 ETH he had before the transaction is $92.69 million. The difference indicates a loss of $42.64 million. Meanwhile, institutional interest in Ethereum continues to grow. According to Farside data, US spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded net inflows for nine consecutive trading days, attracting a total of $486 million in capital. *This is not investment advice.

If you thought May was going to close out quietly, think again. This past week has been chaotic – full of volatility, influence, and power plays. From sudden exchange bans to surprising legal reversals, the industry is being pushed – and pulled – by regulators across the globe. Thailand’s crackdown, the SEC’s unexpected move to drop charges, and growing political pressure in the U.S. are just a few signs that the industry is moving fast. But let’s take a step back to get you all caught up. Here’s the top stories that you might have missed + everything you need to know to go into June well prepared. Let’s begin. #1 Trump-Era Shift? SEC Walks Away from Binance Battle After nearly two years of headline-grabbing allegations, the SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Binance and co-founder Changpeng Zhao. The dismissal, filed with prejudice , means the regulator can’t reopen the case. The SEC simply said the decision was made “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter.” The move follows a 60-day pause and growing speculation about a regulatory tone shift under President Trump. Binance was originally accused of inflating volumes, misusing funds, and trading unregistered securities. Now? The case is closed with no admission of guilt. Binance, as expected, celebrated the win as did the larger crypto community. Huge win for crypto today. The SEC’s case against us is dismissed. Thank you to Chairman Atkins & the Trump team for pushing back against regulation by enforcement. U.S. innovation is back on track – and it’s just the beginning. — Binance (@binance) May 29, 2025 #2 Reform’s Farage Set to Make UK a Global Crypto Powerhouse Nigel Farage is betting big on Bitcoin AND the British ballot. At Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, the Reform UK leader unveiled his party’s “Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill,” promising to slash crypto capital gains tax to 10%, create a Bitcoin reserve at the Bank of England, and outlaw banks from de-banking crypto users. “We are going to launch in Britain a crypto revolution,” he said, holding up the bill on stage. With crypto adoption soaring among young Brits, Farage says it’s time to catch up and he’s ready to lead that charge. #3 U.S. Lawmakers Launch CLARITY Act for Clear Crypto Rules Regulatory confusion has been a constant headache for the U.S. crypto industry but that may be about to change. On May 29, bipartisan lawmakers introduced the CLARITY Act, aiming to draw clear lines around digital assets. Led by Rep. French Hill and supported by key figures like Tom Emmer, this bill wants to assign clear agency oversight and legal definitions to the crypto market. With areas like exchange registration and stablecoin rules on the table, it could bring much-needed certainty. If passed, the CLARITY Act might be the framework the U.S. has long lacked, giving both investors and innovators room to breathe. Can’t wait! #4 Trump Media to Join Bitcoin Billionaires’ Club President Donald Trump’s media startup, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), is making a headline-grabbing move: it plans to pour $2.5 billion into bitcoin. The company, known for Truth Social and Truth+, announced it will fund the purchase by selling stock and convertible bonds. Devin Nunes, TMTG’s CEO and Trump ally, called bitcoin “an apex instrument of financial freedom” and said holding crypto will protect the company from “harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.” This deal could soon put TMTG among the largest public corporate holders of bitcoin, showing how the Trump camp is doubling down on digital assets. #5 Thailand Cuts Off Five Unlicensed Crypto Giants Thailand is drawing the line! Starting June 28, five big-name centralized exchanges – Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX, and XT – will be cut off from the country’s internet. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made it clear: these platforms have been operating without proper registration. This is a protective move against crypto-related crimes and money laundering. The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society will enforce the ban, aiming to shield investors and clean up Thailand’s digital scene. #6 GameStop Buys Bitcoin, Loses Wall Street GameStop just made a $500 million bet on Bitcoin but investors are not on board. The move, intended to offset falling video game sales, triggered a 10% stock drop immediately, and a total plunge of 23%. While the company raised $1.5 billion to fund the pivot, critics aren’t sold. Many fear it’s like past mistakes, exposing GameStop to Bitcoin’s volatility. With store closures increasing and revenue declining, this shift has left the market asking: is this an act of desperation? #7 Solana to Hit $275? Standard Chartered Thinks So Standard Chartered dropped a bold forecast: Solana could hit $275 by end-2025 and stretch to $500 by 2029. The bank sees strength in Solana’s low-fee, high-volume use cases especially for financial and consumer apps. But there’s a catch: “achieving scale… could take time.” Despite leading meme coin activity, the bank notes $SOL looks cheap compared to its application revenue. Still, it expects Solana to underperform Ethereum near-term, with the $ETH/$SOL ratio rising to 17 by 2027, before correcting. Big potential, but the road’s not smooth. #8 Elon Musk Exits Trump Administration Elon Musk is out. The billionaire has officially stepped down from his role in the Trump administration, citing mounting frustration with the federal government’s resistance to cost-cutting reforms. As head of the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Service, Musk had aimed to rein in bloated spending but Trump’s sweeping budget plan pushed the deficit in the opposite direction. “Much worse than I realized,” he admitted, referring to the bureaucratic pushback. #9 New Stablecoin Bill May Lock In Dollar’s Digital Future The GENIUS Act recently cleared a major hurdle in the Senate, and it could redefine how the U.S. treats stablecoins and the dollar’s role in Web3. Backed by a 66–32 procedural vote, the bill demands 1:1 dollar reserves, strict audits, and federal licensing. Foresight Ventures says this would make the USD the “world’s digital settlement currency.” However, let’s hold further speculation till the final floor vote. #10 Cantor Fitzgerald Launches Bitcoin Fund Crypto cautious? This might be for you. Cantor Fitzgerald is launching a five-year Bitcoin fund – but here’s the twist: it’s hedged 1:1 with gold. Capture Bitcoin’s upside while using gold to lock in downside protection. “It’s designed to bring traditional investors into the ecosystem,” said Chairman Brandon Lutnick at Bitcoin 2025. Cantor’s previously teamed up with Maple and FalconX on BTC lending. Now, they’re taking a bigger swing at merging legacy finance with digital assets. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! SharpLink Doubles Down on ETH: In an interesting play, SharpLink Gaming shifted $425M into ETH and named Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman, marking one of the largest crypto treasury plays by a public company to date. NY Crypto Investor Held Hostage: Michael Carturan, an Italian crypto investor, was abducted in New York and held hostage for 17 days – all so his captors could get to his Bitcoin. The suspects have been caught, but the case is a reminder that holding crypto wealth isn’t just a digital risk anymore. Hong Kong Sets the Stage for Stablecoin Licensing: Hong Kong passed a law creating a formal license for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. This puts it among the first to offer clear rules, aiming to attract global crypto firms and boost its Web3 ambitions. SEC’s High-Profile June Summit: On June 5, the SEC will hold a conference highlighting how tokenization is transforming asset management and explore regulatory frameworks to support innovation in digital assets. TON’s New VP Hire Sparks Rally: TONcoin surged nearly 16% after Nikola Plecas, ex-Visa payments exec, joined TON Foundation as VP of Payments. His move ignited a sharp buying spree, pushing $TON past $3.25 with strong volume support. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead: With regulatory fog finally starting to clear, June looks set to bring some major moves. The GENIUS Act could reach final approval, potentially locking in the U.S. dollar’s digital future. Expect more institutional players to jump in as clearer rules and new products, like Cantor Fitzgerald’s gold-hedged Bitcoin fund, gain traction. Hong Kong is positioning itself as a stablecoin hub, attracting global crypto firms with fresh licensing laws and a clear regulatory framework. May’s mix of regulatory progress, growing adoption, and security challenges shows the market is volatile but also maturing fast.

The trader pseudonymously known as Sherpa tells his 246,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is still in a “strong bullish trend” despite breaking below the $106,000 support level. According to the widely followed analyst and trader, Bitcoin is primed to “bounce” as there is strong support at around the $104,000 price level. Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on Sherpa’s chart on the four-hour time frame, Bitcoin could fall lower to just above $103,000 and then trade sideways for a while in a consolidation zone. “Things look okay for now, I would expect more pokes around this area but the longer the time spent here, the better in my opinion. You want to see a good low form.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,841 at time of writing. Turning to Popcat ( POPCAT ), Sherpa says the memecoin built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem is one of the altcoins that is in “dangerous territory.” Based on Sherpa’s chart of POPCAT on the four-hour time frame, the memecoin is at risk of breaking a crucial support area after printing a bearish lower high setup. “Coins that were great before like POPCAT might have just made a lower high and could be breaking this last low. I’m not saying it won’t bounce but I’m much more cautious right now than two weeks ago.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X POPCAT is trading at $0.385 at time of writing, down by around 30% over the past week.

The report, focusing on the first three months of 2025, says scams and market manipulation have gone up by 200% compared to the previous quarter. Most of these cases were found in India, Indonesia, and the CIS region. Fraud Attempts Skyrocket MEXC discovered over 80,000 cases of fraud in the first quarter alone. These scams included coordinated efforts by groups using fake trades and automated bots. In total, the exchange says it found over 3,000 fraud groups. Two main factors seem to have caused this jump. First, MEXC listed new tokens from smaller markets, which attracted both new users and scammers. Second, MEXC’s low trading fees brought in more people, including those looking to take advantage of weak oversight. India and Indonesia Lead the Pack India saw the highest number of suspicious accounts, with nearly 27,000 flagged. Indonesia had about 5,600 suspicious accounts, and the CIS region reported over 6,400. Indonesia’s numbers are especially worrying, with a 1,300% jump compared to late 2024. Experts say the excitement around crypto in these areas often grows faster than people’s knowledge about safe trading. A February report from India’s National Centre for Financial Education found that only 27% of Indian adults know the basics of managing money. Among younger people, the number drops to just 19%. This lack of knowledge gives scammers an easy way in. False Promises from Fake Influencers Many people in these countries learn about crypto through social media, like Telegram or YouTube. Unfortunately, not everyone giving advice is honest. Some pretend to be trusted influencers, sharing fake tips and secret investment schemes. They promise fast gains, but many of these are scams meant to trick people. MEXC Steps Up ProtectionIn response, MEXC is strengthening its systems. They’re using real-time fraud detection and reviewing suspicious accounts. MEXC also plans to teach users how to avoid scams and protect their money. Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, said, “2025 has shown a new kind of scam. We’re focused on stopping these tricks and helping our users trade safely.”",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 09:25:38

Currently, DOGE is priced at $0.22, slightly down on the day but holding a solid position after a strong May rally. With renewed momentum and persistent social media buzz, many believe DOGE could still see further upside this cycle, yet some long-time holders are beginning to diversify. While DOGE remains a nostalgic favorite, its massive market cap limits explosive potential compared to early-stage altcoins. That’s why a growing segment of investors is rotating gains into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , eyeing the kind of returns DOGE delivered in its prime. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.4 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,500 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,500 investors have invested $9.4 million in the presale pointing to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, Mutuum Finance is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $10.7 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards to early investors. Ten lucky participants in the ongoing Mutuum Finance Giveaway will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. While Dogecoin continues to ride waves of social buzz and whale accumulation, its upside may be limited compared to high-potential early-stage projects. That’s why savvy DOGE holders are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a next-gen DeFi platform offering powerful innovation, audited security, and real-world utility. With over $9.4 million raised and 11,500+ investors already on board, the momentum is undeniable. Investors getting in at $0.03 today are set for a 100% ROI at launch, with long-term forecasts suggesting a potential 17,800% surge. With a Certik audit complete and a unique dual-lending model in place, now’s the time to move. Join the presale before the next price jump.

Analysts Predict Bullish Phase Ahead",https://bitcoinist.com/is-ethereum-preparing-for-a-move-to-3800-analysts-predict-bullish-phase-ahead/,"Trading in the mid-$2,000 range, Ethereum (ETH) has repeatedly teased a move toward $3,000, only to fall short and retreat back into its current range. However, several crypto analysts remain confident that ETH’s ascent to $3,000 and beyond is only a matter of time. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Renewed Strength In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted ETH’s bullish price action. The analyst shared the following daily ETH chart, showing the cryptocurrency breaking out of a bullish flag following a period of consolidation – potentially setting its sights on a target of $3,800. Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto shared Titan’s outlook, saying that ETH is “holding up really well right now.” In a separate X post, the analyst added: It looks like a breakout is coming, and $3K is just around the corner. The fact that it’s outperforming #BTC this quarter is a strong sign that altcoin season is warming up. Meanwhile, crypto trader Jelle urged patience. Sharing the following chart of ETH’s recent price movement, he emphasized that ETH is behaving as expected as it continues to challenge a key resistance level. According to Jelle, the “real fun” will begin once ETH hits $3,000. Notably, ETH continues to attract strong institutional interest. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows for Ethereum topped $91 million yesterday, with BlackRock alone accounting for $50.4 million of that total – a clear sign of sustained confidence in the digital asset. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted significant whale accumulation. According to Martinez, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH acquired over 1 million ETH in the last 48 hours – a strong signal of long-term bullish sentiment. Large ETH ETF inflows and whale purchases signal rising institutional confidence and aggressive accumulation – trends that often precede bullish price action. By reducing the available supply on the market, these moves can help fuel upward momentum and price appreciation. Technical Patterns Signal Bullish Continuation From a technical standpoint, Ethereum is showing encouraging signs. Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader pointed out that ETH appears to be closely following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. In this pattern, the spring phase involves a false breakdown below support to shake out weak hands, followed by a test to confirm waning selling pressure. This sets the stage for the jump – a strong rally above resistance with significant volume, marking the start of a new uptrend. According to Merlijn, ETH has already completed the spring and test phases and is now poised to enter the jump phase – potentially setting the stage for a move toward a new all-time high (ATH). That said, all eyes are on the FTX creditor payouts expected later today. Experts warn that the massive $5 billion distribution could temporarily dampen ETH’s bullish momentum by increasing short-term selling pressure. At press time, ETH trades at $2,603, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital currency|ETH|ETH ATH|ETH bull flag|ETH whale|Ether|ETHUSDT|Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-31 09:30:40

A total of $688 million in liquidations hit traders, with 89% of them on the long side — reflecting a heavily bullish market. The largest single liquidation order was a $12.25 million BTC/USDT on OKX, Coinglass data shows. Bitcoin-tracked futures led losses at over $153 mmillion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at around $122 million. Solana (SOL) faced liquidations totaling about $33 million, XRP futures at $30 million, and Dogecoin (DOGE) futures at over $22 million. ""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a bilateral trade deal, prompting him to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% to protect domestic industries. He claimed China reneged on a May agreement to ease trade tensions, adding that he might discuss the matter with President Xi. While China is a top steel exporter, most of its steel is already subject to existing tariffs, per Reuters . Trump’s move rattled global trade markets, with potential implications for key minerals and overall relations between the two nations. The broader crypto market was also swept by the sell-off, with Ether down nearly 4%, XRP and Solana falling around 4-5%, and Dogecoin diving over 8% on the day. Data from Deribit shows open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April, with options up 126%, signaling increasing investor appetite for leverage. But whales — large holders with more than 10,000 BTC — have shifted from accumulation to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges in a classic sign of profit-taking. A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Still, the renewed tariff flare-up, combined with a jittery derivatives market, has traders bracing for more volatility ahead.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-31 09:31:12

Now, several evidence point to the altcoin’s struggles throughout the 2023-25 cycle, which revealed both volatility and capital flow patterns that contrast sharply with prior cycles and competitor assets like Bitcoin and Solana. Ethereum Faces Significant Headwinds One of the most notable indicators is Ether’s realized volatility, which has compressed across cycles as the asset’s size grows, currently hovering around 80%, down from over 120% in earlier periods, according to Glassnode’s latest report . Typically, Ether’s 3-month realized volatility rises during bull markets and falls during bearish trends. However, this cycle has defied that pattern. In fact, after reaching 60% at the mid-2024 peak of roughly $4,000, realized volatility surprisingly climbed above 90% even as the price declined toward $1,500. This atypical increase in volatility amid falling prices signals increased market uncertainty and instability. Moreover, while the drawdown structure in this cycle generally aligns with the typical Ether bull market pattern – where corrections of 40% or more from local peaks are common – the key deviation lies in the absence of a fresh ATH price for the altcoin, unlike Bitcoin and Solana, both of which set new peaks in this cycle. This lack of a new high has been a disappointment for many investors who expected the world’s second-largest crypto asset to track more closely with its peers. Additionally, Ether’s downside price movements have been unusually volatile, with multiple drawdowns exceeding 40% and the current 2025 drawdown peaking at an unusually severe 65.4%. While previous cycles have seen similar or worse drawdowns, they tended to occur later in the cycle. As such, this early, steep correction suggests structural weaknesses unique to this period. In terms of capital inflows, the Realized Cap – a measure of the value of all Ether based on the price at which coins last moved – has increased by only 38% since the cycle low in January 2023, growing from $176 billion to $243 billion. This pales in comparison to the massive growth during the 2021 cycle, which saw more than a 1,000% increase. The relatively muted capital inflow of approximately $67 billion during this cycle underlines weaker liquidity support and helps explain the crypto asset’s subdued price performance. Supporting this narrative, trade activity on major centralized exchanges has mirrored these trends: spot volume, which peaked at $14.7 billion per day during the $4,000 price high in December 2024, plunged by roughly 80% to $2.9 billion per day. Though recent trading volumes have rebounded to $8.6 billion daily, spot volumes have yet to establish new cycle highs, as seen with previous cycles. Average ETH ETF investor Substantially Underwater The firm’s analysis further revealed that the average investor in the BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETFs is currently facing an unrealized loss of approximately 21%. Net outflows from these ETFs have tended to accelerate whenever Ethereum’s spot price drops below the average cost basis, observed during important declines in August 2024 and again in January and March 2025. Despite initial excitement, the ETFs accounted for only around 1.5% of spot market trade volume at launch, pointing to a lukewarm reception. While this rose to over 2.5% in November 2024, it has since reverted back to 1.5%. While the current market conditions reveal mounting pressure for the crypto asset, certain market experts also predict that it could hit the $3,000 mark as early as June.

The bill would also ban banks from denying services to crypto users, addressing concerns over “debanking.” The UK plans to enforce mandatory crypto trade reporting from January 2026 to boost tax compliance. Nigel Farage, leader of Britain’s Reform Party, has thrown his full backing behind cryptocurrency, unveiling an ambitious pro-crypto legislative plan at this year’s Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Taking the stage on Thursday , Farage promised that if elected prime minister in the UK’s next general election, scheduled for 2029, his government would champion crypto-friendly reforms. Waving a draft of the proposed “Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill,” Farage declared, “We will campaign for this and we will put it in place when we win the next general election… Bring crypto and digital assets in from the cold.” UK Bill Proposes 10% Crypto Tax The proposed bill would significantly lower capital gains tax on crypto from the current 24% to 10%, mandate that the Bank of England create a Bitcoin reserve, and prohibit banks from denying services to individuals or businesses based on their crypto-related activities. The practice of so-called “debanking” has become a flashpoint in both political and crypto circles. Farage himself has claimed he was denied bank accounts for political reasons, a grievance he leveraged to connect with the conference’s audience. “I went to 10 banks, all of whom refused me an account,” Farage told the crowd. “No wonder so many people are going for Bitcoin—because they can’t close you down, and that is the ultimate freedom.” Farage is no stranger to controversy. He previously led UKIP, the driving force behind Brexit, and has long been a polarizing figure in British politics. The Reform Party, his current platform, has faced its own accusations of racism, which party leaders have denied. On Thursday, Farage also announced that the Reform Party now accepts crypto donations via its website, supporting Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and USD Coin (USDC).

In recent years, politicians in the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina have advanced similar initiatives, linking crypto’s decentralization ethos with broader anti-establishment narratives. Farage closed his speech by appealing to the conference audience, framing the Reform Party’s crypto-friendly stance as part of a larger fight for financial freedom. “It’s about freedom and control of your own money,” he said, “and that’s what we stand for.” UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

PBS claimed that the order sought to use the federal government’s power to punish PBS, whose content Trump argued was biased against conservatives. PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural northern and central Minnesota areas. The lawsuit said Trump’s order was an “existential threat” to the network. A PBS spokesman said the station concluded it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public TV’s editorial independence and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations. Trump ordered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the system. Through the corporation alone, the network received roughly $325M this year, most of which went directly to individual stations. PBS also disclosed that 22% of its revenue came directly from the feds. PBS disputes charged assertions in the ‘strongest possible terms’ BREAKING – YOUR REACTION: @PBS sues Trump, citing First Amendment violations over taxpayer funding. The public broadcaster claims the May 1 order cutting its funding infringes on its constitutional rights. pic.twitter.com/6eY56cErDQ — Simon Ateba (@simonateba) May 30, 2025 PBS’ lawyer, Z.W. Julius Chen, wrote in the suit filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington that the station disputed Trump’s allegations in the strongest possible terms. The suit alleged Trump’s order was unlawful, exceeded his authority as president, and violated Constitutional protections of free speech because he had made clear he did not like PBS’s news coverage and programming. The station stated that for Minnesota residents, the order threatened the “Lakeland Learns” education program and “Lakeland News,” described in the lawsuit as the only television program in the region providing local news, weather, and sports. The network also disclosed that the U.S. Department of Education had canceled a $78 million grant to the system for educational programming, which would have been used to make children’s shows like “Sesame Street,” “Clifford the Big Red Dog,” and “Reading Rainbow.” “Trump’s order would have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans.” – Z.W. Julius Chen , PBS Lawyer PBS claimed that its action challenged an unnecessary presidential directive attacking it and its member stations in a manner that would tumble public television. It added that the order made no attempt to hide the fact that it was cutting off the flow of funds out of a desire to alter the network’s content. Trump’s administration receives another lawsuit from NPR Trump recently described what NPR published as left-wing propaganda and ordered the CPB to cut the network’s federal funding. However, the CPB clarified that the president had no standing or power to issue the executive order. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations also argued that Trump admitted he was using his power to target the station because he disagreed with the content of their speech. The lawsuit also argued that Trump’s executive order was “textbook retaliation” and “viewpoint-based discrimination.” It explained that the government’s targeting of not just the substance of speech but also a speaker’s particular views was presumptively unconstitutional. Katherine Maher, NPR’s CEO, said it was not right that Trump’s order sought to force the network to adapt its journalistic standards and editorial choices to the preferences of the government if it was to continue to receive federal funding. However, NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik confirmed that the Corporation of Public Broadcasting had not yet frozen money. The lawsuit made a strong case that the Trump administration lacked the power to direct the CPB to stop funding it. It also noted that, even if the CPB did, Trump’s efforts violated the First Amendment rights of the station and its listeners. NPR also argued that Trump violated the Public Broadcasting Act because he could not, by an executive order, tell the CPB to stop funding it. The station also claimed that the executive branch did not have the constitutional power to tell the CPB to stop funding it. The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, spending power.

This plan contrasts with the short-term strategies followed by many investors. Rather than seeking immediate returns, Farina aims to retain most of his position until the token’s value reaches triple-digit territory. XRP is currently trading at $2.19, and while this is much lower than Farina’s long-term objective, he remains focused on future milestones, with his approach centered on value retention, selective profit-taking, and long-term utility through decentralized finance. A Milestone to Celebrate Growth Farina does not intend to sell a substantial portion of his XRP, even when the token reaches higher valuations. He has previously warned community members not to sell their tokens at current levels and explained in his video that his first small sale will occur when the asset hits $10, a point he considers suitable for locking in a minor percentage of gains. According to him, this step is not an exit but rather a way to celebrate progress and redirect some funds into real estate investments, particularly in Greece, where he has already been active with proceeds from other cryptocurrencies. He also shared how his holdings are managed. The vast majority of his XRP is stored offline in cold wallets, with only a small portion held on exchanges for liquidity purposes. He recently drew attention to the Mt. Gox collapse that ruined the lives of many Bitcoin holders and warned XRP holders to move their tokens off centralized exchanges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Taking Profit at Future Price Levels Farina revealed that he would sell some tokens at $50, but noted that the scale would be modest. The next target is $100 , and Farina has explained that selling just 1,000 tokens at this price would bring in $100,000. Farina argued that withdrawing the original capital investment is a sound practice in risk management, but insisted that the majority of his tokens will not be sold. A Better Option than Selling Farina’s ultimate goal does not involve liquidation but rather participation in lending opportunities once the legal framework for XRP becomes more defined. He believes that lending XRP through regulated platforms will allow investors to earn yield in stablecoins, fiat currencies, or even XRP itself. Other experts have also advocated for this approach , as they expect large-scale institutional adoption once all regulatory issues are resolved. While some experts believe XRP may not hit $100 until the next decade, Farina remains unfazed, emphasizing long-term utility and passive income potential. He advises strategic selling, not reacting to short-term price shifts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In crypto and web3, money can be created, lost, or multiplied within seconds. It’s the polar opposite of old money, which grew slowly, accruing value over years or even decades. Crypto accelerates that, posting double-digit moves before TradFi wakes up and has breakfast. You might also like: From crypto projects to digital asset companies: It’s time to level up web3 comms | Opinion This hyper-cycle of onchain value creation—and eradication—compels us to reconsider what money truly is and how it functions in a decentralized future. While traditional money was based on nation-states and central banks, web3 money is founded on code, consensus, and community belief. It writes its own rules—and then forces the rest of the world to follow along. Not because they have to, but because if they don’t, they risk being left behind. It’s a case of innovate or die. And right now, web3 is doing most of the innovating as it reimagines what money is capable of achieving—and who it achieves it for. In this new environment, capital is not just capital: it represents culture, software, and storytelling. Value is digital, 24/7 tradable, and accessible to everyone, not just the suits in their glass towers. The future of finance is being rapidly built before our eyes, and mastering this transformation calls for rewriting the rulebook on what money means. A generation of digital natives is growing up, to whom money doesn’t mean checking accounts and 401 Ks—it means self-custodied stablecoins, yield-producing assets, and collectibles that can command eye-watering prices. Navigating this future calls for viewing money through five new perspectives. Reimagining money First, money has become a networked belief. In crypto, money is no longer issued by governments but created through consensus. Bitcoin ( BTC ) represents trust in a limited supply and decentralization, while Ethereum ( ETH ) shows faith in programmable agreements. Even memecoins demonstrate that stories, viral spread, and community engagement can generate market value without practical utility. In this system, value grows with belief. Money becomes a network effect: a shared idea we all participate in. We know why Bitcoin is valuable: because it’s hard to obtain, has a fixed supply, and is secured by the world’s largest decentralized network. But precious as these attributes are, Bitcoin’s value ultimately comes down to a shared, networked belief. We believe it is precious, and hundreds of millions of others share our conviction, so Number Go Up. Second, money functions as infrastructure rather than status. In traditional finance, wealth is the goal. In web3, it serves as a tool to build ecosystems, coordinate communities, and motivate action. Tokens fund development. DAOs direct capital toward common goals. NFTs serve as programmable access layers, not just collectibles. Here, money works as infrastructure: it is a tool, not a trophy. It’s the means, not the endgame. It’s often said that money doesn’t buy happiness—merely freedom of choice. What is crypto if not the ultimate embodiment of that concept? Freedom to build; freedom to collaborate; freedom to buy and sell anything, any time, to anyone. Third, money exists as a transparent flow. Blockchain technology makes every transaction visible. Unlike traditional systems hidden behind intermediaries, on-chain finance transforms money into traceable, verifiable movement. This creates a new dynamic: behavior becomes observable, and economic patterns become public. It makes us think about not just how money moves, but why. The important question becomes: What does this movement reveal about our true values? The psychology of money Fourth, money operates as a temporal illusion. Crypto’s volatility shows an important truth: value is not fixed; it’s constructed. In web3, fortunes appear or disappear in minutes. This volatility affects both finances and psychology. It teaches us that money does not equal security but represents a constantly changing narrative. This instability requires humility, not exaggeration. Quick profits may come easily, but their real cost often becomes apparent later. As the bitcoiners’ mantra goes, “Stay humble and stack sats.” In other words, don’t flaunt your wealth: be grateful for what you’ve got and keep quietly adding to it if your conviction in its value remains undiminished. Finally, money functions as a moral code. Programmable money allows us to embed values directly into code. Incentive structures can reward transparency, collaboration, environmental protection, or long-term contribution, not just speculation. This means web3 gives us the unique opportunity to design moral money—money that reflects shared principles, not just market forces. In the web3 era, money isn’t merely what you possess: it’s what you help create. It reflects collective belief, functions as a programmable social layer, and serves as a tool that can either strengthen or weaken the values we care about. This is why astute web3 VCs invest not only in technical innovation but in value-aligned ecosystems. Because if we can redesign financial infrastructure, we also have the responsibility to ask: what kind of world should it serve? Let’s not just earn money. Let’s reimagine it.

HYPE, ADA, XYZ, SEI, and NEAR Stand Out",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-digital-assets-are-building-momentum-for-2025-hype-ada-xyz-sei-and-near-stand-out/,"With 2025 fast approaching, certain digital assets are capturing attention. HYPE, ADA, XYZ, SEI, and NEAR are making waves with advancements and community growth. This article examines these assets, uncovering what makes them unique and how they might shape the digital landscape in the near future. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Hyperliquid: Fast, Fee-Free Trading on a New Blockchain Platform Hyperliquid is changing the world of decentralized finance with it’s a new blockchain that was made from scratch to be quick and useful. The blockchain makes sure that transactions are swift and safe by using its own mechanism called HyperBFT. With HyperBFT, traders do not have to wait when you trade on Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid stands out because it also lets people trade perpetual futures without having to pay gas expenses. That’s right—there are no extra charges to worry about as everything happens on-chain, so all transactions are safe and clear. The blockchain platform is in a good position to make a huge difference since it has a team of professionals from leading universities and IT businesses. Cardano’s ADA: The Green Blockchain Revolution A lot of people are interested in Cardano in the crypto market. ADA is Cardano’s own coin, and it competes with Ethereum’s ETH. Cardano is a blockchain that was developed to support smart contracts. This means that developers may create new cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance apps, and games here. Cardano is distinct because it aims to be beneficial for the planet. It uses a system called Ouroboros, which doesn’t need as much energy as proof-of-work models do. Cardano’s blockchain has two levels: one for processing transactions and the other for running smart contracts. This design might allow it manage as many as a million transactions per second. ADA has a lot of prospects in the crypto market. Many people appreciate Cardano’s environmental benefits, particularly as concerns about the impact of cryptocurrencies on the environment grow. Ethereum has been the greatest choice for smart contracts, but Cardano’s way of doing things uses less energy and can develop. In 2021, Cardano native tokens were added, which made smart contracts safer and cheaper to use. ADA is a wonderful choice for people who want things to work well and last. SEI: A Sector-Specific Layer 1 Blockchain for Trading Sei is getting a lot of attention because it is the first Layer 1 blockchain for trade. The blockchain is quick and effective because it can handle a lot of orders every second and complete transactions in just 380 milliseconds. Sei is making itself look like a strong platform for the future of online trading. It has support from big companies and a strong promise to keep things safe. If Sei’s currency hits its highest price forecast, analysts say it could go up by 323.76% by 2030. This potential sets Sei apart from other businesses in the current market cycle. Sei’s unique approach to things could be its biggest strength, unlike other blockchains that try to do too much. In an industry where speed and safety are very important, Sei’s unique technology stands out. Sei’s one-of-a-kind service could give it an edge over other companies as more people trade and want things to happen faster. Sei could be a coin to watch if you’re an investor who wants to keep up with what’s going on in the blockchain world. NEAR Protocol: A Fresh Start for Scalable and Decentralized Apps The NEAR Protocol blockchain platform is meant to help developers who are making decentralized applications (dApps) by making their lives easier. NEAR makes things more efficient and scalable by using a technology called sharding, which is what their Nightshade solution does. This means it can do more transactions at faster speeds and for less money. Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin started the project, and it has gotten the attention of big venture firms, which have given it more than $20 million. NEAR works on a distributed network, which is like centralized data storage systems but with the benefits of being decentralized. NEAR stands out because it cares about how well different systems work together and how easy it is for users to use. The Rainbow Bridge makes it easy to move tokens between NEAR and Ethereum, which makes it possible for people to work together and grow. Aurora, a Layer 2 solution on NEAR, also uses Ethereum’s technology to improve performance and lower costs. NEAR is a good choice in the current market cycle because it is scalable and has low transaction costs. It is a strong competitor in the blockchain space because of its unique approach to sharding and focus on helping developers. Conclusion Though HYPE, ADA, SEI, and NEAR show promise, XYZ’s sports memecoin aspires to unmatched growth, blending meme culture and sports in a community-driven ecosystem.

The early believers who bought Bitcoin at $0.10 and watched it soar to thousands. Today, that moment seems like a legend—something that passed you by. But what if you had a second chance? What if you could go back in time… and this time, do it right? A growing number of crypto veterans believe that moment is here again, just in a new form. It’s called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), and it’s quietly becoming one of the most serious contenders for the next generational wealth wave. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: More Than Just a Coin Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s building on its core—scarcity, decentralization, and security—but reshaping it for scalability, sustainability, and utility. Imagine Bitcoin if it was launched today, designed for mobile-first users, equipped with smart contract functionality, and cross-chain compatibility baked in from day one. With a fixed supply of 21 million tokens, BTC-S mirrors Bitcoin’s scarcity but adds layers of innovation that make it usable in today’s fast-paced DeFi world. From the upcoming Solaris Nova app, which will allow users to mine directly from mobile phones , to enterprise-ready smart contracts, BTC-S is gearing up to dominate across sectors. How Bitcoin Solaris Delivers at Lightning Speed Unlike the original Bitcoin network, which can struggle under transaction load, Bitcoin Solaris runs on a dual-layer architecture. The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) for decentralization and security. The Solaris Layer, on the other hand, uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for rapid speed and minimal energy use. Performance Highlights: Base Layer: Up to 3,000 TPS Solaris Layer: Up to 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality Smart contracts written in Rust Uses Solana’s tooling and Proof-of-History to accelerate adoption And yes—the Solaris Nova app will allow anyone with a smartphone to participate in mobile mining, creating daily income from something already in your hand. From Zero to Wealth—How BTC-S Levels the Crypto Playing Field BTC-S Tokenomics: Scarcity, Utility, and Fair Distribution Bitcoin Solaris follows a structured tokenomics model that reflects both fairness and forward-thinking strategy. 66.66% for mining rewards over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% each for development, community, staking, and marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This balanced approach ensures long-term community alignment while incentivizing adoption and growth at every stage. Presale Frenzy: The Final Hours of This Phase Today marks the last day of the current presale phase, with BTC-S still priced at just $5 . With a launch price of $20, early backers are looking at a potential 1,900% return. The presale is exploding—over 11,000 unique users have already joined, raising more than $1.8 million. Why the buzz? Because this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market, with less than 9 weeks left until launch. Momentum is building—and fast. And if you want to stay plugged in? The project is active across platforms like Telegram and X , where real-time updates and conversations are heating up. A Word on Trust and Community Validation Security is critical. That’s why Bitcoin Solaris has undergone dual smart contract audits, one by Cyberscope and another by Freshcoins . In addition, a full KYC verification has been completed, increasing investor confidence as the ecosystem grows. In addition, crypto enthusiasts are already calling this “the one they won’t miss again.” A detailed review by Crypto Volt breaks down exactly why Bitcoin Solaris is drawing attention from investors, influencers, and analysts alike. And judging by the community energy, this could be just the beginning. Conclusion: You Wished for a Do-Over—Now It’s Here Bitcoin at ten cents felt like a once-in-a-lifetime moment. But every cycle brings new chances to those who are watching closely. Bitcoin Solaris offers more than a coin—it offers a complete, scalable, and decentralized platform primed for growth.

Many analysts believe that this coin is massively underpriced and will experience a massive breakout when it goes live. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently in the presale phase, where each coin is going for $0.03. So far, over $9.4 million worth of tokens have been sold, with 11,300 unique buyers participating in the presale. The presale is in phase 5, representing an opportunity to get a 100% ROI based on the $0.06 listing price. So far, over 9% of the tokens for this phase have been sold, which is impressive considering it is barely a week old. MUTM tokens started selling at $0.01 in phase 1, and the price has since increased by 200%. The token price will grow 16.67% in the upcoming phase to $0.035. If you plan to purchase MUTM tokens in the presale, this is your last opportunity to make a 100% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Prediction The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has inspired a lot of confidence in the crypto world. Many analysts predict the price will rise 10x when the tokens go live. At the planned listing price of $0.06, a 10x increase would represent a price of $0.6. With the price still below $1, experts expect the price to rise to $2 in the coming weeks after the launch day price increases. Many analysts believe that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has enough support to reach a $1 billion total value locked due to its unique value proposition. At its current price, analysts have described it as the “best crypto investment” opportunity of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently passed its Certik audit, which opens many doors for the project. For instance, a Certik audit means that getting a listing on a top tier exchange should be easy. Coupled with the team’s dedication to delivering a beta version of the project on listing day, it is expected that top tier crypto exchanges will reach out for an opportunity to be the first to list it. All these factors combined reinforce the analysts’ opinion that the current presale price represents a massive bargain on the expected price. Once it goes public, analysts expect a massive breakout. Beyond The Hype: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that aims to be more than just about the hype. Its main value proposition is the dual-mode lending protocol. This unique DeFi protocol features a P2C mode and a P2P mode. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) mode, lenders and borrowers interact via a shared liquidity pool, governed by an audited smart contract. Lenders deposit funds, and they earn interest on those supplied funds on an annualized percentage yield basis. The interest rate a lender receives is determined by the pool’s utilization rate, which ensures maximum capital efficiency. Additionally, lenders get access to instant liquidity via mtTokens. For example, when a lender deposits $3,000 worth of BNB, they receive mtBNB tokens. These tokens can be used as collateral for new loans on the platform. The mtTokens, which are based on the ERC20 token standard, can also be freely moved to secondary marketplaces, allowing holders to take advantage of market opportunities. In the peer-to-peer (P2P) mode, users directly negotiate rates on more speculative assets like the BONK meme coin. These are assets whose volatility is often high, which causes many DeFi protocols to exclude them. The genius Mutuum Finance (MUTM) solution is to create unique smart contracts where lenders and borrowers can trade in them, without affecting the overall stability of the protocol. It ensures that holders of these tokens have a chance to actively participate in the DeFi world and accrue interest on their assets. To ensure the overall stability of the ecosystem, all loans, where P2C or P2P must be overcollateralized. The overcollateralization is monitored via a stability factor, which measures how secure the collateral backing a loan is. If the value of the collateral dips below a set level, a liquidation occurs. Liquidators then step in to buy back the debt at a discount, which helps to stabilize the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that could experience a 10x increase in value on listing day, due to its unique value proposition. For early supporters of the project, gains of up to 20x are possible at the current presale price. The low entry barrier of $0.03 represents a massive opportunity for those seeking growth in the crypto world.

According to reports, the grand jury handed up the indictment against the suspect, William Duplessie. The information was made available to the public by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, noting that the indictment will remain sealed until his arraignment on June 11. According to authorities, Duplessie is facing charges of assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and possession of a weapon, with authorities charging him alongside his co-conspirator, John Woeltz. Meanwhile, his legal representative is yet to comment on the indictment. United States court to arraign second suspect in crypto kidnapping incident According to prosecutors, William Duplessie and fellow crypto investor John Woeltz lured the victim to a posh townhouse in Manhattan’s Soho neighborhood on May 6 by threatening to kill his family members. The Italian native, whose identity has still not been revealed by authorities, said he was held captive at the apartment for 17 days. He mentioned that the two criminals took turns to torture him with electrical wires, forcing him to smoke from a crack pipe, and at a point, dangled him from a staircase of a five-story building. The victim mentioned that he decided to hand over the passwords to his device to the assailants on a Friday morning, managing to flee as his captors went to retrieve the device. The decision of the grand jury followed a brief appearance made by Duplessie on Friday morning in a Manhattan court. The judge also mentioned in court that a protective order was still in effect, though refusing to mention who it was concerning. Duplessie, who is listed as a founder at various blockchain-based firms was escorted in handcuffs and wore a prison jumpsuit. Meanwhile, according to previous reports, Woeltz was denied bail at his court hearing, with the judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in custody. His defense attorney had reportedly sought his release on a $2 million bond, noting that he has a degree in philosophy, among many other things. The 24-year-old woman Beatrice Folchi who was also initially arrested and charged alongside Woeltz has also been freed, with prosecutors announcing the dismissal of the charges against her in court, pending further investigations. New York City police commence investigations into two detectives The New York Police Department has confirmed that it is looking into two detectives in connection to the case. The NYPD mentioned to news outlets that its officers “were modified” and “the matter is under internal review.” According to the New York Post, one of the two detectives served as a security detail to Mayor Eric Adams. The police mentioned that both detectives acted as private security for Woeltz and Duplessie after they had clocked out of their shifts for the day. According to reports, one of the detectives is suspected of having driven the alleged victim, the 22-year-old Italian crypto millionaire, from the airport to the townhouse where the incident occurred. The other detective has also been accused of working with the captors in an “unauthorized capacity” during the period. The police department mentioned that both officers have since been placed on desk duties as the investigations continue. “It sounds like they just circumvented the process. Perhaps they were tempted by the allure of the salary, right? Salary comes into play,” said Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD detective and current professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He added that sometimes, the money is worth it and officers always want to take a chance if they see it. However, he added that if officers do it without authorization, it could get them suspended or fired. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, recently called it a “big step forward” in a post on X. It reflects a growing belief that the U.S. may finally be moving toward meaningful regulation for digital assets. A big step forward: the bipartisan CLARITY Act builds on momentum for comprehensive crypto rules in the U.S. Clarity shouldn’t be controversial — and this bill moves us closer to a smart, workable framework. Thank you to @RepFrenchHill , @CongressmanGT , @RepAngieCraig ,… https://t.co/po9dd9GCEk — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 30, 2025 This bipartisan bill could give the American crypto industry the structure it needs to thrive, while putting the U.S. back in the race for global leadership in digital finance. What Is the Clarity Act All About? The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act aims to solve one of the biggest problems in the U.S. crypto market – regulatory confusion. Introduced by Chairman French Hill and supported by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, the bill outlines a clear split of responsibilities between the SEC and the CFTC. It also proposes a national licensing framework that would make it easier for crypto businesses to comply with regulations. This could create healthy competition, attract more innovation, and include tailored rules for stablecoins to fit their unique financial role. The goal is to reduce uncertainty for crypto companies and investors and bring more clarity to how digital assets are governed. AI Transparency Takes Center Stage The bill doesn’t stop at crypto. It also introduces new rules around artificial intelligence. Specifically, it requires federal agencies to publicly disclose how they’re using AI in their regulatory processes. This includes information about what the AI does, its limitations, and how much it costs. According to Representative Bryan Steil, this type of transparency is essential to building trust to the “golden age” we are in now. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act has been introduced. It's time to bring CLARITY to the golden age of digital assets. https://t.co/UtzZySqcNS — Bryan Steil (@RepBryanSteil) May 29, 2025 Ripple’s Alderoty Backs the Move Stuart Alderoty has been a long-time advocate for smart crypto laws, and the Clarity Act lines up with his vision. In his post, he praised the lawmakers who have pushed the bill forward, including French Hill, GT Thompson, Angie Craig, Dusty Johnson, Don Davis, Bryan Steil, and Ritchie Torres. Alderoty believes this bill could bring the U.S. closer to the level of regulatory clarity already seen in other countries. He also sees it as a step toward encouraging more institutional investment and helping crypto businesses operate with greater confidence. More Crypto Laws in the Pipeline: GENIUS and STABLE Acts The GENIUS Act, passed by a 66-32 Senate vote on May 20, 2025, mandates 1:1 reserve backing allowing banks and non-banks to issue them under tiered management. Concerned by Senator Warren about weak protections, it awaits a June vote. Additionally, given consumer safety, the STABLE Act , which was presented by Representatives Hill and Steil, prohibits FDIC claims and suspends algorithmic stablecoins for two years. A Defining Moment for U.S. Crypto? With major crypto players like Ripple backing it and bipartisan support in Congress, the Clarity Act could be a turning point for crypto regulation in the United States. By encouraging innovation, protecting consumers, and creating a clearer legal framework, this legislation has the potential to finally unlock the U.S. crypto market’s full potential. The world is watching closely. If passed, this bill could help the U.S. move from playing catch-up to leading the global digital asset revolution.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|GT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 10:01:19

The Graph price is expected to go as high as $1.00 in 2025. GRT price with a potential surge could reach a maximum of $3.54 by 2030. AI may be taking center stage in today’s tech revolution, but behind every smart application lies the challenge of accessing and organizing reliable data. That’s where The Graph (GRT) steps in—an innovative indexing protocol transforming how blockchain data is queried. As interest in The Graph surges, especially after its major 2025 upgrades and the launch of substreams-powered subgraphs, the question on everyone’s mind is: Can GRT price reach $1?

In the past 6 months, the number of queries sent was 12.1 billion queries. The growing ecosystem means strength increasing on fundamental levels, which is the core element for mass adoption to come in the future. The GRT price could benefit strongly in the coming future, as many factors are aligned optimistically for the crypto. As seen on its weekly chart, its price action appears to be following previous patterns, where the $0.08 support block has played a key role in previous bullish runs. It is seen in the past that after every multi-month period of correction, the breakout is strong. This time also, the GRT price has been spending a lot of months in correction, but like historical patterns, witnessed. The price action in Q2 2025, the GRT price has reacted to the $0.08 level again, which is the same support block that has shown strong demand before. If in May 2025 GRT price succeeds in breaking a declining trendline, representing the current multi-month correction, then a humongous surge is awaiting that could lead to a parabolic rise to $1, but a $0.55 high is a must for its price to reach that level. Moreover, its transaction USD volume is consistently on the rise, and user addresses interacting with the platform in the past 30 days have become stronger, too.

ETF provider REX Shares recently filed to introduce these groundbreaking funds using unconventional regulatory structures that have attracted considerable industry attention. The staking feature has long been considered a critical missing piece in crypto ETF offerings, especially since spot Ether ETFs went live in July 2024. Several executives have argued that without staking, these ETFs remain incomplete. Now, REX Shares appears to be addressing that gap through a novel legal and regulatory setup. Rare C-Corp Structure Used to Avoid Delays Unlike most ETFs, the proposed REX Shares funds are structured as C-corporations—an uncommon format in the ETF space. ETF analyst James Seyffart described the approach as “very rare” in a May 30 post on X, noting that it allows the funds to sidestep the typical 19b-4 filing process with the SEC. “These ETFs are 40-act funds with a unique structure and do not go through the 19b-4 process,” Seyffart explained. This has enabled REX Shares to potentially fast-track approval, while other firms, such as Bitwise, continue to await SEC decisions on similar proposals . In its filing, REX Shares clarified that the fund will be taxed as a C-corporation, meaning it will incur current and deferred tax expenses. These will be reflected in the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV), a key detail for investors evaluating the fund’s long-term performance. Crypto ETF Staking Ahead? Seyffart added that the REX Shares ETFs will gain exposure to Solana and Ether through Cayman-based subsidiaries and aim to stake at least 50% of their holdings. “This is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory workarounds to get these products to market,” he said, emphasizing that while the structure has trade-offs, it seems to have found favor with regulators. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, echoed the sentiment, saying, “Looks like two crypto ETF launches are imminent,” and noting that staking is the major innovation that could make these ETFs more attractive to long-term investors. Even major firms like BlackRock have acknowledged the importance of staking . In March, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, called their Ether ETF a “tremendous success,” but admitted it was “less perfect” without staking. That may soon change if REX Shares’ approach proves successful.

45327081,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738383,1748689210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45327081.jpeg,"Japan endures $12 billion in weekly withdrawal from stocks, largest in its history",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japan-stocks-see-record-12b-weekly-outflow/,"Japanese stocks just recorded the biggest weekly outflow in history, as $11.8 billion was yanked out between last Wednesday and this week, according to data reported by Bank of America. The sell-off came as yields on long-dated government bonds exploded to all-time highs, driven by investor fears about Japan’s ballooning fiscal deficit. The cash exit from Japan didn’t happen in isolation. Globally, equity markets lost $9.5 billion over the same period — the highest for the year. US stocks lost $5.1 billion, while European equities brought in $1 billion, a rare contrast as Japan dealt with the most intense capital flight it’s ever seen. Source: TradingView Bond demand crashes as yields surge Yields on 40-year Japanese government bonds hit 3.689% on Thursday, which is also a record. They later dropped to 3.318%, still nearly 70 basis points higher than where they were at the start of the year. 30-year yields also jumped over 60 basis points to 2.914%, while 20-year yields rose over 50 basis points. That came right after demand for a new batch of 40-year debt fell to its weakest level since July 2023, based on calculations by Reuters. The collapse in demand followed a critical change in market structure. Japanese life insurance companies, usually reliable buyers of long-term bonds, have already fulfilled their regulatory quotas, according to Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager on the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments. With them out of the picture and the Bank of Japan scaling back its bond purchases, yields have nowhere to go but up. This spike in yields has massive implications outside Japan. Investors are now worried about a possible return of funds to Japan from the United States, especially if Japanese bond yields start to look more attractive than US returns. Albert Edwards, global strategist at Societe Generale, said this could trigger what he called a “global financial market Armageddon.” He pointed out that if Japanese investors move their money home, the first to get hit will be US tech stocks, which have seen huge inflows from Japan over the years. Michael Gayed, portfolio manager at Tidal Financial Group, warned that the situation is more dangerous than people think. “Japan looks like a ticking time bomb. If confidence in one of the financial market’s traditionally safe assets has cratered, confidence in the global market could go with it,” Michael said. Carry trades start to unwind as yen rises The surge in bond yields is also threatening to unwind the yen carry trade, a strategy where investors borrow in yen, which normally has low interest rates, and invest the money in higher-yielding foreign assets. That setup only works when the yen stays weak. But now, with yields surging and capital starting to return home, the yen has strengthened more than 8% since the beginning of 2025. That previous carry trade unwind happened when the Bank of Japan raised rates in August 2024, leading to a sharp yen rally and a big sell-off in global markets. Now the setup is even worse. Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, warned that “the carry trade unwinding that is about to ensue will be worse than that in August 2024.” Alicia said the stronger yen, pushed higher by capital returning and investors dumping dollars, can’t be sustained for long. But for now, it’s gaining steam, and it’s dragging global markets into deeper volatility. The stakes are high because Japan holds ¥533.05 trillion ($3.7 trillion) in net external assets, the second-largest in the world. When that kind of capital starts moving back home, it throws off global liquidity and raises borrowing costs across the board. David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy, said that tightening liquidity could push global growth down to 1% and stretch the bear market even further. He also said this is the end of the idea that the US is the default winner in global investing, a sentiment now spreading in Europe and China. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

As blockchain innovation focuses on usefulness and sustainability, this AI-powered network draws users and developers with a strong design and a presale that has already raised $3.4 million in USDT. Nexchain, which is now in stage 16 and costs $0.062, is more than another Layer 1 project. It’s a purpose-built infrastructure combines artificial intelligence and decentralized technologies to provide a smarter, quicker, and more equitable Web3 experience. The presale window provides a unique opportunity to participate in a project that is already gaining popularity before it enters the mainstream. Nexchain, the Intelligent Future of Blockchain Nexchain is reinventing what is possible in blockchain by incorporating artificial intelligence directly into its protocol. This enables real-time optimization and adaptive consensus, granting the network a significant speed advantage. Nexchain, with a transaction throughput of up to 400,000 TPS and costs as low as $0.001, provides an efficient, scalable alternative to traditional blockchains. The first outstanding feature is its AI-powered hybrid consensus, which combines Proof-of-Stake and machine learning to improve security and minimize latency. Then there’s Smart Contracts 2.0, intelligent contracts that optimize themselves based on network circumstances, bringing automation to DeFi, logistics, and IoT. Nexchain supports cross-chain interoperability, enabling smooth asset and data flows between major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain. With a DAO-first paradigm, consumers are immediately rewarded. By storing NEX in a non-custodial wallet, users earn daily payouts of 10% of the network’s gas fee revenue. These features are not future promises; they are part of Nexchain’s current and developing infrastructure. Nexchain, which was priced at $0.062 at presale stage 16, raised $3.4 million USDT, reflecting its expanding importance. Real-World Applications Nexchain’s AI-blockchain integration enables a wide range of use cases. In finance, it allows automated credit scoring and real-time fraud detection. Nexchain’s Smart Contracts 2.0 enables secure and confidential data sharing between organizations in the healthcare industry. Predictive analytics and transparent supply chain tracking benefit the logistics industry. Meanwhile, developers of dApps and games may use Nexchain’s cross-chain interoperability and near-zero costs to improve user experiences. The platform’s adaptability makes it an ideal basis for new decentralized technologies. Built with Security at the Core After completing a smart contract audit, Nexchain received a 78/100 score from Certik. This audit reaffirms the project’s dedication to strong and transparent security standards. The platform’s self-healing network mechanics and anomaly detection tools are protected by cutting-edge cryptography, including post-quantum protocols. These features safeguard against emerging attacks while preserving system integrity. Users gain from more than safety; having NEX in a non-custodial wallet earns them a 10% share of daily gas costs. It’s a passive investment with genuine rewards backed by a well-audited infrastructure. Nexchain leads the Presale List of 2025 As crypto investors seek more than simply buzz, Nexchain offers a presale grounded on technology and value. Its AI-enhanced scalability, cross-chain capability, and community-first governance result in a balanced and long-lasting blockchain solution. The enthusiasm is clear with a presale price of $0.062 and stage 16 already raising $3.4 million in USDT. Nexchain is more than just another brand in a congested sector; it is the greatest cryptocurrency presale of 2025 for those looking for innovation, dependability, and long-term value.

Yet here we are, years later, still pulling out credit cards at coffee shops while our crypto sits unused in digital wallets. SpacePay tackles this challenge with a payment platform that features a 0.5% transaction fee, works with over 325 crypto wallets, and provides instant fiat settlements for merchants. The London-based startup has already raised over $1 million during their ongoing presale, with $SPY tokens currently priced at $0.003181. Crypto Payments Without the Technical Mess Ask any shop owner why they don’t accept Bitcoin, and they’ll mention the complicated setup or expensive equipment. SpacePay cuts through this complexity with a simple solution that works with existing Android payment terminals. No expensive hardware needed. Just a quick software update. The NFC functionality allows customers to simply tap their smartphones against payment terminals, just like contactless credit cards. This familiar gesture makes crypto payments feel natural and effortless. The system works with over 325 different cryptocurrency wallets. Whether you store crypto on a hardware wallet or keep everything on your phone, SpacePay processes the payment smoothly. This compatibility means customers can use what they already have instead of downloading another app. Protecting Merchants From Price Swings Here’s the nightmare that keeps businesses away from crypto: a customer pays with Bitcoin for a $100 purchase in the morning, but by afternoon, that payment is only worth $85 because the market crashed. SpacePay solves this with technology that protects merchants from volatility completely. When someone pays with Bitcoin, the business owner gets regular currency immediately. That $100 sale stays exactly $100 in their bank account, whether Bitcoin crashes or soars five minutes later. The system freezes the exchange rate during the transaction. If Bitcoin’s price suddenly drops, SpacePay absorbs the difference instead of passing that risk to the merchant. Store owners don’t need to become crypto traders. They just see normal payments without the crypto drama. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1925613304023511376 Slashing Payment Costs That Hurt Small Businesses Credit card processing fees take between 2.5% and 3.5% from every transaction. Consider a local bookstore doing $30,000 in monthly sales. With traditional payment systems, they’re paying roughly $900 each month in processing fees. SpacePay changes this with their 0.5% transaction fee. That same bookstore would only pay $150 monthly – keeping an extra $750 every month. Over a year, that’s $9,000 staying in the business instead of going to payment processors. These savings come from eliminating unnecessary middlemen. Traditional systems bounce your money between multiple companies before reaching the merchant days later. SpacePay creates a direct path using blockchain technology, which maintains security while cutting excessive fees. Making Crypto Practical for Daily Life The technology behind SpacePay might be sophisticated, but the user experience is refreshingly simple. Most payment systems process transactions like cars moving through a single-lane tunnel – checking one thing at a time before moving to the next step. SpacePay takes a completely different approach. Think of it like having multiple security guards checking different aspects of an ID simultaneously. SpacePay checks wallet details, crypto balances, merchant info, and exchange rates all at once. This parallel processing explains why Bitcoin payments complete in seconds rather than minutes. Nobody stands around awkwardly waiting for confirmations. The transaction happens fast enough that it feels like any other payment method. Every transaction gets permanently recorded on the blockchain. It creates tamper-proof records protected by serious encryption. This distributed approach not only speeds things up but makes the entire system more secure than traditional payment methods. The platform handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes. Customers and merchants just see a clean, simple payment experience that works reliably every time. No technical knowledge required on either side of the transaction. The really clever part is how SpacePay handles the conversion from crypto to regular money. Most systems make this feel like two separate steps – first the crypto payment, then the conversion. SpacePay makes it feel like one smooth transaction where Bitcoin goes in and dollars come out seamlessly. Visit SpacePay Presale Real-World Adoption That Actually Works SpacePay isn’t building a solution for some theoretical future. They’re addressing real problems that prevent Bitcoin from being useful today. The platform already has plans to roll out across 4.5 million Android-based payment terminals in nine countries. This ambitious expansion works because SpacePay doesn’t force businesses to replace equipment they already own. The software-update approach means widespread adoption becomes possible without massive infrastructure investments. Early merchants testing the system report positive experiences. They appreciate the lower fees, instant settlements, and the fact that accepting Bitcoin doesn’t require becoming crypto experts. Customers enjoy finally being able to spend their digital assets at regular businesses without jumping through hoops. The $SPY token powers this ecosystem with features that extend beyond simple payments. Token holders receive monthly loyalty rewards, voting rights on platform decisions, and revenue sharing from transaction fees. This community-driven approach creates incentives for everyone to want SpacePay to succeed. How to Join the SpacePay Presale For those interested in joining the SpacePay ecosystem, the ongoing presale offers an entry point.

By integrating blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, DePIN projects are offering unique advantages for both consumers and producers, catching the eye of innovators and investors alike. This article highlights the top 10 DePIN coins to watch in 2025. These tokens stand out due to their strong market capitalizations and promising price trends, making them noteworthy players in this evolving sector. The Top 10 DePIN Coins Helium (HNT) HNT, the native token of Helium, is one of the top DePIN crypto projects consistently gaining attention from traders and long-term holders. This growing interest and confidence in the asset are not only due to the quality of the crypto project but also because the token is available for grabs at a lower price. HNT with its price below the 9-week SMA (3.65), showing weakness. However, the RSI at 42.46 suggests it is approaching oversold territory, hinting at potential accumulation. Despite recent weakness, HNT appears to be forming a base around $3. With RSI nearing oversold levels and historical bounce zones aligning, 2025 could bring a strong recovery. A break above $4.50 may trigger the HNT price momentum toward $7–9 resistance. Bittensor (TAO) Bittensor (TAO) price has recently bounced from around $366, closing strong at $401.5. The RSI has rebounded from near-oversold territory to 47.77, hinting at renewed bullish momentum. The price is currently reclaiming the 9-day SMA, which if held, could confirm a continuation of the uptrend seen since April. If TAO continues forming higher lows and breaks above $440 resistance, 2025 could see it revisiting all-time highs. With positive market sentiment and growing adoption of decentralized AI, TAO may exhibit strong bullish performance through 2025, potentially surpassing previous peaks and entering price discovery. Filecoin (FIL) FIL, the native token of Filecoin , is priced at $2.692 and is currently closing below the 9-week SMA, indicating short-term bearish momentum. The RSI is at 39.80, near oversold levels, which makes it a good buy for long-term investment. Despite being below key resistance and in a downtrend, past cycles show strong rebounds from similar zones, especially after prolonged consolidation phases. If macro sentiment improves and FIL reclaims the $3 level, a 2025 rally could push prices toward the $6–8 range. Theta Network (THETA) Theta (THETA), a popular and leading DePIN crypto project, has faced challenges since the beginning of December 2024. THETA is down -16.46% to $0.774 this week, trading below the 9-week SMA. is showing signs of nearing a bottom as it approaches strong historical support near $0.70. With RSI dipping below 40, it’s entering a key accumulation zone where past rallies began. If Theta price holds this level and breaks above the 9-week SMA, momentum could shift bullish. As market sentiment improves, THETA may target $1.50–$2.00 levels in 2025. Given previous explosive moves from similar patterns, a breakout from consolidation could trigger significant upside in the next bull cycle. Internet Computer (ICP) ICP is currently trading below the 9-day SMA at $5.158, forming a strong accumulation zone around $4.50–$5.00, which historically has been a launchpad for bullish moves. The RSI is at 38.71, near oversold territory, indicating potential for a reversal. As the broader crypto market turns bullish, ICP’s strong fundamentals like scalable smart contracts and Web3 infrastructure could help the ICP price break above the $6 level before heading toward the $10 milestone. IOTA (IOTA) Following the presidential election results , IOTA has gained widespread attention from crypto enthusiasts. IOTA is currently consolidating above its historical support zone and below its 9-week SMA at $0.1972. However, the RSI is at 44.98—near neutral, suggesting consolidation rather than severe bearishness. A long-term base seems to be forming between $0.15–$0.20, historically a key accumulation zone. As the IOTA ecosystem expands with smart contract adoption and integration with IoT networks, investor confidence is likely to grow. A breakout above $0.30 could trigger IOTA price to rally toward $0.50 and beyond in 2025. With increased utility, strategic partnerships, and broader Web3 adoption, IOTA is well-positioned to outperform in the coming crypto bull cycle. Render (RENDER) Render Token is positioned at a key support zone, below the 9-week SMA at $4.198. RSI at 43.45 suggests short-term bearish pressure but not oversold. Despite recent pullbacks, RNDR remains a top contender in the AI and GPU rendering space, fueling Web3 infrastructure. With rising demand for decentralized compute power in AI and 3D rendering, Render could surge as adoption grows. A sustained breakout above $6 could trigger Render price to move to retest 2024 highs near $12. Arweave (AR) Arweave is showing signs of bottoming out around a critical support zone, with RSI near oversold levels hinting at a possible reversal. As the premier decentralized storage solution for permanent data, Arweave stands to benefit from the surging demand for immutable blockchain-based storage, particularly from AI and NFT sectors. Its historical performance proves its ability to rally explosively from consolidation zones. Arweave price recovery above the $10 mark could trigger momentum toward retesting $25 and beyond. With Web3’s expansion and increasing interest in permanent data archiving, Arweave could reclaim its former highs in 2025 as confidence and network adoption grow. Akash Network (AKT) AKT price is trading at $1.235, below its 9-day SMA of $1.446, showing recent bearish momentum. The current downtrend offers a strategic entry as RSI dips near oversold territory at 36.11, hinting at a rebound. Akash Network is positioning itself as a decentralized cloud provider in an AI-driven world increasingly reliant on scalable compute. As demand for GPU infrastructure grows, Akash’s unique decentralized marketplace for compute could see explosive adoption. With its strong fundamentals and increasing developer interest, a recovery above $2 could ignite momentum towards previous highs and beyond. AIOZ Network (AIOZ) AIOZ Network focused on decentralized content delivery, is uniquely positioned to benefit from growing Web3 media infrastructure demands. The recent price correction has brought it near technical support, with RSI indicating potential for a bullish reversal. As partnerships grow and decentralized streaming gains momentum, AIOZ could ride the next wave of adoption. If bullish sentiment returns to the broader market and AIOZ reclaims the $0.50–$0.60 zone, it could quickly revisit 2025 highs and potentially break new ground. With solid fundamentals and increasing developer traction, AIOZ could emerge as a key infrastructure token in the decentralized digital content economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Despite new gaming utility, Pi coin faces selling pressure, dropping over 9%, with analysts predicting a possible slide to $0.40 before recovery. Pi Network is entering the gaming space to boost activity and show real use for its tools. The Pi Core Team has officially launched FruityPi, a new game app built to showcase how Pi’s tools, like the Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network, can be smoothly integrated into real-world applications. The Pi Core Team sees gaming as a perfect way to mix fun with real utility. Developers can benefit from Pi’s large, active community by getting more users, signups, and attention for their games. Gaming is a strong fit for driving fun, engagement, and utility in the Pi ecosystem. The new FruityPi game app shows how integration with multiple Pi products like Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network can benefit developers, while leveraging what the Pi community has… pic.twitter.com/8X8ULVYXEk — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) May 30, 2025 Pi Network Boosts Gaming with Real Utility Pi Network is inviting developers to build with its tools, like the Pi Wallet for in-game currencies and the Pi Ad Network for monetization. If the game becomes popular within the Pi ecosystem, then users could also apply to Pi Network Ventures. Earlier this month, PiCore launched a $100 million fund , Pi Network Ventures, to back projects building decentralized apps on Pi’s platform. Analyst Mr Spock shared a live example of real utility on the Pi Mainnet from the Fruity Pi app. He shared three key takeaways: Firstly, the mainnet utility is active, and Pi is being spent and accepted in real apps, which shows real adoption. Next, Sellers are independently setting their prices, such as 0.1 Pi for a power-up, so there are no fixed rates like the GCV (Global Consensus Value). Finally, the price is fully decentralized and controlled by developers and users, and not the Pi Core Team. He shared that this is a real example of real utility, real payment, and real decentralization at work, where the power to decide the price lies with the community. Pi Coin Drops Over 9% Pi coin is currently trading at $0.6177, and is down over 9% in the past day. Around 9.8 million tokens are set to be unlocked today, which will further add to the selling pressure. If Pi coin falls below the key level of $0.60, it could slide to April’s low of $0.40. Most technical indicators for Pi Coin show a bearish trend, with many oscillators and moving averages signaling “Sell” or “Neutral.” Overall, the charts point to a continued downward pressure on the price. Analyst Dr Altcoin has said that Pi’s price will likely drop until the end of August and then gradually recover. He says it could go down to $0.40, unless the Pi Core Team becomes more transparent. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

45328098,https://invezz.com/?p=2743114,1748689800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,MUTM could be the breakout token of 2025 after recent certik audit success,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/31/mutm-could-be-the-breakout-token-of-2025-after-recent-certik-audit-success/,"After a slow start in 2025, the altcoin season has now arrived, with breakout candidates already identified by analysts. One such project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is showing all the signs of a project on the verge of a massive surge. To further reinforce this sentiment, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project recently passed a Certik audit, making it one of the most trusted presale projects available to investors. The results of the audit have provided a massive boost in trust in the project, which has led to an acceleration in the pace of the presale. Despite being less than a week old, over 9% of the tokens reserved for the current phase have been bought. So far, over $9.4 million worth of presale tokens have been bought by over 11,300 unique buyers. The token presale is in phase 5, where each token is priced at $0.03. At this price, investors are guaranteed a 100% return on listing day, when the tokens will launch at $0.06. Those who got in at Phase 1 of the presale were lucky to get their tokens at $0.01. In the upcoming phase, the token price is set to increase by 16.67% to $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rides the utility wave One of the factors working in favor of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is timing. The project comes at a time when meme coin fatigue is setting in. Looking at social media posts on meme coins, many of them increasingly express a negative attitude towards the concept. Investors are now searching for utility-backed projects that can deliver long-term, stable growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) liquidity protocol aims to fulfill this niche. The protocol has three key participants: lenders, borrowers, and liquidators. Lenders and borrowers interact through two primary modes, which are P2P and P2C. In the P2C mode, or peer-to-contract, lenders deposit their assets in a collective pool from which they earn an annualized interest rate on their assets. The rate is determined dynamically based on the pool’s utilization rate. When many borrowers take up loans from a pool, the interest rate rises, which encourages more depositors to join the pool. In the peer-to-peer or P2P mode, lenders and borrowers interact directly and trade in high-volatility assets like the SHIB meme coin. These meme coins are kept in separate smart contracts to protect the more stable P2C contracts from undue volatility. The mode is designed to open up earning opportunities for meme coin holders, previously limited to earning through speculative trading. The other key player in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem is the liquidators. Within the protocol, all loans, whether P2P or P2C, are overcollateralized. This is a measure meant to ensure any shifts in the market do not destabilize the protocol. The rate of overcollateralization is constantly monitored via a stability factor. It checks various market signals to ensure that loans do not fall below a certain threshold of overcollateralization. If the collateral gets below the set limit, a position is automatically liquidated. The liquidators then step in and purchase the debt at a discount. By doing so, they make a small profit while also helping to keep bad debt out of the protocol. Growth through dividends The overall design of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to produce long-term value growth for all participants. One way to achieve this mission is via the use of dividends. Protocol profits are used to buy MUTM tokens at market rates. These purchases not only boost the value of the tokens but also promote the long-term health of the ecosystem by encouraging stakers. The purchased tokens are distributed to stakers as a reward for maintaining the security of the protocol. Since all purchases are on-chain and transparent, this incentivizes more stakers to sign up to get these rewards. It will ensure the long-term growth of the ecosystem as more stakers join in and deepen the protocol’s liquidity. Who can join Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not impose restrictions like the legacy financial system. You do not need to sign long, complex documents or submit your data. The whole protocol is decentralized, and the price of admission is currently at a low $0.03. Given the promised utility and the lofty projects by analysts, joining the MUTM token presale could be one of your best crypto investment decisions of 2025.

The announcement, part of a broader strategy to attract crypto and AI firms, has triggered an immediate backlash from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and for good reason. As the country wrestles with severe energy shortages and ongoing bailout talks, the IMF is demanding urgent answers. According to Samaa , officials are now facing “stiff questions” about how legal – or even logical – this mining push really is. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” said one government official involved in the negotiations. Here’s what you should know. Pakistan’s Crypto Play Falls Flat The plan, unveiled alongside the debut of Pakistan’s first Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference, was meant to signal a pivot toward digital finance. But the optics don’t match the infrastructure. Pakistan’s power grid is notoriously unreliable, with high transmission losses and blackouts still common. Meanwhile, industrial electricity rates hover around $0.22 per kWh – nearly 10x what miners pay in Texas. At that rate, mining one Bitcoin in Pakistan would cost a staggering $132,000, compared to the global average of around $40,000-$50,000. Even with a proposed subsidized tariff of $0.09/kWh, “the model falls apart,” warns local engineer Sana Zakir. “These subsidies may not be sustainable. Pakistan’s agreements with the IMF explicitly discourage blanket energy subsidies.” A Big Bitcoin Bluff! To make matters worse, the IMF claims it wasn’t even consulted about the plan. The Fund has flagged legal ambiguities surrounding crypto in Pakistan, raising red flags over the PDAA – the newly formed Pakistan Digital Asset Authority set to oversee exchanges, DeFi platforms, and tokenization efforts. This is a fundamental red flag. All the Right Ideas, All the Wrong Execution Pakistan does have potential. At least one can argue that it does. Cheap labor, untapped solar and hydro resources, and regional demand could have positioned it well – if the groundwork were there. But right now, it’s not. This was not a strategic move. It was a chaotic attempt to ride a wave without learning how to swim in the kiddy pool. Unless Pakistan overhauls its infrastructure, energy pricing, and regulatory clarity, it risks turning a high-profile initiative into a self-inflicted crisis. It surely wouldn’t be the first time.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 11:19:38

In a filing dated May 30, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Harper has no Fourth Amendment right to shield financial records held by the exchange. The government argued that Harper had voluntarily disclosed the information to Coinbase and that the IRS had acted within the law following a court-approved summons to obtain it. The filing also cited Coinbase’s privacy policy, cautioning users that information could be disclosed to law enforcement. IRS revealed underreporting of tax on gains from digital assets Harper’s case arose from a 2016 IRS investigation of pervasive underreporting of tax on gains from cryptocurrency. The IRS noticed a big difference between the millions of Coinbase users trading Bitcoin and the small number of taxpayers who reported their crypto earnings. Following these findings, the agency issued a “John Doe” summons that required Coinbase to hand over records about customers who trade in large amounts. Harper, who dealt in Bitcoin through Coinbase in relevant years, was against the IRS’s action. He, therefore, sued the agency, alleging that the IRS’s actions constituted an unconstitutional search of his financial information. However, lower courts disagreed with Harper’s claims, concluding that Coinbase’s records are business documents and not Harper’s private papers. They then gave the IRS the go-ahead to access the records. The government argued that Supreme Court precedent is on the IRS’s side. This is because it stressed that people have no expectation of privacy over financial records maintained by third parties Coinbase. It referred to past decisions on cases like United States v. Miller. The Supreme Court has not yet announced if it will take up the case. If it chooses not to, the First Circuit’s decision supporting the IRS will remain intact. The United States v. Miller case on privacy rights Following the United States v. Miller case, the US Supreme Court stated that people have the right to feel safe in their homes, papers, and belongings from unreasonable searches and seizures. This right cannot be violated, and no search warrants can be issued unless there is good reason, backed by an oath or confirmation, that clearly describes where to search and what or who to seize. The main topic of this case was what falls under this protection. If the government wants to search for evidence of a crime against someone, it must get permission first or have special urgent reasons that make the search reasonable. However, if the item being searched for is not protected by the Fourth Amendment and the way the search is conducted within reasonable bounds, then the rules do not apply. Concerning Harper’s case, the government highlighted that the Court of Appeals rightly dismissed the arguments made by the petitioner because they were both against the Court’s past decisions and lacking in merit. Coinbase reveals a data breach incident in its operations On May 15, Coinbase announced that it had been the victim of a data breach, where attackers had bribed support workers to provide them with the firm’s customer data. Customers’ names, account balances, and transaction histories were among the data taken. Coinbase also said the breach affected about 1% of its monthly transacting users. An example of those affected was venture capitalist Roelof Botha, managing partner at Sequoia Capital. Following the incident, Coinbase faced multiple lawsuits. As of May 15 and 16, six legal complaints have been filed, with plaintiffs alleging that the exchange failed to implement adequate security measures and mishandled its response to the breach.

Today, as crypto prices show renewed strength and investors search for the best crypto to invest in, these legacy coins continue to demonstrate resilience through strong fundamentals and expanding use cases. ADA’s smart contract capabilities and XRP’s focus on cross-border payments keep them firmly among the top cryptocurrencies for both long-term and short-term portfolios. However, the spotlight is shifting to new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising new crypto coin poised to capture the attention of those hunting the next big cryptocurrency. The MUTM presale has had over 11,500 members before a token price boost to $0.035 at the start of the next stage. Investors here can make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Will MUTM replicate the explosive growth of ADA and XRP from 2017? The evolving DeFi ecosystem and presale buzz suggest it’s a possibility worth watching. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.7 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 during he next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. Certik Audit Officially Completed, Stablecoin Secures Trust and Stability Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens.

With over $9.7 million raised from more than 11,500 investors and the token price set to double from $0.03 to $0.06 at launch, MUTM is already showing signs of strong upward momentum. Backed by a dual-model DeFi lending system, a certified Certik audit, and a USD-backed overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM blends innovation with investor trust. As the next presale phase approaches and interest continues to grow, now may be the ideal time to act.

Supreme Court decision could reshape privacy rights for millions of crypto users nationwide. The U.S. government is urging the Supreme Court to dismiss a legal challenge from James Harper, a Coinbase user who claims the IRS violated his constitutional rights by accessing his crypto transaction data. The case touches on a broader debate: do Americans have a right to privacy when it comes to their crypto activity? Background: IRS Targets Crypto Tax Evasion This dispute traces back to a 2016 investigation, where the IRS suspected widespread underreporting of crypto-related income. As part of its probe, the agency issued a court-approved summons to Coinbase, requesting information on high-volume users—including Harper. The IRS has since argued that such records are crucial in enforcing tax compliance and identifying unreported gains in the fast-evolving crypto space. Harper’s Argument: A Constitutional Overreach? Harper contends that the IRS violated his Fourth Amendment rights , which protect U.S. citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. His legal team argues that obtaining detailed financial data without individual suspicion constitutes government overreach into personal digital finance. Legal analysts note that this case could become a landmark in defining digital financial privacy. “The Fourth Amendment was written before the internet, but its spirit is very much alive in cases like this,” one privacy attorney told [news source]. U.S. Government’s Response: No Privacy Over Third-Party Records In a recent filing , Solicitor General D. John Sauer responded that Harper voluntarily provided his data to Coinbase, and therefore waived any reasonable expectation of privacy . The government pointed to legal precedents like U.S. v. Miller, which held that financial data held by third parties—such as banks—do not receive the same constitutional protections. Coinbase’s user agreement, the filing argues, also clearly states that the company may cooperate with law enforcement when required. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Could Shatter Public Trust in Banks, Warns European Central Bank Official , What’s at Stake: Financial Privacy in the Age of Crypto So far, lower courts have sided with the IRS, viewing Coinbase’s records as business data rather than private papers. If the Supreme Court agrees, it could effectively give the green light for broader government access to user data stored on crypto platforms. Legal takeaway: A ruling in favor of the IRS could set a precedent that weakens digital privacy protections for millions of crypto users in the U.S., not just those suspected of wrongdoing. Final Thought While this case may seem narrow, its implications could be broad and long-lasting. At its heart is a fundamental question: does the U.S. Constitution protect crypto financial records the same way it does your personal files and papers?

It has dropped by over 36% from its highest point this year. XRP ‘s price dropped for three consecutive days, reaching its lowest level since May 8 as sentiment in the crypto market waned. The ongoing XRP crash led to substantial losses, especially to leveraged traders. Hyperdash data shows that one whale has had an unrealized loss of $2.6 million as the crash accelerated. The whale opened the trade at $2.3715 and applied a 3x leverage. It will be liquidated if it drops to $1.3949, down by about 35% from the current level. Worse, the trader has other long positions on coins like Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), Cardano ( ADA ), and Cosmos ( ATOM ). All of these trades have accumulated large unrealized losses. His weekly unrealized loss was over $8.4 million.

The main catalyst for the decline was a TruthSocial post in which Donald Trump threatened a 50% tariff on European goods. The risk of escalation ended on Monday when he agreed to extend the deadline to July. Trade risks resumed on Friday after Scott Bessent warned that talks between the US and China had stalled. He believes that only a Trump and Xi Jinping meeting can solve the crisis for now.

Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

The seven-year bonds, featuring a 20% conversion premium , signal CEO Pavel Durov’s long-term vision for Telegram’s evolution from a chat platform into a blockchain-powered super-app and possibly a future IPO. Why Convertible Bonds? Legal Lessons From the SEC This move is a strategic pivot from Telegram’s infamous 2020 Gram token ICO, which ended in a bruising SEC lawsuit and a $1.2 billion refund to investors. Legal experts say the bond structure allows Telegram to sidestep regulatory landmines while keeping equity options open for the future. The bonds, priced at a 20% premium to Telegram’s eventual IPO share price, offer investors a lucrative upside while giving Telegram immediate liquidity and flexibility. If the bonds aren’t converted, they mature in 2032 with a fixed interest rate rumored to be between 5–7%. “After the SEC shut down their ICO, convertible debt was the smart play. It’s a nod to compliance without diluting equity ahead of a potential IPO.” — @CryptoLawyer, May 29, 2025 TON Ecosystem Expansion: The Real Prize The capital injection is earmarked for Telegram’s Open Network (TON), a blockchain platform that’s become the backbone of in-app payments, decentralized apps (dApps), and ad revenue sharing. Since integrating TON in 2023, Telegram has onboarded over 30 million crypto wallets, with TON’s market cap surging to $45 billion. The company’s goal is to leverage this user base to create a seamless ecosystem where users can send money, play games, and access DeFi tools — all without leaving the app. Key areas for growth include expanding the ad platform to reward users and channel owners with TON tokens, scaling gaming and NFT projects within Telegram, and building global payment rails to compete with tech titans like WhatsApp and WeChat. “Telegram’s bond raise isn’t just about survival — it’s about dominating the blockchain messaging wars.” — @BlockchainMatt, May 29, 2025 IPO Runway: How Long Will $1.7B Last? Analysts estimate Telegram’s annual burn rate at $400–$500 million, primarily for server costs, TON development, and regulatory compliance. The $1.7B raise buys 3–4 years of runway , aligning with speculation that Telegram could go public as soon as 2028. This war chest allows Durov and his team to focus on scaling the TON ecosystem and monetizing Telegram’s vast user base through premium subscriptions, business tools, and crypto-powered features. But the path to IPO is not without challenges. Telegram must prove that TON can generate sustainable revenue and withstand competition from established blockchain giants like Ethereum and Solana. Investors will also watch closely to see if Telegram can balance growth with regulatory compliance, especially after its high-profile run-in with the SEC. What’s Next? The bond raise positions Telegram as a crypto-finance hybrid, blending private growth with public market ambitions. If TON gains traction, Telegram could disrupt social media monetization or become a cautionary tale of overreach. The next few years will be crucial as the company races toward profitability and a potential blockbuster IPO.",News|Events,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TON,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-31 11:26:54

With Solana (SOL) still basking in its Layer-1 success, many investors are now shifting focus toward undervalued gems with higher upside. One such cheap altcoin, Mutuum Finance is gaining traction fast, with analysts projecting up to 10,000% gains as early backers pile in before the broader market takes notice. The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.4 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,500 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. While SOL continues to dominate headlines, particularly for its lightning-fast network and growing DeFi presence, it’s clear that some of the best cryptos to buy now may be found in lesser-known, low-cap plays gearing up for breakout runs. That’s why emerging contenders like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are starting to rival even the top Layer-1s in investor excitement heading into 2025. Solana Price Outlook: Strength Holds at $174 as 2025 Targets $275 Solana (SOL) is priced at $174, reflecting steady momentum in the face of recent fluctuations triggered by institution sell-offs. The network continues to lead high-performance blockchains with blazing speeds and low costs, making it among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this cycle. While short-term technicals advise caution, long-term projections are optimistic, with some analysts calling for an increase to $275 by the end of 2025, driven by institutional growth and demand from developers. Even so, as SOL becomes increasingly mature, some investors are considering early-stage projects with more ROI potential, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows A two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. That more than 11,500 investors have invested $9.4 million in the presale is a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $6 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Solana (SOL) is a strong long-term play, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers far greater upside. At just $0.03, with a launch price of $0.06 and targets as high as $6, MUTM could deliver up to 10,000% gains. With over $9.4 million raised, 11,500+ investors, a completed Certik audit, and a unique DeFi model, it’s one of the hottest altcoins this cycle. Join the presale now.

The token dropped from $2.20 to $2.14 as the broader crypto market shed 3.81% of its value, settling at a total market cap of $3.3 trillion. The volatility comes in the wake of the U.S. Court of International Trade’s decision to overturn Trump’s trade tariffs, reigniting trade policy concerns and sending ripples across risk assets. XRP wasn’t immune, with over $29.68 million in long positions liquidated as traders scrambled to adjust their exposure. News Background China-based Webus International said Friday it plans to raise up to $300 million through non-equity financing to support its global chauffeur payment network with an XRP reserve. The initiative aims to integrate XRP’s cross-border settlement capabilities into Webus’ ecosystem, including on-chain booking records and a Web3-based loyalty program. Webus is renewing its partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings to use the XRP Ledger for settling cross-border rides and driver payouts. Bitget listed Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin late Thusday. Ripple published a cross-border payments report on Friday. Cross-border payments underpin the $31.6 trillion B2B market, projected to hit $50 trn by 2032. Traditional multi-intermediary rails are slow, costly and opaque, facing regulatory and transparency hurdles. Blockchain-based solutions like Ripple’s stablecoin network promise near-instant, cheaper, visible settlement, enhancing liquidity, global expansion, talent payments and customer trust, while reducing failed transfers, the report said. Price-Action Technically, XRP found strong selling pressure at the $2.21 resistance level, failing to mount a sustained recovery. A notable support zone emerged near $2.11, with high-volume buying during the 03:00 hour preventing further downside. Recent consolidation between $2.13 and $2.14 suggests potential stabilization — though the pattern of lower highs indicates sellers remain in control. In the final trading hour, XRP formed a higher-low pattern around $2.135, signaling potential short-term support. However, the token also faced resistance at $2.144-$2.145, forming a tight range that traders will be watching closely for the next breakout or breakdown. Technical Analysis Recap XRP dropped 5.7% from $2.20 to $2.14 over the past 24 hours. A price range of $0.13 (5.9%) was observed between a high of $2.22 and a low of $2.09. Significant resistance formed at $2.21 during the 16:00 and 22:00 hours, triggering heavy selling. Strong buying at $2.11 during the 03:00 hour prevented further downside. Recent consolidation between $2.13 and $2.14 suggests potential stabilization, though lower highs persist. A higher low at $2.135 formed in the last hour, with resistance at $2.144-$2.145 capping any rebound. XRP closed the session at $2.137, indicating consolidation after a volatile day. As XRP navigates the crosswinds of macroeconomic tensions and technical headwinds, traders will be closely watching for any signs of sustained support or further breakdown.",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-31 11:30:00

Some market watchers see this dip as a pause before a major move. According to their charts, Bitcoin could be gearing up for another steep gain. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ Historical Patterns Point To Rebound Based on reports from the analyst known as “Mister Crypto,” rounded-bottom formations and ascending triangles have marked every big Bitcoin rally. In 2013, when Bitcoin was trading under $10, it spent months in a smooth, curved base before breaking out and climbing past $1,000. A similar pattern showed up in 2017. After nearly three years of sideways action, the price finally exploded toward $20,000. The last cycle in 2021 also followed the same playbook, with almost four years of building a wide base before shooting up to nearly $70,000. Bitcoin will go parabolic. This time won’t be different! pic.twitter.com/0fEMMMclbD — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) May 29, 2025 Mister Crypto’s chart suggests that the period after 2021 has formed another base. If history plays out the same way, his forecast points to a breakout in 2025 that could send Bitcoin as high as $900,000—a 760% rise from today’s level. Analyst Charts Re-Accumulation According to charts shared by another analyst, Bitcoin often moves in stages. First, there’s an initial “leg up” that signals the shift from deep accumulation into a growing bull trend. Then, the price settles into a sideways “re-accumulation” phase before the final run. From 2019 through 2021, Bitcoin followed this path closely. Analysts note that from late 2023 into mid-2025, Bitcoin looks to be in that same re-accumulation phase. If this unfolds as in past cycles, the next big upswing could push Bitcoin into the $270,000–$350,000 range before any parabolic spike comes into view. Long-Term Holders Keep Adding Coins On-chain data shows long-term holders (addresses that haven’t moved their coins in over 155 days) are still piling on. Between March 3 and May 25, 2025, these holders increased their overall supply by nearly 1.40 million BTC. That pushed long-term holdings from 14,354,000 BTC to 15,739,400 BTC. In previous bull markets—like those in 2013, 2017, and 2021—long-term holders often sold during the rallies to lock in profit.

If large pockets of Bitcoin remain off exchanges, fewer coins are available for new buyers. That could tighten supply and make sharp moves more likely once demand picks up. Looking Ahead In Uncertain Market Bitcoin has lost momentum recently, but many analysts feel these dips won’t last. At $105K region, the price sits below last week’s levels.

Most of these were longs being forced to sell into a falling market, accelerating the decline. This wave of selling has added significant downward pressure, and we are now at multi-week lows. The liquidation spree serves as a reminder of the dangers of leverage in a volatile cryptocurrency market, where significant price movements can trigger automated sell orders.

Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels and Rebound Signs On the technical front, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bearish, as BTC has violated the upward trendline. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has broken below a rising trendline and is forming a descending triangle. This classic pattern, where lower highs converge to horizontal support, indicates more bearish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-period EMA is a ceiling at $106,932. The MACD is confirming this with a bearish crossover and red histogram bars. Key levels to watch: Support: $102,141 – if this breaks, we could see $100,799 or $99,356 Resistance: $106,409 – potential reversal point if patterns emerge* Reversal Watch: Bullish candlesticks (Morning Star, Bullish Engulfing) at support, MACD divergence, 50-EMA reclamation as reversal signs The short term is bearish, but a significant reversal with strong buying at support could take us back to $104K and beyond. But without reversal signs, be cautious, as the path of least resistance is down.

The comment came during her appearance on Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street on Fox Business, where she was talking about the 2.1% rise in April’s personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. It was the slowest annual increase in four years. “That’s good relief for American consumers,” Mary said , but she also warned that this number doesn’t tell the whole story. “It’s an incomplete picture of what we have to look at as policymakers,” she said. She added that looking ahead, inflation still carries risks, and the Fed isn’t ready to make any sudden moves. Mary made it clear she still thinks monetary policy is in a good place, and she’s okay with two rate cuts in 2025, if inflation keeps cooling and the economy stays steady. “We can actually move one way or another as the data unfolds,” she said. But she also added, “You want to keep the policy rate modestly restrictive for now until we are sure that inflation is going to get to that 2%.” Trump met Fed’s Powell at the White House to demand lower rates The day before Mary gave her TV interview, President Donald Trump met with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the White House. This came after weeks of Trump pressuring the Fed to cut rates, both online and behind closed doors. Trump invited Powell to discuss “economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation,” according to Reuters. The Fed later confirmed the meeting happened, but said Powell didn’t give any policy guidance. He only repeated that any future changes to interest rates would depend entirely on economic data. The statement stressed that Powell and the rest of the central bank will continue to base decisions on “careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” But Trump is clearly not buying that. He’s been slamming Powell for weeks on his Truth Social account, accusing the Fed of holding back growth by keeping interest rates too high. On May 17, he posted, “THE CONSENSUS OF ALMOST EVERYBODY IS THAT, ‘THE FED SHOULD CUT RATES SOONER, RATHER THAN LATER.’ Too Late Powell, a man legendary for being Too Late, will probably blow it again – But who knows???” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump didn’t hold back in private either. “The president did say that he believes the Fed chair is making a mistake by not lowering interest rates,” Karoline told reporters. “It’s putting us at an economic disadvantage to China and other countries.” The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hasn’t cut rates since December, just before Trump returned for his second nonconsecutive term. Meanwhile, Trump is rolling out new tariffs that could increase inflation, complicating things for a Fed trying to manage prices while keeping the economy afloat. So far, the central bank is standing firm. Mary’s comments show that officials are in no rush to change course. The April PCE report may have been good news, but the Fed is still watching the road ahead — and they’re not done steering yet.

Livepeer (LPT) is now trading near $11.77, up more than 110% in less than 48 hours. With such a rapid rise, traders are asking: Why is LPT price going up, and is this rally sustainable into June? What’s Happening With LPT’s Price? Livepeer price forecast (Source: TradingView) The LPT price action over the past 48 hours reflects a clear breakout from a multi-week symmetrical triangle visible on both 4-hour and daily charts. The breakout above the $6.50–$7.00 resistance zone coincided with high volume, triggering a vertical move that touched an intraday high of $14.32 before pulling back slightly. Current price levels are consolidating just under $12.00, suggesting that profit-taking is underway after the parabolic move. However, the underlying structure remains bullish as long as LPT holds above the $10.00 psychological mark.

However, instead of BTC, the company is looking to use it to acquire Ethereum (ETH). According to the S-5 prospectus filed on May 29, Sharplink will use a substantial amount of proceeds from the offering to purchase Ethereum. The offering, which will involve the sale of up to 72,051,288 shares of common stock, is estimated to raise $1 billion in gross proceeds based on the assumed sale of 12,624,668 shares at current prices. Sharplink plans to use proceeds from its offering to purchase Ethereum. Source: SEC Aside from its ETH purchases, Sharplink will also use part of the proceeds for general business purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and expanding its core affiliate marketing operations. The stock sale will be executed via an “at-the-market offering” structure, which will allow Sharplink to issue shares periodically through a sales agent or principal. Such a structure enables the company the flexibility to respond to market conditions without compromising its crypto acquisition and operational goals. Sharplink plans to accumulate Ethereum in reserves The announcement of Sharplink’s plans to raise $1 billion from its stock offering comes days after it raked in $425 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, offering to establish an Ethereum treasury. The $425 million raise was led by blockchain technology firm Consensys, with participation from Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital, Ondo, and Pantera Capital, among other investors, SharpLink Gaming revealed Tuesday in a statement. The group reportedly bought 69,100,313 of the firm’s shares at $6.15 each. The newly raised funds will go toward acquiring Ethereum, which will serve as the company’s primary treasury asset. Sharplink Gaming’s private equity deal is expected to close on May 29. Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin will serve as chairman of Sharplink Gaming’s board of directors. Rob Phythian, founder and CEO, called the achievement “a significant milestone in Sharplink’s journey,” which marks an expansion beyond its core business. “On closing, we look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board,” he added. The announcement of the initial $425 million raise caused Sharplink’s stock to surge over 400%, peaking at $52 and closing at $35.80 on May 27, though it later dropped 8% after the $1 billion filing, reflecting market volatility. Strategy has become the standard Sharplink is taking a page out of Strategy’s crypto-focused playbook with a bias for Ethereum rather than BTC. This is an interesting detail as the company’s interest in stacking Ethereum coincides with positive momentum in the ETH community. Much of that momentum comes from the Pectra upgrade as well as new leadership at the Ethereum Foundation, which has gradually helped the token recover from the sub-$2,000 region. Other publicly traded companies have also employed the Strategy playbook over the past couple of years. Good examples include medical device company Semler Scientific and the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, who began employing aggressive Bitcoin-based strategies in 2024. Those not using the playbook to acquire BTC aggressively have tweaked it to focus on other altcoins. While Sharplink will focus on purchasing ETH, companies like Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. (formerly Janover) are dedicating millions of dollars to acquiring Solana for their respective corporate treasuries.

In a new report, UBS says that the US government may be forced to make its growing debt burden more manageable by turning to additional financial repression measures that would artificially lower the yield on government bonds. “We expect that, over the longer term, the US government may pursue both fiscal consolidation and financial repression – a phenomenon that already exists in some form in the US and many other countries – to contain yields and keep the high debt burden manageable.” One potential financial repression measure may be to reform the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for US banks, according to UBS. “Presently, large US banks must hold equity capital against all assets, including high-quality ones like Treasuries. Loosening the SLR could be justified as supporting bank lending, but excluding Treasuries from capital requirements would incentivize banks to hold more Treasuries, potentially enhancing market liquidity.” UBS says the US is well-positioned to successfully implement financial repression measures, as long as they are put in place on a temporary basis. “For a country as large and wealthy as the US, widespread financial repression seems feasible and could enable the government to continue financing a growing debt burden without materially increasing its risk of default. Financial repression policies could be deployed temporarily to provide fiscal breathing room, allowing for budget consolidation and improvement, followed by a phase-out and a return to more conventional policy settings. In such a scenario, economic distortions should remain temporary and manageable.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the biggest meme coin in Ethereum’s ( ETH ) chain, dropped for four consecutive days, reaching a low of $0.00001238, its lowest level since April 22. It has moved into a technical bear market, falling by almost 30% from its highest point in May. Shiba Inu’s decline is mostly because of the ongoing crypto sell-off that has affected all types of coins. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has dropped from an all-time high of $111,900 last week to $103,000. SHIB has also crashed as its network faces substantial challenges. First, data shows that SHIB whales have been in a selling spree this year. Supply held by these investors started the year at 743 trillion and has now dropped to 723 trillion. Whale selling is a sign that they expect its price to keep falling. Shiba Inu whales are selling | Source: Santiment Second, Shibarium, its layer-2 network, is not doing well as its total value locked stands at just $2.92 million. In contrast, Unichain , which Uniswap ( UNI ) launched earlier this year, has a TVL of over $600 million. Further, Shiba Inu’s token burn rate has lost momentum in the past few weeks. The single biggest burn this week was an 18 million transaction that happened on Wednesday. It was common for SHIB to have over 1 billion burns a few months ago. Shiba Inu price analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price peaked at $0.00001755 on May 12 as cryptocurrencies rallied. It then embarked on a strong downtrend, reaching a low of $0.00001235, its lowest point since April 22. It has moved below the 50-day moving average and the lower side of the rising wedge pattern. A rising wedge is a bearish pattern comprising of two ascending and converging trendlines. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling, with the next target being the year-to-date low of $0.00001033, down by 16% from the current level.

Here’s Why this Changes Everything for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-just-gave-wall-street-its-xrp-backdoor-heres-why-this-changes-everything-for-xrp/,"A recent post by investigative journalist Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp) has brought attention to a quite significant move by Ripple that could change the landscape for institutional adoption of XRP. Sharing a screenshot of a recent article, Jungle Inc pointed out that Hidden Road, the prime broker that Ripple recently acquired , has launched over-the-counter (OTC) crypto swaps for U.S. institutions. The importance of this move lies in the type of financial exposure it offers. According to Jungle Inc, these are cash-settled swaps, meaning there is no on-chain movement of cryptocurrency. This structure helps institutions to gain exposure to digital assets without holding or transferring them directly, a format more aligned with traditional financial practices. Ripple Just Gave Wall Street Its XRP Backdoor Hidden Road — Ripple’s $1.25B acquisition — has launched OTC crypto swaps for U.S. institutions. Quiet accumulation is now possible… without moving the charts. Why this changes everything for XRP: 1.These swaps are cash-settled… pic.twitter.com/tdjUIdzayu — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) May 30, 2025 Strategic Licensing and U.S. Access Hidden Road operates through a UK-regulated entity, allowing it to engage U.S. institutional clients without falling directly under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. This regulatory path, paired with Ripple’s existing MiCA license in Europe and its FINRA-licensed U.S. operations , reflects a deliberate infrastructure strategy aimed at building a full-stack financial network across jurisdictions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This regulatory design allows Ripple to onboard U.S. capital in a way that minimizes friction, potentially opening the door for XRP to become a featured asset within these OTC offerings. While no assets have been officially named, Jungle Inc noted that Ripple owns the broker and “XRP is next.” The Role of Infrastructure in Market Dynamics The rollout of OTC swaps is not just a trading option but a mechanism that allows for institutional accumulation without affecting spot market prices. As Jungle Inc emphasized, quiet accumulation is now possible without moving the charts. This is particularly relevant for digital assets like XRP, where liquidity events often precede major price volatility. Due to the nature of these cash-settled instruments, positions can be built quietly, well in advance of any public announcements or retail visibility. This front-loaded approach to exposure means that any eventual listing or use of XRP within this swap framework could already be priced in by the time the broader market reacts. Implications for XRP’s Market Position This development positions XRP favorably in the eyes of institutions. Ripple’s strategy, centered on regulatory licensing and silent infrastructure rollout, provides the necessary tools for serious capital engagement. If the XRP is indeed added to the list of supported assets, it could mark the return of large-scale institutional adoption of the token. Retail investors may not see immediate effects, but the groundwork is being laid. As Jungle Inc concluded, “Retail trades trends. Institutions trade access. And Ripple just handed them the keys.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Market Buzz Builds as ETF Hopes and SharpLink Strategy Align Crypto enthusiasts are calling SharpLink Ethereum’s Saylor, with social media posts labeling it the “Michael Saylor of Ethereum”. This bullish sentiment is further fueled by REX Shares filing for Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs. Analysts say these ETFs could launch in weeks, providing U.S. investors with a way to gain exposure to Ethereum’s staking ecosystem – something that has previously eluded attempts at ETFs. While the SEC filing and ETF buzz mean more institutional support for Ethereum, broader market forces are at play. Global macroeconomic concerns, including interest rate hikes and regulatory headwinds, are weighing on digital assets. Ethereum Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Amid Breakout Tension Despite bullish fundamentals, Ethereum price prediction is showing technical cracks. On the 4-hour chart, ETH has broken below the ascending channel, with the 50-period EMA at $2,592 now acting as resistance. The MACD is deepening bearish momentum, and a Three Black Crows pattern near $2,594 adds to the downside risk. Key support and resistance levels to watch: Support: $2,466 and $2,385 – break here could lead to $2,298 or $2,250 Resistance: $2,594 and $2,689 – reversal above here could mean recovery Candlestick Watch: Look for Bullish Engulfing or Hammer patterns near support. SharpLink and ETFs are medium-term bullish, but be cautious in the short term. No reversal signals have been seen yet, so consolidation or a down move is the likely path.

Blue Origin’s Tweet Sparks Buzz appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Justin Sun, founder of Tron and a leading crypto billionaire, is about to make history by flying to space with Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. A recent tweet exchange between Sun and Blue Origin has sparked excitement, hinting that his suborbital flight on the New Shepard rocket is coming soon. Hello @justinsuntron We look forward to seeing you in West Texas on a future New Shepard flight soon! https://t.co/jnBbcjHBAn — Blue Origin (@blueorigin) May 30, 2025 If this happens, Sun will be the first person from the crypto world to travel to space, showing how blockchain and space exploration can come together. A $28 Million Ticket to Space In 2021, Justin Sun won a charity auction by bidding $28 million for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard flight. The money went to Blue Origin’s Club for the Future, a foundation that supports 19 space-related charities focused on inspiring future generations in STEM fields. Though the flight was originally planned for 2022, it was delayed. But on May 29, 2025, Sun posted a tweet from inside a spacecraft simulator, suggesting the trip is back on. The flight might take place in July 2025, according to recent announcements, and Sun will fly with five other crewmates, including someone who won their seat with a $6 million ticket. Flying with a Star-Studded Crew Justin Sun won’t be traveling alone. He’ll be joined by five others, making this an exciting mission that combines the worlds of space and crypto. This group will mark a new chapter in how cryptocurrency interacts with space technology. Justin Sun in the Spotlight Sun has a history of making big headlines. In 2019, he paid $4.5 million to have a charity lunch with famous investor Warren Buffett. At that lunch, Sun brought top crypto figures like Litecoin’s Charlie Lee and eToro’s CEO Yonni Assia. Even though Buffett remains skeptical about Bitcoin, the meeting sparked important discussions about cryptocurrency. In 2025, Sun continued his high-profile appearances by attending a dinner with Donald Trump for top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin. He also met crypto leaders like Michael Saylor and the Winklevoss twins at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. These actions highlight Sun’s efforts to raise TRON’s profile and influence in the crypto space. How Does The Crypto Community See This? The crypto community on X has been buzzing about Sun’s space plans. Influencer Wendy O said, “Justin is taking us to the moon,” celebrating this milestone. Others believe this trip could boost TRON’s visibility and push the crypto industry toward exciting new innovations. This mission may increase TRON’s visibility and inspire blockchain leaders to think bigger as the crypto world gets ready to reach new heights.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 11:51:40

The move, issued in a statement titled “Providing Security is not a ‘Security’,” alleviates legal uncertainty that had long stifled innovation and discouraged American participation in network staking. While the clarification is not a binding rule, it signals a more open regulatory posture under the current administration. It could also unlock significant growth in staking-related infrastructure, which is increasingly central to the operation and decentralization of modern blockchain networks. The SEC’s statement Hester Peirce, the Division of Corporation Finance and Commissioner, essentially captured the essence of the SEC’s approach by explaining that “certain proof-of-stake blockchain protocol ‘staking’ activities are not securities transactions within the scope of the federal securities laws.” Pierse clarifies that staking is a voluntary effort by users to secure a network, but the previous regulatory uncertainty has been discouraging for Americans. This “artificial constraint” harmed decentralization, censorship resistance, and, therefore, the credible neutrality of proof-of-stake-based blockchains. According to the Division of Corporation Finance, the statement applies to various groups of individuals and services, including those who stake assets individually or via the delegated-proof-of-stake platform, as well as staking-as-service providers, both custodial and non-custodial. Furthermore, the commission outlines in the statement that ancillary services associated with staking are not considered a securities offering. As an example of such ancillary services, the commission cites the provision of slashing coverage that returns staked crypto assets before the unbinding period ends, allowing the reward to be recalculated while maintaining the minimum amount of staked assets required for normal network operation. The statement follows the previously issued clarification noting that the SEC doesn’t apply securities offering laws to the mining of cryptocurrency. Generally, the clarification follows the logic of the commission’s other actions and statements made in the post-Gensler era, which began in 2025 when President Donald Trump directed his administration to loosen crypto sector regulation. Read more: Gary Gensler’s political testament. Digesting the SEC chairman’s exit interview One of the most notable differences was the abandonment of Gensler’s approach of labeling most cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities, a status that led to legal battles and, therefore, slower development in the sector. A yet unnoticed victory Crypto Council for Innovation was one of the first to emphasize the importance of the change in the staking status. In a series of X posts, the organization pointed out that the new legal status outlines staking “as a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract.” Alison Mangiero, head of staking policy, thanked the SEC for recognizing staking’s real purpose as a tool that provides network security without being a security itself. 1/ Huge win for staking and the wider crypto community. @SECGov now recognizes staking as a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract. 👏 @AMangiero @TeamPOSA pic.twitter.com/jTfPq4ihjX — Crypto Council for Innovation (@crypto_council) May 30, 2025 The shift in attention from wealth accumulation to the structural role of staking in PoS-based networks suggests that U.S. regulators are becoming more open-minded about the cryptocurrency sector. Interestingly, the clarification of staking status news was met with perplexity by many. In the comment sections of the news accounts, people asked if the news was bullish and, if so, why the prices weren’t going up. Some tried to deploy Grok AI to get the answers. One possible reason for such confusion is that Bitcoin and stablecoins largely dominated the 2025 crypto narrative, while proof-of-stake platforms were pushed out of the spotlight in crypto discussions. Ethereum, one of the leading proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems, has been under fire as the Ether price declined throughout the year. “Bitcoin, not crypto,” became a popular motto among many influencers on crypto X. However, staking hasn’t gone anywhere. The staking ratio (a percentage of the supply of the staked crypto to the rest of the circulating supply) continues to grow across various blockchains. The Block indicates that as of Dec. 31, 2024, Ethereum’s staking ratio reached 28%, while other key PoS-based blockchains (i.e., Solana, Cosmos, and Polkadot) saw staking ratios over 50%. It signifies a growing investor involvement in staking. Furthermore, the staking sector is undergoing a series of innovations. Mostly, they aim to provide stakers with more flexibility or unlocking liquidity while staking. It makes staking less demanding. Previously, it involved locking up crypto assets for a specified period, which could be unprofitable. The modern-day features help validators avoid missing out on profits while securing the network. The SEC’s clarification on staking may not carry the weight of formal legislation, but it represents a meaningful step toward deregulating the U.S. crypto landscape. While the news has yet to spark a surge in token prices or mainstream attention, it lays critical groundwork for future innovation. As staking continues to evolve—becoming more liquid, accessible, and central to blockchain infrastructure—the ability of U.S.-based users, developers, and service providers to participate without fear of legal ambiguity could catalyze a new wave of decentralization and growth. In short, the stakes have changed.

Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. With DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, these features collectively enhance Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Daily indicators suggest it is entering oversold conditions, while the 4-hour momentum and volume remain heavily bearish. Unless strong buying interest emerges, the decline may continue. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong community and meme buzz, which can drive short-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 80x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Ethereum (ETH) is catching attention with a new breakout setup and a price target pushing toward $7,500. At the same time, XRP whales are loading up, backing Ripple as ETF hopes grow. But while the big names lead the news, a low-cost presale is building real momentum behind the scenes. Unstaked, a project focused on AI and automation, has raised more than $8.3 million during its presale. Still priced at around a penny, it’s gaining traction quickly. With smart tools and upcoming AI agents designed to help users across digital platforms, Unstaked is starting to look like the best crypto to invest in now. While ETH and XRP dominate headlines, early backers are locking in their spots before the next big wave. Ethereum Target Climbs as Analysts Watch for Breakout Ethereum (ETH) is holding above $2,600 and forming an ascending triangle that points to bullish movement. Analysts are now raising short-term targets above $3,250, with some seeing a run toward $7,500. This is supported by talk of spot ETF approvals and growing interest from big institutions. Even with just a 2% gain this week, ETH is up 48% this month. Its market cap is close to $321 billion. Strong trading volume and technical patterns are adding to the breakout talk. Bitcoin might be stealing headlines with its rally past $111,000, but Ethereum target levels are climbing too, showing signs of building its own momentum. XRP Whales and ETF Buzz Build Quiet Strength XRP is steady at $2.30, not fully riding the recent market wave. But whale activity shows a deeper trend. Santiment reports that wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have added 3.9 billion coins in a year, bringing their total to 6.05 billion. Those holding 10 million to 100 million now control 7.76 billion, up from 6.5 billion. This steady growth lines up with growing hopes around XRP ETF approvals. The new XXRP ETF has already hit $112 million in assets, beating many other altcoin funds quickly. Ripple is also in talks to buy Circle, and its XRP Ledger is expanding through Hidden Road. These XRP whale moves show that big players see long-term value. But for retail buyers, the upside may be limited at current prices. That’s why attention is turning toward newer projects with useful features and early-stage gains. Unstaked Presale Gains Steam with $8.3M Raised & $1M Giveaway While Ethereum and XRP dominate market news, Unstaked is picking up momentum where it matters most: strong presale numbers, growing user interest, and a clear plan for real-world use. Now in stage 17, Unstaked has already collected over $8.3 million, and the price is still just $0.01043. That makes it one of the most undervalued but highly promising entries in today’s crypto space. The project centers on AI-driven social agents. These are smart bots that will soon connect with platforms like Telegram, Twitter, and Discord. They help users manage online communities, keep up with conversations, check sentiment, and even help with moderation, all without switching apps. This is powered by the Proof of Intelligence system, which tracks helpful AI actions and gives rewards in return. Unstaked is also launching a $1 million Gleam giveaway. Twenty winners will each get $50,000 worth of $UNSD. To join, users must finish a few simple tasks, invite others, and buy at least $100 worth of tokens. The giveaway runs for five months, keeping users involved and offering serious rewards. With the listing price expected to reach $0.1819, even those buying now could see a big return. Early buyers might get up to 27x gains. For anyone asking what’s the best crypto to invest in now, Unstaked checks the boxes with AI tools, fast growth, and strong reward features. The Bottom Line Ethereum is aiming for $7,500, and XRP is moving on new ETF buzz. These signals show big money is back in the market. But for smaller investors, these coins may already be past their biggest growth. While ETH targets and XRP whale moves sound great, the biggest profits may have already been taken. That’s why Unstaked is standing out. It’s built on AI ideas, gives rewards through smart features, and has already raised over $8.3 million before even launching. And the price?

This follows broader market volatility after a U.S. appeals Court reinstated Trump-era tariffs . The decision reversed an earlier International Trade Court ruling and is spooking risk markets, including digital assets like Solana. BREAKING US APPEALS COURT HAS JUST REINSTATED PRESIDENT TRUMP TARIFFS THAT WERE BLOCKED YESTERDAY pic.twitter.com/2J8e58zXMQ — FinFluential • Simplifying Stocks (@FinFluentialx) May 29, 2025 Technically, SOL has broken its key $165.94 support level and is now outside the bullish channel that had been in place since mid-April. The daily chart looks nasty: a series of red candles and a Three Black Crows pattern. The 50-day EMA at $159.60 has flipped from support to resistance, and the MACD momentum indicators are showing widening gaps and deepening red histograms – all bearish. Support levels: $141.60, $125.95, $112.04 Resistance zone: $176-$188 with strong rejection Momentum indicators: MACD bearish, RSI 46 Derivatives Liquidations and ETF Delays Fuel Bearish Sentiment The data shows a shift in sentiment around Solana. According to Coinglass, futures open interest fell 3.23% to $7.11 billion, and long liquidations were $18.98 million on Friday, while short liquidations were just $464,750. This represents a significant unwinding of leveraged long positions. Meanwhile, the delays in US spot Solana ETFs, despite six applications from Fidelity and VanEck, are capping the optimism. Polymarket has the approval odds at 82%, and some analysts, including VirtualBacon, are calling for post-approval targets of $440-$600, similar to Bitcoin’s post-ETF rally. However, until the SEC gives the green light, regaining $200 looks challenging. Institutional Growth and Network Expansion Offer Long-Term Promise; Solana Supported? Despite the short-term headwinds, Solana continues to attract institutional interest and foster ecosystem growth. Circle’s $250 million USDC mint on Solana in late May has added liquidity and expanded stablecoin utility – Solana now handles 34% of all stablecoin volume.

Look for support at $141.60; however, unless Solana forms a strong reversal pattern, such as a Hammer or Morning Star with MACD convergence and a retest of the 50 EMA, the path of least resistance remains down. Newbies should wait for clear reversal signals to enter, while experienced traders can look for volume confirmation on a breakdown or reversal. Without bullish momentum, Solana may not retest $200 anytime soon. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.67M Mark as 62% APY Staking Draws Interest With SOL/USD dipping below $1560, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $ 50,000 BTC increase, reducing the supply. The current token price is at $0.00254 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,632,712/ $7,676,876 Token price : $0.00254 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~62% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield, with full liquidity.

This prediction follows the Bitcoin price breaking the $111,000 resistance as it continues to build momentum towards a new all-time high. With the Bitcoin price acting as the launchpad for renewed crypto market excitement, investors are shifting their attention to FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a surprisingly well-structured meme token that’s gaining momentum fast. Analysts Call $111,000 The Launchpad For A Bitcoin Price Explosion Toward $185,000 By Q3 Analysts have said the $111,000 mark could serve as the next major launchpad for the Bitcoin price upward trajectory. They believe this level may act as a consolidation zone before the Bitcoin price’s next explosive move. In addition, the founder of 10T Holdings has also issued a bold forecast , stating that the Bitcoin price could surge to a range of $180,000 to $185,000 by Q3 2025. The investor’s prediction further reinforces the idea that institutional capital remains confident in the Bitcoin price’s long-term upside, especially as crypto adoption continues to grow. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Combines Intelligence, Influence, and Explosive Potential FloppyPepe (FPPE) challenges the traditional meme coin narrative by merging internet culture with practical applications, AI advancements, and a vision focused on community-led development. With the token currently priced affordably at $0.00000035, the project is attracting attention from early investors seeking the next major breakout. This emerging presale holds significant potential for transforming investments into considerable profits thanks to its exceptionally low presale price. Investors are rapidly joining in, driven by fear of missing out on anticipated substantial returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Smashes Milestone With Over $2 Million Raised The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale has recently surpassed a landmark of $2 million in revenues, reflecting strong confidence among investors. This token employs a tiered pricing method, distinguishing it from the standard pricing strategies commonly used by larger ICOs. Currently, the token is priced at just $0.00000035, offering a cheap entry point. Those who invested during the private round completely sold out within 24 hours, raising nearly $1 million and showcasing robust investor confidence in its growth prospects. Moreover, the project has undergone a smart contract audit by SolidProof. Limited-Time Offer: Get An 80% Bonus When Joining The Presale FloppyPepe (FPPE) is offering a limited-time bonus to new investors: an 80% bonus in tokens for participants who enter the presale using the code “ FLOPPY80 .” This allows investors to acquire a larger share of what could become one of the year's most vibrant new tokens. In an arena where many coins fluctuate with temporary excitement, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) AI-fueled framework and expanding community may signify a much more sustainable and lucrative promise. The Memeverse: A Treasure Trove Of Memes, Videos, And Resources At the core of the FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem is the Floppy AI, a distinctive AI utility that scours Twitter and cryptocurrency news outlets, compiling over a million real-time data points into actionable insights. The ecosystem also includes interactive AI applications such as Meme-o-Matic for meme creation and FloppyX for producing brief viral videos. The Floppy AI also transforms this information into enjoyable and engaging memes and tweets, offering bite-sized market intelligence that is both entertaining and educational. tors Eye Huge Returns As FloppyPepe (FPPE) Gears Up For A Crypto Surge Considering the existing presale price and a speculative post-launch valuation of $0.01, FloppyPepe (FPPE) can potentially deliver life-changing returns for its early investors. A modest investment of $100 could evolve into $5 million, contingent on market acceptance and listing performance aligning with forecasts. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has established a soft cap of $20 million and a hard cap of $45 million, which is ambitious yet achievable given the current appetite in today’s meme-influenced market. With the presale rapidly gaining traction, now is the moment for investors to secure their tokens. Take action today before it is too late.

Find out what this does for crypto trade—and why Bitcoin poker is now hot. The arrival of institutional funds is driving excitement in the world of Bitcoin. It’s amazing that more than $900 million ( 500x increase over the average daily inflow for 2025 so far) was traded in one day, compared to the low daily averages we had this year. This is not a temporary measure—it is clearly a notable indicator. Amidst economic, workforce, and political confusion, the crypto domain is doing very well. Bitcoin did achieve a new high (all-time high) of $112,000 before subsequently falling back to about $108,700—not much decline, but of no consequence in these markets. The technical indicators are overall reflecting a strong return of bullish momentum above $100,000 and the new ultra-high levels of institutional interest that have contributed to the excitement. Institutional Confidence Returns Many institutions have shown a lot more interest in Bitcoin ETFs, proving there is a strong, ongoing trust in this market. After the initial rally at the start of the year, analysts started to rely on ETF inflows to gauge new changes in people’s feelings toward the market. Because of the new injection of funds, Bitcoin’s market cap is now above $2.17 trillion. Currently, Bitcoin does much more than lead the crypto world—it is showing that it is a true competitor for value, like gold and other major assets. Price Volatility Remains The recent rally has had a few hiccups. Bitcoin dipped by 2.5% on the 23rd of May after the surprising announcement from President Donald Trump that he is proposing new tariffs on foreign imports (whether or not this is related is not known officially). His statement shook both the crypto markets and regular markets, but it was short-lived – the buyers entered the markets, and prices stabilized. Experienced crypto holders have seen volatility, but this is still shocking for later holders (particularly those entering via ETFs). 7-day BTC price chart by Coinbase Crypto Infiltrates Other Industries Bitcoin in traditional finance is altering the landscape for complementary industries. Gaming is the sector leading this change. The creation of online gaming focused on blockchain technology and decentralized gambling experiences is a disruption for the industry, especially crypto poker sites , allowing online users to play poker with the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. The advantages for users of these poker sites are apparent: provably fair algorithms, low transaction fees, a payout time of minutes instead of weeks, and user anonymity, an important component for those who are privacy-conscious. Where regular online casinos manage the online gambling market, we have seen crypto poker sites pop up, and the rules that oversee this online gambling vary significantly across countries. Being decentralized and having access to users’ crypto wallets allows these crypto poker platforms to let people play online poker without the usual banking limits, starting new trends in online gaming. The convergence of gaming and finance is indicative that Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are becoming more important. The convergence of DeFi with digital entertainment is clear that cryptocurrency is not limited to earlier adopters and an interested niche, it is becoming broadly accepted. Outlook for the Rest of 2025 Bitcoin continues to cause a stir, and the projections get bolder and bolder. Some analysts are now putting targets around $160,000 for Q4, contingent on regulations being leveled out and inflation continuing to be in check. But honestly, this hype still hinges on larger economic dynamics and the Federal Reserve’s next moves. Institutional exposure looks solid, however, it is not a guarantee for success. ETFs basically have become the measuring stick for Bitcoin’s acceptance in mainstream finance. Right now, their actions are being closely examined. There are already Ethereum ETFs, and interest in similar products for Solana and other main cryptos is rising, causing more institutions to enter the crypto world. Prices in Bitcoin and crypto markets are still bouncing around wildly. Even so, large investors are now acknowledging Bitcoin’s role as a true asset class. This development might influence the industry as the years progress.

While the HBAR coin shows strength and potential to continue its upward movement, Unilabs (UNIL) catches the eyes of analysts searching for the next billion-dollar crypto startup. Let’s explore why prominent crypto analysts are backing early-stage ICO Unilabs to outperform the Hedera price this summer. Unilabs (UNIL): DeFi’s Dark Horse Aims For $1 Billion Capitalization Unilabs offers curated investment solutions through its AI-powered investment platform. The key component of Unilabs’ ecosystem is the AI asset manager, which uses real-time market data to pinpoint emerging crypto projects and ICOs with unbounded upside potential. The selection of projects is updated continuously to expose users to the best-performing assets at all times. Unilabs users can also invest directly into its proprietary fund baskets—BTC, AI, RWA, and Mining—to get exposure to emerging projects in these sectors without active market participation. The AI analyzes price movements, trading volume, and on-chain metrics to rebalance over $30 million in AUM between these funds in real time. By holding the UNIL token, users can gain governance rights and vote on important platform development decisions. UNIL holders can also stake their tokens in rewarding staking pools, which offer up to 122% annual yields as staking rewards. Additionally, the platform accumulates 30% of all revenue generated in a transparent profit-sharing pool and distributes it as rewards to UNIL token holders. The UNIL token is currently valued at $0.0051 in stage two of the presale and has so far raised over $1.5 million. The token’s value will surge periodically as the presale progresses. The demand for Unilabs’ investment solution has led to top analysts expecting it to capture a significant share of the crypto AI market. According to Coingecko, the total market cap of artificial intelligence tokens is $31 billion, and if UNIL can seize even 3-5% of this in 2025 with its much-needed utility, it can easily reach a $1 billion market cap. BlackRock MMF Tokenization Boosts HBAR Coin’s Legitimacy Archax, a UK-based digital asset exchange, announced that it is expanding its tokenized fund share options by adding BlackRock’s US Treasury Money Market Fund (MMF) in collaboration with HBAR coin. Since this addition highlights a significant step towards the institutional legitimacy of the HBAR coin, it sparked unwarranted excitement in the community, resulting in a whopping 70% intraday move in the Hedera price. How High Can The Hedera Price Reach? In addition to the BlackRock push, the Hedera price has seen significant growth, with the recent integration of Circle's USDC. Increased attention from this collaboration could be an essential catalyst for the HBAR coin’s growth. USDC's success on Hedera could enhance the network’s market value, upgrading HBAR coin’s status in the crypto sector through improved liquidity. Image Courtesy: TradingView Currently trading at $0.1901, the Hedera price is up 35% from the April lows and is taking support from the lower trendline of its two-month-long uptrending channel. Although HBAR coin has seen weak action over the past two weeks, the price action remains strong in the longer term. Today, it bounced from the 50-day SMA, signaling a potential local bottom and continuation of the uptrend. If bullish pressure resumes, the Hedera price could ascend to higher levels, aiming for psychological milestones such as $0.4 and even $0.5. How Unilabs Can Outpace The Hedera Price HBAR coin is gaining traction with the BlackRock pump and strategic partnership with Circle, but analysts are favoring Unilabs (UNIL), which has proved its explosive potential with early presale demand. Unilabs aims to unlock investment opportunities for retail investors and allow them to replicate institutional-grade gains in their portfolios. Due to this practical use case and an attractive passive income model, investors are rushing to the UNIL presale , and analysts are calling it the next billion-dollar coin in 2025.

He wants to discuss the legal and regulatory aspects of the assets. This development comes after members and major stakeholders under his portfolio insisted that digital assets are still banned in the country. The Ministry of Finance released a statement regarding the meeting, noting that it will serve as a “strategic forum to deliberate on the evolving regulatory and legal framework surrounding digital currency and the broader crypto landscape in Pakistan.” Aurangzeb, who is also the chairman of the PCC, is expected to preside over the meeting, with Bilal Bin Saqib, his special assistant on blockchain and crypto also in attendance as the CEO of the council. Pakistan Crypto Council wants to address the legal status of digital assets According to the report, other members of the council will also be in attendance on Monday, including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), secretary of the Law and Justice Division, and secretary of the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication. The council is expected to review several items, which include the development of a regulatory framework to govern digital assets in Pakistan, aligning it with global standards and technological advancements. The main point of the meeting will be to discuss the groundwork to establish the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA), a proposed autonomous body to oversee the digital finance and cryptocurrency ecosystem in the country. The Pakistan Crypto Council wants to lay a foundation for a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment. It also wants to look into the promotion and adoption of responsible blockchain technology, with a view to protect investors and enhance financial inclusion. “The upcoming meeting underscores the government’s commitment to shaping a future-ready financial infrastructure while ensuring stability and compliance in the emerging digital economy,” it added. Internal criticisms fuel the need for clarification The meeting was convened after conflicting signals from several figures within the government. Days ago, the SBP and the Financial Division informed the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance that digital assets were banned in the country. It meant that all transactions and ownership of the assets were illegal under certain conditions. Although the SBP has walked back its stance on the assets, some stakeholders are still not sold. Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal mentioned that the PCC was formed to look into the crypto policy, noting that the council was formed via an executive order without any legislative backing. He added that under the current SBP and SECP regulations, digital assets are banned in the country. “There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan,” he said. The executive director of the SBP, Sohail Jawad, also mentioned that the central bank had issued a directive on the legal status of digital assets, noting that its stance that it is illegal remains intact. He also mentioned that the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is still recommending crypto-related cases to law enforcement for further action. However, he mentioned that a national working group on digital assets has been formed, and their suggestions will be communicated to the PCC. The parliamentary debate also coincided with the unveiling of the country’s government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the CEO of the PCC, Mr Saqib. According to the official statement from the Ministry of Finance, the unveiling was done in Las Vegas, United States, at this year’s Bitcoin Conference, with United States VP J.D. Vance in attendance. The Pakistan Crypto Council was launched in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.

45329648,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-top-football-club-psg-embraces-crypto,1748695357,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/45329648.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now As Top Football Club PSG Embraces Crypto,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-top-football-club-psg-embraces-crypto,"Paris Saint-Germain F.C. has confirmed its adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy, making it the first major football club to officially add BTC to its financial books. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Pär Helgosson, head of PSG Labs, revealed that the club began accumulating Bitcoin in 2024 and still holds it as part of its reserves. This announcement arrives just as PSG prepares for the Champions League final, bringing both the sporting and financial spotlight onto the club. PSG also shared plans to support Bitcoin ventures and founders, signaling a deeper commitment beyond holding assets. PSG’s Bitcoin Strategy May Influence Sports and Crypto Alike Paris Saint-Germain isn’t new to experimenting with crypto—its fan tokens and Web3 initiatives go back years. But converting fiat reserves into Bitcoin and holding them long-term is an entirely different commitment. This isn’t a marketing gimmick or a temporary flirtation with blockchain. This is treasury allocation—something previously seen in corporate circles, now adopted by a leading sports brand. What’s striking is not just the move itself but the context around it. PSG’s fanbase is largely under 34, a demographic already entrenched in digital assets. The club’s decision to pivot towards Bitcoin reflects an understanding of its own audience and a belief that future value will be driven by crypto-native systems. JUST IN: European soccer giant Paris Saint Germain announces they adopted a #Bitcoin treasury reserve 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/nGeq7bUyBJ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 29, 2025 Through PSG Labs, the club is not only holding BTC but actively seeking to invest in and accelerate crypto projects, startups, and builders. This approach could spark a new playbook for other top-tier clubs and sports leagues. If PSG’s venture into Bitcoin pays off—not just financially, but reputationally—it’s likely that others in the sports and entertainment space will follow. Crypto could evolve from niche sponsorships and collectibles into a structural pillar of how major teams manage wealth, foster innovation, and engage their fanbases. For the crypto ecosystem, this signals the return of a serious wave of institutional curiosity—one that could prove longer lasting than the last cycle. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Crypto Adoption Spikes Across Industries SUBBD PSG’s treasury announcement has a major cultural impact on the crypto space and among most sports enthusiasts. And if there’s any other space currently undergoing a cultural reset, it’s the creator economy. SUBBD enters this scene with a purpose that goes far deeper than tipping tools or platform gimmicks. It’s a decentralized infrastructure built to shift control back into the hands of creators, where the value generated by communities isn’t skimmed by middlemen but retained and grown collectively. SUBBD's native token acts as a currency within a fully integrated ecosystem, supporting creator tokens, community rewards, and governance participation. What elevates this from just another creator token is its commitment to long-term sustainability through a dual-burn and staking protocol, where both creators and fans can lock tokens to influence project direction and receive incentives. In a world where institutions like PSG are leveraging blockchain to connect directly with their audiences, SUBBD’s relevance only increases. Just as PSG is using Bitcoin to realign its financial model with its youthful fanbase, SUBBD is giving online creators a similar mechanism to build loyalty, reward participation, and remain self-sufficient without relying on third-party platforms. This fact was highlighted by top crypto content creator ClayBro in one of his dedicated videos about SUBBD and its potential. If tokenized loyalty is the future of audience engagement, then SUBBD is already building the roads. It doesn’t just fit into a world shifting toward crypto—it builds a necessary bridge between creative energy and economic value. BTC Bull The timing of PSG’s announcement is no coincidence, as it arrives at a moment when Bitcoin has moved from speculative asset to strategic reserve for both companies and now, apparently, elite football clubs. BTC Bull operates on this very principle: that Bitcoin’s importance is no longer theoretical. It’s a financial axis. BTC Bull is a meme-forward project, but beneath its tongue-in-cheek branding lies a calculated reward model. It ties token airdrops and supply burns directly to Bitcoin’s price milestones. The higher BTC climbs, the more it unlocks value for BTC Bull holders. This setup isn’t just fun—it’s incentive engineering based on the most proven crypto asset on the planet. There’s no staking here, no confusing DeFi mazes. BTC Bull thrives on simplicity and strategy. The project doesn’t just comment on Bitcoin’s trajectory—it’s structurally tied to it. With PSG now declaring that BTC is part of its own treasury, Bitcoin-based narratives are gaining cultural gravity. BTC Bull rides that gravity without needing to chase headlines—it lets the market’s natural movements steer its mechanics. What makes BTC Bull relevant now is precisely what made PSG’s move newsworthy. Both rely on Bitcoin not just for storage, but for signaling. As BTC inches toward mainstream institutional acceptance, projects like BTC Bull that embrace its rhythm, rather than mimic unrelated trends, could find their value rise not from hype—but alignment. Snorter As PSG leans into Bitcoin to remain relevant to a digitally fluent fanbase, it makes sense to highlight tools that mirror that efficiency and reach. Snorter is built around that same principle: get closer to users, eliminate friction, and prioritize speed. Snorter is a Solana-based Telegram trading bot that doesn’t just notify—it executes. It was created to solve a very real problem: the delay and fragmentation in how people discover and snipe new tokens. While most traders are stuck switching between listings, wallets, and charts, Snorter keeps everything in one flow inside Telegram, with lightning-fast execution and a clear interface. What makes Snorter particularly potent in this moment is its alignment with changing user behavior. The crypto community, especially the under-30 crowd—the same demographic PSG is actively targeting—is already platform-native. They prefer lightweight, immediate tools over bloated exchanges. Snorter understands that, and delivers. The platform also includes token screening features and curated alerts, making it more than a snipe tool—it’s a mobile-first trading companion. And in an age where legacy brands are integrating blockchain to keep pace with their digital audiences, tools like Snorter represent the infrastructure that makes that connection possible. It’s fast, context-aware, and tuned to the language of the next-gen trader. MIND of Pepe Paris Saint-Germain didn’t just move capital—it made a calculated attempt to connect with a younger, digitally native audience. That same instinct sits at the center of MIND of Pepe , a meme-driven project that’s more than just a nod to internet culture. It’s an AI-powered sentiment engine, constantly plugged into the social web to gauge mood, spot viral energy, and provide real-time market cues to its community. MIND of Pepe operates like a brain for traders in the meme coin space. Instead of relying on slow-moving analytics or gut instinct, the platform’s AI scans posts, discussions, and meme signals across social media to evaluate crowd psychology. It then translates those insights into data traders can act on—often before the market catches on. In a world where branding and timing can create more value than utility alone, MIND of Pepe serves as a toolkit for navigating volatility. It doesn’t just track what’s trending—it tries to understand why it’s trending. That matters in today’s crypto space, where signals move faster than price charts. Presale is over. 👁 $MIND can now be purchased at listing price until launch. https://t.co/YQZ9DDOMKJ pic.twitter.com/zZ9e3LMIH5 — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 31, 2025 At the time of writing, the project has completed its presale having raised upwards of $11.9 million, set to hit top exchanges very shortly, with several developmental updates also set to drop in the coming months. PSG’s embrace of innovation through Bitcoin and Web3 ventures validates the need for tools that bridge behavior and technology. MIND of Pepe is building that bridge in the meme coin sector, proving that data-driven intuition and humor aren’t mutually exclusive. If the next bull market is driven as much by narratives as by numbers, MIND of Pepe could become a must-have lens through which many interpret the madness. Solaxy The crypto space is increasingly bifurcated—Ethereum with its institutional adoption and Solana with its performance and accessibility. Solaxy sees this not as a divide to pick sides in, but a rift to bridge. As a Layer 2 solution, it enables fluid interaction between both chains, giving users the speed of Solana and the security of Ethereum without compromising on either. Solaxy doesn’t pitch itself as yet another scaling solution—it positions itself as infrastructure for a future where chains are interoperable and utility is chain-agnostic. On top of its technical foundation, the project also offers high-yield staking via SOLX, its native token, which supports users who want to contribute to network stability while earning passive income. PSG’s entry into Bitcoin investment territory is a reminder that performance and future-proofing go hand in hand. It’s not enough to adopt crypto—you need to make it usable, relevant, and fluid for your audience. Solaxy’s mission reflects that thinking. It doesn’t just offer access to blockchains—it simplifies that access, making it frictionless for developers and investors alike. As more institutions look for entry points into DeFi, and more users demand smooth multichain experiences, Solaxy could play a foundational role. It isn’t waiting for demand to arrive—it’s building the road in anticipation. Best Wallet Token PSG’s Bitcoin treasury isn’t a tech stunt, but rather it’s part of a larger realignment toward digital-first value management. That realignment doesn’t just need assets. It needs tools. Best Wallet Token’s product is one such tool—built not for hype, but for utility that adapts as users evolve. It’s a decentralized, non-custodial wallet that supports transactions across over 60 blockchains. But what separates it from the noise is the depth of its ecosystem. Within the wallet, users can stake, access market insights, browse presales early via the Upcoming Tokens feature, and even manage their entire portfolio—all from one interface. The BEST token serves as more than just a currency within the platform. It provides access to perks, reduced fees, and early access advantages. As crypto adoption spreads from corporations to sports clubs to everyday users, having an intuitive, comprehensive platform matters more than ever. Best Wallet isn’t a niche tool—it’s a hub for navigating crypto without hopping between 10 tabs. Just as PSG restructured its reserves to reflect what the future might look like, Best Wallet gives everyday users a similar recalibration opportunity. It’s not about chasing the next trend—it’s about equipping yourself for everything that comes after. Conclusion We’re no longer in the phase where crypto is just circling the edges of culture. When billion-dollar clubs start locking Bitcoin into their reserves, it’s a cue that the game is changing. The projects above aren’t clinging to old mechanics—they’re building for where things are going next. In times like these, the difference between noise and signal is utility; and these ones speak clearly. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Experts Doubt It,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/can-pakistans-bitcoin-mining-move-impact-btc-price-experts-doubt-it/,"The post Can Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Move Impact BTC Price? Experts Doubt It appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Pakistan plans to allocate 2,000 MW for Bitcoin mining and create a national Bitcoin reserve amid political and economic instability. IMF raises concerns over the project’s viability and energy use, questioning its feasibility amid Pakistan’s high energy costs and weak grid. This week Pakistan’s recent announcement to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining was a remarkable move. Later this week they also said that Pakistan has plans to establish a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , this update joined amid ongoing political tensions, financial distress, and border issues. While a normal impression might be optimistic, compared with countries like El Salvador , but it’s not very optimistic. While this initiative signals a potential policy shift in the country, but its direct and immediate impact on the Bitcoin price is anticipated to be very minimal, largely due to a confluence of significant domestic challenges and international scrutiny. Adding to the challenges, the IMF has questioned Pakistan and raised red flags about the move. Keep reading to know more. Economic Viability and Infrastructure Concerns The ambitious mining plan of Pakistan faces tremendous economic viability issues, and power generation is less of an issue than its per kWh charges. The country has commercial electricity rates which are hovering somewhere around $0.20- $0.22/kWh, and are considerably higher than those in competitive mining hubs like Iran, Kuwait and other countries. Moreover, an electrical engineer based in Pakistan highlighted that even with a proposed subsidized tariff of $0.09/kWh, the cost remains barely competitive for large-scale operations compared to other countries in the global Bitcoin mining. The pricing was a major issue, but beyond pricing, the nation’s power infrastructure presents further obstacles. As Pakistan’s grid suffers from inconsistent service, distribution and transmission losses. These are major risks for energy-intensive mining facilities. IMF Scrutiny and Regulatory Roadblocks Adding to these internal challenges, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has added red flags and asked several questions, as they said this announcement was done without IMF consultation. They voiced serious concerns regarding Pakistan’s plan like the rationale behind allocating such a substantial amount of electricity, especially given the country’s ongoing chronic energy shortages and declining countries fiscal conditions. Moreover, this external oversight clearly indicates the complexities involved in moving from a conceptual plan to a fully operational one. This creates an uncertain situation for Pakistan’s dreams related to Bitcoin crypto’s. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Appoints Special Assistant for Blockchain and Crypto in PM’s Cabinet , Limited Short-to-Medium Term Impact on Bitcoin Price While the move was strategic or chaotic still remains a question. But, if in case it does establish a Bitcoin mining facility in Pakistan. It wouldn’t send the BTC price to hit mars or jupiter, from one financially weakend country’s action. Its effort could incrementally contribute to the network’s security and global demand for Bitcoin in the long run, but no major outcome seems likely in the future. Moreover, the current viability challenges and the critical intervention from the foreign organization clearly hints that its direct influence on global Bitcoin price will likely remain limited in the short to medium term, only if they successfully set up their plan in motion. However, the long-run outlook totally depends on the broader market forces, global adoption trends, and major regulatory developments. These are the combined factors that are expected to continue to be the primary drivers of the future Bitcoin price movements. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

45330667,https://invezz.com/?p=2743304,1748695800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as major contender for DeFi throne,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/31/mutuum-finance-mutm-emerges-as-major-contender-for-defi-throne/,"Since Solana (SOL) crossed the $100 mark in 2024, interest in SOL has seen a dramatic increase. However, in 2025, SOL has many investors disappointed as the price has stagnated around the $170 mark. With investors looking to make massive gains, they have turned to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which makes crypto observers describe the next “king of DeFi.” Looking at the ongoing presale, this sentiment is justified. So far, over $9.4 million worth of presale tokens have been sold. The presale is currently in phase 5, with each token selling for $0.03. In the previous phase, the token price was $0.025 and has since increased by 20%. The current phase of the presale represents the last chance to make a guaranteed 100% ROI based on the listing price of $0.06. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will increase by 16,67% to $0.035, while the guaranteed ROI will dip to 71.43%. So far, over 11,300 unique buyers have taken part in the presale, and over 9% of the phase 5 presale tokens have been sold. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fundamentals At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to interact as liquidators, borrowers, or lenders. Lenders supply the liquidity, which borrowers can access via overcollateralized loans. Meanwhile, liquidators help to maintain the overall health of the ecosystem, which is governed by the stability factor. The role of lenders Lenders’ primary role is to supply liquidity either through P2P or P2C. The peer-to-contract (P2C) is the primary means by which lenders and borrowers interact. Funds contributed by lenders can be accessed using collateral in the same contract, without the need for individual loan matching. Once lenders deposit funds in a pool, they receive an annualized percentage interest yield on their assets. The pool’s utilization rate determines the rate; as more borrowers access the pool, it causes the yield to rise, which encourages more lenders to deposit their assets. Lenders can also use the P2P to earn interest. In these pools, which are governed in separate smart contracts, lenders and borrowers engage in discussions about their terms. They can agree on the interest rate, the loan period, and many other factors. The mode is reserved for highly volatile assets with low liquidity, like the FLOKI meme coin. It is kept separate from the P2C pools to ensure that the high volatility of assets in this mode does not stabilize the overall protocol. The role of borrowers Borrowers provide collateral that is needed for loans in the ecosystem. The interest rate that borrowers pay is governed by supply and demand dynamics. Borrowers have the option to choose between stable or variable rates. With stable rates, they have a better understanding of their repayments. Once they repay a loan, the borrowed tokens return to the pool, and accrued interest flows into the revenue mechanism. Borrowers can also use collateral to mint stablecoins on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The stablecoin’s value will algorithmically be maintained at the value of the USD. The stablecoin will open up earning opportunities for its holders through arbitration to maintain this value. The role of liquidators Liquidators are another role within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) where participants can make a stable income. The entire ecosystem is maintained through a stability factor, which monitors the current collateralization of a loan against its value. If the collateral’s value falls below a certain threshold, the position is liquidated. Liquidators in the protocol can then purchase the debt at a discount and make a small profit in the process. At the same time, their actions help to keep bad debt out of the ecosystem. Incentives to stake on Mutuum Finance From the above, all participants stand to benefit from the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. There are also numerous incentives in the ecosystem, including a profit-sharing mechanism. In the mechanism, profits from the protocol will be used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which will be redistributed to stakers as rewards for maintaining the protocol’s security. With a robust lending protocol, coupled with a robust profit-sharing mechanism, Mutuum Finance is well-positioned to claim the DeFi throne. Recently, it passed a Certik security audit, which has boosted trust in the project and is poised to accelerate the pace of the ongoing presale. At the current price of $0.03 per token, this could be your best opportunity to join this DeFi project.

The surge, catalyzed by a sudden bullish breakout following the White House’s decision to delay 50% tariffs on EU goods, has since been tempered by geopolitical uncertainty and clear signs of market overexuberance. Social Chatter on Bitcoin Santiment’s data shows a sharp uptick in crowd optimism precisely as Bitcoin peaked, which led to an immediate correction. This is a reminder that extreme greed often precedes market pullbacks. Positive sentiment across platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram hit its highest point this year on May 22, only to be swiftly reversed when President Trump’s tariff threat caused market jitters. Although the federal court ruling on May 28 deemed the “Liberation Day” tariffs unconstitutional, offering temporary relief, Santiment warned that recurring tariff-related discussions are now a key driver of volatility. Mentions of “tariff” and “trade war” spiked on social media in the final days of May, mirroring patterns observed during the April correction. Despite the cooling, the crowd remains bullish. The most popular Bitcoin options call is now for $300K. This sentiment depicted rising long-term expectations despite near-term instability. Santiment’s report also explained the reliability of crowd sentiment as a counter-indicator, with extreme fear on May 25 coinciding with Bitcoin’s rebound to $106K. Meanwhile, blockchain fundamentals continue to show strength. Over 147,000 BTC have exited exchanges in 2025, which reduced immediate sell pressure and suggested continued confidence among holders. The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) has declined steadily since mid-April, indicating that older coins are being reactivated. Such a trend is typically a bullish signal associated with ongoing price expansions. Santiment noted that these shifts suggest the rally is driven not solely by speculative frenzy. BTC’s Path Ahead BTC whales continue to shape market tops. On the day of Bitcoin’s ATH, there were 18,782 transactions of over $100,000. Interestingly, this was the highest since Trump’s inauguration in January, suggesting significant profit-taking by institutional players. In fact, one whale held a 40x leveraged position now worth $1.2 billion. As such, the report warns that a liquidation event below $104,810 could trigger a cascade of long positions unwinding. As Bitcoin enters a new phase of price discovery, data shows that emotional extremes and external shocks continue to dictate short-term moves, even as exchange flows and coin age metrics point toward deeper bullish foundations. The road to $300K may be steep, but investor expectations, like Bitcoin’s price, have never been higher.

Santiment analysts based the list on code changes on public Github pages of open-source cryptocurrency projects. The company also says it uses a system to prevent fake changes from creating the perception of high developer activity. Compared to the previous list, there are significant changes in the list. Chainlink (LINK), which ranked high in almost all developer activity scores, has returned to the first position in the new list, significantly widening the gap with the second-placed altcoin. However, it is also noteworthy that DeFiChain (DFI), which is known for its price drops and is the smallest altcoin on the list with a total market value of only $5.4 million, is at the top of the list.

The recent rejection highlights a key resistance zone that bulls have been unable to overcome. As global markets experience increased volatility due to rising geopolitical tensions and ongoing trade disputes between major economies like the US and China, risk assets—including crypto—are consolidating or retracing. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support Despite the pullback, top analyst Ali Martinez believes Solana could still be poised for a rebound. In a recent analysis, Martinez pointed out that as long as SOL holds above the $159 support level, the asset maintains a structurally bullish outlook. This zone now serves as a key threshold for the bulls to defend in the short term. If Solana finds enough demand at these levels, it could set the stage for a sharp recovery and renewed attempts at breaking above $180. For now, the market remains tense, with traders watching both macroeconomic developments and technical levels closely. SOL’s ability to hold critical support may determine whether it joins the next leg of a potential altcoin rally or slides into a deeper correction. Solana Consolidates Quietly While much of the market’s attention remains locked on Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana has been quietly consolidating in a tight range below the $180 resistance. The lack of volatility in recent days may seem uneventful, but analysts warn that this calm could be the precursor to a sharp breakout. As the broader market digests macroeconomic uncertainty and prepares for a potential altseason, Solana’s technical setup suggests it may be one of the first major altcoins to move. Martinez recently shared an optimistic outlook for Solana, highlighting the importance of the $159 support level. As long as SOL holds this zone, the structure remains bullish. Martinez also noted that the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the chart, typically seen during the final stages of a retracement before a new impulse begins. This aligns with the current low-volume, sideways environment that often precedes large price expansions. If Solana breaks above the $180 resistance with strong momentum, the move could spark an aggressive rally toward previous highs. Given its strong fundamentals, vibrant ecosystem, and historical leadership during bullish phases, Solana is well-positioned to lead if the market transitions into a full-fledged altseason. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Gas Usage Hits New Highs – Real Demand Powers ETH Growth Solana Tests Support As Market Corrects Solana (SOL) is currently trading around $153.49 after failing to reclaim the $180 resistance zone. The daily chart shows a sharp decline over the past few sessions, with price breaking below the 34-day EMA at $163.20. This move highlights growing bearish momentum and places the spotlight on the $150–$156 support range, where the 50-day and 100-day SMAs converge. Volume has ticked higher during this drop, suggesting stronger selling pressure as traders de-risk amid broader market uncertainty. The failure to hold above key moving averages weakens the short-term bullish outlook, though the structure hasn’t fully broken down yet. If SOL manages to stabilize above $150, this zone could act as a base for a rebound. However, continued weakness below this level may lead to a retest of lower support zones around $144 and $135. That said, RSI levels suggest Solana is approaching oversold territory on lower time frames, hinting that buyers could step in soon. Related Reading: Altseason Loading?

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031.

Short-term indicators suggest recovery. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP shows early signs of recovery As of May 31, OP/USDT is trading at $0.644, up 3.70% after a sharp drop. The price is holding above support at $0.626, with stronger support near $0.60. Resistance sits around $0.747. The MACD remains bearish, while OBV shows slight buying interest. Unless OP breaks above $0.747 with volume, this bounce may be short-lived. A drop below $0.626 could lead to further downside. OP is up 3.70% after a sharp drop The MACD remains bearish, while OBV shows slight buying interest. Unless OP breaks above $0.747 with volume, this bounce may be short-lived. A drop below $0.626 could lead to further downside. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP is gaining momentum in the short term On the 4-hour chart, OP/USDT is also up 2.71%, showing signs of a short-term recovery. The Alligator indicator still points downward, with resistance ahead at $0.662, $0.686, and $0.709. However, momentum is improving: the Balance of Power is strong at 0.89, indicating buyers are gaining control, and the CMF is trending upward, suggesting buying pressure is starting to build.

Optimism (OP) shows a short-term bounce, but the overall trend is still bearish. On the daily chart, it remains below key resistance at $0.747 with bearish MACD momentum. The 4-hour chart shows growing buying strength, but OP faces resistance at $0.662. OP may continue to recover in the short term, but unless it breaks above $0.709 with strong volume, this is likely just a relief rally, not a full reversal. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history | Source: Coinmarketcap OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse.

Bennett tells his 115,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has a “confirmed break” after falling below a support level at around $106,000. According to Bennett, Bitcoin could fall by up to around 13% from the current level to a price of about $91,790 if BTC loses support levels that are around $100,730 and then $97,762. “Those downside targets are in play as long as $106,000 holds as new resistance on the daily time frame.” Source: Justin Bennett/X The analyst and trader further says that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum ( ETH ), could turn bearish as USDT dominance, the percentage of USDT’s market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, rises. “This is the same Tether dominance outlook as eight days ago, and now we have a confirmed breakout. There are no guarantees, but you have to respect what’s on the chart, not what you hope will happen. If it holds, BTC and ETH pull back. Keep it simple.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Turning to Ethereum, Bennett says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap is leaning bearish after breaking below an ascending trendline on the four-hour chart. “A little speculative right now, but I’d be willing to bet that ETH breaking this trend line opens up $2,460 and $2,360. Today’s fakeout above range highs gives Ethereum a bearish tilt. That said, markets could chop around while some of these supports hold.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,365 at time of writing, while Ethereum is trading at $2,605.

Creditors will receive up to 72% payouts, with payments processed via Kraken and BitGo. Distributions could trigger short-term crypto market volatility as recovered funds enter circulation. The FTX Recovery Trust has launched a second wave of payments to creditors, marking a major milestone in the collapsed exchange’s ongoing reimbursement process. On May 30, the Trust began distributing $5 billion to eligible creditors who completed pre-distribution requirements, targeting both the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes. The move follows a May 28 announcement detailing how the funds would be allocated across various claim types. FTX Creditors Set to Receive Up to 72% Payout in Latest Round Under the plan, Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims are set to receive a 72% distribution, while US Customer Entitlement Claims will see a 54% payout. Convenience Claims will receive a full 120% reimbursement. General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims are scheduled for a 61% distribution. Payments are being processed through official distribution partners Kraken and BitGo, with recipients expected to receive funds within one to two business days. The FTX reimbursements are being closely watched by crypto investors, as large liquidity injections from these payouts could impact digital asset markets. Analysts warn that if recipients choose to offload or swap their recovered funds on retail exchanges, it could introduce short-term price volatility. This is the second major disbursement since FTX’s collapse. The first round of payments, totaling $1.2 billion, was distributed on February 18 to claimants with less than $50,000 in approved claims. The reimbursement process has not been without controversy. In September 2024, FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri highlighted that claim values were being calculated based on prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing — during the depths of the crypto winter — rather than current market values. As a result, many creditors are recovering just 10% to 25% of their crypto holdings’ actual value.

Sam Bankman-Fried’s Release Date Set for 2044 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars. The move comes after Bankman-Fried was reportedly placed in solitary confinement earlier this month for giving an unauthorized interview to Tucker Carlson. His incarceration began in August 2023, after Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail due to allegations of witness tampering involving leaked diary entries from former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, who was a key witness in the case.

Ethereum ( ETH ) has declined for three consecutive days, hitting a low of $2,500. That’s a 9.8% drop from its monthly high. Despite the pullback, it has outperformed most altcoins, many of which have fallen more than 15% from their highs this month. ETH retreated ahead of June, which is usually its worst month, because of the start of summer. CoinGlass data shows that the average monthly performance in June since 2016 is minus 7.4%. Its median monthly return in June is minus 8.68%. ETH monthly returns | Source: CoinGlass June is also Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) second-worst-performing month after September, with an average return of minus 0.35%. Seasonality does not always work out. For example, ETH dropped by 18% in March, bucking a four-year trend of gains. It also dropped by 31% in February, after recording positive gains in the last six consecutive years.

It’s currently trading in a tight zone between $2.75K and $2.4K ever since May 10. It’s worth noting that even after the recent 9% decline in $ETH’s prices, the annualized premium stands at 6%. This means that $ETH futures are currently at a 6% premium compared to spot. In simple words, traders are willing to pay more for $ETH than its spot price, indicating an overall neutral-to-bullish sentiment. Read on as we discuss the ongoing market sentiments around Ethereum. We’ll also suggest the best crypto to buy now to ride the upcoming $ETH-fueled crypto rally. Ethereum’s Positive Market Data A possible reason for the decline in $ETH’s price might be investors losing interest in dApps across the blockchain. The total value locked (TVL) of the crypto industry is currently at $122B. This is 43% less than its all-time high in December 2021. Even then, Ethereum dominates the TVL with a 54.2% market share. Out of this, 6.3% is added by Layer 2 on Ethereum. For comparison, Ethereum’s TVL is four times more than Solana and BNB Chain combined. All in all, while there has been a drop in the overall industry’s TVL, Ethereum has managed to emerge as a dominant player. Now, let’s compare the fees collected by Solana and Ethereum protocols. The top four dApps on Solana collected $356.3M in user fees in the last 30 days. Out of this, only $48.5M (13.6%) was collected as protocol fees. On the other hand, the top four dApps on Ethereum collected $169M in the last 30 days. 52% less than Solana. Out of this, $38.3M (22%) was collected as protocol fees. This is primarily because many dApps on Ethereum run on the Layer 2 solution, which settles back to the Ethereum mainnet and shares revenue with validators, creating demand for $ETH. So, while the prices may seem stagnant as of now, $ETH has still increased around 75% since mid-April. A solid consolidation is important for a sustained long-term price rally. A break above the $2.75K resistance can propel $ETH towards its all-time high at $4K. If you want to prepare yourself for this opportunity in the best manner possible, here are some top altcoins you can invest in. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Crypto to Buy Now to Identify Explode-Worthy Tokens If you’ve been at sea trying to pick the next big crypto coin and want to supercharge your crypto investing career, MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is easily the #1 crypto you should buy. $MIND is a cutting-edge AI agent that: Interacts with the crypto community – in a context-aware tone using relevant crypto and meme lingo – on online platforms like X Acknowledges their opinions and insights on specific meme coins Combines online chatter with on-chain activity data, like volume spikes, early investor funding, etc., to identify the next cryptos to explode .

However, make sure you move fast because the $MIND presale is ending in around 2 days from now. Here’s our guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana L2 with $40M in Presale Funding Solaxy ($SOLX) could be right at the center of the next surge in DeFi, seeing as it aims to revolutionize the Solana blockchain and restore its glory days. Solana, in case you’re out of the loop, has been facing congestion and scalability issues thanks to $TRUMP’s success, which brought hundreds of thousands of new investors to Solana. During peak activity hours, Solana is unable to process transactions, often resulting in failed transaction requests. Enter Solaxy. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, which will offload a lot of Solana’s transactions onto a sidechain, thereby reducing the burden on the mainnet. Additionally, $SOLX will process transactions in batches rather than one by one. As is the case in conventional banking, batch processing will reduce the cost required per transaction, meaning Solana will become even more affordable than it is currently. With over $42.7M in early investor funding, the Solaxy presale has proven that investors are really looking forward to ‘Solana’s lifesaver’ going live. If you want to join the tribe, buy $SOLX now for just $0.00174 each. Hurry up, though, because the presale is in its last stage and will close out in a couple of weeks. 3. Comedian ($BAN) – Controversial Artwork Gets Its Very Own Meme Coin Comedian ($BAN) is a low-cap coin based on the infamous artwork of the Italian virtual artist Maurizio Cattelan. The artwork, which you might have definitely seen floating around on social media, features a banana taped to a wall. Yep, that’s it! Needless to say, this rather ‘bold’ display of artistic caliber drew in a lot of negative comments, especially from lovers of contemporary, old-school art that involved a lot of thought, skill, and, oh, brushstrokes. Permissible or not, the mere controversy surrounding the art was enough for crypto degens to push the $BAN token to mainstream popularity. With lifetime gains of over 100,000%, $BAN is currently one of the top trending cryptos . It has jumped more than 30% over the past month , and you can get one $BAN for just $0.06572 right now. Sweet Gains, But Spicy Market Utility-backed presale cryptos like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and Solaxy ($SOLX) can indeed offer you once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to become crypto millionaires. However, the fact remains that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. No returns are guaranteed! So, always jump in with a small amount and do your own research before investing.

Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto , briefly climbed higher than Bill Gates on the global wealth chart. But as quickly as it happened, a Bitcoin price drop pulled Nakamoto back down. Still, the moment sparked a fresh wave of interest in crypto’s most famous ghost and the fortune they’re quietly sitting on. Bitcoin Rally Pushed Nakamoto Ahead of Gates Nakamoto’s wallet, believed to hold 1.1 million BTC – around 5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply – recently reached a massive $113.8 billion , according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham . That briefly put him ahead of Bill Gates , whose fortune stood at $112.9 billion , based on Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires list . It was enough to make Nakamoto the 12th richest person in the world , if only for a moment. The surge was driven by optimism around a potential U.S.–China trade deal , which helped push Bitcoin’s price higher. But the Lead Didn’t Last Long The crypto market, as always, had other plans. Bitcoin’s price slipped again, bringing Nakamoto’s estimated net worth back to around $114 billion as of May 31, 2025 . Meanwhile, Gates’ net worth has risen to $166.3 billion , putting a wide gap back between the two. Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto, Anyway? Nakamoto’s true identity remains one of crypto’s biggest unanswered questions. Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, people have speculated that it could be Nick Szabo , Len Sassaman , or Peter Todd . In 2024, a documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery pointed the finger at Peter Todd but he quickly denied any connection. That only added to the legend of Satoshi: a billionaire who might not even know they’re currently one of the wealthiest people alive. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation , Could Nakamoto Catch Up to Elon Musk? Topping Elon Musk , who currently has a net worth of $422.7 billion , would be a much bigger jump. For Nakamoto to match Musk, Bitcoin would need to skyrocket to $406,000 per coin. It sounds far-fetched, but in crypto, strange things happen all the time and this recent Gates moment proved that anything’s possible. Crypto’s Wealth Race: Who’s Next? This back-and-forth between Nakamoto and Gates shows just how unpredictable crypto can be. If Bitcoin rallies again, Nakamoto could easily reclaim the edge especially with Gates’ wealth holding steady. As the market keeps moving, the crypto world is watching closely – because in this game, one price spike could change everything. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ISO 20022: The Global Messaging Standard ISO 20022 is not just another regulatory buzzword; it represents a sweeping global standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. Designed to harmonize payment messaging across borders, ISO 20022 replaces fragmented legacy systems with a unified language that enhances interoperability, transparency, and data richness. As the world’s financial system shifts into a future of real-time payments and digital assets, ISO 20022 stands as the backbone of this evolution. DIRECTLY FROM SWIFT: “WE NOW SEE BLOCKCHAINS BASED ON THE ISO 20022 DATA DICTIONARY.” ISO 20022 Blockchain Listen closely. pic.twitter.com/haUFUGk0mI — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 31, 2025 SWIFT, the cooperative behind trillions of dollars in cross-border transactions, is leading the ISO 20022 migration effort, guiding banks and financial networks through a seamless transition. Until recently, this migration was largely viewed through the lens of traditional financial institutions, but the latest acknowledgment from SWIFT signals something bigger: the convergence of ISO 20022 standards with blockchain ecosystems. Ripple and the ISO 20022-Blockchain Convergence For years, Ripple has positioned XRP and its blockchain solutions as financial-grade technologies that can integrate seamlessly with existing payment infrastructures. RippleNet, Ripple’s global payment network, was designed from inception to support ISO 20022 messaging, making Ripple one of the earliest blockchain companies to align with these standards. SWIFT’s recent confirmation that it now recognizes blockchains based on the ISO 20022 data dictionary bolsters Ripple’s strategic narrative. This suggests that blockchains, particularly those built for institutional-grade finance, are no longer outsiders or disruptors but are being absorbed into the fabric of global financial standards. For XRP, this development sharpens its identity not merely as a speculative crypto asset but as a utility token built to thrive within a harmonized, standards-driven global payments landscape. Why This Matters for XRP’s Future Ripple’s commitment to ISO 20022 has always been more than technical compliance; it’s a signal to banks, central banks, and financial institutions that Ripple’s solutions are enterprise-ready. With SWIFT’s acknowledgment, blockchain systems like RippleNet gain additional legitimacy in the eyes of conservative financial players who demand rigorous adherence to international standards. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, as financial institutions increasingly migrate to ISO 20022-based systems, they will naturally seek blockchain solutions that can seamlessly integrate into this architecture. Ripple, with its head start in this domain, stands poised to capture significant institutional demand. XRP, as the native asset facilitating liquidity within Ripple’s ecosystem, could thus see a surge in utility-driven adoption, not simply as a bridge currency, but as a core component of ISO 20022-aligned settlement flows. The Broader Implication: Blockchain’s Institutional Embrace SMQKE’s highlighting of SWIFT’s statement serves as a milestone marker in the blockchain’s journey from a fringe technology to an institutional mainstay. While many blockchains and crypto projects have pursued innovation outside regulatory frameworks, Ripple has consistently emphasized compliance, interoperability, and integration. The recognition that blockchains can operate on the ISO 20022 data dictionary is not just a technical nod; it is a profound endorsement of the maturation of blockchain solutions, and Ripple’s XRP is right at the center of that evolution. This development also sends ripples across the regulatory landscape. As blockchains align more tightly with global standards, it becomes increasingly difficult for regulators to dismiss them as rogue or untested. Instead, they become part of the solution, helping modernize and streamline global finance in a way that meets both institutional needs and compliance requirements.

The BTC slide triggered a massive $687 million in trader liquidations, the biggest wipeout seen since February. The cumulative crypto market cap dropped by over 2% to stand at $3.24 trillion. The sell-off got triggered by US President Donald Trump’s reignition of trade war fears by doubling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum to 50%. He accused Beijing of breaking a key May agreement. Trump’s aggressive stance sent shockwaves through global markets, raising concerns over economic fallout. Bitcoin bears eye $102K next Data shows that Bitcoin is stuck below $104K after facing rejection from $106K due to increased selling pressure. It will be crucial to see if bulls can defend this level. Bitcoin futures saw over $153 million being liquidated. 93% of these liquidated positions ($137 million) turned out to be long bets set in BTC price action. It was followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $122 million, Solana (SOL) at $33 million, XRP at $30 million, and Dogecoin at over $22 million. As per IT tech, a cryptoquant analyst, the Bitcoin price trend of printing lower highs and lower lows confirms bearish momentum. The “sell” signal got confirmed at $106k, which shifted down the trend and is still expanding downward. Bitcoin is still stuck below $104K after rejection from $106K Price just wicked into $103K territory with visible pressure from sellers. Can bulls defend this level again or is $102K next on the radar?

Volume profile depicts that there is a heavy interest around $103K, and the breakdown below this level will signal a deeper move towards the $102K zone. Bears are pressing the market lower, and the $103K zone remains a critical short-term support. However, if BTC surges past $104.8K would be the first sign for bulls to regain momentum. Big whales flip to selling mode Bitcoin price dropped by more than 5% over the past 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $103,528 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume dipped by 20% to stand at $50.73 billion. On-chain data reveals that while open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April and options have skyrocketed 126%. Big players like whales holding over 10,000 BTC have quietly flipped from accumulation to net selling. This has pushed coins back onto exchanges in a classic profit-taking scenario. Bitcoin-linked ETFs depict the position. May 30 saw a total net outflow of $616 million from US BTC ETFs, with none of the twelve ETFs recording a net inflow. On the other hand, Ethereum ETFs posted a net inflow of over $70 million, hitting 10 consecutive days of inflows. The Fear and Greed index has turned back to the “Neutral” zone after flashing greed for a couple of weeks. With Ether and XRP down by nearly 4%, and Solana off by 6%, traders are now watching for a potential reversal or bracing for more turbulence.

It's a common scam vector. Still, someone tried it on me. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Account compromise The narrative Last weekend, an unknown California number called me. A helpful gentleman informed me that my Coinbase account had been compromised during its recent data breach and he was there to assist me in not losing my assets. Oh no, the horror! Why it matters All right, so obviously this is a scam. Right after hanging up with this supposed help desk agent, I texted a Coinbase spokesperson to verify that at no point would the exchange call a customer to tell them their account was compromised. It's scam 101 — if you're getting a phone call informing you that your account's been compromised , whether at a crypto exchange, a bank, the IRS, whatever, it's a scam . Do not share your personal details and do not provide any passwords if you get a call like this. There were a few flaws in the attempt to get me to, presumably, move my funds from my supposedly compromised Coinbase account to another address. But I'm hopeful that this can be a useful teaching moment for the nearly 70,000 people who have been affected by Coinbase's recent breach disclosure, as well as anyone else who receives a phone call claiming their information has been compromised. Here's how this went down. Breaking it down Let's start from the beginning. On Saturday, May 24, I received a call from a number I didn't recognize to my personal phone, not my public-facing work number. It being a weekend, one where I was actually visiting family in another state, I didn't pick up. Then the same number called back and I still didn't pick up (yes I know, riveting, but it's 2025 and you can leave a voicemail or text). Ten minutes later, I received a third call from a different number, which I did pick up because at that point I was curious. A fast-talking gentleman who called himself Riccardo told me he was part of Coinbase's Actions and Protections Department and that he was reaching out because my Coinbase account information had been compromised and a new email had just been added to my account. I was pretty confused, for reasons I'll get into below. But I was also intrigued because there were immediately four red flags. For simplicity's sake, I'll refer to the caller as ""the agent"" from here on out, but to be absolutely clear, I doubt he is an actual customer service agent, representative or other employee of Coinbase, and he certainly was not reaching out to me as an authorized representative of the exchange. First off, the phone call itself is a big red flag. Coinbase will never call a customer about a breach, but rather will contact customers via email, it previously said in a tweet . This is actually standard. The Federal Trade Commission website notes there is a vast range of scams wherein someone will call you, and numerous other companies have warnings that their employees will never proactively call a customer about account issues. The agent I spoke to said they would freeze my account for 24 hours to ensure no funds could be stolen (thanks, I guess?) and that a supervisor would reach out to me (I continue to wait for this supervisor to call). This supposed freeze on my account can be extended to three months if there are multiple failed login attempts. To wrap up the call, he said he'd send me an email summarizing all the details we'd discussed. On Saturday night, I received an email with the subject line ""your case is under review."" The follow-up email this very helpful customer service representative sent was extremely informative. For one thing, the email address they had associated with my account is a public-facing address, but is not the email address attached to my actual Coinbase account (in fairness, I forgot that part until I tried to find my login information a few days later). Gmail initially (correctly) flagged this email as spam. I moved it to my inbox, where Gmail then showed me that the sender ( help@info-coinbase.com ) was not the actual sender — the email arrived via learnindonesian.online. Even the info-coinbase.com part is sketchy — for one thing, Coinbase's website is coinbase.com , though it does send emails from info@info.coinbase.com — still, you wouldn't expect a hyphen in a support email domain. For another, the info-coinbase domain was first created in November 2024 (according to an ICANN lookup ) and isn't a real website. The email headers were also not super helpful in terms of providing any sort of identifying information, but they did confirm that the sender appeared to have tried to obfuscate their information. Curiously, the ""Visit Coinbase"" link at the bottom appeared to link to the actual Coinbase website and there do not appear to be any hidden embedded images or other attached files in the email at all. I'm not totally sure what's going on there. A real scammer could have embedded a virus of some sort into the email or even a tracking pixel. Another common tool scammers might use is putting in a phishing link in place of a legitimate one in an email, tricking the user into going to a website intended to steal their login information (this is not legal, technical or any other sort of advice; if you decide to try and scam somebody using information you gleaned from this newsletter, stop it). While scammers might sometimes know how much their intended victims have in a wallet or account, the person who called me did not appear to have that information (as I have zero crypto in my Coinbase account). I called the number back on Friday to see what might happen. No one picked up. I guess my account must be secure now.

With over $9.70 million raised in its presale and more than 11,650 holders already on board, the project is breaking through the noise. Combined with a fully completed CertiK audit and a powerful utility model, it’s clear why the crypto community is starting to treat Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as more than just a trending name — it’s becoming a real contender in the DeFi space. Numbers that signal real trust In a market still recovering from countless rug pulls and broken promises, numbers matter. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already pulled in $9.70 million during its presale phase, and it’s not even live yet. Over 11,650 investors have committed, and this isn’t speculative hype — it’s capital and user growth backed by development progress and third-party validation. That validation came from one of the industry’s most trusted names, CertiK. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) underwent a full audit including static analysis and manual review. The result was a Token Scan Score of 70.00, issued after a revision in May 2025. For many serious traders, a CertiK audit isn’t just a checkbox — it’s a signal that a project has nothing to hide and everything to build. Where the capital is going The $9.70 million raised so far isn’t just sitting idle. This capital is being directed toward launching Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s core infrastructure. The team is already developing its decentralized lending protocol, which includes both P2P and P2C functionality. The P2P system allows users to lend and borrow a wide range of tokens, including ones that are usually excluded from traditional lending platforms. That includes memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Meanwhile, the P2C model focuses on stable, high-liquidity assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and DAI, creating structured lending pools for users looking to earn reliable passive income. The team has already confirmed that a fully functional beta version of the platform will launch by the time the token goes live — a major delivery milestone that most presale projects struggle to meet. Passive income you can count on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just for traders. Long-term holders and passive income seekers also have a reason to get excited. By depositing assets like ETH or DAI into Mutuum’s P2C lending pools, users can earn annual returns between 7% and 18%, depending on pool utilization. This isn’t theoretical. For example, putting $5,000 worth of DAI into the protocol can generate annual returns of up to $900. Unlike staking in volatile platforms, these rewards are directly tied to lending demand, creating a sustainable income model for conservative investors. Community growth points to viral spread Beyond the capital and token mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is witnessing explosive community growth. Telegram groups are expanding fast, daily engagement is surging, and influencers on X (formerly Twitter) have begun spotlighting the project for its rapid traction and promising fundamentals. The $100K giveaway currently running has only added to the buzz, pulling in thousands of new eyes and wallets. But giveaways are just an entry point — the real retention comes from what the project delivers next. And Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering across the board. CertiK seal builds post-rug confidence In a time when investor trust is hard to win, a CertiK audit is a huge credibility booster. With so many projects collapsing due to unchecked contracts or malicious devs, seeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) score a 70.00 on Token Scan gives serious confidence to risk-aware traders. It means the code has been reviewed, the logic verified, and the risk exposure minimized. This added transparency plays a major role in onboarding new capital — both retail and institutional — and is one of the strongest reasons why the project is being taken seriously at this stage. This is what early traction looks like It’s rare to find a project that checks all the boxes — rising capital, growing user base, certified security, working product, and clear utility. But Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does. With a current price of just $0.03, there’s a closing window to get in before the next phase pushes prices higher and profit margins lower. The next phases will bring higher entry costs, more competition for tokens, and less room for explosive gains. The smartest move? Enter now, not later. Because once it hits exchanges and trading begins, the chance to get MUTM at a floor price will be gone for good. This isn’t a project to watch. It’s a project to join.

According to the firm, it plans to raise 450 million reais (about $78 million) to purchase the leading digital asset, a move that has caused its shares to tumble over 8%. Méliuz, which trades in the cashback and coupon business, trades on the B3 exchange in Brazil under the ticker CASH3. The company initially plans to offer about 17 million common shares to raise around 150 million reais (approximately $26.2 million). The company also left enough space to expand the offering by up to 200%, which could see it triple the amount if demand goes as planned. Méliuz embraces Bitcoin amid its transformation The latest announcement marks a new chapter in the company’s transformation, moving from a traditional fintech to what can be described as the first Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil. Since March, when the company made a $4.13 million Bitcoin purchase, Méliuz has accumulated around 320.2 BTC, currently worth $33.55 million. It also became one of the first fintech companies in Brazil to offer crypto exposure to its clients, with this new step a way to increase its involvement in the industry. “Rather than just allocating part of its cash to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, the company has repositioned its purpose to act by maximizing the amount of Bitcoin per share,” the company said in a previous statement about its strategy shift. Markets appear to have priced in the news, with the company’s stock swinging wildly over the past year. The stock is up 217% since the beginning of 2025 at around 2.53 reais per share, climbing to a high of around 11 reais. The recent drop saw the price hit 8.13 reais, with trading volume hitting 6.51 million shares. According to Ray Nasser, the head of the Latin America branch of trading firm BlockFills, Méliuz has been adopting the same strategy as Michael Saylor-owned Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). He mentioned that the move has been able to help its shareholders get better value for their money. “The company lost its relevance over the years, and its stock price went down,” he said. “Although it made a turnaround in 2024, it’s doing what Strategy is doing now, it’s riding the hype.” Comparison to Strategy and Bitcoin adoption The firm has earned the compliment of being compared to United States firm, Strategy over the last few years. Strategy kickstarted the big-scale Bitcoin adoption in the United States, with the firm now holding about 580,250 Bitcoins, worth over $60 billion, using several capital raises. During the bull run, the company’s stock outperformed Bitcoin itself, creating what some analysts called a “Bitcoin proxy” for investors. But Méliuz carries out its operation differently, with the company’s market cap hovering around 305 million reais ($53.8 million), a fraction of its 9 billion reais peak after it went public in 2020. Meanwhile, the company has set its pricing for June 12, with trading of the new shares beginning on June 16. The company has scheduled two priority subscription periods for existing shareholders, with the first expected to start on June 4 after a June 3 cutoff date, and the second expected to end on June 10, after a June 9 cutoff date, allowing them to own the new shares first. The company was founded in 2011 and has built its business on cashback rewards and discount coupons, partnering with over 1,000 brands and accumulating 35 million registered users. Méliuz started offering Bitcoin exposure to clients back in 2022 when PayPal and other companies showed positive results experimenting with crypto purchases.

Among the many voices amplifying the event’s highlights, prominent crypto analyst Vet took to X to express admiration , particularly noting how impressed he was by the clear go-to-market strategies presented by various XRPL teams and their sharp awareness of both incoming and existing XRPL features such as smart escrows and payment channels. A Showcase of Innovation on the XRP Ledger XRP Las Vegas has become a focal point for spotlighting real-world blockchain applications that leverage the XRP Ledger’s unique capabilities. This year’s event underscored not just the enthusiasm of the developer community but also the maturity of the projects aiming to deliver meaningful impact across industries. With pitches spanning DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise payments, the XRPL ecosystem is evolving at a rapid pace. So many awesome XRP Ledger projects at XRP Las Vegas pitching! Particularly impressed by the clear go to market plans and awareness of incoming and existing xrpl features e.g smart escrows and payment channels. Good stuff folks! pic.twitter.com/075vuiXRJO — Vet (@Vet_X0) May 30, 2025 What makes the XRPL stand out in the broader blockchain landscape is its combination of speed, scalability, and low transaction costs, attributes that many of the pitching teams are strategically harnessing. Vet’s insights emphasize that these teams not only have innovative ideas but are also well-prepared for market integration, with concrete execution plans that leverage the ledger’s growing capabilities. Leveraging Smart Escrows and Payment Channels One of the standout features gaining attention among the projects at XRP Las Vegas is the use of smart escrows. This enables automatic execution of conditional payments when predefined criteria are met, which is particularly useful for applications such as automated payouts, decentralized insurance, and escrow services. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another critical innovation is the XRPL’s payment channels, which enable near-instant microtransactions off-chain while ultimately settling on-chain, a vital tool for scaling high-volume payment applications. Several projects pitched at the event showcased sophisticated plans to integrate these features, signaling their understanding not just of the technical layer but also of how to translate these tools into competitive advantages in the real world. A Community Ready for the Next Phase The atmosphere at XRP Las Vegas reflects more than just technical experimentation; it reveals a community poised for growth. Over the past year, the XRPL ecosystem has seen the rollout of sidechain developments, the rise of the EVM-compatible sidechain to attract Ethereum developers, and an increase in institutional interest. The projects pitching this year are leveraging the momentum, transitioning from theoretical phases to practical applications ready for the market. Moreover, the energy from the event is bolstered by a maturing regulatory landscape. With partial legal clarity and Ripple’s ongoing global partnerships, the XRP Ledger is positioning itself as a viable backbone for international finance and cross-border transactions. This environment gives builders confidence, a fact made clear by the polished, investor-ready pitches seen at the Las Vegas gathering.

According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P indices, those retirement plans are often invested in funds that track the S&P 500, and the AAPL (Apple stock) accounts for 6% of the S&P 500’s value. Apple stock has tumbled 20% this year and 3% earlier this month when Trump demanded that the company move all its production operations to the United States. Apple is currently the third-largest U.S. company by market value, influencing the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. The company has lost nearly $1 trillion in market value this year, currently at $3 trillion after topping $3.9 trillion in December. 401(k) plans take a hit from Apple stock falling Apple has been dropping since the beginning of the year, along with many other stocks, due to Trump’s trade war uncertainty. Companies like Amazon , Google, and Tesla, which are tracked by the S&P 500, are in the same boat as Apple. Amazon has tumbled by 6%, Google 9%, and Tesla 14% this year, which could add to 401(k)s stalling. Nvidia and Microsoft have helped keep the S&P 500 afloat with gains of 0.6% and 9% this year, respectively. However, the S&P 500 index is down by 0.01% today. Scott Ladner, Chief Investment Officer at Horizon Investments, revealed that if the market uncertainty continues, some economic consequences will eventually be experienced. By December last year, American retirement plans held $44.1 trillion, with $8.9 trillion in 401(k)s. The Dow Jones fell by 0.58%, and the Nasdaq dropped by 1.61% today. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 companies experienced principal stock value drops after the reinstatement of Trump’s tariffs on China, with the energy and information sectors suffering the most. Trump revealed that China had breached an agreement with the U.S. to put back tariffs on essential minerals. He did not specify how China had violated the deal and did not offer a permanent solution to the trade war. Investors diversify their portfolios to shield their finances against market uncertainty Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird Private Wealth Management, urged Americans to find out where their retirement savings are invested to ensure they are well diversified. He added that although funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 are relatively well diversified, different 401(k) plans may offer different exposures to areas of the market. Steffen revealed that Americans must know how much of their finances have been invested in big companies like Apple to better understand how policies affect their portfolios directly during periods of volatility. According to Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and technology analyst at CFRA Research, Apple is significantly exposed to tariff uncertainty, and the stock may continue to fall in the coming months. He urged investors to wait to see the stock price’s outcome. The ongoing antitrust concerns against Apple and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, signal more challenges ahead, according to Zino. In August, a federal judge ruled that Google had an illegal monopoly on the search engine. Zino said this could continue to affect Apple stock and, in turn, negatively influence the S&P 500. Trump’s tariffs eliminated a tax exemption on goods of $800 or less, leading Americans to pay more for imported goods. Consumers are prompted to turn to Amazon and Etsy, which emphasize low prices. Amazon recently introduced a beta tool called Amazon Haul, a service that allows Americans to pay $20 less for imported items. Analysts said this gives the company a competitive advantage during uncertainty.
