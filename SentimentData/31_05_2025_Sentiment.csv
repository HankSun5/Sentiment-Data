After months of anticipation and complex legal proceedings, the team overseeing the FTX bankruptcy process has officially launched the second phase of its repayment efforts. This is a pivotal moment for FTX creditors who have patiently waited to recover assets lost in the exchange’s dramatic downfall. According to reports, this phase is expected to see a substantial FTX distribution of over $5 billion. The initial disbursements are slated to begin within a short window of 1–3 business days from today, marking a tangible step towards resolution for many. What Does This FTX Repayment Phase Entail? This isn’t the first step in the recovery process, but Phase 2 represents a major wave of distributions. The bankruptcy estate, managed by administrators, has been working diligently to locate, secure, and liquidate assets belonging to the collapsed exchange and its affiliated entities, such as Alameda Research. The goal has been to maximize the value available to repay creditors whose funds were frozen or lost. The specifics of this FTX repayment phase include: Significant Capital Outflow: The commitment to distribute over $5 billion indicates the significant progress made in asset recovery and valuation. This figure represents a large portion of the total estimated value available for distribution. Targeted Audience: These funds are specifically earmarked for eligible FTX creditors who filed claims during the bankruptcy proceedings. The complex process involved verifying claims, determining their value (often based on asset prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing in November 2022), and establishing a distribution hierarchy. Initial Timeline: The 1–3 business day window for the start of distributions suggests that the administrative and technical infrastructure for payout is ready. While distributing funds to a large number of creditors is a complex task, this initial timeframe provides a clear expectation for when the process will commence. Method of Payout: Creditors are typically being repaid based on the USD value of their holdings at the time of the bankruptcy filing. While some distributions might involve in-kind crypto where feasible and approved, a significant portion is expected to be in fiat currency or stablecoins, depending on the creditor’s preference and jurisdictional requirements. This helps manage volatility during the payout period. This phase follows extensive work, including asset sales, legal battles, and negotiations to consolidate assets and create a pool of funds for distribution. It’s a testament to the efforts of the bankruptcy administrators and legal teams involved. A Ray of Hope for FTX Creditors? For the thousands of individuals and institutions who had funds locked on FTX, this announcement is more than just a financial update; it’s a moment of potential relief. The past year and a half have been filled with uncertainty, frustration, and financial strain for many. The start of this major crypto payout offers a tangible outcome after a prolonged period of waiting. While the total recovery percentage for creditors is still subject to the final outcome of the bankruptcy process and asset liquidation, the fact that such a significant amount is being distributed in this phase is generally seen as a positive sign. Early estimates and market conditions (particularly the rise in value of some crypto assets held by FTX) have sometimes suggested a potentially higher recovery rate than is typical in large-scale bankruptcies, though this is not guaranteed for all claim types. This step helps to restore some faith in the process, demonstrating that even in the aftermath of a catastrophic failure like FTX, structured legal processes can yield results for affected parties. It moves the narrative from the collapse itself to the active resolution and restitution phase. Navigating the FTX Bankruptcy Update: What Should Creditors Do? With the distribution phase beginning, it’s crucial for FTX creditors to be informed and cautious. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed via Official Channels: Rely exclusively on official communications from the FTX bankruptcy administrators (like Kroll Restructuring Administration) or the court-appointed representatives. Be wary of unofficial sources, social media rumors, or direct messages claiming to facilitate your payout. Verify Your Payout Details: Ensure the payment method and destination you provided during the claims process are correct and up-to-date. If you need to update information, do so only through the official creditor portal or designated channels. Beware of Scams: Unfortunately, major events like this attract scammers. Be extremely cautious of any unsolicited contact (emails, texts, calls) asking for personal information, wallet keys, or fees to ‘expedite’ your FTX repayment. The administrators will not ask for this information via unofficial channels. Understand Your Claim Status: If you haven’t already, log into the official creditor portal to understand the status of your claim, the approved amount, and the expected method of distribution. Consult Financial/Legal Advisors: For complex claims or significant amounts, considering consulting with a financial advisor or legal counsel who specializes in bankruptcy recovery can be beneficial. Patience remains key, as distributing funds to a large number of creditors across various jurisdictions will take time, even after the initial phase begins. The 1–3 day window is for the *start* of the process, not necessarily the completion of all payouts. The Road Ahead for FTX Distribution and Resolution While the distribution of over $5 billion is a massive step, it’s important to remember that the FTX bankruptcy process is incredibly complex. There may be further phases of distribution as more assets are recovered or legal disputes are resolved. The administrators are tasked with maximizing recovery for all creditors, which can involve liquidating a diverse range of assets, from traditional investments to venture capital stakes and remaining crypto holdings. The successful execution of this phase will build confidence in the remaining steps of the resolution. It demonstrates the operational capability of the bankruptcy estate to handle large-scale financial movements and communicate progress to affected parties. The ultimate goal is to conclude the bankruptcy proceedings and provide as much restitution as possible to those who suffered losses. This FTX bankruptcy update is a critical turning point, shifting the focus from the failure of the exchange to the active process of making amends to those affected. While challenges remain, the commencement of this significant crypto payout is a positive development that offers tangible hope to the multitude of FTX creditors around the globe.

His stance directly opposes Mayor Adams, who is famous for his love of crypto. The division on the topic could be settled when the city heads to the polls, as both men are candidates for November’s mayoral election. Mayor Adams is running as an independent, and Lander is the Democratic candidate. Caught up with @NBCNewYork this morning to call out @andrewcuomo for his absurd attempts to rewrite history on his abysmal labor record. I fought DoorDash to deliver a $21 minimum wage, while Cuomo is taking $1M bribes to do their bidding. pic.twitter.com/zrdP5d8FpY — Brad Lander (@bradlander) May 28, 2025 Mayor Adams’ crypto plans may stall if he does not return to office Mayor Adams has been campaigning to make New York City a hub for crypto in the near future and has even set up an advisory council to that end. However, if he is unable to keep his seat as mayor, and a man who believes “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” takes over, there’s no telling what will happen to the things Mayor Adams sets in motion. Lander also believes that “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” Mayor Adams talked about his Bitbond proposal on Wednesday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, a speech that came a week after he hosted New York City’s inaugural crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion. At the event, he reiterated his pledge to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and announced the creation of a digital assets advisory council to “bring fintech jobs and investment right here to the Big Apple.” Lander called Mayor Adams’s proposal “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,” adding that “the current Federal Tax Law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs.” Lander does not buy the crypto hype While politicians like Adams, Francis Suarez, Cynthia Lummis, Andrew Yang, Tom Emmer, Pat Toomey, Ron DeSantis, and Kirsten Gillibrand have all taken a pro-crypto stance, others are either indecisive or suspicious of crypto. Aside from Lander, another famous critic of crypto is Elizabeth Warren . She is outspoken as a crypto critic and is famous for introducing the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023, which aimed to impose strict regulations on crypto transactions to curb illicit activities. She believes crypto is a “preferred tool” for terrorists, drug traffickers, and money launderers, and has made many other interesting claims. Warren’s stance on crypto is shared by Bernie Sanders and both of them have also worked together on regulations to restrict banks’ engagement with crypto, arguing it lacks “real public purpose” and primarily benefits speculators while causing financial losses for others. Sanders also supports measures to limit crypto’s environmental and economic impacts. These politicians who seem to be anti-crypto all share concerns about the industry’s volatility, potential for criminal use, environmental impact, and lack of consumer protections. Lander’s unenthusiastic response to Bitbonds reflects a cautious stance that aligns with broader Democratic skepticism about crypto’s stability and public utility. Landers and the other anti-crypto politicians have been pushing for stricter regulations in hopes that it will address perceived gaps in oversight, a concern Lander echoed in his critique of Bitbonds’ legal viability.

Recently, the TST Memecoin experienced a sharp reminder of this reality, undergoing a significant and sudden drop on major trading platforms, including Binance. This event underscores the inherent volatility and significant Cryptocurrency Risks associated with such speculative assets. What Triggered the TST Memecoin Crash? According to a report by Wu Blockchain shared on X, the Test (TST) memecoin saw a precipitous decline. Specifically, the token plummeted by a staggering 40% to a price point of $0.03456 across both the Binance spot and futures markets. This kind of rapid price movement is not uncommon in the memecoin space, but a 40% drop in a short period certainly grabs attention and causes concern among holders and traders involved in Binance Trading . While the exact catalyst for this specific drop wasn’t immediately clear from the initial report, memecoin crashes can be triggered by various factors: Whale Movements: Large holders selling off significant portions of their supply can overwhelm buy orders and drive prices down rapidly. Sentiment Shifts: Negative news, rumors, or a general shift in market sentiment away from speculative assets can lead to panic selling. Market-Wide Corrections: Sometimes, a memecoin crash is part of a broader downturn in the overall crypto market, driven by macroeconomic factors or regulatory news. Lack of Fundamentals: Memecoins often lack underlying technology or real-world use cases, making their value purely dependent on speculation and community hype. When that hype fades, the price can collapse. Understanding the Impact on Binance Trading The fact that the drop occurred on both Binance spot and futures markets is significant. The spot market reflects the immediate supply and demand for the asset, while the futures market allows traders to speculate on future price movements, often using leverage. A sharp drop like this affects traders in different ways: Spot Traders: Holders on the spot market see the value of their assets decrease directly. Futures Traders: Those with leveraged long positions (betting on the price going up) face potential liquidations, where their positions are automatically closed by the exchange because they can no longer cover potential losses. This can accelerate the price decline. Conversely, those with short positions (betting on the price going down) profit from the crash. The incident highlights the amplified risks involved in futures trading, especially with highly volatile assets like TST Memecoin . The potential for rapid and substantial losses is ever-present. Why Does Crypto Market Volatility Hit Memecoins Hardest? Crypto Market Volatility is a well-known characteristic of the entire digital asset space. However, memecoins often experience volatility to an extreme degree. Why is this the case? Unlike established cryptocurrencies with developed ecosystems or Bitcoin’s status as a digital store of value, memecoins derive their value primarily from community hype, social media trends, and speculative trading. This makes them incredibly susceptible to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. A viral tweet can send the price soaring, while a large sell-off or negative rumor can cause a rapid Memecoin Crash . Their low prices and high circulating supplies also mean that relatively small amounts of capital, compared to larger cap coins, can cause significant percentage swings in price. This low barrier to entry for price manipulation (intentional or unintentional) contributes to their extreme volatility. Navigating Cryptocurrency Risks in the Memecoin Space The TST incident serves as a stark reminder of the significant Cryptocurrency Risks present, particularly within the memecoin niche. For anyone considering or currently involved in trading these assets, understanding and mitigating these risks is paramount. Key Risks to Consider: Risk Type Description Impact on Memecoins Market Volatility Prices can change drastically and rapidly. Extreme price swings, potential for rapid crashes (like the TST Memecoin Crash ). Liquidity Risk Difficulty buying or selling large amounts without significantly affecting the price. Sudden large orders can cause disproportionate price drops or spikes. Rug Pulls/Scams Project developers abandon the project and steal funds. Complete loss of investment. High risk in unverified memecoins. Sentiment & Hype Driven Value based on social media trends and community excitement. Price is highly unstable and can collapse if hype disappears. Lack of Fundamentals No underlying technology, use case, or revenue stream. Value is purely speculative, making long-term holding risky. Actionable Insights for Traders on Binance (and Beyond) Given the inherent risks, especially with assets prone to a Memecoin Crash , what steps can traders take, particularly when engaging in Binance Trading or on other platforms? Strategies to Consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are investing in, even if it’s a memecoin. Look for community strength, developer activity (though often limited), and understand the tokenomics. Risk Management is Crucial: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Memecoins are highly speculative. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically sell your position if the price drops to a certain level, limiting potential losses during a sudden crash like the one seen with TST Memecoin . Avoid Excessive Leverage: While futures trading offers the potential for high returns, leverage magnifies losses during volatile swings. Be extremely cautious with leverage, especially on memecoins. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into one highly speculative asset. Spread your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies. Beware of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Don’t buy into a coin just because it’s pumping. You might be buying at the peak right before a crash. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources (like Wu Blockchain) and community sentiment, but verify information before acting on it. These strategies are not guarantees against losses, but they are essential tools for navigating the unpredictable landscape of Crypto Market Volatility and mitigating Cryptocurrency Risks . The Broader Picture: Crypto Market Volatility Remains While the TST specific event is noteworthy for its severity, it’s a symptom of the larger reality of the crypto market. Price swings of 10%, 20%, or even 40% in a day are not unheard of, especially further down the market cap ladder. This volatility is driven by a confluence of factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. Successful navigation of this environment requires a long-term perspective, robust risk management, and continuous learning. Summary: Lessons from the TST Memecoin Crash The recent 40% plummet of TST Memecoin on Binance serves as a potent case study in the extreme volatility and significant Cryptocurrency Risks inherent in the memecoin market. It highlights how quickly fortunes can change for those involved in Binance Trading of such assets. Understanding the factors contributing to a Memecoin Crash and implementing strict risk management strategies are vital for anyone venturing into this highly speculative corner of the crypto world. While the potential rewards can be high, the risks, as demonstrated by TST, are equally substantial.

At the same time, the Trump Coin is facing a retrace risk following its recent surge, fueled by hype.

Priced at $0.00000035 per token, investors receive 80% bonus tokens upon purchase. The Ethereum Price Sets Sights On $4,000 Amid Growing Bullish Momentum. Currently down 45.8% from its December 2024 peak of $4,000, the Ethereum price has arrived at a key resistance point. With limited historical barriers beyond this point, conditions appear favorable for the Ethereum price to move toward $4,000. A bullish continuation pattern is forming, hinting that another impulsive leg upward for the Ethereum price may be just around the corner. Crypto analyst Astronomer, in a lengthy post, emphasized the long-term inverse relationship between the Ethereum price and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). He noted that with the DXY dropping significantly, the Ethereum price is likely to range high, possibly reaching $4,000, calling the setup “flawless.” Trump Coin Faces Steep Decline As Retracement Threat Persists The Trump Coin surged in the lead-up to a fancy dinner hosted by President Donald Trump. Some investors spent nearly $150 million for access; however, prices dropped by 16% immediately after the event within hours. The Trump Coin reached a high of $16.50 before the May 23 black-tie gala but quickly fell back to $12.76 soon after. Technical charts show several large wallets sold a significant amount of the Trump coin right after the event. Crypto Analyst Kamil suggests that unless the Trump coin breaks above $15 again, a retracement risk remains high. Without a unique technology or use case, the Trump Coin value may struggle to hold its ground. As hype fades post-event, investors are moving on. Many are heading toward the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale for its long-term upside and the AI technology behind it.

This declaration isn’t just a statement; it signals a renewed focus on a contentious area of US trade policy that has significant implications beyond borders, potentially even rippling into financial markets watched closely by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Understanding the Trump Tariffs and the Trade Court Battle When we talk about Trump tariffs , we’re referring primarily to the duties imposed during his presidency under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (citing national security concerns, mainly on steel and aluminum imports) and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (in response to unfair trade practices, notably targeting China). These tariffs sparked significant opposition, leading to legal challenges in various courts, including the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The trade court battle involves complex legal arguments. Opponents argue that these tariffs were unlawfully imposed, exceeding presidential authority or violating procedural requirements. The government, under Trump, defended them as necessary measures to protect domestic industries and national security. The ongoing legal disputes center on the scope of presidential power under these trade statutes and whether the executive branch followed the correct legal procedures. Here’s a simplified look at the key legal fronts: Section 232 Cases: Challenges against tariffs on steel and aluminum, often arguing they weren’t truly based on national security or that the process was flawed. Section 301 Cases (China Tariffs): Lawsuits contending these tariffs were an unauthorized escalation of trade disputes beyond the scope of Section 301’s original intent or that the process lacked proper public notice and comment. Constitutional Challenges: Some cases touch upon the separation of powers, questioning whether Congress improperly delegated too much tariff authority to the President. Why is Winning the Court Battle So Crucial for Trump’s Political Strategy? Donald Trump’s political identity is heavily intertwined with his ‘America First’ economic agenda, where using tariffs as a tool for negotiation and protection was a centerpiece. Vowing to win the court battle isn’t just about the legal outcome; it’s a critical part of his ongoing political strategy . Securing legal victories would: Validate Past Actions: A court win would retroactively legitimize a core policy of his presidency, allowing him to claim vindication against critics who argued his tariffs were illegal or poorly implemented. Empower Future Policy: Winning sets potential precedents that could provide a stronger legal basis for implementing similar or expanded tariffs if he were to return to office. Reinforce Political Narrative: It aligns with his message of being a strong leader willing to fight for American workers and industries against foreign competition and perceived unfair practices. It’s a way to demonstrate resolve and commitment to his base. Maintain Leverage: While the specific cases might pertain to past actions, the legal principles at stake could influence the executive branch’s power regarding trade measures, impacting future negotiation leverage. This isn’t merely a legalistic stance; it’s a strategic move aimed at shaping public perception and solidifying his policy credentials ahead of potential future political endeavors. Challenges and Hurdles in the Trade Court Battle Despite Trump’s confident declaration, winning these legal challenges is far from guaranteed. The trade court battle presents significant challenges and legal hurdles: Legal Arguments Against Tariffs: The core of the opposition’s case often rests on challenging the statutory basis or the implementation process. For Section 232 tariffs, opponents question whether the national security justification was genuine or merely a pretext for economic protectionism, which is typically outside the scope of the act. For Section 301 tariffs, arguments often revolve around whether the actions taken directly addressed the ‘unfair practices’ identified and whether the process adhered to administrative law requirements, such as providing adequate opportunity for public input. Judicial Scrutiny: While courts often grant deference to the executive branch on matters of foreign policy and national security, this deference is not unlimited. Courts will examine whether the executive branch acted within the authority granted by Congress and followed the procedures mandated by law. Judges are tasked with interpreting complex trade statutes, and different panels of judges can arrive at different conclusions, leading to appeals and prolonged litigation. Precedent and Interpretation: Trade law is a specialized and often complex area. The outcome of these cases can depend heavily on how judges interpret specific phrases within decades-old statutes and how they apply existing legal precedents regarding executive power and administrative procedure. Novel arguments or interpretations could sway decisions. Winning requires successfully defending the administration’s interpretation of its authority and demonstrating that all legal procedures were correctly followed, a task made difficult by the complex and often controversial nature of the tariff decisions themselves. What is the Potential Economic Impact of the Tariff Court Outcomes? The outcome of the trade court battle carries potential implications for the economy. While specific impacts are debated among economists, here are some potential areas of influence: Certainty vs. Uncertainty: A definitive ruling, whether upholding or striking down the tariffs, could reduce uncertainty for businesses. If tariffs are upheld, companies that adjusted supply chains or absorbed costs might see the status quo confirmed. If struck down, it could lead to refunds of duties paid (potentially billions of dollars) and a reversal of trade flows, requiring new adjustments. Industry Competitiveness: Industries that benefited from tariff protection (like domestic steel and aluminum producers) could face renewed foreign competition if tariffs are removed. Industries that were harmed by retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports could see markets reopen. Consumer Costs and Inflation: Tariffs are taxes on imports, often leading to higher costs for consumers or businesses that use imported goods. Removing tariffs could potentially lower costs, while upholding them maintains this upward pressure on prices, contributing to inflationary concerns. Global Trade Relations: The legal outcome could influence the U.S.’s standing in global trade negotiations and its relationship with key trading partners. A ruling that limits presidential authority might necessitate a different approach to trade disputes in the future. For those watching the broader markets, including cryptocurrency, significant shifts in trade policy or large-scale refunds/impositions of duties could add to macroeconomic volatility, which sometimes correlates with movements in digital asset prices, although this link is indirect and complex. Exploring the Broader Implications for US Trade Policy The legal fight over Trump tariffs is more than just about past duties; it’s about the future of US trade policy . The court’s decisions will help define the boundaries of executive power in using tools like Section 232 and Section 301. Potential Outcomes and Their Effects: Tariffs Upheld: This would affirm broad presidential authority under these statutes, potentially making it easier for future administrations (including a potential second Trump term) to implement similar unilateral trade measures. Tariffs Struck Down: This would constrain presidential power, potentially forcing future administrations to rely more on congressional action or international trade bodies like the WTO (despite its current challenges) to address trade grievances. Mixed Rulings: Courts might uphold some tariffs while striking down others based on the specific legal arguments, leading to a more nuanced definition of executive trade authority. The outcome will be closely watched by trade partners, international organizations, and businesses worldwide, as it will signal how the U.S. government can and will likely use its trade levers in the years to come. This foundational aspect of economic interaction is a key factor in global stability, which in turn, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean? While this trade court battle might seem distant from the day-to-day world of cryptocurrency, understanding its potential ramifications offers valuable insights: Monitor Macro Trends: Pay attention to how major economic policy disputes like this progress. Outcomes could influence inflation, supply chain stability, and overall market sentiment – factors that can indirectly affect the crypto market. Understand Political Influence: Recognize that political strategies and legal battles over economic policy are interconnected. Trump’s vow highlights how trade remains a potent political tool, and its use can create volatility or shift economic landscapes. Diversification Awareness: The uncertainty generated by such high-stakes legal and political battles underscores the importance of understanding diverse market drivers and potentially considering diversification strategies, whether within crypto or across different asset classes (this is not financial advice, merely an observation on market dynamics). Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources covering trade law and economic policy. Understanding the potential legal precedents being set can provide context for future government actions impacting the economy. The declaration by Trump to win the court battle is a reminder that fundamental economic policies are still being shaped and challenged through legal and political means, with consequences that can extend into various facets of the financial world. Conclusion: The Stakes of the Tariff Court Battle Donald Trump’s pledge to secure victory in the ongoing legal challenges against his administration’s tariffs underscores the significant stakes involved. This isn’t just about past policies or collecting duties; it’s a pivotal trade court battle that will help define the future scope of presidential authority in setting US trade policy . The legal complexities, combined with the potential for substantial economic impact on industries, consumers, and global trade relations, make this a closely watched issue. For Trump, winning is also a crucial element of his ongoing political strategy , aiming to validate his ‘America First’ approach and position himself for future influence. While the direct link to cryptocurrency might seem tenuous, the broader implications for economic stability, market volatility, and the global political landscape are factors that informed participants in any market, including digital assets, should consider. The outcome of these legal battles will contribute to the complex web of forces shaping the economic environment for years to come.

For industry participants, the lack of a defined framework has created uncertainty and hindered innovation. However, a recent development on Capitol Hill is sparking optimism, particularly within companies navigating this complex landscape. Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at Ripple, has voiced strong support for a newly introduced bill, signaling a potentially pivotal moment for Crypto Clarity in the United States. Why the CLARITY Act is a Potential Game Changer for US Crypto Regulation On X (formerly Twitter), Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty lauded the introduction of the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , commonly referred to as the CLARITY Act , in the U.S. Congress. He described the bill as a significant stride towards establishing comprehensive rules for digital assets in the country. His sentiment, “Clarity shouldn’t be controversial — and this bill moves us closer to a smart, workable framework,” encapsulates the industry’s deep-seated desire for regulatory certainty. But what exactly is the CLARITY Act and why is it being hailed as such a crucial step forward? At its core, the bill aims to provide much-needed definitions and guidelines for digital assets, particularly concerning the distinction between a commodity and a security. This has been a major point of contention and the source of significant regulatory confusion, leading to enforcement actions and uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Here are some key areas the CLARITY Act seeks to address: Defining Digital Assets: Establishing clear legal definitions for different types of digital assets. Regulatory Jurisdiction: Providing clarity on which regulatory body (like the SEC or CFTC) has oversight over specific digital asset activities. Market Structure: Offering guidance on how digital asset markets should operate under U.S. law. How Does the CLARITY Act Address Industry Concerns? The existing regulatory environment in the U.S. for cryptocurrencies has often been criticized for being fragmented and relying on enforcement actions rather than clear rules. This has led to what many perceive as regulation by enforcement, making it difficult for companies to innovate and operate with confidence. For a company like Ripple , which has been embroiled in a high-profile legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of its XRP token, the call for clarity is particularly resonant. Stuart Alderoty’s comments reflect the industry’s frustration with the current state and its hope that legislative action can provide a more predictable path forward. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act aims to provide a framework that could potentially: Reduce regulatory uncertainty for businesses operating in the digital asset space. Foster innovation by providing clear rules of the road. Offer greater protection for consumers and investors by establishing clear market standards. What Are the Challenges and the Path Ahead for Crypto Clarity? While the introduction of the CLARITY Act is undoubtedly a positive development and a significant step towards comprehensive US crypto regulation , the legislative process is often lengthy and complex. The bill will need to gain traction, navigate committee reviews, and secure votes in both the House and the Senate before potentially becoming law. Furthermore, achieving true Crypto Clarity will likely require ongoing dialogue and collaboration between lawmakers, regulators, and industry participants. Different stakeholders may have varying perspectives on how digital assets should be regulated, and finding a consensus can be challenging. Stuart Alderoty’s statement highlights the importance of this legislative effort but also implicitly acknowledges that it is just one piece of the puzzle. The industry will be watching closely to see how the bill progresses and whether it can indeed deliver the smart, workable framework that is desperately needed. In conclusion, the introduction of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , championed by figures like Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty, represents a beacon of hope for those seeking a more defined and predictable regulatory landscape in the United States. While challenges remain, the bipartisan effort signifies a growing recognition in Congress of the need for legislative action to bring much-needed Crypto Clarity to the digital asset market. It is a crucial step that could pave the way for greater innovation, investor protection, and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies under a clearer regulatory umbrella.

At its current entry price of just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI is attracting comparisons to Ripple’s early days, when low-priced tokens with practical applications had the scope to dominate the market. With analysts projecting its value could hit $1 by Q4 2025, this fledgling token is offering a potential 100x return for investors eager to get in early. But what sets Ruvi AI apart, and could this truly be the next crypto giant? What makes Ruvi AI stand out? Unlike many cryptocurrencies driven by hype, Ruvi AI is rooted in real-world utility. The token leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to solve problems across industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. While Ripple gained recognition for revolutionizing cross-border payments, Ruvi AI aims to bring similar transformation to its chosen fields. Its practical applications include: Healthcare: Automating diagnostics, enhancing operational efficiency, and reducing costs. Logistics: Optimizing supply chain networks by identifying bottlenecks and improving performance. Finance: Strengthening fraud detection and boosting transactional security through AI-driven solutions.

Strategic partnerships strengthen Ruvi AI’s prospects Ruvi AI recently announced a collaborative partnership with Weex Exchange, a significant step in its roadmap. This partnership bolsters its visibility and enhances trading accessibility, making it easier for new and seasoned investors to trade Ruvi AI tokens. Strategic alliances like this echo Ripple’s early successes with institutional partnerships that cemented its credibility and fueled adoption. Weex Exchange’s robust trading ecosystem allows Ruvi AI to expand its market reach while offering investors a seamless trading experience. Such a partnership not only ensures liquidity and stability but also reinforces Ruvi AI’s commitment to strategic growth. Ripple vs Ruvi AI: how they compare Ripple made headlines in its early days for introducing a blockchain solution that simplified international transactions, gaining adoption across banks and financial institutions. Ruvi AI echoes this sentiment by addressing inefficiencies across crucial sectors like healthcare and logistics, where the need for intelligent automation is growing more urgent. However, while Ripple eventually faced legal and regulatory hurdles, Ruvi AI operates in a landscape shaped by lessons learned from its predecessors. Its emphasis on compliance, utility, and functionality positions it as a strong contender to avoid similar pitfalls. Boosting returns with VIP investment tiers Ruvi AI isn’t just making waves with its utility and partnerships. Its VIP investment options are attracting numerous investors eager to maximize their returns. These tiers provide lucrative bonuses designed to reward early participants. Here’s how they work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens = 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07/token = $4,900. Value at $1/token = $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens = 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07/token = $15,680. Value at $1/token = $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens = 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07/token = $89,600. Value at $1/token = $1,280,000. For investors seeking exponential returns, these options create a clear incentive to back Ruvi AI early in its lifecycle. Is Ruvi AI the next big thing? Cryptocurrencies with low entry points and tangible use cases often generate long-term success, provided they can back up their potential with real outcomes. Ruvi AI combines the accessibility of an affordable token with the strategic vision of a technology designed for impactful applications. Its collaboration with Weex Exchange, robust presale performance, and projected valuation of $1 by Q4 2025 make it one of the most talked-about tokens today. Ripple’s meteoric rise stemmed from its early focus on streamlining finance. Similarly, Ruvi AI’s focus on solving inefficiencies across multiple industries positions it for comparable, if not greater, success. Final thoughts At just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI offers an opportunity that’s hard to ignore. Drawing comparisons to Ripple’s early days is not just a testament to its potential but also its readiness to redefine how modern industries utilize AI and blockchain. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, Ruvi AI’s commitment to utility, innovation, and strategic growth makes it a compelling case for the future.

Add in the exciting Buyer Battles, where top contributors are rewarded daily, and it’s clear why BlockDAG is being talked about as a 10,000x opportunity. This is more than just a presale, it’s a race. Why BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Are a Game Changer BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles add a new layer of excitement to the presale experience. Instead of simply buying coins, participants are ranked daily based on how much BDAG they accumulate, with the leaderboard resetting every 24 hours, and the top buyer of the day gets any unsold amount of a 150 million BDAG daily pool.

This comes just as the analyst predicted that the altcoin could hit a $1.5 trillion market. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $22 As Bullish Candle Forms In an X post, Egrag Crypto predicted that candle 13 on the yearly chart could be the breakout candle that sends the XRP price to $13 or $22. He also raised the possibility of the altcoin surging above these price levels, with a wick extending even higher. Based on his analysis of Candle 9, the 2021 yearly candle, the analyst noted that Candle 13 points to a target of around $17. Related Reading: XRP Holds Midline Support That Has Led To Breakout In The Past, Why $2.9 Could Be Next Egrag Crypto remarked that this aligns perfectly between $13 and $22 for the XRP price. He also commented on Candle 12, noting that it was the strongest Bullish Engulfing pattern. This engulfing process started from Candle 5 and continued through Candle 11. The analyst added that the body of these candles closed above all previous candles, which is a “classic bullish sign.” It is even more bullish when it occurs on a yearly or 12-month chart, as in this case. Commenting on the current XRP price action, Egrag Crypto stated that the noise is still loud on the high timeframes. He noted that the body of Candle 13 is above $1.85, and the wick extends up to around $3.40. The analyst claimed that a close below $1.85 could mark the end of the bull run, while a close above $3.40 confirms that XRP is heading to double digits. Interestingly, the crypto analyst declared that December 31 this year will be a date to remember in XRP history. He remarked that market participants will see where the XRP price stands and what kind of candle formations are shaping up for the legendary year. XRP At A Critical Level In an X post, Crypto analyst CasiTrades noted that the XRP price has returned to the $2.25 range, which is one of the most important levels on the chart. She stated that this zone has acted as both resistance and support since the $0.50 breakout, and now a proper backtest is underway. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Could Shoot To $12 Soon The analyst revealed that the smaller timeframes show that this level could hold. However, she warned that higher-timeframe confirmation is key and that the XRP price needs daily closes above $2.25 to confirm a bullish pivot. CasiTrades added that whether or not this is the final pivot, this level remains a high-probability zone for buyers. She noted that the next major support is at $1.90 if this $2.25 support fails. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.21, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Cardano Eyes a Rally & Tron Trends Upward,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-presale-hits-8-2-million-cardano-eyes-a-rally-tron-trends-upward/,"Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Unstaked each offer a different path for crypto utility, and all three are showing potential heading into 2025. TRX’s current price activity remains steady, holding above $0.20. If the resistance barriers near $0.30 and $0.45 are cleared, there’s a path toward $0.73 that analysts are beginning to take seriously. Cardano’s recent 20% push to $0.74 has brought it back into the spotlight despite recent community issues. But Unstaked , the AI-focused project priced under a cent, has already started showing real traction. Now in stage 17 of its presale, priced at $0.01043, and projecting a launch price of $0.1819, it could deliver a 2,700% return for early participants. TRON’s Stablecoin Progress Raises Eyes Toward $0.73 Goal TRON (TRX) has maintained strong momentum by staying above the $0.20 range, and some market watchers suggest that a climb toward $0.73 is possible if it can push past the hurdles at $0.30 and $0.45. TRON’s increasing use in DApps and its fast-speed infrastructure have made it attractive for those following scalable networks. Consistent growth in developer interest and active users on TRON helps strengthen this outlook. Still, success depends on TRX breaking through technical resistance. For those following projects with steady user adoption and network development, TRON remains in focus as the market moves toward 2025. ADA’s Price Targets Take Shape Despite Community Tensions ADA’s rebound to $0.74, following a notable 20% climb, has stirred fresh speculation about its ability to rise to $2.80. Experts point to $0.85 as the next key resistance, and if that’s surpassed, the possibility of further gains becomes real. Much of this optimism is based on Cardano’s consistent focus on research-backed growth and development. However, allegations linked to a $600 million ADA issue, though denied by founder Charles Hoskinson, have caused some uncertainty. Still, ADA’s stability and technical strength keep it in the conversation as a contender for higher returns. Unstaked: Growing Fast, Still Below a Cent, With AI Agents Coming After Launch Unstaked is building a platform meant to support creators and marketers in growing their reach using AI. Users will be able to design their own AI agents to manage engagement across platforms like Telegram, X, and Discord. These agents will post, respond, adapt, and improve based on data in real time. As confirmed in its whitepaper, the agents will go live after the presale ends and the platform launches. Now in stage 17, Unstaked is priced at $0.01043, with an expected listing price of $0.1819. This creates a projected return of 2,700%. With $8.2 million already raised, the platform is gaining attention rapidly. What makes Unstaked stand apart is how directly it connects its features with user benefits. Access to automation tools and platform utilities is linked to ownership, offering creators a powerful edge. As more digital brands look for faster ways to grow and stand out, Unstaked is becoming one of the most practical plays in Web3. At under a cent, this price range might not last much longer. Final Takeaway! TRON is showing strong technical structure, and Cardano continues to push upward through mixed sentiment. Both are advancing, but Unstaked brings something fresh: a product ecosystem about to go live. The crypto presale price is still just $0.01043, with a target launch price of $0.1819 and over $8.2 million already raised. With its unique AI angle and post-launch agent rollout, Unstaked is positioning itself as a serious contender for big gains in 2025. While TRX and ADA navigate the broader market, Unstaked is moving forward with clear momentum.

Recent market reports show structural optimism returning across the crypto sector, with macro players forecasting bullish patterns not just for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for platforms with deep real-world functionality. While VeChain focuses on supply-chain impact and Hedera inches closer to becoming a top Ethereum alternative, a lesser-known name— Qubetics —has shocked the market by surpassing 514 million $TICS tokens sold and $17.5 million raised in its ongoing presale. It’s this emerging trio that many are now calling the most potential crypto lineup of the quarter. And while Hedera’s HBAR is getting serious attention thanks to unique technical upside projections, and VeChain strengthens partnerships across logistics and ESG, Qubetics introduces a modular infrastructure with an on-chain tokenization marketplace that may reshape how physical and digital assets get exchanged in Web3. Each of these projects is riding its own wave of traction—whether technical, institutional, or community-driven—offering completely different angles for what the most potential crypto could actually look like in a complex 2025 market. So what sets Qubetics apart? Why does its presale price rise by 10% every single Sunday? And how exactly are Hedera and VeChain leveraging their latest expansions? Let’s break down the details. Qubetics Builds a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace That Solves What Others Couldn’t Qubetics isn’t another generic altcoin. It’s Web3’s first fully integrated aggregator, uniting the functionality of several top blockchains into one interoperable hub. But what truly defines its application is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace—a cross-chain protocol that enables real estate, commodities, luxury goods, and even private equity shares to be securely tokenized, bought, and sold. That alone is making it stand out as a most potential crypto candidate among seasoned market watchers. Imagine a small real estate firm in Miami. With Qubetics, they can tokenize fractional ownership of properties and offer them to global participants without involving centralized intermediaries. Or consider a collectibles startup in Los Angeles that wants to create transparent, tamper-proof NFT records tied to physical luxury watches. Qubetics provides the infrastructure to bridge those assets with on-chain smart contracts across Solana, Polygon, and Ethereum—all within one dashboard. That’s not theoretical. That’s what the Qubetics ecosystem is built for. With tokenized assets becoming a high-demand vertical for both retail and institutional participants, Qubetics’ use case aligns perfectly with the next chapter of Web3. It takes what traditional platforms promised—but couldn’t scale—and gives it frictionless, audited functionality. That alone gives $TICS the kind of narrative momentum typically seen in projects that later end up among the most potential crypto leaders of the cycle. Qubetics Presale Stats and ROI Forecasts Signal Why It May Be the Most Potential Crypto Now Right now, the Qubetics presale is in its 36th stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.3064. Over 27,300 participants have joined the Qubetics presale, pushing the total raise past $17.5 million and confirming demand through the sale of more than 514 million tokens. What makes this even more exciting for early adopters is that every presale stage lasts just 7 days, and price jumps by 10% at midnight every Sunday, creating a clear incentive structure for early entries. And here’s where the ROI math gets compelling. If $TICS hits just $1 after the presale, that’s a 226.32% return. But analysts are looking far beyond that, projecting scenarios where Qubetics reaches $5 to $15 following its Q2 2025 mainnet launch. If $TICS reaches $5, the ROI becomes 1,531.58%. At $10, returns expand to 3,163.16%, and a $15 milestone would deliver an eye-watering 4,794.74% ROI. Consider a simple $100 buy-in right now. At a $15 post-launch price, that same $100 would turn into $4,894.74—and the momentum suggests that possibility isn’t far-fetched. It’s this kind of structured growth opportunity that has community members dubbing it the best crypto pre sale of 2025. And with 10% weekly jumps, missing a Sunday could mean missing a major discount. Hedera Forecasts a Faster 5x Growth Than Ethereum In a detailed analysis published by Brave New Coin, Hedera’s native token HBAR is forecasted to grow 5x faster than Ethereum based on its efficient consensus model, sustainability, and active enterprise-grade integrations. Unlike typical proof-of-work platforms, Hedera utilizes the hashgraph consensus mechanism, which dramatically boosts speed and scalability while keeping costs low. That alone has drawn interest from institutions tired of ETH gas fees and throughput bottlenecks. One of the key signals in the report is Hedera’s institutional alignment. It is governed by a council that includes tech giants like Google, IBM, LG, and Boeing, ensuring both trust and innovation at the enterprise level. With over 33 council members and consistent mainnet transaction growth, Hedera’s infrastructure supports high-value apps in DeFi, gaming, and carbon offset markets. From a technical standpoint, HBAR’s fundamentals and adoption metrics suggest an exponential curve, especially as the market prepares for a post-Ethereum-scaling era. These factors combine to place Hedera as not just a competitor—but potentially one of the most potential crypto projects if its growth continues at this pace. VeChain Boosts Enterprise Ecosystem With X Node Upgrade In a recent update published by Binance Square, VeChain’s foundation has activated new X Node benefits to incentivize long-term participation and expand enterprise use. This strategic change increases node rewards and unlocks new staking options, directly targeting the network’s most active backers. These upgrades come as VeChain’s roadmap aligns deeper with real-world enterprise logistics, ESG tracking, and carbon footprint transparency. What makes this interesting is the dual-token economy of VeChain—VET for value transfer and VTHO for gas—which is being optimized through ecosystem upgrades to enhance scalability and reduce congestion. Additionally, with partnerships across the automotive, food safety, and logistics industries, VeChain is being looked at by stakeholders in Europe and Asia as a compliance-ready solution for blockchain-based supply chain traceability. From a tokenomics and corporate engagement standpoint, VeChain’s current positioning is more mature than many altcoins in its tier. And with structural upgrades and governance improvements underway, VET is re-entering expert watchlists as a most potential crypto—especially among ESG-conscious communities and real-world business platforms. Why These 3 May Be the Most Potential Crypto Trio to Watch This Quarter In a market that’s regaining its footing, these three projects represent a powerful blend of innovation and execution. Qubetics is bringing real-world asset tokenization to the forefront while climbing its presale ladder with clear ROI modeling and strong momentum. Hedera, backed by elite corporate nodes, is forecasted to outpace Ethereum in speed and efficiency, which could trigger a large-scale narrative shift. VeChain, meanwhile, is tapping into the tangible enterprise world, reinforcing its supply chain relevance while rolling out strategic upgrades. Together, they’re not just riding hype—they’re anchoring real-world utility to the blockchain promise. And that’s why Qubetics, VeChain, and Hedera are currently regarded among the most potential crypto opportunities on the table. Whether you’re searching for the top crypto presale , an enterprise-driven protocol, or a green, scalable layer-1, this lineup covers all bases. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the most potential crypto in 2025? Qubetics, Hedera, and VeChain are considered the most potential crypto projects due to their real-world applications, presale growth, and enterprise-grade infrastructure. How much can $100 grow in Qubetics presale? At a $15 post-launch price, a $100 investment in Qubetics presale could grow to $4,894.74 based on current ROI projections. Why is Qubetics called the best crypto pre sale? Due to weekly 10% price hikes, strong real-world applications, and over $17.5M raised, many participants call Qubetics the best crypto pre sale opportunity of the year.

Yet as the court weighs its options, new artificial intelligence rivals may already be chipping away at Google’s dominance faster than any judge’s ruling could take effect. A key issue at trial has been the rise of AI tools that appear to be eroding Google’s lead in the search engine game. Mehta is set to hear final arguments this Friday from the Justice Department and Google on remedies meant to boost competition in search. His ultimate decision could also shape how AI services gain ground in the search market. The Justice Department, which sued Google in 2020, wants sweeping changes. It has urged the court to force the company to sell its Chrome browser, restrict it from paying Apple to remain the default search engine, and require it to share its search data with competitors. Regulators say these strong steps are justified by a legal benchmark set more than 20 years ago, when the government attempted to break up Microsoft. “All three of the DOJ’s major remedies are aimed at helping generative AI providers take share from Google,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at TD Cowen. Mehta has indicated he plans to issue his ruling in August The search engine giant counters that the government’s proposed fixes go too far and would cause irreparable damage to its business. Holding about 90% market share of online search queries in the U.S., the company has suggested a narrower approach: tweak its agreements with Apple, Mozilla, and Android to carve out space for rivals. The tech firm says it will appeal the judge’s ruling. Each year, the company pays roughly $20 billion to Apple for default placement in Apple’s Safari browser. Any change to that arrangement could erase billions from Apple’s profits. Mehta is weighing whether to stop Google from sharing revenue with Apple under the current deal, which could change how Google is embedded in the Safari browser. Lawyers and experts warn that his decision may also influence future contracts among tech giants over how AI features are featured on their platforms. The Justice Department is against Google paying Samsung and Motorola to pre-install Gemini In court, the Justice Department pointed to Google’s more recent efforts to dominate AI-driven search. According to testimony, Google has begun paying Samsung and Motorola to pre-install its new AI system, Gemini, on their devices. The department argues that this practice aims to capture the next wave of internet search and should be banned. Shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, fell sharply this month after an Apple executive testified that Google searches in Safari had declined for the first time in nearly twenty years. The same executive said Apple plans to offer AI options such as ChatGPT or Perplexity in Safari within the following year. Google responded in a blog post, saying that overall searches for Apple devices and services have actually risen. “A formidable question that hovers over the entire proceeding is how should the judge take account of emerging developments and the technology that affect the fortunes of all of these companies,” said William Kovacic, a professor of antitrust law at George Washington University and former FTC chairman. During the trial, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, testified that Google aims to finalize a distribution agreement with Apple by midyear. Under that deal, Apple would tap Google’s own AI model and chatbot, Gemini, to answer user queries—an option Apple already offers using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Last week, Google announced the U.S. launch of “AI Mode,” a new way to respond to searches with conversational answers rather than the familiar list of blue links. It represents the biggest overhaul of its search engine in years and is powered by Gemini. Google has been steadily improving Gemini , which supports AI Mode and other features across its products. Although Gemini’s user base has grown in recent months, it still trails ChatGPT in popularity.

Speaking at a U.S. Steel facility in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, Trump told an applauding crowd of employees that he had a “major announcement.” He said the higher tariff would “secure the steel industry in the United States” and warned that no one would be able to “get around that” new tariff rate. “We are going to be imposing a 25% increase,” Trump explained. “We’re going to bring it from 25% to 50%, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States. Nobody’s going to get around that.” He added that he had considered setting the rate at 40%, but industry leaders persuaded him to go further. “At 25% they can sorta get over that fence,” Trump said. “At 50% nobody’s getting over that fence.” Trump’s move builds on the sweeping tariffs he first imposed on March 12, when he set a 25% tax on all steel imports and a 10% levy on aluminum. At the time, Canada responded with its own duties, and American auto makers warned of higher costs. The European Union also announced countermeasures, which it later dropped. On Friday, Trump praised those original measures, claiming they saved the U.S. steel sector from collapse. He said that without the first round of tariffs, “all steel would have been foreign-made and factories would have closed.” Analysts warn that steel prices may increase due to the tariffs Still, analysts warn that higher levies could push up prices for steel, a critical material in construction and manufacturing, two industries Trump has said he wants to strengthen. Since March, the price of domestically produced steel has climbed, as American mills no longer face as much competition from abroad. A 2023 report by the International Trade Commission looked back to when Trump applied steel tariffs in 2018, finding that U.S. steel output did rise, but costs climbed for cars, tools, and machines. Those higher expenses cut production in affected industries by more than $3 billion in 2021, the agency said. Trump is using a law known as Section 232, which lets the president impose tariffs on imports deemed a threat to national security. Last year, the U.S. bought $31.3 billion worth of iron and steel. Canada topped the list at $7.6 billion, according to Commerce Department figures. Later in his remarks, Trump turned to another issue: the sale of U.S. Steel to Japan’s Nippon Steel. During his 2024 campaign, he had opposed the deal, and President Joe Biden had blocked it, citing security concerns. But Trump said he came to believe Nippon could save the company and keep jobs in America. “U.S. Steel was being sold into foreign hands with no protections for our great steel workers,” he said. “And I said there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen. I was watching over you.” But he added that Nippon and U.S. Steel leaders kept improving the terms. “They kept asking me and I kept rejecting them: No way, no way, no way,” he said. “Every time they came in, the deal got better and better and better for the workers.” A key change was a so-called golden share that gives the U.S. government a say in company decisions. “I’m going to be in Washington; I’m gonna be watching over it,” Trump promised.

He invited several employees onstage, and they spoke about the challenges the industry had faced. They thanked him for his actions. “This is going to be a very big day,” Trump told the workers. “This is going to be one of the biggest days in your life.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-30 23:59:56

Crypto Liquidations Have Surpassed $712 Million Over The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, chaos has occurred on the derivatives market following the volatility Bitcoin and the company have gone through during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet Below is a table that shows how the liquidations have looked for the cryptocurrency sector within this window. As is visible, almost $712 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure from their platform in the past day. About $477 million of these came during the last twelve hours alone. Bitcoin and the altcoins, especially, have seen a decline in this period, so it’s not surprising to see that the liquidations have overwhelmingly affected the long investors. More specifically, the holders betting on a bullish outcome have been involved in more than 90% of the flush. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze, and given the sharp imbalance toward the bulls, this particular event would be called a long squeeze. During a squeeze, a large amount of liquidations get triggered at once and feed back into the move that caused them. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations, making such events quite volatile. As for which of the individual tokens contributed the most to the long squeeze, the heatmap below shows it. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, have also come out on top in this list, with the former observing liquidations of $221 million and the latter that of $116 million. The third-ranked coin, however, hasn’t been XRP, but rather Solana, which is a couple of spots lower in terms of market cap. SOL’s $32 million in liquidations may be down to the fact that it has seen a larger decline than XRP. While Bitcoin has seen a push down during the past day, its downfall actually started much earlier, with the high around $112,000 from May 22nd acting as the top so far. According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this peak coincided with a spike in whale activity. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which tells us about how many whale-sized transfers are occurring on the BTC network every day.

It would appear that both versions of this metric (tracking transactions valued at more than $100,000 and $1 million) surged to a high level earlier in this month, a potential sign that profit-taking from these humongous entities forced Bitcoin toward a top. Bitcoin Price BTC saw a dip under the $105,000 level earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has since observed a small rebound as it’s now back at $105,800.

Data-breach hunter Jeremiah Fowler says he found an unprotected database of exactly 184,162,718 login records across more than 47 gigabytes of data. Fowler says a small sample of records he analyzed contained 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. The trove of data also includes Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, X, WordPress, Yahoo, and many other types of login info, reports Wired , adding that all of the data in its entirety has now been taken down. With the scope of information that was exposed, Fowler says the victims are now vulnerable to several kinds of attacks, including corporate espionage, phishing and social engineering, account takeovers, and more. He also mentions that government entities appeared to be included in the hack. “I saw numerous .gov accounts from countries around the world. These could be a serious potential risk if any of those compromised accounts had security clearance to sensitive areas of the state networks or data.” The exact origins of the database are unknown, but Fowler notes that the password field was labeled as “Senha,” which is “password” in Portuguese. Fowler says he believes it’s “highly possible” that a cybercriminal is to blame, calling it by far the most reasonable explanation for the massive collection of login data. According to Fowler, the length of time that the data was exposed and whether anyone else accessed the files remains unknown.

Rather than opting for a 19b-4 process for traditional ETF filings, REX Shares chose the 40-Act filing under the Investment Company Act 1940. This structure circumvents the protracted job of obtaining regulatory approval from the SEC and should expedite the launch in the market. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared this news on social media and confirmed the details about REXShares’ filing. BIG NEWS: @REXShares just filed an effective prospectus for Solana and Ethereum staking ETFs to list here in the US. Don’t know launch date but could be within the next few weeks. These are 40-act funds with a unique structure and do not go through the 19b-4 process pic.twitter.com/cqUCWlFAZW — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 30, 2025 The move is a major development in the growth of cryptocurrency investment products in the United States. Rex Shares uses C-Corp and Cayman subsidiaries to speed ETH & SOL staking ETFs Each fund will utilize a C-corporation structure, a rare choice in the ETF industry, to facilitate participation in staking activities while adhering to regulatory standards. The funds will gain exposure to ETH and SOL through wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiaries that will acquire and stake the cryptocurrencies. The launch date is uncertain, but Seyffart says these ETFs could be added within the next few weeks. Today’s filing comes in the wake of the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, having recently affirmed that staking through a PoS-based network is not considered securities. Commenting further on the Rex Shares filing, James Seyffart noted that it was a smart move “As you can see in screenshot above. They will be getting their spot exposure to ETH and SOL via Cayman subsidiaries. All of this, assuming they launch in near future, is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory work-arounds to get these products to market,” he said in the X post. SEC delays on spot crypto ETFs push Rex Shares to take alternative route Rex Shares opting for this not-so-traveled path is likely an indirect result of the United States not approving any crypto spot ETFs to date. The SEC recently delayed decisions on Grayscale’s Avalanche and Cardano spot ETF applications. This halt affects Grayscale’s work to transform its Avalanche Trust into a spot ETF and a similar application for Cardano. The SEC began the 240-day statutory review period of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF proposal in February, and expectations remained high as the deadline neared. Prediction markets like Polymarket put the odds at about 71%, suggesting investors were highly optimistic. However, the anticipation would be dampened by the delay. The SEC has also reopened comments to elicit feedback from the public, therefore continuing to assess both regulatory and market impact considerations. In related news, the SEC moved WisdomTree’s XRP spot ETF proposal to the next stage in the review process. The solicitation of comments is requested through public notice regarding investor protection and potential market manipulation concerns. This proposal is made pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B), which shows that continued review is appropriate. It would be one of the first spot XRP ETFs approved in the US if passed. Nasdaq has also filed a Form 19b-4 to list and trade shares of the 21Shares Sui ETF on its exchange, representing the launch of the initial regulatory review period. This comes after 21Shares filed an earlier S-1, signaling its interest in providing institutional exposure to the SUI token. Meanwhile, SUI — the native asset of the Sui network — saw a mere 2% price bump following the filing news. But it currently trades around $3.32, a drop of roughly 6.9% in keeping with the broader market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Cross River Bank reportedly holds all bank accounts associated with the payment system. The Good news for the XRP community is that Cross River Bank has been a Ripple partner since 2014, providing real-time international payments. This connection was brought to the community’s attention by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a prominent crypto proponent on X, who highlighted the bank’s role in the development of X-Money. JUST IN: ELON MUSK TO LAUNCH 𝕏-MONEY WITH ALL BANK ACCOUNTS HELD BY CROSS RIVER BANK! CROSS RIVER BANK ALREADY INTEGRATED RIPPLE FOR REAL-TIME INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS! #XRP X MONEY https://t.co/6NaoNRfdSU pic.twitter.com/IMz61LvRYT — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 30, 2025 Musk has recently confirmed that a limited-access beta version of the payment system will launch soon. For many in the XRP community, this is a significant moment, as they have long advocated for XRP to be used in Musk’s financial platforms. The presence of Ripple-enabled banking infrastructure at the core of X-Money’s backend raises new questions about the possibility of XRP becoming a part of the global payments functionality Musk is building. Ripple’s Relationship With Cross River Bank Ripple’s collaboration with Cross River Bank began in September 2014, when the bank announced its adoption of the Ripple protocol to offer real-time international payments. According to a blog post published by Ripple, Cross River Bank became one of the first U.S. banks to integrate the Ripple network. The goal was to provide instant, secure, and compliant cross-border transactions, particularly between the United States and Western Europe. Many experts believe XRP can lead an instant payment revolution , and this partnership shows the asset’s potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Will Musk Integrate XRP? Ripple technology enables financial institutions to send funds in any currency in real time, without the need for reserve funding. It is built to provide a fast, low-cost, and secure settlement layer that complies with regulatory standards. Suppose Cross River Bank is serving as the foundational banking partner for X-Money. In that case, this creates a clear pathway for Ripple technology, particularly XRP, to become part of the broader payment architecture on X. Recent rumors suggest that Musk will integrate XRP into the new payment system. Although the billionaire has not confirmed these rumors, the infrastructure is likely in place to make it happen without requiring major changes. Grok, Musk’s AI-powered chatbot, has named XRP as the best asset for cross-border payments . Meanwhile, Ripple’s enterprise-grade systems have already proven with Cross River Bank. The conditions for potential XRP use in X-Money are aligned, and if Musk approves this integration, it could change the digital asset landscape.

Lander warned that using volatile crypto assets to fund infrastructure and housing projects could undermine investor confidence in the city’s debt. Political tensions escalate as Lander (a mayoral candidate) positions himself as a fiscal pragmatist against Adams’s crypto-friendly agenda. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander has rejected Mayor Eric Adams’s proposal to issue municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin, calling the idea both “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” Lander, who shares responsibility for the city’s debt issuance alongside the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, made clear that the city will not pursue any crypto-backed borrowing while he remains in office. Bitbond Battle Brews in NYC as Election Rivals Clash Over Crypto Policy Lander said in a statement on Thursday that “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” according to a report by Bloomberg. He added, “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander opposed Mayor Eric Adams’s proposed Bitcoin-backed municipal bond (Bitbond) plan, calling the idea “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” He noted that under U.S. tax law, municipal bonds cannot be used to purchase cryptocurrencies or… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 The response follows remarks made by Mayor Adams on Wednesday during his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . Addressing a crowd of crypto enthusiasts, Adams called for the creation of a “Bitbond,” expressing his intention to make New York a national leader in crypto innovation. “We need to have a Bitbond, and I’m going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York,” Adams said. “If it grows in New York, it will cascade through the entire country.” The mayor’s comments come just a week after he hosted the city’s first crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion . There, he unveiled a digital assets advisory council designed to boost fintech investment and job creation in the city. But Lander pushed back hard on the idea. He pointed to legal and regulatory constraints that limit how municipal bonds can be issued and used. According to him, the city can only issue debt for specific public purposes and must do so in compliance with federal tax law. “The current federal tax law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs,” Lander said. He also emphasized that the city does not have any system in place to handle infrastructure financing in cryptocurrencies or to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars. Adams, who is seeking re-election this November as an independent, did not respond to requests for comment. Lander, a Democrat and a candidate for mayor himself, made clear that under his watch, Bitcoin-backed bonds won’t be part of the city’s fiscal strategy. With both candidates positioning themselves for November, the clash over crypto policy could become a defining issue in the race. Mayor Echoes Trump’s Crypto Playbook Amid Growing Political Embrace of Digital Assets Mayor Adams is doubling down on crypto as part of his re-election campaign, echoing Donald Trump’s strategy from last year when Trump vowed to make the U.S . the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump’s actions included issuing an executive order to create a digital asset task force and hosting the White House’s first crypto summit in March with top industry executives. Trump Hosts First White House Crypto Summit President Donald Trump hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, a landmark event bringing together top industry leaders, regulators, and government officials together. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 14, 2025 Adams, recently cleared of corruption charges by the DOJ, a move that sparked backlash and resignations, has now become a prominent face at crypto events. In Las Vegas, he spoke at the industry’s largest conference alongside figures like VP J.D. Vance and Senator Cynthia Lummis. These events, once dominated by industry leaders, now increasingly feature political figures. At a side event hosted by Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, Adams appeared again, showing a long-standing relationship dating back to his Brooklyn days. Last fall, Pierce even co-hosted a fundraiser for him in Puerto Rico. Adams has championed crypto since his 2022 mayoral campaign, famously converting his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum . Now, NYC is forming a digital asset advisory council to explore launching a “Bitbond.” A similar federal initiative, proposed by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, suggests bonds partly backed by Bitcoin for a potential strategic reserve.

With major players like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) cooling off after strong rebounds, new altcoins with low market caps and disruptive potential are beginning to steal the spotlight. While ETH and SOL continue to dominate in terms of utility and infrastructure, they may offer more modest upside compared to fast-rising Mutuum Finance, which are drawing interest for their exponential ROI potential. Mutuum Finance presale has raised more than $9.5 million and attracted over 11,400 participants, ahead of a token price rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 100% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. In a shifting market where crypto investing is increasingly focused on value-entry points, MUTM is quickly becoming a go-to option for those looking to get in early on the next big cryptocurrency. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.5 million and accumulated 11,400 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its launch price of $0.06. Certik Audit Finalized: Mutuum Finance Strengthens Position in DeFi Lending The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while consolidating its market position. A Certik smart contract audit has now been officially completed, and the results shared across various media platforms boosting investor confidence in the project. With this milestone, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. Gamified Leaderboard Engages the Community In addition to securing community ties, Mutuum Finance has established a leaderboard feature which displays the top 50 token holders in real-time. Bonus tokens will be received by the top 50 ranks, which becomes an entertaining, game-like incentive for users to move up and hold their positions. It is a smart merge of DeFi mechanics and community involvement. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance continues to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its growing investor community. To award early investors Mutuum Finance platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. One of the revolutionary aspects of the Mutuum Finance model is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. The Buy-and-Distribute mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction as the next altcoin to watch, with over $9.5 million raised and 11,400+ investors already in. With a current presale price of $0.03 and a launch price of $0.06, early buyers could see 100% gains, plus more if post-launch momentum continues.

With institutional money flowing back into digital assets and key tokens making sharp upward moves, the hunt for the best performing crypto today is heating up. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, some of the strongest action is happening just outside the top spot. From altcoins with real-world use cases to presale tokens with aggressive entry points, momentum is building fast. This list covers four names pulling serious attention right now, Web3 ai , TRON, Binance Coin (BNB), and XRP, each offering different entry angles for traders and investors looking for real upside. Whether it’s AI-powered innovation, high-speed chains, DeFi backbone tokens, or utility coins ready for an ETF breakout, these tokens are showing why they’re being tagged as the best performing crypto today. Let’s break it down starting with the project making early buyers rethink their entry levels, Web3 ai . 1. Web3 ai: Whales Are Buying at $0.000402 Web3 ai has already crossed $5.8 million in its presale and is currently priced at just $0.000402 per token in Stage 7. That alone is pulling in traders. But what really sets it apart is what comes next, $WAI unlocks a full suite of AI crypto tools on launch. These tools include trading bots, portfolio optimizers, and fraud detection modules that plug directly into real trader workflows. With a listing price locked at $0.005242, just entering the presale gives early buyers over 1,747% ROI baked in. It’s no surprise whales are front-running the crowd on this one. While the $777K giveaway might get retail attention, high-volume wallets are clearly stacking $WAI for its long-term potential. Web3 ai is gaining traction fast as the best performing crypto today, not just for the price action, but for what it offers post-launch. With AI dominating headlines across industries, this is one of the few tokens offering usable AI crypto products. If $WAI hits its projected $4 price in the coming years, missing the $0.000402 entry will feel like watching history from the sidelines. No fluff, just clear tokenomics, roadmap execution, and use-case-driven hype making Web3 ai the best performing crypto today right now. 2. TRON: Volume Surge and Expanding Use Case TRON (TRX) is currently trading at $0.2779, backed by a 24-hour trading volume of $590 million and a market cap of over $26 billion. That’s a strong signal of renewed interest, especially considering how consistently TRON’s ecosystem has expanded in 2024 and into 2025. The network continues to show reliability for hosting decentralized applications and stablecoins, with growing integration in digital identity platforms and data storage layers. TRON’s high-speed throughput and low fees keep attracting developers, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. With new partnerships forming around enterprise-level integrations, TRX isn’t just another old name hanging around, it’s being used. It’s already outperforming many tokens that were quiet just a few months back, putting it squarely on the radar as one of the best performing crypto today . The technical structure also supports short-term upside, with analysts noting buy-side strength around the $0.27–$0.30 range. It may not carry meme coin excitement, but in terms of steady market traction, TRON is making a very real case. 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Strong Utility, Stronger Price Action BNB is back in the spotlight with a current price around $684.75 and a market cap near $96.5 billion. While that size may make it seem less explosive compared to smaller cap coins, its recent performance tells another story. With daily trading volumes at $1.8 billion and consistent exchange-driven burn mechanisms tightening supply, BNB has been pushing up charts steadily. What makes it one of the best performing crypto today is that its demand is real. Traders need BNB for fee reductions, launchpad access, and liquidity provisioning across the Binance ecosystem. As Binance continues to expand its footprint into new regions and launch new financial tools, BNB scales right alongside. Analysts are pointing to $750 as the next resistance zone, and strong exchange inflows suggest BNB might be on that path faster than expected. The asset’s blend of utility, low volatility compared to peers, and firm institutional trust makes it more than just a coin, it’s a core trading asset in 2025. 4. XRP: ETF Buzz and Institutional Backing Fuel Momentum XRP is trading around $2.30 with volume surging past $2.6 billion in 24 hours. That’s big on its own, but with the launch of CME XRP futures and ETF speculation on the table, the entire XRP price structure is being reevaluated. Analysts are tracking short-term targets near $5, with longer-term expectations floating as high as $27 depending on how the institutional setup unfolds. With that kind of upside potential in play, it’s no stretch to call XRP one of the best performing crypto today. What makes XRP especially compelling right now is the alignment between retail buzz and institutional tools. With the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve considering XRP, and regulatory paths clearing up post-lawsuit, traders are starting to re-enter positions they exited long ago. The support range near $2.25 is holding firm, while futures open interest builds. Whether you’re day-trading patterns or watching ETF headlines, XRP is flashing signals that can’t be ignored. Summing Up In a market full of noise, some names are showing real substance, and those are the tokens making moves. Web3 ai is leading the pack with its aggressive crypto presale pricing and AI-powered utility suite, positioning itself as the best performing crypto today from both a retail and whale perspective. Meanwhile, TRON is gaining renewed momentum with increased use case adoption and transaction volume. Binance Coin (BNB) continues to prove why real-world utility and platform dominance matter in market cycles. And XRP is recharging its narrative with fresh institutional interest and bullish technical signals. Whether you’re looking for an early-stage gem or a large-cap with stable momentum, each of these projects is showing why they belong on your radar as the best performing crypto today. The market is moving, fast. And sitting on the sidelines means missing out. Entry windows don’t stay open forever. Choose wisely, and time it right.

Bitcoin Could Hit $200,000 This Year Speaking from the perspective of a macro quant hedge fund operator, Edwards was unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, stating, “If the data stays in the current trend we’re in, I think $150–200K is definitely possible this year.” The founder of Capriole, a fund known for pioneering on-chain valuation models like Hash Ribbons, Energy Value, and the Macro Index, grounded this forecast in a web of interlocking technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming “We’re printing new all-time highs on daily and weekly closes,” Edwards noted. “As long as we stay above $104K as long as the Macro Index trends up, and US liquidity continues to rise, this environment is very bullish.” Capriole’s proprietary Macro Index—a machine learning model aggregating over 100 inputs from Fed liquidity to bond and equity markets—has turned decisively positive. Bitcoin’s rally, Edwards emphasized, is further reinforced by metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Hodler Growth Rates, and Energy Value, all signaling room for expansion. But while Bitcoin shows strength across multiple dimensions, altcoins are telling a very different story. The Death Of The Old Altcoin Cycle Edwards refrained from naming specific altcoins but delivered a clear macro verdict: the capital flow dynamics have changed, and altcoins are no longer on an equal footing with Bitcoin. “Structurally, things are quite a bit different this cycle […] the biggest driving forces are Bitcoin ETFs and US policy. That’s creating a centralizing effect—funneling capital directly into Bitcoin,” he explained. He pointed to the historical cycles of retail-led altcoin rallies, followed by catastrophic drawdowns—often exceeding 99% losses. “Retail has just gotten destroyed,” he said bluntly. “There’s a fatigue in the altcoin space that wasn’t there four or five years ago.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock The legacy of failed ICOs, broken tokenomics, and events like the FTX collapse have left lasting scars. Meanwhile, institutions are avoiding the risks and complexity of smaller-cap digital assets, opting instead for regulated Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. “It used to be more of a level playing field. That’s no longer the case,” Edwards said. “The real money is flowing into Bitcoin—and that probably continues for a while.” When Will Altcoins Wake Up? Despite the grim tone, Edwards does not dismiss altcoins entirely. He views a strong altcoin cycle as conditional—not impossible, but dependent on clear Bitcoin dominance first. Using Capriole’s Speculation Index and Crypto Breadth models, which track the relative strength and price movement of altcoins, he made a key observation: “Right now, only 5% of altcoins are above their 200-day moving average. That’s not bullish.” He compared the current setup to late 2020, when Bitcoin surged from $10K to $60K before altcoins began outperforming. That rotation required Bitcoin to first breach previous all-time highs decisively. “You want Bitcoin to hit something like $140K while alts are still underperforming. That would be the ideal setup […] that’s when capital begins rotating downstream,” he explained. Conversely, if altcoins begin pumping prematurely, while Bitcoin remains range bound, Edwards sees that as a top signal. “That’s usually the last puff of air,” he warned. Cycles Are Changing, Risks Are Evolving Beyond price action, Edwards questioned the relevance of traditional halving cycles. He argued that the impact of miners—once the primary driver of Bitcoin supply dynamics—has diminished significantly due to ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign actors like Michael Saylor. “That four-year cycle is dead—or at least dramatically weaker. Miners are now just 2–3% of the total supply flow. The real drivers today are institutions,” he said. This evolution reduces the probability of 80% drawdowns and increases the risk of systemic leverage—particularly from publicly traded Bitcoin-heavy firms. While not an immediate concern, Edwards sees potential for long-term vulnerabilities if major players overextend. Edwards also discussed diversification within Capriole’s portfolio. While Bitcoin remains the firm’s core allocation, he revealed exposure to quantum computing equities like IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D-Wave (QBTS), and QUBT. “I think quantum is like Bitcoin in 2015. It’s early, it’s volatile, but the long-term CAGR could be even higher than Bitcoin’s.” He added that gold also plays a strategic role, not as a replacement but as a hedge. Capriole monitors the gold-to-equity ratio closely, and its breakout above the 200-day moving average is seen as a historically bullish signal—both for gold and Bitcoin. In closing, Edwards urged investors to tune out most of the financial news cycle. “Probably 99% of headlines don’t matter,” he said. Instead, focus on game-changing shifts: Fed pivots, global liquidity expansions, and true structural reconfigurations of capital flow. “We’re wired to overreact to bad news. The key is to filter it down to a few macro drivers that actually move the market—and Bitcoin right now has those working in its favor.” Until altcoins show meaningful breadth and break their long-term resistance structures, Edwards’ message is clear: Bitcoin will soar. Altcoins won’t—at least, not yet. At press time, BTC traded at $105,557.

Analysts suggest the move employs strategic regulatory workarounds to bypass conventional SEC procedures. Unique Structure Behind the REX ETFs According to ETF analyst James Seyffart, the REX filings utilize an unusual structural classification. “These ETFs are structured as c-corps. Which is very rare in the ETF world,” he explained on May 30. REX confirmed that the fund would be taxed as a C-corporation, meaning both current and deferred tax expenses will be factored into the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV). This model deviates from the norm and raises questions about its implications for investors. Staking as a Missing Puzzle Piece Staking has been one of the most anticipated features for spot Ethereum ETFs since their debut in July 2024. Many industry executives believe the absence of staking has made these products incomplete. ETF Store President Nate Geraci called REX’s approach a “regulatory end-around” and expressed confidence in their imminent launch. Bypassing the SEC’s Traditional Path Seyffart noted that the REX funds are 40-act funds and thus avoid the usual 19b-4 regulatory review process. This is a critical workaround, particularly in light of the SEC’s recent delay on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its own Ether ETF. “This was one way to get some level of signoff from the SEC,” Seyffart said. Fund Mechanics and Market Entry REX’s proposed ETFs will gain spot exposure to Ether and Solana through Cayman-based subsidiaries. The structure is designed to allow staking of at least 50% of each token, marking a significant shift from earlier offerings. Seyffart added, “All of this, assuming they launch in the near future, is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory workarounds to get these products to market.” The launch, though not yet dated, appears imminent based on regulatory patterns and market positioning. BlackRock Perspective Adds Weight On March 20, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, described their own Ether ETF as a “tremendous success.” However, he admitted the lack of staking made the product “less perfect.” The addition of staking capabilities is seen by many as essential for ETFs aiming to fully capture the benefits of Ethereum and Solana’s proof-of-stake networks. The developments from REX could potentially open the floodgates for similar fund structures, signaling a new phase of innovation in crypto-linked investment vehicles.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-31 01:30:29

He calls it a significant step toward establishing a clear and consistent regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. Alderoty argued that “Clarity shouldn’t be controversial” and that the bill would allow for a practical and intelligent regulatory environment . The Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer thanked some prominent lawmakers for their role in leading the charge. This list includes Representatives French Hill, Congressman Glenn Thompson, Angie Craig, the GOP Majority Whip Dusty Johnson, Don Davis, Bryan Steil, Ritchie, and Davidson. Their work underscores the need for new regulatory guidelines that can be spun up and revised quickly as the digital assets space accelerates. Rep. Bryan Steil released the following statement regarding the CLARITY Act on X. The post mentions that the bill is designed to bring clarity to digital assets during this golden period. Supporters of the bill are united by a desire to enable the digital assets sector to expand by establishing a trustworthy and predictable set of laws. Right now, businesses and investors are often uncertain about which of their activities may delay the future of the industry. Bipartisan CLARITY Act redefines crypto oversight Introduced on May 29, 2025, by members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, the CLARITY Act seeks to clarify the regulatory roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding digital assets. The bill is looking to categorize most cryptocurrencies as virtual commodities overseen by the CFTC rather than as a security regime, as is the current practice of the SEC. With the rising use of digital assets, now is a good moment for such a move. This is because their increasing adoption and market maturity offer opportunities for broader economic integration. The rising use of these assets is also a concept shared by MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor . Alderoty noted the bill’s significance in bringing “long-overdue clarity” to the digital asset landscape. The bill, he said, takes the industry closer to a “smart, workable framework” that creates an equilibrium between innovation and consumer protection. CLARITY Act safe harbor advances as Ripple calls for clear crypto rules The CLARITY Act also introduces a four-year safe harbor provision for primary token offerings if the underlying network reaches a “mature blockchain system” status and the total raise stays below $75 million during any 12-month window. Alderoty also supported the CLARITY Act, as Ripple remains committed to advocating for regulatory clarity regarding the cryptocurrency industry. He has sent a letter to the SEC requesting the commission to clarify when a digital asset ceases to be an investment contract . Not all of them, he contended, should be subject to the same securities regulations — especially not on secondary market transactions — and he offered a safe harbor to shield compliant crypto issuers from enforcement risk. As XRP regains attention as a top crypto buy with the Ripple SEC lawsuit nearing resolution, uncertainty lingers following SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s recent “New Paradigm” speech. Ripple’s letter directly responds to the pivotal question posed in the speech: “When does a digital asset separate from an investment contract?” Ripple referenced established securities law analysis from legal experts like Lewis Cohen in its response. Cohen’s analysis contends that current US investment contract law does not consider routine transfers of most fungible crypto assets in secondary markets as securities. With the CLARITY Act, the US may finally start taking concrete steps to provide regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. While the bill gets consideration in the legislative committee, its passage would lay a benchmark for the future of how US regulators will oversee digital assets.

He spoke after Ripple handed over the “Skull of Satoshi” artwork at the 2025 Bitcoin conference. Larsen said the gift was a way to recognize progress and to build a better rapport between the two camps. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?

The plan didn’t pan out as he had hoped. Still, Larsen seemed upbeat about moving past that setback. He made clear Ripple itself didn’t put any cash into the drive. In early 2023 when I funded the “Change the Code” campaign, my goal was to see if there was a way to turn Bitcoin into an accelerator for direct air capture. The campaign didn’t work, and that’s ok!

That includes wind, hydropower and even nuclear energy. Miners have also tapped into waste gas projects, turning flared natural gas into fuel for their rigs. Five years ago, those numbers were far smaller. Today, the shift shows that Bitcoin can clean up its act without rewriting its code.

The Skull will now have a permanent home at the Bitcoin Museum in Nashville. pic.twitter.com/Eo3kNqRvGp — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 Skull Of Satoshi Donation At yesterday’s conference, Ripple formally handed the skull sculpture to the wider Bitcoin community. The gesture was more than a photo-op. It signaled that Ripple wants to ease the tension between XRP supporters and Bitcoin purists. In the past, the two groups have sparred over fees, speed and now environmental impact. By giving away an artwork meant to spark debate, Ripple is saying, “Let’s talk, not fight.” Call For A United Crypto Front Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined in the show of goodwill. He called on all crypto players to pull together. He urged regulators to carve out clearer rules, and asked industry insiders to focus on serving the unbanked. Garlinghouse stressed that XRP and Bitcoin fans have more in common than they might think. He said it’s time to unite against outside pressures, like tightening regulations and market skepticism.

These projects are gaining traction through strong fundamentals, active communities, and real-world use cases that set them apart from the noise. In a market where utility matters more than hype, these five contenders, including BlockDAG (BDAG) , are building systems people want to use. From AI agents to privacy tools to decentralised marketplaces, each project brings something distinct to the table. If you are searching for the best crypto 2025 opportunities before they hit exchanges, read on to discover the presales that are making waves for all the right reasons. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): $277M Raised as Testnet and Tools Set the Pace BlockDAG has surged past $277 million in its presale, now entering stage 28 with growing attention from developers and analysts alike. Its hybrid architecture, which blends a Directed Acyclic Graph with Proof of Work, delivers scalability and speed without compromising decentralisation. Unlike many tokens still stuck in theory, BlockDAG already has a live testnet featuring full EVM compatibility. Developers can mint NFTs, run smart contracts, and interact through MetaMask, making it immediately usable for real-world applications. The broader ecosystem includes the X1 mobile miner app, and high-powered X Series mining hardware. Each product adds a layer of function and engagement that sets BlockDAG apart from typical presale tokens. With its GO Live Reveal scheduled for June 13, and a growing number of daily participants, BlockDAG is being widely discussed as a best crypto 2025 pick. Its momentum and utility are aligning for serious long-term potential. 2. Web3Bay (3BAY): Can Retail Be Rebuilt on Blockchain? Web3Bay is on a mission to decentralise e-commerce by eliminating third-party control and enabling users to trade directly using the 3BAY token. The platform rewards activity with lower fees, staking bonuses, and exclusive discounts, all governed by blockchain records that ensure fairness and traceability. This model reimagines digital commerce as something owned, not rented. Currently priced at $0.1959 in stage 5 with $2.1 million already raised, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the best crypto 2025 picks in the commerce sector. As transaction volume grows, token value could climb quickly. The potential here mirrors early BNB, only this time with a retail focus that’s drawing serious attention. 3. Unstaked (UNSD): Could AI Agents Replace Entire Web3 Teams? Unstaked is introducing decentralised AI agents that operate across Web3 ecosystems. These agents handle tasks like growth, moderation, and analytics without needing centralised management or software subscriptions. Every action is validated through Proof of Intelligence, recorded on-chain, and rewarded transparently, creating a self-operating infrastructure for digital communities. Now in stage 17 at $0.01043 with $8 million raised, Unstaked is drawing attention from DAOs and crypto builders searching for scalability. As automation becomes essential, many see this as a contender for best crypto 2025 based on utility alone. Its agent economy could soon become the operational core for countless decentralised platforms. 4. Cold Wallet (CWT): Privacy Is No Longer Optional in Crypto Cold Wallet is creating a secure wallet experience that protects user privacy with zero-knowledge proofs and cold-storage grade protection, while maintaining DeFi and staking functionality. Unlike typical wallets, it allows users to engage anonymously without sacrificing access to the broader crypto ecosystem. Control and stealth come standard, not as an afterthought. At $0.00853 in stage 11, and with a future launch price of $0.3517, Cold Wallet is capturing attention for its blend of privacy and utility. Its DAO-based governance and anonymous staking options add another layer of value. In a world pushing for more transparency, Cold Wallet is emerging as one of the best crypto 2025 plays for those seeking control without compromise. 5. Web3 ai (WAI): Merging AI and On-Chain Utility Web3 ai isn’t chasing hype around artificial intelligence. It’s focused on building tools that integrate large language models, risk engines, and NLP-powered bots directly into crypto workflows. These systems will help users automate trading, sentiment analysis, and wallet actions based on real-time blockchain data. Now in stage 7 with over $6.4 million raised, Web3 ai offers entry at just $0.000402 per token. With the right traction and utility rollout, it doesn’t need to reach astronomical prices to deliver exponential returns. Its $777,000 giveaway is also increasing investor participation and creating a sense of urgency around the presale. In Summary The 2025 presale season is not about hype, it is about substance. Projects like BlockDAG, Web3Bay, Unstaked, Cold Wallet, and Web3 ai are not just promising ideas, they are building real tools with clear use cases. Each one targets a gap in the market, from privacy to AI automation to decentralised commerce. BlockDAG leads the pack with its live testnet and full smart contract functionality, making it a strong contender for best crypto 2025. As these five projects continue gaining traction, they represent some of the most credible and utility-driven presales worth watching this year.

They are experimenting with XRP staking via Flare Networks. The company shared an X post : “Welcome to smart contracts and DeFi opportunities, #XRPArmy. The company then asked its users to “Stay tuned for the beta.” Uphold intends to take root in the US in following Trump’s pro-crypto stance In the last quarter of 2023, Uphold released Vault , a self-custodianship wallet that the company says empowers user to have more ownership of their digital assets. The wallet launched initially with XRP as an option, in keeping with Uphold’s existing dedication to the token. The company has also highlighted the Flare Network (an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain emphasizing cross-chain interoperability). The recent release of USDT₀, an omnichain variant of Tether’s USDT on Flare, has massively increased the network’s TVL, indicating surging demand for cross-chain DeFi utility. Uphold is further expanding its users’ functionality with the re-launch of its crypto debit card, which is available in the UK and US. It plans to extend the offering to other countries soon. The card (available in a virtual and physical version) offers people a way to spend digital currencies directly from their wallets and thus use crypto more as everyday money. The company’s broader push into the US market reflects a wider trend among crypto firms looking to capitalize on a more favorable regulatory climate under President Donald Trump’s administration. Uphold appears keen to position itself at the forefront of this shift. In March, Uphold reinstated staking rewards for US customers on 19 digital assets such as Ethereum, Solana, and NEAR. Concerning this, Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin highlighted that staking is important in how blockchain works and the online economy. Based on his argument, users should be able to back this activity and earn rewards. He further stated that with the new focus on blockchain in the US, they are excited to provide staking services to their customers in the US once more. Building on that momentum, Uphold announced on May 30 that it will soon offer direct deposits with integrated rewards for US users. This feature includes a “Direct Salary Deposit” option, paired with the industry’s first 4% XRP-back reward. Additionally, users can earn 5% rewards on RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-backed stablecoin. Through a mix of DeFi integrations, payment tools, and rewards, Uphold is aggressively expanding its footprint in the US while bringing greater utility to XRP and other digital assets. Uphold disabled staking amid regulatory uncertainties As of 2023, Uphold did not offer staking services in the US due to regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto staking. According to an SEC complaint, many staking firms failed to provide adequate information to clients, particularly regarding how they secured staked assets. The SEC also considered whether staking services could be considered unregistered securities offerings. Accordingly, many companies were forced to cease or limit their staking activities in the United States. One prime instance of this regulatory force was the SEC’s $30 million settlement with Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges, for unauthorized staking services. This high-profile case was a cautionary tale to the whole industry. It might have factored in Uphold’s decision to pause their staking offerings, shedding some light on why many companies still hesitate to offer staking services. Uphold’s recent consideration to take root in the US in the staking sector marks a significant milestone in the crypto community. This is because as investors earn passive income through staking, liquidity, and stability will be achieved, thus representing a giant bet on cryptocurrencies.

Here’s Why Qubetics is the Next Big Thing—Top Cryptos to Buy This Month,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-ethereum-heres-why-qubetics-is-the-next-big-thing-top-cryptos-to-buy-this-month/,"The crypto market has been buzzing with excitement lately, especially with Bitcoin’s market dips and rising interest in decentralized finance (DeFi). Recently, global institutions have been increasingly turning their attention toward blockchain platforms that offer real-world applications, utility, and scalability. This shift has caused some tokens to surge, while others fade into the background. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, which once dominated the scene, are now being eclipsed by emerging projects that promise even greater returns. Investors who missed out on Ethereum’s early stages may now find themselves regretting the missed opportunity—just as Qubetics ($TICS) rises as the next must-have token. Qubetics ($TICS) is steadily gaining attention as it moves through its presale phases, offering a unique opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the next big thing. Unlike Ethereum, which faced scalability issues early on, Qubetics aims to solve these challenges head-on. With its focus on interoperability and cross-chain capabilities, Qubetics stands out as a revolutionary blockchain project that could transform how businesses, professionals, and everyday users interact with decentralized technology. This presents an exciting opportunity to jump in early, before it gains mainstream adoption. The Missed Opportunity: Ethereum’s Peak and What Could Have Been Ethereum’s rise to prominence was nothing short of remarkable. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum opened the floodgates for decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Its impact on the crypto ecosystem cannot be overstated, and the platform became the go-to for developers and investors looking for a reliable blockchain. But as Ethereum grew, so did its challenges. High transaction fees, scalability issues, and slower processing times became increasingly apparent. Despite efforts like Ethereum 2.0, these problems have persisted, making Ethereum less appealing for new projects and business adoption. In hindsight, Ethereum’s early adopters reaped the benefits of being part of its ICO and presale phases. For those who missed those early opportunities, Ethereum’s price movements have made it harder to jump in now. Ethereum’s all-time high price of over $4,000 in 2021 may seem like a missed opportunity, especially when considering that early investors could have bought at less than $1 during its ICO in 2014. Now, at its current price range, Ethereum seems a bit overvalued compared to the early days. While Ethereum is still a significant player in the crypto world, its capacity for exponential growth may have plateaued, making it less exciting for newcomers looking for the next big thing. And this is where Qubetics enters the picture. Qubetics: The New Rising Star—Best Cryptos to Buy This Month Qubetics ($TICS) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about tokens in the crypto world, and for good reason. As of now, Qubetics is still in its presale, and its price is incredibly affordable—offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in early. The project is currently in its 36th presale stage, and it has already sold over 514 million tokens to more than 27,300 holders, raising over $17.5 million in funds. The price per token stands at $0.3064 in Stage 36, with predictions showing that it could rise significantly once the mainnet launches. Unlike Ethereum, which struggled with scalability and high fees, Qubetics offers a seamless multi-chain experience, allowing different blockchains to communicate with each other. This solves one of the most pressing issues in the crypto space—interoperability. Qubetics’ platform offers a variety of real-life applications, making it ideal for businesses, professionals, and individuals across different sectors. Whether it’s for financial services, supply chain management, or decentralized finance, Qubetics is poised to fill gaps left by Ethereum and similar platforms. For businesses, Qubetics offers a unique proposition: the ability to develop cross-chain decentralized applications without being restricted by the limitations of a single blockchain. Professionals can utilize Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet to manage assets across multiple platforms, improving efficiency and security. For individuals, Qubetics offers the potential for exponential returns, especially as the presale price remains low and analysts predict significant price growth. Real-Life Scenarios: How Qubetics Will Impact Different Sectors Businesses: In the world of finance and banking, Qubetics’ interoperability can drastically reduce the friction involved in cross-border transactions. By using its multi-chain platform, businesses can ensure faster and more cost-effective payment solutions. For example, a global supply chain company could use Qubetics to track the movement of goods across different regions and blockchains, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud. Professionals: Qubetics offers unique solutions for professionals in the tech and finance industries. Developers can create decentralized applications with greater ease, leveraging Qubetics’ cross-chain functionality. Financial advisors could integrate Qubetics’ technology into their systems to offer more secure and efficient investment solutions for their clients. Individuals: The potential for individual users to benefit from Qubetics is huge. By participating in the ongoing presale, they can secure TICS tokens at a low price, potentially reaping substantial rewards once the mainnet launches. With analysts predicting a 226% return if the token reaches $1 and a 4794% ROI if it hits $15 after the mainnet, the opportunity to buy early is undeniable. Interoperability: Bridging the Gap in the Blockchain Ecosystem Interoperability is a critical advancement for blockchain technology, as it allows different blockchain networks to communicate and work together seamlessly. Traditionally, blockchain networks have operated in isolation, limiting the transfer of assets and data between them. This fragmentation creates inefficiencies and barriers for developers, businesses, and users. However, with Qubetics’ cross-chain interoperability, this challenge is overcome by enabling seamless communication between various blockchains, ensuring that decentralized applications (dApps) can operate smoothly across multiple networks. This integration helps streamline processes, reducing friction and improving the overall user experience. For businesses and individual users, Qubetics’ interoperability opens up new possibilities by facilitating cross-chain transactions and services. Companies can utilize this technology to create more efficient solutions, such as cross-border payments or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that draw on liquidity from multiple networks. For users, it means greater flexibility, enabling them to interact with assets and services across different blockchain ecosystems without being confined to a single platform. By bridging the gap between disparate blockchain systems, Qubetics empowers a more interconnected and dynamic blockchain ecosystem, driving widespread adoption and innovation. Qubetics Presale Details: The Countdown to the Next Big Launch The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in Stage 36, with the token priced at $0.3064.

Trump says on Truth Social that he had previously decided to make a deal with China because his tariffs were plunging the Asian giant into “grave economic danger.” But according to Trump, his efforts did not pay off, as he says China breached a deal with the United States. “I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH the US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.32% on Friday, while the S&P 500 traded closer to even, only slumping by 0.0081%. Crypto, on the other hand, fell further, with the overall digital market cap dropping by more than 4%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by more than 1%. The Trump Administration announced multiple waves of tariffs on China in early April, which China responded to with retaliatory measures. Earlier this month, the White House announced that it had reached a deal with China to suspend and lower many of those tariffs, which kickstarted the equities market.

It joins a list of other Western technology companies pulling out of the Russian market. Geopolitical tensions are again affecting the technology industry as Microsoft is joining a list of other Western companies such as Google that are closing their Russian subsidiaries. Microsoft Corp.’s Russian subsidiary, Microsoft Rus LLC, has announced that it will declare bankruptcy. The announcement was made through a notice published on the official Russian registry Fedresurs on Friday, May 30. This decision seems like it was brought on by the ongoing pullback of Western technology companies from the Russian market, considering the escalating political tensions and economic isolation stemming from the war in Ukraine. Microsoft’s Russia unit is on the brink While Microsoft has not issued an official statement in response to inquiries, the notice signifies an end to the company’s already scaled-down presence in Russia. Over the last two years, the company has significantly reduced its presence in the country. The notice came just days after the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, publicly criticized and suggested that foreign digital service providers like Microsoft and Zoom should be “throttled” in favor of domestically developed alternatives. Microsoft was one of several Western technology giants that responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 by curtailing services and operations in the country. Initially, the company continued to provide essential services such as security updates and cloud support, but by June 2022, the company announced a substantial downsizing of its Russian operations due to the deteriorating economic environment and geopolitical instability. After the announcement, the company removed the RT (formerly Russia Today) app from the Windows App Store and banned advertisements from Russian state-affiliated media. The Fedresurs registry entry states that Microsoft Rus LLC is now proceeding with legal steps to enter bankruptcy, which would potentially dissolve its presence as a formal business entity in Russia. This is the pattern that other foreign companies exiting Russia have followed. Russia’s TASS news agency noted that Microsoft operates three other affiliated entities in the country, namely: Microsoft Development Center Rus, Microsoft Mobile Rus, and Microsoft Payments Rus. At this time, the status of these units remains unclear. Whether they will also initiate bankruptcy proceedings or attempt to continue operating under restricted conditions is yet to be seen. Other companies exiting Russia Earlier this week, President Vladimir Putin emphasized the need to wean Russia off Western digital tools, specifically naming Microsoft and Zoom. While Russia’s “technological sovereignty” policy is not new, the pressure to use regulation to suppress foreign firms to prop up Russian-developed alternatives has grown since the war in Ukraine began. In 2022, Google’s Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after authorities froze its bank accounts, making it impossible for the company to pay local employees or fulfill obligations to suppliers. Some foreign software continues to be used in Russia as of now and are often circulated through gray market channels or rebranded alternatives, but official policy increasingly favors domestic innovation, even at the cost of performance, reliability, or global integration. Microsoft’s exit might accelerate Russia’s domestic innovation ambitions as sectors that relied on the company’s productivity tools, cloud services, and cybersecurity infrastructure will now be left empty handed. Industry observers have noted that replicating the sophistication and integration of Microsoft’s ecosystem will be a significant challenge for Russian developers, at least in the short term.

Ethereum’s shift toward broader institutional use, Solana’s appearance in strategic reserves, Cardano’s fresh DeFi integrations, and BlockDAG’s surging presale have all sparked interest. Each project brings a unique angle, from scalability and smart contract utility to low-cost entry and active ecosystems, but one project is clearly drawing the most eyes. This isn’t just about who’s rising in price. When considering the top crypto to buy now, investors are evaluating technical strength, ecosystem development, and near-term momentum. Based on these factors, BlockDAG has emerged with standout traction, while ETH, SOL, and ADA continue to show solid reasons to stay on watch. Here’s a detailed look at how they compare. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0018 Pricing & Exchange Reveal Set the Stage BlockDAG is showing rapid growth as it moves toward a key milestone in its presale phase. The coin is still available at $0.0018, while total presale funding is now closing in on $277 million. What’s driving interest? On June 13, BlockDAG will reveal 20 centralized exchanges where BDAG will be listed, a turning point that could fuel its public breakout. The project’s strength goes beyond exchange plans. BlockDAG merges DAG scalability with PoW security and supports 2,000 TPS at launch, scaling to 15,000 TPS. Its mobile app, X1, already has over 1 million users, while community-focused features like Buyer Battles and a 25% referral program have increased user engagement. A refreshed Double Up Reset also gives buyers a renewed chance to increase their holdings. With low entry pricing, growing visibility, and a defined path to listings, BlockDAG is building strong fundamentals. These factors explain why many see it as the top crypto to buy now, especially for those looking at long-term upside with real near-term catalysts. 2. Solana: Testing Support With Strategic Boost From Institutional Backing Solana is trading at $163.19, down 5.5% over the past day. Despite the dip, it’s holding firm after a solid recovery from April lows around $115. The current zone between $158 and $163 is a crucial support range. If it holds, analysts say SOL could test resistance at $183, with potential upside toward $195 and $210. What’s reinforcing confidence in Solana is its inclusion in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a notable recognition of its broader utility. The platform continues to attract developers and users through its growing Web3 and DeFi ecosystem. If price stability continues, Solana remains a technically sound option. For swing traders and long-term believers, it continues to earn a place among the top crypto to buy now. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Demand & $4K Forecasts Support Strength Ethereum is currently priced at $2,620, having dipped 3.9% in the last 24 hours, with intraday movement between $2,591 and $2,732. This drop follows a strong monthly gain of nearly 45%, fueled by spot ETF inflows and renewed interest from institutions. Ethereum remains the leader in DeFi, holding more TVL than its closest competitors. The latest upgrade, Pectra, increased validator limits from 32 ETH to 2,048 and introduced faster, lower-cost network performance. While a $2.4 billion options expiry on May 30 may create short-term price swings, long-term targets remain high. Analysts at Standard Chartered see a $4,000 price point in 2025 and $7,500 by 2029. Ethereum’s continued relevance and technical strength make it a consistent pick among those scanning for the top crypto to buy now. 4. Cardano: Expanding Utility Through Bitcoin DeFi Cardano’s current price is $0.7009, showing a 6.7% decline on the day. Its trading range is sitting between $0.699 and $0.755. While price action has stayed muted, Cardano has been making quiet but meaningful moves. A major one is its integration of Bitcoin DeFi through the Lace Wallet, giving BTC users access to ADA-based financial tools. Alongside Solana, Cardano was recently added to the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that boosts its credibility. Analysts are projecting ambitious targets, including $2.05 by the end of 2025 and potentially $10 by 2030. These projections are tied to the blockchain’s ability to scale and integrate real-world use cases. While ADA isn’t stealing headlines right now, its developments and price range make it a relevant name in any discussion about the top crypto to buy now. Why BlockDAG Commands the Most Attention Ethereum brings institutional confidence. Solana continues to test important support levels while expanding its network. Cardano is quietly adding real-world use through Bitcoin integration. Yet BlockDAG is combining all the key elements, accessible pricing, strong technology, user incentives, and a confirmed roadmap to listings. With the presale target set at $600 million and the current price still at $0.0018, BlockDAG offers one of the most compelling setups. Its growing user base, solid architecture, and scheduled exchange reveal give it a clear advantage. For those searching for the top crypto to buy now , BlockDAG presents a rare opportunity to get in before the public launch and potential price shift begin. The days leading up to June 13 may represent the last chance to enter before a major wave of visibility and demand reshapes its market position. For buyers focused on value, growth, and timing, BlockDAG might just be the move worth making.

45313672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=762183,1748660451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45313672.jpeg,"Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-upward-momentum-highly-likely-to-continue-on-chain-data-shows/,"Although Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stalled in the mid-$100,000 range, on-chain data indicates that the top cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum is far from over. BTC recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980, prompting several crypto analysts to forecast even higher prices in the near term. Bitcoin Rally Far From Over, Data Suggests According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crypto Dan, Bitcoin is still “highly likely” to continue its upward trajectory. The analyst shared the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart to support this outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The NRPL chart highlights the scale of realized profits and losses by market participants who are selling BTC. A relatively low NRPL during price increases typically signals that profit-taking is limited, often indicating the continuation of a bullish trend. In the chart, the current level of profit realization is highlighted in right-most red box. While the recent price surge may trigger a short-term correction, the extent of realized profits does not suggest the end of the ongoing upward cycle. As Dan noted: Compared to the NRPL spikes at past cycle peaks, this round of profit-taking is relatively limited. In particular, when compared to the movements at the highs in March and November 2024, the current level of profit realization is notably lower. Dan concluded that the current level of profit-taking does not point to a major trend reversal. Instead, Bitcoin is poised to continue climbing, potentially targeting levels beyond $120,000 in the coming weeks. Despite the optimism, some market watchers remain cautious. Noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that Bitcoin’s current price action might be a bull trap, with BTC at risk of falling below the $100,000 threshold. For the uninitiated, a bull trap refers to when the asset briefly breaks above a well-established resistance range, leading traders to believe a breakout is occurring, but then quickly reverses and falls back below the resistance level. This move often plays out to lure in long positions before liquidating them as the price drops back into the previous range. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak, Retail Yet To Arrive On a more positive note, multiple on-chain indicators suggest Bitcoin is not yet near its cycle top. Notably, retail investor participation in the current rally remains limited – a sign that the market may still have room for a second wave of capital inflow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Massive 7,883 BTC Outflow From Coinbase – Are Institutions Loading Up? Likewise, Binance inflow data shows that certain investor groups are not eager to sell their BTC, possibly anticipating further gains. At press time, BTC is trading at $105,659, down 2.5% over the past 24 hours.

Musk, wearing a black outfit and sporting a noticeable black eye, stood beside the president during a joint news conference. The gathering was meant to signal that Trump continues to support the billionaire entrepreneur. During the event, the president presented Musk with a golden key and described him as someone who has endured “slings and arrows,” suggesting that public criticism of Musk has been unfair. “He had to go through the slings and the arrows, which is a shame,” Trump said. Trump bids Elon Musk farewell. Source: FOX 35 Orlando In recent months, Tesla has faced protests, acts of vandalism, and a steep decline in its stock price. Many of these challenges have followed Musk’s growing involvement with DOGE and cost-cutting efforts. By publicly endorsing Musk, Trump aimed to show that he stands firmly behind the man who played a significant role in his own political comeback. The relationship between Trump and Musk, however, was not always smooth. At one point, Musk suggested that Trump should not run for office. In response, Trump even posted on social media in 2022 that he “could have said, ‘Drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it.” Despite that rocky start, the two eventually found common ground. Elon Musk donated generously to Trump’s political campaign and offered praise on social media. In turn, President Trump allowed Musk to be involved in various federal agencies without much resistance. In February, he even took to the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference carrying a chainsaw, saying it was “easy” to “save billions of dollars sometimes in, in an hour.” That display drew attention, but in practice, Musk’s team did not come near to achieving the goal of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget. Musk admits that cutting costs was far more difficult than he had anticipated By Friday, however, Musk admitted that identifying and securing huge savings proved far more difficult than he had anticipated. Standing alongside Trump, he described the task of reviewing government spending as “extraordinarily time-consuming and difficult,” involving careful scrutiny of countless line items. “It’s mostly just a lot of hard work,” he said. Even though Musk was stepping away from his formal role in DOGE, both men insisted the effort would continue. Trump noted that Musk had “installed geniuses with an engineering mindset and unbelievably talented people in computers” to carry on the work in multiple agencies. “Elon is really not leaving,” the President said. “He’s going to be back and forth. I have a feeling it’s his baby.” Musk reiterated that the cost-cutting effort is far from over Musk promised that DOGE will achieve $1 trillion in cuts eventually, even though the DOGE website currently lists $175 billion in proposed cuts. “This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,” he said, likening the effort to a way of life, “like Buddhism.” During the news conference, a reporter asked Musk about a recent report in The New York Times suggesting he had been using drugs more heavily than was previously known. Musk did not address the report’s specifics, instead criticizing the newspaper’s credibility and saying, “Let’s move on.” Another question focused on Musk’s black eye. He explained that it was the result of roughhousing with his 5-year-old son, X. “I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face,’” Musk recalled. “And he did.” His answer drew laughter and eased the tension in the room for a moment. Toward the end of the session, Musk rejoined the discussion to criticize federal judges who have upheld limits on the administration’s power. He accused judges of “immense judicial overreach that is unconstitutional.” “It needs to stop,” he said. “It’s gone too far.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 03:30:29
45315984,https://invezz.com/?p=2743378,1748663878,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Best crypto presales to buy as Bitcoin sees renewed volatility,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/31/best-crypto-to-buy-as-bitcoin-sees-renewed-volatility/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) slipped 2.5% and 5%, respectively, on Saturday after President Donald Trump accused China of violating its trade agreement with the United States, reigniting fears of escalating trade tensions. The decline followed the release of the latest US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, which came in line with expectations and initially kept the crypto market steady. However, sentiment turned negative after Trump’s statement on Truth Social suggested that China had reneged on the terms of a previously negotiated deal. He emphasized the impact of his 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, claiming they had placed China in “grave economic danger” and triggered civil unrest, prompting him to strike a quick agreement to stabilize conditions. This development adds to the volatility traders have seen since February, when tariff threats on Canada and Mexico began surfacing. With Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing renewed volatility, retail interest is rotating toward high-risk, high-reward opportunities like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now in the final phase of its presale. As speculative capital seeks fresh momentum plays, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among traders looking to capture outsized returns. The appeal lies in the typical presale dynamic—low entry price, viral branding, and the potential for explosive upside once listings go live. BTC to slip to $100K? Bitcoin (BTC) is down 4.50% for the week to $103,332 and appears vulnerable to a short-term retest of the $100,000 mark. However, blockchain data suggests that any sustained move below that threshold may be short-lived. According to CryptoQuant, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which measures the realized gains and losses from Bitcoin transactions, shows only moderate profit-taking at current levels. This contrasts sharply with the elevated spikes seen during the March and November 2024 peaks, which preceded significant sell-offs and market tops. The relatively restrained selling now suggests that the market is not exhibiting signs of overheating, leaving room for further upside. Supporting the case for a strong bounce if BTC dips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, currently at $96,000. This metric reflects the average acquisition price of coins moved recently and has historically served as a reliable support during bullish phases. In prior cycles, Bitcoin has typically not stayed below this level for long, underscoring solid investor conviction and persistent demand. Taken together, the muted profit-taking and a key support near the $96,000 point to a high likelihood that any pullback under six figures would attract dip-buying interest, reinforcing the broader bullish trend. Why market attention is on Bitcoin Pepe Even as Bitcoin grapples with short-term volatility, its recent move to new highs has buoyed sentiment across the broader crypto market, an environment that has historically set the stage for wider rallies. In this risk-on backdrop, investor appetite is again turning toward speculative corners of the market, with meme coins among the early beneficiaries. One standout in this rotation is Bitcoin Pepe, which is positioning itself not just as another viral token but as a meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. The project claims to combine Bitcoin’s security with scalability comparable to Solana—an infrastructure edge that differentiates it from the majority of meme tokens, which typically offer little beyond branding. To build out its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has lined up several strategic partnerships. These include collaborations with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, as well as a tie-up with the GETE Network aimed at expanding into the cross-chain Web3 gaming segment. These moves suggest an effort to blend meme culture with real-world blockchain utility. Investor interest appears to be following. Bitcoin Pepe has raised more than $12.7 million in its ongoing presale, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0396. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, and a centralized exchange listing is expected shortly thereafter—an event that could act as a near-term price catalyst. As speculative capital continues to rotate into meme coins and early-stage projects, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself at the convergence of infrastructure development and retail-driven hype.

While traders keep an eye on Aave’s (AAVE) resistance zone after its bounce from key Fibonacci support, and Uniswap’s (UNI) breakout above $6.50 with bullish indicators flashing, another move may be brewing in the shadows. Web3 ai recently launched a $777,000 giveaway, but it’s not just about the giveaway. The true value lies in Web3 ai ($WAI) , now in stage 7 of its 50-stage presale at just $0.000402. With projections pointing to $4 in the future, this coin could offer a 10,000x return for early holders. Web3 ai is packed with real AI tools, such as auto-trading bots and scam detectors. For those serious about long-term gains, Web3 ai presents a compelling opportunity, going far beyond just the giveaway. AAVE Bounces at $250, Eyes $414 Breakout Target Aave (AAVE) recently bounced off the golden ratio at $250, with its resistance zone becoming the key focus for bullish traders aiming for a breakout. The coin is currently trading at around $265, up by 16% over the past week. Analysts predict a 43.8% price increase, potentially reaching $414.06 if momentum holds. The 0.618 Fibonacci level has acted as strong support, and breakout patterns suggest a shift from last year’s downtrend. AAVE’s fundamentals remain robust, particularly in lending and borrowing. Bulls are targeting $582 by year-end, but volatility remains a concern, and risk management is crucial. Uniswap Breaks $6.50, Targets $7.50 on Volume Surge Uniswap (UNI) has seen a significant breakout above trendline resistance, pushing the coin above $6.50 with a target of $7.50. UNI experienced a strong intraday move, with Open Interest rising by 14% to $400 million and trading volume up 54% to $467 million. Liquidations of short positions surged, indicating a potential short squeeze. Technical indicators back the bullish sentiment, with UNI breaking above the 50, 100, and 200-period EMAs on the 4-hour chart. If it holds the breakout level, UNI could test the May high of $7.50. Positive momentum signals solid gains in the near term. From $0.000402 to $4 Ahead for Web3 ai: Big Wins Are Hiding in Plain Sight Web3 ai has launched a $777,000 prize pool, divided between 10 lucky buyers. To enter, all it takes is a $100 purchase of $WAI coins. However, the real prize is what’s being built behind the scenes. In stage 7 of its 50-stage presale, Web3 ai has already raised over $6.2 million. Each $WAI coin is priced at just $0.000402, with analysts predicting a future price of $4 by the future. This could result in a 10,000x return, but the real story is that Web3 ai’s platform is already developing tools like auto-balancing portfolios and scam detection features. These aren’t just future promises; they’re already being developed. This makes Web3 ai more than a meme coin: it’s a practical, timely asset. For those serious about finding the best crypto for the future, Web3 ai ticks all the boxes: utility, timing, and massive upside. While the giveaway grabs attention, long-term holders are after sustained returns driven by real tools. The strategy is clear: get in early and hold through the growth. Whether someone wins the $77,700 prize or not, the real jackpot could lie in holding $WAI before it hits major exchanges. This is one of the best cryptos to consider for anyone building a future-focused portfolio. Key Takeaways Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI) both show bullish short-term potential, with AAVE reclaiming the 0.618 Fibonacci level, setting up for a 43% move. UNI’s breakout above trendline resistance targets $7.50. However, for those seeking long-term gains, Web3 ai presents a stronger opportunity. While the $777,000 giveaway garners attention, the real potential lies in the $WAI coin. Priced at $0.000402 in stage 7, with $6.2 million raised, Web3 ai offers automated portfolio tools, trading bots, and scam detection features powered by AI. This combination makes Web3 ai one of the best long-term crypto opportunities.

He suggested that cargo ships could speed up their transit through the Panama Canal if they paid in Bitcoin. It was a brief comment, but it set off a flurry of questions about how it might work in practice. Related Reading: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO Bitcoin Payments For Priority Passage According to reports from the panel, Mizrachi spoke alongside El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy leaders, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. He said that ships could “cut the line” by paying tolls in Bitcoin. He offered the idea as a way to reward early adopters. It was presented in a casual tone, but it touched on a serious topic: how fast payments could tie into a long-standing shipping process. Ships Could Pay Panama Canal Transit Fees in Bitcoin The mayor of Panama City, Mayer Mizrachi, said he is exploring bitcoin payment options for ships passing Panama Canals. “What if you have a perk for paying in bitcoin?” Mizrachi mused. “You’d get to go faster.” 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/zciROaSGjM — Ray (@ray4tesla) May 30, 2025 Questions Over Fees And Fairness Based on what was discussed, the Canal’s current rule is first-come, first-served. Changing that would need approval from the Panama Canal Authority and Panama’s national government. Shipping companies might push back if they feel smaller carriers are priced out. US President Donald Trump weighed in late last year, arguing that US ships faced “unfair tolls” and hinting at reclaiming the Canal in December 2024. That episode showed how sensitive Canal changes can be. Handling A $5 Billion Business According to the Panama Canal website, the waterway brought in around $5 billion in revenue between October 2023 and September 2024. Nearly 10,000 ships passed through, carrying about 423 million tons of goods. That’s about 5% of global maritime commerce. If Bitcoin payments were allowed, the Authority would need a plan to deal with price swings. One day’s checkout could be 50 BTC, the next it might jump to 60 BTC. Panama would likely need a quick exchange system to turn BTC into dollars or other stable currencies. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ A Push For City-Level Crypto Mizrachi has also backed letting people pay city fees—taxes, fines and permits—in Bitcoin, Ether and USDC. He raised the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which produces over half of the nation’s GDP. He noted he wouldn’t need more laws to start one. But real steps will depend on lawmakers and officials at the national level. For now, it remains a mayoral proposal, rather than a binding plan. Mizrachi claimed over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions happen in Panama every year, though much of it is “behind closed doors,” he said.

Speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum in California, Jamie said, “You are going to see a crack in the bond market, OK? It is going to happen.” He made the statement while criticizing the US government and the Federal Reserve for how far they’ve pushed spending and monetary policy since the pandemic. According to remarks reported by the Wall Street Journal , Jamie believes the government’s debt-driven policies are pushing the system toward instability. At the center of it is a House-passed tax plan supported by President Donald Trump that would blow up the federal deficit by about $2.7 trillion over ten years. The US national debt is already more than $36 trillion. That proposal has freaked out traders, with a spike in 10-year Treasury yields to 4.418% earlier this month and a credit downgrade from Moody’s, which pointed to the government’s “towering pile of debt.” Traders react to growing fiscal risk Jamie said things got unsteady back in early 2020 when Covid-19 shook the system. But the government’s reaction—which worked at first—eventually spiraled. “They massively overdid” the response in the following years, he said, leaving the economy bloated with cheap money and debt. The result now is a bond market that’s showing signs of real stress, starting with a lack of demand at a Treasury auction on May 21. The financial system has also been slowed down by rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Jamie pointed out that banks have less room to hold bonds under current regulations. That means they can’t easily step in when markets turn shaky. This creates a situation where, if sellers flood the market and there aren’t enough buyers, there’s no buffer to prevent a deeper freeze. To respond, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other financial officials have floated the idea of relaxing capital rules. The goal is to make it easier for banks to absorb more government bonds. But Jamie wasn’t exactly convinced that would fix the real problem. He warned regulators directly: “It’s going to happen, and you’re going to panic.” He added that he’s not sure if the breakdown comes in six months or six years, but he’s certain it’s on the way unless something changes soon. Jamie Dimon sees bigger risks beyond bonds While most of Jamie’s message focused on the debt situation, he also hit other areas he thinks are being ignored. He said investors are underestimating the damage from Trump’s tariffs , which were reintroduced after the president returned to the White House. Jamie said the market is too confident considering how these trade policies can hit real companies. “It’s an extraordinary amount of complacency,” he said. His concerns go beyond money. Jamie said America’s place in the world is at risk if it doesn’t stay strong both economically and militarily. He warned that the US dollar’s role as the global reserve currency could vanish in the future. “If we are not the pre-eminent military and the pre-eminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency,” he said. Jamie admitted that China, the main target of the trade war, is a “potential adversary”, but said the bigger issue is internal. “What I really worry about is us,” he said. “Can we get our own act together—our own values, our own capabilities, our own management?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On Friday, Commerce Department data revealed that consumer prices rose 2.1% in April compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. That puts inflation within touching distance of the Fed’s target, but officials aren’t ready to change course just yet, especially not while President Donald Trump is ramping up tariffs . According to Reuters , Fed officials are choosing patience, not action. The risk of cutting rates too early while tariffs continue to raise import costs is just too high. And they’re not convinced inflation is going to stay low either. Goods prices are already rising again, which means businesses are likely passing costs from higher import taxes straight to consumers. Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said the April inflation dip will probably be seen by the Fed “as the calm before the storm.” He said unless consumer spending collapses or job losses spike, the central bank will keep waiting. Fed freezes as tariffs drive caution On the same day the inflation data came out, the government also reported that consumer spending only grew 0.2% in April. That’s weak. Meanwhile, the personal saving rate jumped to 4.9%, up from 4.3%. Households are saving more and spending less, likely because tariff policy changes so frequently that people are bracing for whatever comes next. Karim Basta from III Capital Management put it simply: “There’s nothing to do but wait.” Since December, the Fed has held short-term rates between 4.25% and 4.50%. And after their most recent meeting in May, officials made clear they’re focused on inflation . Multiple policymakers said they’re worried that Trump’s tariffs could wipe out any progress on prices. Mary Daly, President of the San Francisco Fed, said on Thursday that inflation is still above target. “Inflation is going to be my focus,” she said. Daly also emphasized that rates have to stay “moderately restrictive” to keep downward pressure on prices. Later that evening, Lorie Logan, who leads the Dallas Fed, said it could be “quite some time” before the Fed knows if Trump’s trade policies will do more damage to jobs or prices. She said those risks are “in rough balance,” and that’s enough reason for the Fed to stay on hold. Still, traders are betting that by September, the Fed will start cutting rates slowly. They expect the policy rate to land between 3.75% and 4.0% by the end of the year. But unless inflation drops hard or unemployment jumps, the Fed is showing no sign of blinking.

One such token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently priced at $0.03, with analysts forecasting a $5 price target after launch. The experts point out that this token has the value proposition, coupled with the perfect time to support this breakout. At its current price of $0.03, a rise to $5 would represent an over 100x gain post-launch. While in the legacy financial world, these gains are almost unheard of, they are quite possible in the crypto world. However, for a crypto project to be worthy of such high price targets, it must fulfill several criteria, which Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has done perfectly. One of them is that its value proposition has to be built on solid fundamentals that point to long-term value addition for its community. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could achieve $5 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a unique protocol design that has left analysts amazed at how low its current valuation is compared to its fundamentals. The MUTM token is currently selling for $0.03 per token in Phase 5 of the presale, with over $9.4 million having been raised so far. Buyers who participate in the current phase are assured of a 100% ROI. In Phase 1, the pricing was even cheaper at $0.01 per token. Since then, the price has risen 200%, and it is set to rise another 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6. So far, over 11,300 unique buyers have participated in the presale, with many of them buying tokens since the start of the presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on utility The crypto market has gradually been shifting focus from quick flips that leave most of its community trapped due to low liquidity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focused on building a decentralized, dual-mode liquidity protocol that will deliver long-term growth for its community. In the first mode, called the P2C (peer-to-contract), lenders receive an annualized percentage yield on their assets when they deposit them in a smart contract. This yield rate is based on the utilization rate, and the pool is designed to be self-sustaining by constantly shifting rates based on demand and supply. When the utilization rate in a P2C pool rises, the rate increases, which encourages even more liquidity to enter the pool. That also makes it unfavorable for borrowers to participate, which pushes down the rate to more acceptable levels. In the other mode, which is peer-to-peer (P2P), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows lenders and borrowers to engage directly with each other in separate smart contracts. The focus of the P2P mode is on highly volatile assets like the PEPE meme coin. By placing it in a separate section, it ensures the high volatility does not bleed into the P2C pools, while also providing an avenue for holders of highly volatile assets to earn passive income. mtTokens for instant liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has correctly assessed that depositors in a liquidity pool are often discouraged from doing so since staking takes liquidity away from them. To solve this issue, Mutuum Finance has introduced a revolutionary concept called mtTokens. For instance, when a depositor places $2,500 worth of ETH in a pool, they receive mtETH tokens in return. The mtTokens ensure that depositors can take advantage of market opportunities as they arise. These tokens are built on the ERC-20 token standard, which means they can be freely exchanged on secondary markets or used as collateral for new loans on the protocol. Long-term dividend payouts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has created a smart solution for dividends that also supports the overall growth of the project. The team plans to use profits from the protocol to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which they will then distribute to the stakers. These purchases will support the price of the MUTM tokens while also incentivizing more stakers to sign up. Consequently, it will support the long-term health of the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating that with a commitment to utility in the crypto space, a new project can drive real value for its community. With the success of the recent Certik audit, the number of firm believers in the project has shot through the roof and is expected to keep climbing after launch. Consequently, the modest projection of a rise to $5 is feasible.

Borrowing costs have hit record highs, demand is collapsing, and investors are walking away. According to the Financial Times , policymakers are now scrambling to figure out how to stop things from spiraling further. Last week, 30-year bond yields hit 3.2%, up from 2.3% earlier this year. 40-year bond yields climbed to 3.7%, right after two auctions flopped in a row. Traders in Tokyo described it bluntly as a “buyers’ strike,” and it confirmed something deeper. Investors no longer want Japan’s super-long-term debt. Yields shot up because prices tanked, and that’s happening for one big reason: nobody is buying. Aging investors and the demand problem A major reason for the weak demand is demographics. Kevin Zhao, who leads global sovereign and currency strategy at UBS Asset Management, said the country’s wealthy postwar baby boomers aren’t investing for the long term anymore. Another chunk of missing demand is coming from life insurance firms. Last year, they were pushed to buy up long-term bonds, and they did. But traders now say that the buying wave has ended. Insurance companies aren’t reliable buyers anymore. They’re pulling back, and it’s showing up clearly in the auctions. A recent 20-year bond auction barely attracted interest, the lowest demand since 2012. Then came this week’s 40-year bond sale, which had the weakest bid-to-cover ratio in nearly a year. Traders said the lack of interest confirmed what’s been building for months. The usual buyers are gone, and new ones haven’t stepped in. BoJ policy changes and critical decisions ahead The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is making things even tighter. It raised interest rates to 0.5% and has been trimming its bond buying by ¥400 billion — about $2.8 billion — each quarter. That tapering will continue until March 2026. But without strong buyers, every cut in BoJ purchases adds stress to the system. The bank already owns around 52% of Japan’s bond market, and there’s growing concern about how much more pressure the market can take. All eyes are now on the week of June 16. That’s when the BoJ’s Monetary Policy Committee meets for two days. They’ll review the past year of reduced bond purchases. Some in the market believe the committee might slow down the tapering to keep a lid on yields. The BoJ’s decisions that week could decide whether things calm down or get worse. Just after that, the Ministry of Finance is expected to meet with market players to discuss its debt issuance plans. One likely move would be to cut back on sales of long-dated bonds. Yields dropped slightly on Tuesday after reports that the ministry had started asking brokers how they feel about the current bond market environment. At JPMorgan, economists told clients the spike in yields makes the upcoming BoJ meeting even more important. But Benjamin Shatil, a senior economist there, thinks the central bank is lagging behind. Japan is now in its fourth year of inflation above target, yet policies haven’t caught up. “It all begs the question — why buy?” Benjamin asked. He also pointed to Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, which has not shifted allocations toward domestic bonds despite the volatility. And with liquidity tightening fast in Japan’s commercial banks, fewer institutions are able — or willing — to buy this debt. On the trading desks in Tokyo, the long end of the bond market — the super-long JGBs — is flashing all the alarms. Shinichiro Kadota, a strategist at Barclays, said Wednesday’s failed auction shows the deep problems are now front and center. Issues like BoJ tapering, budget pressure from defense spending, and household savings moving into tax-free NISA accounts are all hitting at the same time. Income for life insurers is also shrinking, and their investment products are losing out to other alternatives. Shinichiro said he doesn’t expect the BoJ to reverse course. “There may be some tweaks . . . but the solution has to be the Ministry of Finance [reducing] issuance,” he said.

While the bulls have held higher lows in the short term, repeated rejection from the same level raises questions about buyer conviction at these highs. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Ethereum is currently consolidating below the major resistance at $2,800, which aligns with the 200-day moving average. The uptrend that began near $1,500 has paused, and the RSI has slightly dropped below 70, reflecting weakening bullish momentum. Despite this, the price remains above the 100-day MA and the previous breakout zone near $2,200, indicating structure remains bullish unless those levels are lost. A clean breakout above $2,800 would open the path toward the $3,400–$3,600 supply zone. On the other hand, failure to do so could trigger a retest of the $2,200 demand block. The 4-Hour Chart The 4H chart shows that the price has formed a clear ascending triangle between the $2,800 resistance and roughly $2,500 support. The structure resembles a potential distribution phase following two strong accumulation zones below $1,850 earlier this month. While ETH continues to set higher lows, the repeated rejection at the highs is starting to weigh on the short-term outlook. The RSI is also hovering near 47, suggesting a neutral momentum shift. A break below $2,500 and the lower boundary of the pattern would signal bearish reversal toward $2,100, while a confirmed breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the distribution idea and favor upside expansion. Sentiment Analysis The Coinbase Premium Index is currently holding slightly above zero, indicating moderate spot demand from US-based investors. Historically, a rising premium has often preceded strong bullish trends driven by institutional or high-volume retail buyers on Coinbase. Although the current levels are not aggressively high, they reflect underlying strength in the spot market and a willingness to pay slightly more for ETH on U.S. exchanges. If this premium begins expanding while ETH approaches resistance again, it could signal renewed confidence and front-running of a breakout. On the other hand, if the premium fades or turns negative, it may signal waning interest and a possible short-term top, which is the scenario that is seemingly occurring at the moment. Therefore, if the demand from the US declines, it would be highly likely for ETH to go into a correction phase once more.

Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485. This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. Related Reading: This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why Liquidation Disparity Between Bitcoin and Altcoins Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, market behaviors have demonstrated a notable divergence between Bitcoin and altcoin liquidations. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise. Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin’s value surged, pushing the price further upward. In stark contrast, altcoins have experienced a markedly different scenario. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts. This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. The sustained downward pressure on altcoins reveals the failure of expectations surrounding an “Altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies typically outperform BTC. Implications of Market Asymmetry The distinct patterns in liquidations between BTC and altcoins reflect critical shifts in investor risk sentiment and leverage usage. BTC’s favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception. Conversely, the altcoin sector’s persistent price declines have led to widespread liquidation of bullish positions, highlighting the misalignment between trader expectations and actual market behavior. According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming? This trend has intensified following the ETF’s approval, as traders appear more confident betting on Bitcoin’s stability and growth potential compared to the volatility and unpredictability of the altcoin market. Moving forward, the current market conditions suggest that investors may continue to approach Bitcoin with measured optimism while maintaining a cautious stance toward altcoins.

The native token has been hit hard once again due to the overall market-wide crash, and has wiped out all the gains registered since the hype rally earlier this month. This One Is for Users, Gamers, Developers Pi Network’s Core Team often publishes (or refurbishes) guidelines and updates for all of its users, and the latest one, which went live hours ago, is mostly targeting gamers, developers, and PI investors. It reads that games, in general, and those built on its network, are particularly important for user participation as gaming is a “strong fit for driving fun, engagement, and utility in the Pi ecosystem.” The post highlights the launch of a new game app, called FruityPi, which “shows how integration with multiple Pi products like Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network can benefit developers.” It is also advertised that it can leverage what the project’s community has to offer, such as signups, attention, and the aforementioned engagement. The team also advised developers to integrate their newly minted games with Pi’s ecosystem, as it will allow them to take advantage of all of its products and collective resources. If the app manages to gain traction from Pi users, then they should also “apply to Pi Network Ventures.” As previously reported , Pi Network Ventures is a $100 million fund that launched in the middle of the month, which aims to invest in startups that advance the utility of real-world Pi adoption. PI’s Price Keeps Dropping Interestingly, when the team first hinted about a big announcement coming later in May (which was on May 8), the community was quick to pick up the news and blow it out of proportion. As a result, the native token exploded from $0.6 to roughly $1.7 within days. However, that hype-driven rally was short-lived, and the asset began to lose value even before the Pi Network Ventures announcement went live. Since then, PI’s price troubles have only deepened, and the market-wide correction in the past 48 hours didn’t help. In fact, PI is down by 10% in the past day alone and has returned to its starting position of around $0.6. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko Perhaps one other reason behind the substantial price dump is the growing number of unlocked PI tokens in the past few weeks.

The current price of $3.86 hovers just above the lower Bollinger Band at $3.77, which could act as short-term support. The RSI is at 45.46, indicating weakening bullish momentum and nearing oversold territory. The bearish candle formations confirm the downward pressure, while the drop from recent highs signals a possible correction phase. If support at $3.77 fails, Pendle may slide further. Otherwise, a rebound would need to reclaim the $4.23 level to restore bullish confidence. PENDLE/USD 4-hour chart PENDLE 4-hour price chart; Tradingview Based on the 4-hour chart of Pendle (PENDLE/USDT), the current outlook suggests intensified bearish momentum. The price has declined to $3.86, decisively breaching the lower Bollinger Band at $3.90, which may indicate oversold conditions or further downside risk. The Balance of Power indicator reads -0.57, signaling bearish dominance. Furthermore, the MACD has turned negative with widening histogram bars and a bearish crossover, reinforcing the downward trajectory. Unless Pendle reclaims the mid-Bollinger Band at $4.34 or higher, continued selling pressure may drive the price toward the next support zone near $3.60. Reversal signs remain weak and largely absent for now.

On the daily timeframe, the price has dropped to the lower Bollinger Band, and RSI is at 45.46, indicating weakening momentum but not yet oversold. This suggests more room for downside or consolidation. On the 4-hour chart, the RSI hovers near 40 with a bearish MACD crossover, reinforcing selling pressure. The Balance of Power also favors sellers. If the price fails to hold above the $3.76 support zone, a deeper pullback is possible. Caution is advised in the near term. Is PENDLE a good investment?

In early February, Pendle price made a sharp decline as it touched the ground around $2.6. Though the price of Pendle recovered later toward $3.7, it failed to maintain that level and dropped toward $2.7 by February’s end. Pendle’s market price further plunged in March due to rising trade war between the US and China. As a result, Pendle dropped below $2 on March 11. It continued to face intense volatility toward $3 by the end of March. In April, Pendle price witnessed a steady surge as trade war eased between the US and China. The price maintained its momentum above $3 throughout the month. Pendle ended April at $3.4. At the start of May, Pendle price is trading between $3.1 and $3.4.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|PENDLE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 05:53:10

The altcoins have it even worse, with massive price drops from the likes of SUI, LINK, DOGE, SOL, ADA, and more. CRO has defied the market-wide trend with a double-digit price surge. BTC Dumps to $103K Ever since it skyrocketed to almost $112,000 last Thursday to chart a new all-time high, bitcoin’s price has been unable to recapture or even sustain its momentum. It started to fall on the next day when US President Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. Although he delayed their implementation for over a month, BTC failed to bounce off decisively and was stopped at around $110,000 on a couple of occasions. The latest rejection, which came on Thursday at $109,000, was the worst one (for now) as it drove BTC down to $105,000. It recovered some ground to $106,000 yesterday, but the bears reemerged and pushed the cryptocurrency south to a 12-day low of just over $103,000. This decline transpired after Trump said China “violated” the trade agreement between the two, while Beijing responded kindly. Although BTC has regained some ground and now sits above $103,500, its market cap has slid to $2.06 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has shot up to 61.3%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out, Not CRO The alternative coins have marked some big losses over the past day. Ethereum is close to breaking below $2,500 after a 4.5% drop. XRP has plunged beneath $2.15, while DOGE, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX have plummeted by up to 9%. The situation with the lower-cap alts is even more painful, as many, such as ENA, INJ, VIRTUAL, and PEPE, have charted double-digit price declines. CRO is the only exception, having gained 17% in the past day and trading close to $0.11. The total crypto market cap has seen roughly $200 billion gone in the past two days and is down to $3.360 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

After days of bullish momentum, ETH now hovers around the $2,550 level—a line that could determine the short-term trajectory. Despite the pullback, Ethereum remains relatively strong compared to other assets, showing signs that bulls still maintain control of the structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support However, risks are rising. If Ethereum loses this key demand zone, bearish pressure could intensify and trigger further downside across the altcoin market. Investors are watching closely as ETH tries to stabilize after multiple attempts to reclaim higher levels in recent weeks. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical signal that could offer hope for bulls. According to Martinez, if ETH manages to hold above $2,550, the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart is flashing a buy signal, pointing to a potential rebound toward $2,650. This aligns with the idea that consolidation near strong demand often leads to upside continuation if momentum holds. Ethereum Builds Strength Amid Uncertainty Ethereum is holding up well despite widespread market volatility, trading confidently above the $2,400 level. The asset continues to show strength as it consolidates within a key demand zone, positioning itself for a potential move higher. This resilience is drawing the attention of analysts, many of whom believe ETH is preparing for an impulsive breakout that could ignite a broader altseason. While the technical outlook remains constructive, global tensions continue to shape investor sentiment. The ongoing trade friction between the US and China, combined with rising US Treasury yields, is injecting uncertainty into the macroeconomic landscape. These systemic risks have the potential to disrupt financial markets, but so far, cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin and Ethereum—have remained relatively firm. Martinez shared a technical setup that could validate the bullish thesis. According to Martinez, Ethereum is flashing a TD Sequential buy signal on the 4-hour chart, signaling a likely rebound if ETH continues to hold above $2,550. This would position the asset for a move toward $2,650—a level that could confirm bullish momentum and bring altcoins back into focus. If Ethereum can maintain its current support and break through immediate resistance, it could serve as a spark for renewed optimism across the crypto sector.

On the 4-hour chart, ETH has clearly lost momentum, slipping below the 34 EMA ($2,608) and also breaking beneath the 50 and 100 SMAs—levels that previously acted as support during consolidation. The recent rejection from the $2,800 range triggered a sharp correction, with increasing volume suggesting strong selling activity. The next key area to watch is around $2,450, which aligns with previous consolidation zones and could serve as short-term support. If this level fails to hold, ETH could retest the 200 SMA near $2,300, a crucial level that also lines up with early May breakout levels.

The TD Sequential buy signal, previously active above $2,550, has now been invalidated, signaling caution for traders. All eyes are now on the bulls to see if they can defend this region and reset the short-term structure for a rebound.

With a 2000% rise in trading volume, the LPT price triggered a strong rise from levels around $5 to mark local highs at around $13.48. The rise in the value is due to the listing on the popular South Korean exchange, Upbit, which has increased its trading volume and market exposure. Now that the token has triggered a strong upswing and the technicals surge over the upper threshold, is the LPT price heading for a correction? The historical price chart suggests the price has rebounded from the lowest support around $3.3. In the times when the price has been forming a consecutive higher high and lower low, the listing seems to have come as a blessing in disguise. The rally almost reached the pivotal resistance zone between $11.56 and $12.78 but failed to sustain which may point towards a small correction phase. As seen in the above chart, these levels have been the trend reversal zone before, and hence, they need to be either broken up or down to flip the ongoing trend. The price surged above the resistance zone during Q1 2024 and remained consolidated throughout the year as it offered a strong base, which turned into a resistance that persists till now. Therefore, rising above this zone is extremely important for the LPT price to reach the neckline of the v-shaped recovery above $21; otherwise, the token may continue to consolidate below the range. Technically, the bullish dominance over the rally has just started as the weekly MACD has turned bullish after remaining bearish since the start of the year. Besides, the weekly RSI has risen above the descending trend line, hinting towards the beginning of the bullish trend. Therefore, the Livepeer (LPT) price is believed to maintain a consistent ascending trend by withstanding the bearish pressure and eventually rising above the resistance zone. On the other hand, the token has been attracting significant volume at frequent intervals, which suggests the investors remain vigilant over the token. Therefore, a rise above the range may attract fresh liquidity that may lead the LPT price close to its ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|LPT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 06:28:08

Square's new biannual product launch cadence, the first of which included Square Handheld and a Square AI teaser, positions the company to reignite Square segment growth. AI integration into Square POS leverages proprietary data and distribution, offering robust upselling potential and should drive strong future subscription and services revenue. Block is among the best bitcoin businesses available on public markets, with a full-stack approach and the ability to deploy bitcoin services into enormous ecosystems of merchants and consumers. Further, the company earns a very lucrative yield on its Lightning channel, which is seeing booming growth. Block is at a crossroads; it has faced several years of multiple compression and poor stock performance, but recently has inflected EPS and is looking to re-accelerate Square and Cash App growth. Now, execution is everything. Just a few short weeks ago, I wrote one of the most uncomfortable articles in my time writing here for Seeking Alpha. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported objectively bad earnings, with slowing growth and meager guidance. The stock got decimated. It dropped from 20% from around $60 to $45 upon release. Block is personally my top holding and a stock I have written on several times with consistently bullish stances. Watching this stock underperform high-flying AI names and fintech competitors alike for the past few years has been a challenge, to say the least. Even worse, I have been recommending others to buy the stock, just to watch it consistently underperform. My conviction was shaken for the first time after seeing the market response to the recent earnings. But I read through the report with an open mind. What I saw didn't justify a 20% selloff. I began writing. The article was titled 'Don't Let This Selloff Go To Waste' and I rated XYZ a strong buy. It felt horrible at the moment, but I had to stomach that discomfort. Since then, the stock has returned to its pre-earnings level above $60. I didn't expect such a rapid recovery, but there are very clear reasons for such. Since the earnings report, the company has announced significant product launches, management has been far more engaged with retail, and there's been a major step toward the company's bitcoin (BTC-USD) inflection. The company is showing renewed focus on innovation and product velocity. The thesis underpinning my Strong Buy rating in this article is simple: Block will reaccelerate growth through product stack depth, innovation, and solid execution. I typically wouldn't cover a stock again so soon, but there's much to talk about here. Let's dive right in. Square Releases The recovery began with the company's first Square Releases, a new biannual product launch cadence for Square merchants. The first Releases announcement was on May 13th, which coincided with the J.P. Morgan 53rd Annual Technology, Media and Communications Conference. Both CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja presented at the conference. I have a detailed writeup of the conference on my X account . The core takeaways from their talk were: Four key priorities for the rest of the year: expand Cash App Borrow ramp Afterpay on Cash App card market share gains in square and re-acceleration of GPV growth launch of Proto, the Bitcoin mining ASIC business. Expansion of Cash App Borrow is not predicated on an expansion of risk appetite. It’s based on the improved unit economics by switching to SFS (Square Financial Services) for origination & the improved profitability thereof. They can now profitably lend to more users. Acceleration of Square GPV growth will be driven by a revamp of marketing strategy. Currently, 80% of Square customer acquisition is organic/self-serve. The company wants a 50/50 balance between self-serve and internal sales led/partnership driven. Meaning, the sales approach has changed to favor more outbound, free hardware, and contract-driven sales. This approach is what allowed competitors to gain share vs Square in recent years. The shift to field sales has resulted in positive early signs with larger customer wins. Cash App gross profit accelerated in April vs to the March run rate, which now makes the company's poor Q2 guide look ""uncharacteristically conservative"" since it assumed a weakening consumer. Such weakening has not materialized through April and May. The goal of codename: goose is to have a fully autonomous AI agent that can act as a CFO or COO for Square merchants and a personal financial assistant in Cash App. Product velocity and innovation are what will regain shareholder trust, belief, and enthusiasm Both Dorsey and Ahuja expressed far more optimism during the investor conference compared to the earnings call. The stock climbed from $55 to $58 on that day. On the morning of the conference, the company announced one huge product release and one huge teaser: Square Handheld and Square AI. Square Handheld is the best-in-class portable point-of-sale (""POS"") system currently available. It is the thinnest, lightest, has the best camera, offers the most payment methods, can process payments offline, and is very cost competitive. X.com user @nachunja A handheld POS is important for retail stores, restaurants, and any other business where it's advantageous for customers to check out at a non-fixed location. This product launch, alongside the company's revamped marketing strategy, aims to reaccelerate Square GPV growth. I believe it's a winning equation. Square Handheld was the flagship launch of the first Square Releases, but this also came with a host of other updates for each of the company's specific verticals (Food & Beverage, Retail, Services, and Health & Beauty). The most important software update was the launch of a new Square POS unified software interface . It enhances the cross-compatibility of Square software across different devices and is a critical step toward moving up the value chain from SMB's (small-to-medium business) to large enterprises. Finally, the company teased Square AI, an AI model that is native to the Square POS software. It's difficult to understate the opportunity that Square has here. I have consistently shared what, I believe, are the keys to success for AI companies: proprietary data and distribution capability. Square fits both of these very well. Data makes the AI smart and useful, and distribution makes the economics work. Integrating AI into the Square software stack moves it up the value chain once again: it started as a simple way to accept card payments, then became a POS solution for merchants, and then a full-stack ERP platform. Square AI will make it a full-stack business operating system. This is an incredibly robust value proposition for existing merchants and should also attract new merchants quite well. On the distribution front, it will be as simple as a software update. My assumption is that a base-level Square AI offering will be bundled into the Free plan with additional features available for both Plus and Premium plans. www.squareup.com This will help generate further subscription & services growth over time as AI has very clear upselling benefits for both existing and new merchants. In my recent article , I summarized my core long-term thesis as such: Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. The Cash App Borrow news referenced was that the company would begin originating Cash App Borrow loans internally within Square Financial Services, which has a US banking charter. This improves the unit economics of the segment and will generate further growth from the Cash App segment contribution. Square AI will accelerate subscription & services growth from the Square segment contribution. Combined with the company's renewed focus on outbound marketing and customer acquisition, I see a very clear path for Square to begin regaining market share and accelerating growth. Don't just take my word for it, though. Block CEO Jack Dorsey himself agreed with my take on X: x.com The seminal Square Releases Day was a great success and was met with excitement from the market. It encapsulates perfectly my thesis: execution excellence underpinned by deepening POS hardware offerings (deepening the product stack), enhancing software functionality (innovating UI/UX), and building hype for future product innovations with Square AI. This brings me to my next point: management engagement. Management Engagement I have been posting about Block for well over a year now on X but have never seen Jack Dorsey engage with the retail community as much as he has recently. It seems the response to the recent earnings call really did light a fire under him. Just look through his replies . He's been replying directly to retail analysts like myself that provide in-depth coverage of the company, its products, and its growth runway. X.com There are many such examples. Engaging with the retail community on X has become much more common in recent years, with many CEOs and other executives using it as a vehicle to communicate directly to a retail audience. Again, returning to my thesis: engagement with the retail community ensures investors understand the strategic direction the company is pursuing. It's not necessarily enough to launch innovative new products; you also need to market them well and ensure the market understands the innovation. The final component of the stock's recovery is Bitcoin. The company's full-stack bitcoin offerings are attracting more attention as the leading cryptocurrency hits new all-time highs and Bitcoiners gather at bitcoin 2025 . Block's Bitcoin Strategy Block has one of the most robust Bitcoin strategies of any publicly traded company. It offers products aimed at accelerating the adoption of bitcoin as a currency, the capability to buy bitcoin easily and hold it safely, and soon the ability to mine bitcoin. The company also has a Bitcoin treasury dollar-cost-averaging strategy. In other words, it holds bitcoin, allows users to buy bitcoin, is increasing access to bitcoin mining, offers cold storage capabilities, and supports the open-source development community. The biggest product announcement to date for Block's bitcoin strategy, however, came just recently on May 27th at the Bitcoin Conference. The company launched a pilot test allowing Square sellers to accept bitcoin as payment. It hopes to have this feature widely available by 2026. x.com These transactions will be processed on the Lightning Network , a payments protocol on the Bitcoin Blockchain that greatly improves processing time for transactions. Historically, a major criticism of bitcoin as a currency is that transactions take roughly 10 minutes to settle. This is due to the design of the blockchain itself, in which new blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes. Each block contains a variety of data, most importantly it contains a 'merkle root' expression of all transactions that were accepted by nodes during that block time. This is slow and clunky. Lightning, on the other hand, essentially allows two nodes to stow some bitcoin away in a multi-sig channel. The two parties within this channel can now transact privately and instantaneously in a private channel off the main blockchain. Next, many of these nodes can be interconnected to create a web of Lightning nodes, effectively creating the Lightning Network. The network supports multi-hop routing, where payments are forwarded throughout the web of connected channels. These transactions are enforced using hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) and can settle in milliseconds, as long as each node along the path has sufficient liquidity. Block's Cash App is Lightning compatible, and Square bitcoin payments will also rely on Lightning. This allows both Square merchants and Cash App users to transact with bitcoin instantaneously. It creates the most widely deployed bitcoin payment rail. Block's head of Bitcoin, Miles Suter, spoke at the bitcoin conference on May 28th. He mentioned that Cash App has seen a 7x increase YoY in Lightning payment volume and 25% of outbound transactions are now on Lightning. Why does this matter? It matters because Block operates a sizable Lightning channel (the 7th largest, known as c=) and earns nearly 10% bitcoin on bitcoin yield. With 189 bitcoins in the channel (according to mempool), this represents a yield of nearly 20 btc per year. At $100k per coin, this is $2m per year in passive yield on the company's bitcoin, which is otherwise sitting in its treasury. Yield is generated by Lightning nodes when they place BTC liquidity in a channel and open that channel up to route payments through it. This is non-custodial yield, meaning Block still maintains ownership of that bitcoin. They are generating yield with an asset on their balance sheet without introducing counterparty risk. If payments stop flowing, there is no risk to the bitcoin. The yield will just dry up. Bitcoin 2025 livestream The biggest question mark for Square payments, though, is on tax treatment. As it stands, bitcoin is classified as property, meaning it is a commodity and is regulated by the CFTC. Selling a commodity triggers a taxable event, requiring a calculation of profit by taking asset value at time of sale versus cost basis. On the back end of a Square bitcoin transaction, Block would sell bitcoin for the equivalent amount of USD, allowing the customer to pay in bitcoin and the merchant to receive USD. The issue is that this creates a taxable event. But how can you calculate the cost basis? It is conceivable that this is possible for bitcoin purchased through Cash App and held in Cash App, but for any bitcoin paid from an external wallet, it becomes prohibitively difficult to calculate tax. Further, this creates a two-tiered tax (capital gains and sales tax) for customers and disincentivizes use. This question is likely the reason that Block said ""The roll out... is expected to reach all eligible Square sellers in 2026, subject to applicable regulatory approvals."" in the first section of the announcement. Regardless, this move highlights how well the company is driving forward the bitcoin ecosystem. It is helping to bridge the gap of bitcoin adoption from enthusiasts to everyday people. It is building the infrastructure required to facilitate this and has the expansive two-sided merchant / consumer network required to greatly accelerate it. For those that believe that Bitcoin will play an integral role in the financial world of tomorrow, it's difficult to find a company better positioned to boom from that paradigm shift. Assuming that both bitcoin payments on Square and Proto's bitcoin mining chip reach mass rollout in 2026 (this is a fairly big assumption), Block will have successfully tied together its entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Again, this ties into my thesis of product stack deepening (bitcoin mining ASIC) and innovation in existing products (bitcoin payments on square). All that's left for the company's Bitcoin segment is to execute on this. Risks The biggest risk to the thesis of this article is in the thesis itself: execution. Block has faced challenges in the past with execution. The stock has tumbled a long way from the COVID-era highs around $280. In the past few years, Block has gone through layoffs, executive reshuffles, an influx of competitive threats, an ever-changing regulatory environment, a short report, countless analyst downgrades, mass inflation, and the fastest rate hike cycle in recent history. Not a favorable environment for a fintech. Throughout this time, they have been evolving as a company as well. Jack Dorsey sold Twitter and moved back to full-time CEO of the company and brought renewed focused on the ecosystem of ecosystems strategy. Amidst the challenging macro backdrop, the company lost focus on the Square segment. Square is still the market leader, but only by a narrow margin, with around 28% share. Cash App made up for much of this weakness for a while but hasn't grown monthly active users in 5 consecutive quarters. The stock has suffered severe multiple compression since. Despite reporting booming EPS growth, the stock is completely range-bound and has been for 3 years now. Data by YCharts Investor Takeaway We are now at a crossroads. Block's traditional finance segments, Square and Cash App, need to reaccelerate growth. The company is focused on the following things to achieve this: outbound marketing and large business acquisition for Square and network density and teen customer acquisition for Cash App. The company's bitcoin business is doing phenomenal, as we discussed, but this is largely ignored by the market. It is not yet very accretive to Block's financial results, but that will change over time. The execution risk remains. Should the company fail to reignite Square and Cash App growth, the stock will continue lagging the market. This is the opportunity, though. The market is basically pricing in a lack of execution. Despite exceptional EPS growth, the stock trades at only 22x forward PE. Using estimated 2026 earnings, the stock trades at 15x forward PE.

Known for drastically reducing gas fees while enhancing transaction speeds, Arbitrum is emerging as one of the most adopted scaling platforms. With its Orbit upgrade expanding compatibility and new dApps launching rapidly, the ARB token is gaining governance relevance. The network’s surge in usage highlights the growing demand for faster, more efficient Ethereum-compatible chains.Even with these advances, Arbitrum did not address the full spectrum of challenges facing blockchain today—developer friction, real-world onboarding, and cross-domain utility. Qubetics ($TICS) rises to meet those demands. Designed as a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain, Qubetics combines breakthrough development infrastructure with streamlined utility tools, making it a strong candidate for the top cryptocurrency to buy in 2025. With deep developer accessibility, security-first frameworks, and smart contract modularity, Qubetics sets a higher standard for future-ready digital finance ecosystems. Meanwhile, Near Protocol (NEAR) is riding a 20% monthly gain as it tests the neckline of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. Priced at $2.94, the token is nearing the $3 resistance zone, which could trigger a breakout if momentum sustains. Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network has climbed from $124 million in early April to $173 million, reflecting rising DeFi activity. While DEX volume is holding above $17 million, a 7% drop in the stablecoin market cap hints at looming liquidity constraints. Still, NEAR’s technical structure and increasing TVL show promise for growth and adoption. Qubetics: Developer-Centric Innovation That Defines the Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Qubetics is rapidly becoming a front-runner among the top cryptocurrency to buy for developers, businesses, and early adopters. At the core of its value proposition are two powerful tools— QubeQode , a simplified smart contract language designed for efficiency and security, and Qubetics IDE , a custom integrated development environment that allows professionals to build, test, and deploy applications with minimal friction. This developer-first ecosystem lowers the barrier to entry, offering intuitive tooling while ensuring formal verification and modularity remain intact. For businesses, Qubetics creates an accessible path to blockchain integration. The Qubetics IDE supports multi-chain deployment, on-chain automation, and dynamic permission systems that streamline enterprise operations. Professionals can build sector-specific tools without navigating steep learning curves. Individuals benefit from secure dApp engagement and decentralized access, backed by seamless updates and zero downtime architecture. Qubetics Presale ROI and Analyst Insight This foundation of utility is matched by surging community momentum. The ongoing crypto presale of Qubetics has reached stage 36, selling over 514 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,300 participants, with $17.5 million raised. At the current presale price of $0.3064, Qubetics provides a unique entry point into one of the fastest-growing Web3 ecosystems. Those who entered at stage 1, priced at $0.01, are already looking at a 2,964% ROI. Yet the presale isn’t over—participants entering now are still strategically positioned for compelling gains. If $TICS reaches $1 post-launch, stage 36 buyers see a 226% ROI. At $5, the return expands to 1,531%, and at $6 it climbs to 1,857%. A move to $10 implies a 3,163% return, while a post-mainnet rally to $15 could deliver up to 4,794% ROI. The presale continues to attract developers and backers seeking the top cryptocurrency to buy before market-wide awareness kicks in. With innovation, traction, and tools already in place, Qubetics is not just a potential contender—it’s setting the benchmark. Arbitrum: Ethereum’s Most Practical Scaling Layer Gains Traction Arbitrum’s rise as a Layer-2 solution has made it a staple for Ethereum-based projects aiming to minimize gas fees and accelerate execution. Full EVM compatibility allows seamless deployment of existing Ethereum apps, making the migration process effortless. Governance under the ARB token allows participants to vote on network upgrades, staking mechanics, and long-term development strategy. With the Arbitrum Orbit upgrade, new use cases continue to roll out, and projects are increasingly choosing the platform for its speed and affordability. Arbitrum is viewed as essential infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, especially as the demand for L2 adoption climbs across DeFi, NFT, and gaming. Arbitrum is among the top cryptocurrency to buy for participants seeking proven scalability and Ethereum synergy, but it lacks the holistic builder toolset and modular design offered by Qubetics. Near Protocol: Momentum Builds Amid Technical Reversal Hopes Near Protocol (NEAR) is testing a breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, suggesting bullish strength. With its current price nearing the critical $3 neckline, the next few sessions may define its short-term trajectory. The MACD indicator is nearing a bullish crossover, while TVL has steadily climbed to $173 million. Still, caution exists. The 7% drop in Near’s stablecoin market cap suggests some users are pulling liquidity, raising questions about the network’s short-term capital health. That said, strong on-chain metrics like consistent DEX volume and rising TVL indicate a rebound could be near. NEAR is positioned among the top cryptocurrency to buy for those seeking trend reversals backed by on-chain growth, but it lacks the early-stage ROI opportunity and developer integration edge seen in Qubetics. Final Thoughts Arbitrum delivers scalability. Near shows strengthening DeFi metrics and technical promise. Yet only Qubetics offers a comprehensive environment built for speed, flexibility, and real-world usability—all while enabling entry at an early presale phase with unmatched upside. Qubetics stands apart with QubeQode and Qubetics IDE—developer tools that simplify smart contract creation and streamline enterprise adoption. The numbers are clear: over 27,300 participants, $17.5 million raised, and more than 514 million tokens sold. With the presale still open at $0.3064, this is more than a blockchain opportunity—it’s a chance to gain early access to a network with foundational advantages. For those seeking the top cryptocurrency to buy with tangible utility, scalable potential, and immediate access—Qubetics delivers the full package.

45319694,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69123,1748673263,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Zumo Acknowledges XRP Powerful Use Cases As Bridge Currency,https://timestabloid.com/zumo-acknowledges-xrp-powerful-uses-cases-as-bridge-currency/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has drawn attention to a newly surfaced insight from a Zumo report, identifying Ripple’s XRP token as a highly suitable candidate for wholesale applications within single-currency domestic zones. The assessment appears in Zumo’s publication, titled “Digital assets 2023: identifying the opportunities across the enterprise landscape.” It refers to the specific benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in business-to-business (B2B) digital asset payments. Ripple’s XRP token—> “attractive for WHOLESALE applications in domestic/single-currency-zone contexts, where blockchain/DLT-derived advantages (cost/ speed/programmability/automated reconciliation) can potentially be realised without the awkwardness of the digital asset fiat… https://t.co/DDvBlO58Cb pic.twitter.com/PDa15AYV1N — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 28, 2025 Enterprise Friction in Crypto-to-Fiat Conversion The report makes the case that the inefficiencies and friction associated with converting cryptoassets into local fiat currencies remain a core challenge in early-stage enterprise adoption. The analysis specifically notes that many crypto-based payments currently require off-ramps back into fiat to complete transactions or satisfy regulatory, tax, and accounting requirements. This hinders their seamless integration into operational payment flows. Ripple and XRP Positioned for Domestic Optimization Zumo highlights several blockchain projects that aim to address these cost and conversion issues. Ripple is mentioned directly alongside Stellar in the context of working to reduce these frictions, with the report calling out XRP and its intermediary token role as part of this effort. In a key section, the authors write that the XRP token is “attractive for wholesale applications in domestic/single-currency-zone contexts, where blockchain/DLT-derived advantages (cost/speed/programmability/automated reconciliation) can potentially be realised without the awkwardness of the digital asset fiat bridge.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This analysis suggests that XRP’s architecture and integration features make it particularly well-suited for domestic wholesale environments, where the need to convert between different fiat currencies is removed. Institutions can more directly benefit from blockchain’s technical efficiencies. Gradual Adoption Within Enterprise Financial Infrastructure The commentary aligns with Ripple’s long-standing positioning of XRP as a liquidity and settlement token for financial institutions and enterprises. By eliminating the need for complex cross-border fiat bridges in domestic contexts, XRP may offer banks and corporations a viable path to DLT integration without requiring full-scale disruption of existing fiat systems. This has implications for how enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure may be deployed in the near term, focusing first on domestic efficiencies before scaling into more complex, cross-border models. CBDC Complexity Reinforces XRP’s Immediate Use Case The Zumo report also includes a statement from HSBC Managing Director Mark Williamson, reinforcing the broader challenges surrounding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and digital assets in cross-border use. Williamson emphasizes the need to solve what he calls the “CBDC Rubik’s cube,” encompassing wholesale and retail models, token- and account-based systems, as well as primary and secondary market integration. The inclusion of such commentary further contextualizes the digital asset landscape, within which XRP is positioned as a practical tool for enterprise-level financial applications. SMQKE’s tweet underscores growing institutional acknowledgment of XRP’s potential in practical, regulated settings. The recognition of XRP’s advantages—specifically cost reduction, speed, and programmability—adds to the token’s evolving narrative as a purpose-built settlement mechanism within tokenized finance frameworks. As enterprises continue to evaluate and adopt blockchain solutions, XRP’s utility in streamlined, domestic payment environments may become increasingly relevant.

The AI pace of change feels unlike anything we’ve witnessed before – distinct from the shifts brought by mobile, social media, or cloud computing. This isn’t just a feeling; it’s a reality underscored by data. Venture capitalist Mary Meeker, renowned for her previous ‘Internet Trends’ reports, has released a new, extensive slideshow report titled “Trends — Artificial Intelligence.” Across its 340 pages, the word “unprecedented” appears 51 times, specifically used to describe the speed of AI’s development, adoption, investment, and usage. As Meeker writes, “The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented, as supported by the data.” Understanding the Unprecedented AI Speed What exactly makes this wave of AI different? The data points highlighted in the Mary Meeker report paint a clear picture of acceleration. Here are some key indicators: User Adoption: Achieving 800 million users in just 17 months, as seen with platforms like ChatGPT, is a speed of consumer adoption never before recorded for a new technology. Company Growth: The rate at which new AI companies are reaching high annual recurring revenue (ARR) milestones is significantly faster than in previous tech cycles. Cost Reduction (Inference): The cost of using AI models (inference costs), calculated per 1 million tokens, has dropped dramatically by 99% over the past two years, according to research cited by Meeker. This rapid decrease makes AI more accessible and fuels wider adoption. Cost Increase (Training): While usage costs fall, the cost of training large AI models has surged, sometimes reaching up to $1 billion. This highlights the immense investment required at the foundational level of AI development. This combination of rapid user adoption and plunging usage costs, despite high training costs, creates a unique market dynamic. What’s Driving the AI Adoption Speed? Beyond user demand, several factors contribute to the astonishing AI adoption speed documented by Meeker. Competition is fierce, leading companies to quickly match and improve upon features offered by rivals, often at lower costs. The rise of open-source AI models, particularly from international players, further intensifies this competition and lowers barriers to entry. Hardware advancements are also playing a crucial role. Meeker points out significant efficiency gains in specialized AI chips. For example, Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell GPU is vastly more energy-efficient per token than its 2014 predecessor. Companies like Google and Amazon are heavily investing in developing their own custom AI chips (TPUs and Trainium, respectively) at scale for their cloud infrastructure. These are not minor initiatives; they are described as “foundational bets” that enable faster and cheaper AI processing, directly impacting the pace of adoption. Exploring Key AI Technology Trends The report delves into several critical AI technology trends shaping the current landscape. The shift towards more efficient hardware, the increasing sophistication of models, and the proliferation of specialized AI applications are all contributing to this accelerated pace. The competition between proprietary models and open-source alternatives is also a significant trend, driving innovation and potentially lowering costs for end-users and businesses. While the technological progress is undeniable and happening at an unprecedented AI speed, the financial returns story is less clear-cut. Venture capital is flowing into AI companies rapidly, but these companies, along with cloud providers, are also incurring massive expenses due to the infrastructure demands of AI development and deployment. The significant investment required for computing power, data storage, and talent means that profitability for many remains a future goal. Benefits, Challenges, and the Path Ahead The rapid advancements and dropping inference costs are largely beneficial for consumers and enterprises. They gain access to increasingly powerful AI tools and services at more affordable rates, fostering innovation and efficiency across various sectors. This is a direct result of the intense competition and technological progress highlighted in the Mary Meeker report . However, the primary challenge remains identifying which companies will successfully navigate the high investment requirements and intense competition to become profitable, long-term leaders in the AI space. As Meeker aptly puts it, “Only time will tell which side of the money-making equation the current AI aspirants will land.” For individuals and businesses, the actionable insight is clear: stay informed and be prepared for continuous, rapid change. The AI revolution is not slowing down; understanding its drivers and implications is crucial for navigating the future landscape, whether you are involved in technology, finance, or any industry being reshaped by AI. In conclusion, Mary Meeker’s report confirms what many have sensed: the current era of AI development and adoption is truly unprecedented in its speed and scope. Driven by technological advancements, fierce competition, and massive investment, the AI pace of change is reshaping industries and presenting both incredible opportunities and significant challenges.

Bitcoin is down over 2% today, trading at $103,700. Smart contract platforms also took a big hit as Solana fell 6.3%, Sui dropped 7.8%, and Avalanche slid 7.3%. Crypto stocks were also affected as Bitdeer (BTDR) sank 8.3% after a big rally, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) dipped 2.7% and Coinbase (COIN) lost 1.3%. U.S.-China Trade Tensions Startle Crypto Markets The rising U.S.-China tensions are back in focus after a brief truce earlier this month. President Trump accused China of violating the tariff agreement, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox interview that trade talks with Chinese representatives had “stalled.” In response, China called on the U.S. to “immediately correct its erroneous actions and cease discriminatory restrictions,” according to the BBC. Earlier, the easing of tensions had fueled a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin, but the renewed conflict could now erase those gains. Memecoins See Sharp Pullback Bitcoin has dropped 6% over the past week. Whale activity shows signs of a comeback, but technical signals are still flashing warning signs. A death cross also looms for Bitcoin, and if it falls below the $104,584 support, it could slide further toward $100,694. Bulls need to reclaim $106,726 to regain control and prevent deeper losses. Memecoins also saw a sharp pullback, with over $10 billion wiped from their market cap in just seven days. It dropped from $74 billion to $64 billion, which is the lowest since May 9. Over $11.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options were to expire yesterday , which had a major impact on their short-term price action. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Liquidations Nearly $1B Today: Time to Exit and Take Profits? , Open Interest Drops, Liquidations Hit $800M The Fear and Greed Index has also dropped from 74 to 69, a three-week low. Over 217,000 traders were liquidated recently, with over $800 million in total liquidations across the crypto market. Over the past 24 hours, there have been $716 million in total liquidations. Bitcoin futures saw a $3.7 billion drop in open interest as BTC fell from $108,000 to $104,500. This sharp pullback signals a healthy reset, clearing out overleveraged positions and cooling market hype. While Bitcoin could soon dip to $100,000, however, data shows that a drop below that level could be short-lived. CryptoQuant’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart shows there is only mild profit-taking, which is far less than the sell-offs seen at market tops in 2024. This hints that the market isn’t overheated and Bitcoin’s uptrend may still have room to run. If Bitcoin drops below $100,000, the $96,000 would be a key support level attracting buyers and limiting further drops. Trader Altcoin Sherpa points to a strong support zone between $102K–$104.5K and expects a bounce that could push Bitcoin above $107K in the coming days . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

An analyst suggests that holding the current range over the weekend will be key for the long-awaited rally back to $200. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Solana Hits Multi-Week Low Amid the crypto market pullback, most cryptocurrencies are recording a red Friday, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) momentarily losing some key levels. Solana, one of the cycle’s leading Altcoins, followed the rest of the market and registered a 6% retracement in the daily timeframe. SOL has seen a significant recovery from its multi-month downtrend, which led the token to hit a 14-month low of $95 during the early April retraces. Over the past month and a half, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed multiple crucial levels, setting the stage for a potential rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the key $180 resistance despite hitting a three-month high of $187 a week ago. A reclaim of this key barrier could push SOL’s price toward the $200 mark, enabling a rally to new highs. Today’s price action has sent Solana to a 22-day low of $156 after losing its $164-$180 price range and the $160 support zone for the first time since the May 8 breakout. Trader and analyst Crypto Bullet shared a bearish outlook for Solana, suggesting that the token will underperform for the rest of the year. He highlighted SOL’s trading pair against ETH, noting that the cryptocurrency has been in a rising wedge in the weekly chart since the Q4 2024 rally. According to the SOL/ETH chart posted by the trader, the cryptocurrency has broken down out of the formation after losing the 0.069 mark. To Crypto Bullet, this signals that “ETH will soon pump way harder than SOL.” All Eyes On SOL’s Weekly Close Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Solana is attempting to continue Weekly Closing within its Range High resistance, which is key for its long-term rally. He previously explained that the cryptocurrency re-entered its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range after successfully reclaiming the $120 barrier last month and consolidating within the $160-$175 range high. To the analyst, SOL’s price “needs to continue demonstrating price stability” around this zone, as that is what is “required for SOL to break out from this range into the $200+ levels.” He affirmed that Solana needs to aim for a retest similar to late 2024, when the cryptocurrency built a base around the Range High ahead of the breakout with multiple weekly closes near the resistance zone, which led to a massive breakout to the $200 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeating Early 2024’s Playbook – $3,800 Target In Sight? Rekt Capital highlighted that SOL has been successfully retesting this area as support over the past few weeks. However, he warned that cryptocurrency mustn’t close below the current price zone as it would “tease a possible loss of this region as support.” A drop below this range could lead to a retrace into the Range Low, between the $120-$135 mark. “Price stability at the Orange Range High going forward is thus key here,” he concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $159, an 11.6% decline in the weekly timeframe.

33767162,[object Object],1748674842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Mining On Wheels: Gemini Powers Bitcoin With A Cybertruck,https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-powers-bitcoin-with-a-cybertruck/,"Gemini rolled into the Bitcoin 2025 Conference with a Tesla Cybertruck that did more than turn heads. The truck, dubbed the “Cyberbeast,” was painted in black-and-gold Bitcoin vinyl and hooked up to a compact Bitaxe Gamma miner. Attendees watched live as the setup mined Bitcoin right in the back of the truck. Cybertruck’s Mining Demo Steals The Show According to conference reports, the Cyberbeast edition brings an 845-horsepower tri-motor system and can tow up to 11,000 pounds. It isn’t just for hauling gear. In Gemini’s demo, the truck powered the Bitaxe device through its own battery pack and even handled a quick recharge. The miner itself connects over Wi-Fi, works quietly, and only needs a normal household outlet. Solo Satoshi Units Power The Rig Based on reports from Solo Satoshi, the maker of the Bitaxe Gamma, over 10,000 of their open-source miners sold in April. That added more than 10 petahashes (PH) to the global Bitcoin network. Mining bitcoin from the Cybertruck @SoloSatoshi pic.twitter.com/4rlyemPToV — Gemini (@Gemini) May 28, 2025 The Gamma model is energy-efficient. It draws about the same power as a space heater and can fit in a backpack. That makes it a favorite for home users who don’t want a noisy machine in their living room. Sweepstakes Ties Trading To Entries Gemini linked this stunt to a sweepstakes in the US running from May 19 to June 18, 2025. Anyone 18 or older can enter. Two winners will each get a Cybertruck “ Cyberbeast ” valued at $113,735. They’ll also receive $2,000 for travel and cash to help cover taxes. You earn one entry for every $50 spent on the Gemini Credit Card or traded on the Gemini Exchange. You can rack up to 20,000 entries total—10,000 from card use and 10,000 from trading. Mining Faces New Challenges In 2025 Based on data from April 2024, the mining reward fell from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC after the halving. That cut earnings in half overnight. Hashprice—the revenue you make per terahash per day—slid from $0.12 last year to $0.049 this April. Network difficulty climbed to a record 123 trillion. Miners now need gear that sips power to keep running. Despite the tougher math, network strength is rising. Reports show the total Bitcoin hashrate hit 831 exahashes per second (EH/s) this month, with peaks near 921 EH/s. That’s up 77% from the 2024 low of 519 EH/s. New rigs and higher Bitcoin prices are pushing the numbers up. Bitcoin itself flirted with a new all-time high close to $112,000 in recent weeks. Gemini’s Cybertruck mining setup is more than a stunt. It suggests a future where mining could happen outside warehouse farms.

New U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings show Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 – a 6.64% increase in three months. According to the filing, Buffett has allocated most of the firm’s cash reserves to US Treasuries as of Q1 2025, followed by investments in equity securities at $263.735 billion. Berkshire also has a $36.892 billion cash position as of last quarter, which ended in March. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire’s trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan’s holdings at $297.8 billion. If Warren Buffett’s investment firm were a nation, it would be the 11th-largest foreign holder of Treasury Securities, just behind France’s $363.1 billion, Ireland’s $329.3 billion and Switzerland’s $311.6 billion holdings. Berkshire’s push for yield on its cash comes after the firm offloaded $3.23 billion worth of shares in three US banking giants last quarter. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million.

45320704,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69143,1748675381,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple (XRP) Can Integrate with SWIFT, NACHA and Federal Reserve",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-can-integrate-with-swift-nacha-and-federal-reserve/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has drawn attention to a series of document excerpts that reinforce Ripple’s ability to integrate with major financial infrastructure systems such as NACHA, SWIFT, and the Federal Reserve. In a tweet captioned, “Yes, Ripple can integrate with NACHA, SWIFT, and the Federal Reserve. Documented 4x.” SMQKE referenced highlighted portions from what appear to be institutional or regulatory texts. These texts detail Ripple’s compatibility with existing financial standards and networks, suggesting that Ripple’s distributed ledger technology can operate in conjunction with, rather than in replacement of, traditional systems. Yes, Ripple can integrate with NACHA, SWIFT and the Federal Reserve. Documented 4x. https://t.co/HYf3336Xd1 pic.twitter.com/DIoeS5v7wA — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 29, 2025 NACHA and Ripple: Parallel Roles in Payment Governance One excerpt underscores the idea that Ripple could be integrated into or modeled after a self-regulatory body like NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association). NACHA governs ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions in the U.S. and sets rules and responsibilities for financial institutions. The document indicates that Ripple’s structure, based on distributed and decentralized user participation, aligns with the framework NACHA provides. The implication is that Ripple could operate within the same regulatory scope without disrupting existing legal and operational frameworks. It also notes that NACHA’s rules could be extended to define how financial institutions interact with Ripple. SWIFT’s Messaging Standards and Ripple’s Settlement Layer Another section cited in the tweet distinguishes SWIFT and Ripple . While SWIFT operates as a messaging system that does not settle payments itself, Ripple offers a full settlement layer using its distributed ledger. Despite their functional differences, the document explicitly states that “SWIFT and Ripple could easily exist in the same space,” including scenarios where SWIFT could utilize Ripple’s distributed ledger . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This speaks directly to concerns about redundancy or conflict between traditional messaging systems and blockchain-based solutions. The documentation confirms that interoperability, rather than exclusivity, is a feasible and perhaps intended design goal. Ripple’s Settlement Protocol and Global Institutional Adoption A further excerpt outlines the possibility that several financial institution networks could be built on top of Ripple’s common settlement protocol. The example given involves NACHA using Ripple’s infrastructure to create standardized rules for dispute resolution, compliance, and other aspects of payment processing. This is further supported by the mention of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) region banks in Europe potentially adopting a similar approach. The potential scope of Ripple’s network is therefore not limited to the U.S., reinforcing its global relevance. Federal Reserve Compatibility and Standards Enforcement Finally, one document emphasizes the role of regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Reserve, in setting and enforcing standards for Ripple. The excerpt clearly states that messaging standards, such as those used by SWIFT, can be integrated into Ripple. This indicates that Ripple is built with compliance and interoperability in mind, allowing it to operate within the boundaries set by central regulatory institutions. The documentation highlighted by SMQKE provides concrete references to Ripple’s ability to work alongside and within existing financial systems such as NACHA, SWIFT , and the Federal Reserve. Rather than acting as a disruptive force that seeks to replace these institutions, Ripple is positioned as a complementary system capable of enhancing efficiency while remaining compatible with established regulatory frameworks. This perspective, backed by multiple citations from formal texts, reinforces Ripple’s potential role in the modernization of global payment systems.

45320746,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738264,1748675461,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45320746.jpeg,FTX begins its second payout round of $5 billion,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ftx-kicks-off-5b-payout-to-creditors/,"FTX has started its second distribution round of payments to its creditors. The exchange is set to pay more than $5 billion to holders in the Plan’s Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who met pre-distribution requirements. In a post on X on Friday, the FTX stated that creditors should begin seeing the funds reflected in their accounts within one to three business days. FTX revealed second round payout breakdown FTX previously announced that the second distribution would include a 72% payout for Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims, 54% for US Customer Entitlement Claims, and 61% each for General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims. Convenience Claims are set to receive a 120% payout. The exchange also stated that all eligible creditors will receive funds through its distribution service partners, Kraken and Bitgo. On Friday, John J. Ray III, Plan Administrator of the FTX Recovery Trust, commented on the rollout’s start, saying: “Today’s announcement represents continued progress returning cash to FTX’s customers and creditors. I am proud of the outstanding success of the recoveries to date. Our work continues on recovering more for creditors and resolving outstanding claims.” John J. Ray III On X, the exchange also asked customers to remain cautious of phishing emails and scam websites from channels that may appear to look like the FTX Customer Portal. Meanwhile, crypto investors and speculators are waiting for the impact of reimbursements, knowing how they could easily sway digital asset market prices if recipients sell or swap their funds on retail exchanges. In February, FTX completed its first round of repayments, distributing $1.2 billion to holders with claims under $50,000. At the time, Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, suggested that a significant portion of these funds might find their way back into the crypto markets. FTX payouts are based on 2022 crypto prices During its first round of payments, Julian Grigo, head of institutions and fintech at asset custody, argued that some creditors may have been dissatisfied. He claimed that while its reimbursements brought relief to some of its customers, there were still some concerns over the plan. He argued that most holders will only get a portion of their original holdings, and then again, they will only be repaid based on asset prices at the time of the exchange’s collapse. BTC-related repayments, especially, have troubled investors since they are calculated using November 2022 valuations, when it was only trading at around $20,000. Since then, the crypto asset has risen in value, currently trading between $90,000 and $112,000. The pricing differences have undoubtedly caused analysts to question fair value determination in bankruptcy proceedings. FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri and other creditors had previously filed a petition to have the exchange repay customers as per current market prices. However, the court ruled against the proposal, and Kavuri claims that, as a result, creditors received only 10%–25% of the current value of their crypto holdings. Earlier this year, Kavuri also called the people’s attention to multiple creditors in 163 countries who are ineligible to receive reimbursements. He stated that countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Greenland, Iran, Russia, and China have imposed restrictions on custodial exchanges Kraken and BitGo; hence, residents cannot claim distributions. He noted that China is the largest jurisdiction ineligible for FTX claim distributions, seeing that it makes up about 8% of the global customer base.

These are Shiba Inu (SHIB) with whispers of another potential 16,290% rally and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a rising altcoin challenging legacy tokens with aggressive growth momentum. Mutuum Finance is emerging as the best altcoin to invest in now, drawing eyes with its low entry point and high-return projections. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.4 million with over 11,500 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. As the market shifts and investors weigh what cryptocurrency to buy now, this matchup between legacy hype and fresh innovation may define which portfolios outperform in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Upside as Burn Rate and Community Fuel Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000014, with minimal downward action but resolute within the broader market consolidation context. Overall, all things considered, SHIB continues to gain speculative attention in spite of recent price stasis owing to its continuous burn programs, this week’s 41 million token burn among them, aimed at reducing circulating supply and enhancing scarcity. With long-term forecasts pointing to potential moves towards $0.0001, several analysts are forecasting over 600% returns are within reach in a healthy bull cycle. With SHIB building increasing utility via its Shibarium Layer-2 network and being well-supported by its community, it is a top pick among meme-based investments. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also attracting investor attention for its low-cap growth potential ahead of the next cycle. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built not to fall to the collapse risk of its algorithmic counterparts. This transparent and secure architecture, supported by open-source smart contracts and now formally attested through the completion of a Certik audit, guarantees healthy financial transactions. With the intersection of next-generation lending technology and robust infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is reshaping the future of decentralized finance. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.4 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,500 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. SHIB may offer explosive returns through speculation and burn mechanics, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings real DeFi innovation, strong utility, and audited security. With $9.4M raised, 11,500+ investors, and a presale price of $0.03 (set to rise by 16.67%), early buyers could see 100% gains by launch. Act now before the next price jump.

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum price of $19.30 with an average of $16.75. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $61.24 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $4.48 (+0.49%) Market Cap $7.08 Billion Trading Volume $200.27 Million Circulating Supply 1.58B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $4.61 24-hour Low $4.36 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.64% 50-Day SMA $4.25 14-Day RSI 48.32 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $4.78 Polkadot price analysis: DOT faces bearish domination around $4 Downtrend persists. DOT stays in a bearish pattern, with repeated tests of support and resistance levels showing continued seller control. Price pressure tightens resistance at $4.22, holds firm, while $3.91 is tested repeatedly, increasing the risk of a breakdown. Buyers’ weak recovery efforts have failed to regain momentum, leaving DOT near its session low and signaling hesitation to reverse the trend. Polkadot (DOT) is currently priced at $3.96, reflecting a 5.78% drop on May 31, 2025. The daily session opened with sharp declines, driven by increased selling pressure. The intraday low reached $3.91, while the high was capped at $4.22. The current price action signals a prevailing bearish sentiment with sellers dominating the market. DOT’s all-time high stands at $55.00 from November 4, 2021, and its all-time low is $2.69, set on August 20, 2020. This marks a steep 92.76% decline from its peak but a 47.86% rise from its historical low. Polkadot on 1-day chart: DOT has a persistent downtrend and bearish momentum DOT established a downtrend during the daily timeframe that persisted through May. The chart shows multiple failed attempts to break above $4.20, leading to further declines. The daily candlesticks exhibit strong bearish control, with long upper wicks and solid red bodies. Sellers are aggressively pushing prices lower, leaving limited room for recovery within the daily session. DOT/USDT Chart: 1-day Volume patterns indicate a substantial increase in sell-side activity, while the RSI trends toward oversold conditions. The MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, suggesting sustained downward momentum. If $3.91 breaks, DOT could slide further. However, if buyers manage to reclaim $4.22, a potential reversal may occur. Polkadot on 4-hour chart: DOT consolidation with strong resistance and weak support The 4-hour chart reveals a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows, confirming the bearish market structure. DOT’s resistance at $4.22 has held firm, preventing any upward move. Sellers have consistently rejected breakout attempts, with price levels returning toward support at $3.91. DOT/USDT Chart: 4-hour The RSI is below 30, indicating ongoing pressure. The MACD remains negative, with both lines diverging downward. If $3.91 is broken decisively, DOT could face deeper declines, with the next key support below. A breakout above $4.22 could signal an intraday reversal, but current momentum suggests this is unlikely without a shift in volume. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $4.62 BUY SMA 5 $4.93 SELL SMA 10 $4.78 SELL SMA 21 $4.47 BUY SMA 50 $4.13 BUY SMA 100 $4.42 BUY SMA 200 $4.9 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $4.35 BUY EMA 5 $4.17 BUY EMA 10 $4.07 BUY EMA 21 $4.13 BUY EMA 50 $4.44 BUY EMA 100 $4.95 SELL EMA 200 $5.4 SELL What to expect next? Polkadot’s (DOT) price remains under pressure as it consolidates between resistance at $4.22 and support at $3.91. If sellers continue to dominate and the $3.91 support breaks decisively, DOT may head lower toward the next key support, intensifying the bearish trend. However, a sudden reversal above $4.22 could shift sentiment, opening the way for a potential short-term recovery. The overall market mood for DOT appears bearish, with traders watching for either a breakdown or a rebound from these critical levels. Until a clear breakout occurs, consolidation with a downward bias is likely to persist. Is Polkadot a good investment? Currently, Polkadot (DOT) faces intense downward pressure, with technicals pointing to a prevailing bearish trend. Resistance at $4.22 and repeated testing of $3.91 support suggest limited upward momentum and heightened risk of further declines. The long-term potential of DOT depends on broader market recovery and the network’s continued development. However, the current price action and market structure indicate caution for new entries until an apparent reversal or strong support is confirmed. Traders should monitor key levels closely for signs of stabilization or further breakdown. Why is Polkadot down today Polkadot (DOT) is down 5.78% today, trading at $3.96, due to sustained selling pressure in the broader market and persistent bearish sentiment. The resistance at $4.22 has prevented any significant upward move, while repeated tests of the $3.91 support level have signaled market hesitation and vulnerability to further declines. Will Polkadot recover? Polkadot (DOT) shows signs of recovery with a recent upward trend. If favorable market conditions continue, we could see a bullish trend, and Polkadot has the potential to recover.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In December 2024, Polkadot showed signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4. In January 2025, Polkadot peaked at $7.98 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $4.64 – $5.28 in February. In March, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) traded at approximately $4.30. In April 2025, Polkadot (DOT) experienced a gradual downtrend, with its price hovering slightly below the $4 mark amid ongoing market volatility. In May, Polkadot (DOT) began trading at around $4.1 and showed moderate fluctuations.

This announcement follows a decision made earlier this year confirming that these tokens do not meet the legal definition of securities under U.S. law. Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasized that while meme coins are part of a vibrant crypto niche, they do not fall under the agency’s regulatory purview. Peirce made the statement during the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas , noting that investors in meme coins should not expect traditional protections from the SEC. SEC Takes a Hands-Off Approach — Similar to NFTs Peirce drew comparisons between the current surge in meme coin interest and the NFT boom of 2021. Like NFTs, meme coins often fall outside regulatory frameworks, meaning buyers are engaging with minimal oversight or recourse in the event of fraud or volatility. The meme coin segment has grown substantially, with a current market capitalization of over $62 billion and a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $10 billion. Top tokens in this category include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, $TRUMP, and Bonk. The $TRUMP Token: A Politically Charged Meme Coin Launched in January shortly before the presidential inauguration, the $TRUMP token surged to $44.28 before stabilizing around $10.71. Notably, around 80% of its token supply is reportedly controlled by the Trump Organization and its affiliates, raising concerns over potential conflicts of interest. Lawmakers such as Senator Richard Blumenthal have raised ethical questions about the Trump family potentially profiting from crypto projects while holding political influence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? , Regulatory Shift or Political Strategy? The SEC has also recently dropped its legal battle against Binance , a move many see as reflective of the current administration’s more crypto-friendly stance. While some speculate that these regulatory decisions may align with President Trump’s pro-crypto policies , Commissioner Peirce firmly denied any political motivation. “Our goal is to create a better regulatory environment for all participants,” she said . Peirce also defended the SEC’s decision to rescind Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which previously restricted banks from offering crypto custody services. Investor Takeaway: Proceed With Caution While the SEC’s clarification offers legal clarity, it simultaneously underscores the risk for retail investors. Without regulatory protection, meme coin investments remain highly speculative. As this space continues to grow and intertwine with political narratives, it is increasingly important for investors to conduct due diligence, verify token ownership structures, and consider the broader implications of their investment choices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

45321364,https://nulltx.com/?p=150090,1748676956,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Pump.fun Sends $25.7M in SOL to Kraken as Transaction Fee Revenue Surges,https://nulltx.com/pump-fun-sends-25-7m-in-sol-to-kraken-as-transaction-fee-revenue-surges/,"Pump.fun , a top platform in the Solana ecosystem for creating and trading meme tokens, has made the news again—but this time, it’s not about a new meme token. At 11:30 AM (UTC) yesterday, pump.fun moved a colossal 156,000 SOL (equivalent to $25.71 million) to the centralized exchange Kraken. This transaction represents almost three weeks’ worth of stale fee income. And it isn’t just another horn-blowing at what has to be regarded as an insane revenue-generating platform. This is more than a profit. The pump.fun team’s actions have serious implications for the Solana ecosystem and might lead to the latest token generation event on Solana. The platform’s revenue model, which charges fees on token launches and transactions, continues to rake in millions of dollars on a consistent basis. According to data from DeFiLlama, pump.fun has been averaging around $1.3 million per day in transaction fees. The timing of this recent transfer aligns closely with that daily figure over the past 19 days, pointing to a systematic off-ramping strategy employed by the platform to convert on-chain earnings into fiat or centralized holdings. Regular Transfers Suggest Systematic Revenue Strategy It is not the first time that pump.fun has made a move like this. On-chain data illustrates that the platform routinely accumulates transaction fees in SOL over a period of one to two weeks before transferring them out in bulk to Kraken. These withdrawals are part of a long-standing pattern — a well-oiled revenue engine quietly extracting value from one of the most speculative corners of the crypto market. According to reports, pump.fun has sold more than 4.025 million SOL over the past year. The total roughly amounts to $727 million. That volume has been liquidated at an average price of $180.70 per SOL, a not-so-obvious indication of what might be the first truly profitable crypto exchange. pump. fun 在半小时前将 15.6 万枚 SOL ($25.71M) 手续费收入转进 Kraken。 根据 defillama 上的数据，近期 pump. fun 每天的手续费收入在 $130 万左右。这跟他们本次隔了 19 天转出的 SOL 价值是比较吻合的。 pump. fun 每在积累了一到两周的手续费收入后就会将这些 SOL 转进… https://t.co/acS6GMtMrq pic.twitter.com/xsWvfhKqbV — 余烬 (@EmberCN) May 30, 2025 Most of our activity in crypto space happens on exchanges. So if you pay close attention to almost any crypto project or platform these days, you’ll notice they all say something like: “Watch us on exchanges!” Or, “Follow our price fluctuations on exchanges!” With this in mind, let’s try to understand the events of the last few days under an even_mi_meme umbrella. Meme Token Frenzy Fuels the Engine pump.fun has achieved current success due to the meme token frenzy, especially among those on the Solana blockchain. In recent months, there has been a wild uptick in the number of inexpensive, viral tokens being thrown around on Solana — many of which seem to be spun up within moments on platforms like pump.fun. Even if most of these tokens are bound to death spiral anyway, the sheer volume and transactional activity of them across the pump.fun ecosystem is generating huge fee income for the platform. What makes pump.fun unique is how straightforward its interface is and how large its user base is. Every new token that gets launched pays a fee, and every trade adds to the transaction fee pool — which the platform collects in SOL. With the hype around meme coins showing no sign of letting up, especially on Solana, pump.fun is perfectly positioned to capture more of this slice of the mania-fueled economy. The most recent $25.71 million payment to Kraken underscores the effect spinning into action here. More user speculation means more fees, and those fees lead directly to greater liquidity for pump.fun and its principals. What This Means for the Broader Solana Ecosystem Pump.fun consistently brings in a healthy income; this shows Solana is a healthy network. The mean transaction volume of pump.fun is a string of soloing on Solana; this means the pump.fun is confirming Solana’s claims of being a low-fee, fast-speed network. Some people suggest more and more that the meme coin activity is unsustainable, and that’s just a signal for the crypto whales to pull out. In fact, the raw numbers coming out of pump.fun suggest otherwise: They’re real, driving real volume, and they’re bringing in real dinero. Platform sends regular payments to Kraken; why? Periodic payments from the platform to Kraken raise more questions than they answer about pump.fun’s sustainability and long-term planning. Is the platform just a short-term liquidity extractor, or does it have some kind of long-term roadmap? So far, the team has kept largely mum on the question. No matter what happens from this point, pump.fun has made itself a potent presence in the current crypto world. As long as guesswork crypto trading remains alive and well — and as long as users are willing to pay for the privilege — pump.fun will likely continue to be one of the most minting-at-will entities in the DeFi space. For both watchers and merchants, the communication is evident: keep an eye on the fees. For in the midst of a speculative frenzy, pump.fun is almost assuredly right there at the peak, collecting its quiet, ancillary profits, and sending tens of millions in SOL out to Kraken.

Cold storage is when traders move their assets off exchanges and into hardware wallets, a storage solution that is much more secure than keeping crypto on an exchange. Ethereum appears to have very secure long-term holders. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Exchange Outflows Suggest Strategic Accumulation This week, Ethereum saw extremely large volumes of coins leaving centralized exchanges, which is an indicator that has usually foreshadowed an increase in the cryptocurrency’s price. When Ethereum and other altcoins are moving off exchanges in large amounts, it’s a net positive for their prices. Although Bitcoin has had a relatively stable price, Ethereum has performed significantly better and continued to do so over the same timeframe. This performance differential, along with net outflows, signals a change in sentiment. Investors seem to be moving into ETH as they anticipate major events that could catalyze the price. This sentiment has been intensified by recent spot inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds in the U.S. On May 29, those funds recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million. The funds, in fact, are riding a streak of nine consecutive days of positive net inflows. With these kinds of consistent inflows, Ethereum ETFs are a way for institutions and retail investors to access Ethereum in a regulated manner. And this kind of demand for something like an Ethereum ETF is a sign of growing accessibility for crypto. On May 29 (ET), U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net outflow of $359 million, ending a 10-day streak of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million, marking a 9-day streak of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 Dormant ICO Whales Awaken: Massive ETH Movements Raise Eyebrows Together with the wider market, two Ethereum wallets from the time of the ICO have awakened from long dormancy and are now making huge transactions that have caught the eye of blockchain analysts. An early participant in the Ethereum ICO has an address tied to it and at one time held a mind-boggling 1 million ETH. Just five hours ago, this address moved 959.69 ETH to the OKX exchange. At current market valuations, the transferred amount is approximately worth $2.54 million. Despite this massive transaction, the address still retains a whopping 50,704 ETH on-chain, valued at around $132 million. 这次是两个 ICO 巨鲸一起发力了，成本都是低至 0.31 美金的大佬 1⃣ ETH ICO 100 万枚 $ETH 巨鲸 5 小时前向 #OKX 充值 959.69 ETH，价值 254 万美元；链上仍剩余 50704 ETH，价值 1.32 亿美元 https://t.co/JFVlWHNe7N 2⃣ 2015 年 ICO 10 万枚 $ETH 的 OG 3 小时前向 #Kraken 充值 587 ETH，价值… https://t.co/xOj0szBX2C pic.twitter.com/5Rh5zgUmVE — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) May 30, 2025 Not only is this address’s holding large, but it also has a significant historical context. According to blockchain records, this wallet acquired its ETH during the ICO at the astonishingly low price of around $0.31 per coin. Such moves made by early adopters can be interpreted in various ways — they may have been profit-taking or involve a kind of strategic reallocation. This week also saw news emerge about a second wallet, believed to be associated with a participant in the 2015 Ethereum ICO and currently holding around 100,000 ETH. Just three hours ago, this wallet transferred 587 ETH to Kraken, which, at the current market rate, equates to about $1.56 million. Since March 13, 2023, the same address has sold a total of 14,398 ETH, bringing in approximately $28.47 million at an average price of $1,977. This slow and almost laboriously drawn-out sell-off pattern indicates that if this address is indeed a whale, it’s presently exiting either the Ethereum or Web3 space, or diversifying its assets. Market Implications and the Road Ahead These synchronized actions create a many-sided depiction of Ethereum’s contemporary condition. On one side, institutional investors are embracing Ethereum with a swift-paced buying frenzy, as shown by the ETF inflow now stretching across nine consecutive days. On the other side, a handful of very old and very large Ethereum holders — some of which have been clutching their assets since the Ethereum ICO back in 2014 — are starting to sell off portions of their holdings after nearly a decade. Even with these substantial sales, ETH’s price has held strong, thanks to the collective confidence in the crypto market and because of the dwindling supply of liquid Ethereum resulting from the cold wallet migrations. If the current trend of outflows holds, Ethereum may see less of an obligation to sell and more of a platform for price increases. Ethereum 2.0 is in a progressive stage of its upgrades, layer 2 adoption is rising, and ETF inflows are on the upswing, putting Ethereum (ETH) in a robust position. Yet, even with all these positive developments, there is a group of investors who could still negatively impact Ethereum’s price in the near term. Those investors are the ICO whales. Ethereum is proving its relevance yet again as the crypto market heads into the second half of 2025. It’s not just a smart contract platform; it’s a maturing financial asset drawing interest from both long-term believers and institutional capital.

Here’s What This Means for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/saudi-prince-drops-100-million-on-xrp-heres-what-this-means-for-xrp/,"Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud has invested $100 million into XRP through a strategic partnership with publicly traded company VivoPower International PLC (NASDAQ: VVPR). In the wake of this notable development, a pseudonymous crypto journalist, known as Jungle Inc on X, has highlighted what this means for XRP and its teeming holders. VivoPower’s XRP-Focused Strategy VivoPower has successfully raised a total of $121 million in funding to implement what it describes as a comprehensive XRP-focused treasury and infrastructure strategy. Of this total, $100 million originates from Prince Abdulaziz, making his participation the most significant component of the fundraising round. This marks the first time a public company has officially committed to building its treasury operations around XRP rather than more established digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Jungle Inc, VivoPower’s strategy includes allocating capital to directly purchase and hold XRP as a reserve asset . The company also plans to build new infrastructure on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , which will support a broader pivot toward decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. As part of its strategic shift, VivoPower is preparing to spin off certain legacy divisions to focus its operations exclusively on cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. Leadership and Strategic Appointments In a notable personnel move, Ripple veteran Adam Traidman has been appointed as advisory chairman to guide the company’s transformation. Traidman, who has experience in the XRP ecosystem, is expected to assist in VivoPower’s transition into a crypto-first corporate entity with a focus on XRPL-based applications. Institutional Implications and Market Perception Jungle Inc emphasized the broader implications of this initiative. He referred to the investment as a “royal-level endorsement” of XRP and stated that the development “proves XRP’s growing DeFi and treasury use case.” He also highlighted that this move could lead to increased institutional interest in XRP, similar to how MicroStrategy’s acquisition of Bitcoin catalyzed corporate interest in BTC during previous market cycles. The announcement presents a notable inflection point in XRP’s institutional narrative. Unlike other public companies that have thus far preferred Bitcoin or Ethereum for treasury allocation, VivoPower’s decision to center its capital strategy around XRP introduces a new precedent. The involvement of Prince Abdulaziz further distinguishes this investment by providing it with geopolitical and economic weight, particularly given Saudi Arabia’s broader interest in emerging financial technologies. Jungle Inc concluded by stating, “The XRP narrative just changed. Institutions are watching.” This statement reflects a growing perception among market observers that XRP may be entering a new phase of institutional relevance, driven by high-profile endorsements and a maturing use case within both treasury management and decentralized financial infrastructure.

45321466,https://nulltx.com/?p=150088,1748677157,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Virtuals Daily Recap: AI Agent Sector Sees Pullback as Virtuals Dips Post-Echo Rally,https://nulltx.com/virtuals-daily-recap-ai-agent-sector-sees-pullback-as-virtuals-dips-post-echo-rally/,"The AI Agent economy gave back a hefty portion of its recent gains in the last 24 hours, with valuations across the sector declining after a not-so-sustained spike in $VIRTUAL. Total market cap for the AI Agent sector? Now at $10.59 billion, which gets us to an -8.77% change on the day. We see an ecosystem pullback that really hit some of the core layer tokens pretty hard, and a good example of that is the Virtuals ecosystem. They saw their ecosystem market cap dip a little bit to $2.59 billion, and we got an -8.28% price decline in the $VIRTUAL token. Even though prices are cooling, investor attention and market activity, which are gauged by mindshare, remain high. Indeed, mindshare rose 2.25% to 38.83%. This suggests that while some short-term holders may be rotating out of major tokens like $VIRTUAL, the overall interest in the sector remains robust. Vigorous investor attention is likely to lead to more market activity in the not-so-distant future. Volatility Follows Echo Rally as $VIRTUAL Retreats $VIRTUAL has seen a drop in its value, only a few days removed from a powerful price increase. That rally was largely attributed to a massive uptick in user engagement and trading activity post-“Echo” update. The update had propelled $VIRTUAL up by nearly 40% earlier this week, pushing it into the realm of the ecosystem “VIRTUAL”. However, as in most instances when a huge upsurge in value occurs, a retracement is now following. On May 30, the price of $VIRTUAL corrected by -8.33%, landing at $2.1851. With profit-taking underway and speculative interest cycling into newer entrants, the recent decline appears more technical than fundamental. Virtuals’ overall market cap dropped by a similar percentage, reflecting synchronized movements across its sub-projects and partners. Yet, the platform holds one of the most robust positions in the AI agent economy. Its total sector share of mind is 38.83%, suggesting that traders and developers are continuing to pay it heed, even amidst a broader cooldown. In fact, the potential for a rebound seems high, considering that in this fast-moving, AI-infused Web3 landscape, sentiment often rotates in a matter of days. Mindshare and Momentum Shift Toward Rising Stars Although $VIRTUAL has stepped back, a number of smaller projects in the Virtuals ecosystem and the broader AI agent space are beginning to attract investor interest. Traders seem to be rotating into these newer or more nimble plays, in search of the higher beta opportunities that might give us the next leg up. MISATO (@Misato_virtuals), which jumped by +8.08%. Its focus on lightweight, autonomous decision-making for micro-agents seems to have caught the eye of traders looking for next-gen performance assets, and the market seems to be rewarding that with a nice bump in price. Next in line is TRISIG (@tri_sigma_), reaping +5.70%, and not far behind is POLY (@polytraderAI) at +5.15%. Both projects are building agent frameworks geared towards decentralized trading and finance. These are two sectors where AI is starting to make significant inroads. GRPH (@soulgra_ph) and SIREN (@genius_sirenai) likewise saw modest gains of +2.41% and +1.18%, respectively, indicating that a shift in momentum toward the kind of under-the-radar projects with which they are associated may be in play. And that is a shift with which investors in speculative projects might be more than pleased. Virtuals Daily Update | May 30th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/SxfKmbD79H — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 30, 2025 Capital moving into smaller capitalized projects is common following a sector surge. When major tokens such as $VIRTUAL begin a consolidation phase, high-risk opportunity investors often move to the next tier, seeking potential micro-cap projects and aiming to catch the next early breakout wave of the sector. Looking Ahead: Temporary Reset or the Start of Rotation? The present decline is in the question—is it a temporary dip following the exuberant advance or a developing scenario of prolonged underperformance for certain segments in the AI agent ecosystem? At the rate of innovation we are seeing, and with the consistent level of new project launches across the ecosystem, the answer may well be both. It seems likely that for the large-cap leaders like $VIRTUAL, a cooling-off period may be in store. At the same time, we may see emerging projects take up the narrative in the short term. The ongoing increase in mindshare indicates that attention isn’t departing from the sector but is instead reallocating within it. This seems more indicative of a healthy AI Agent market than an unhealthy one—especially with the not-so-recent memory of some big-name players leaving the space. The project is able to maintain relevance and doesn’t seem likely to disappear anytime soon. It retains a foundational pillar in the AI ecosystem. With its price decline, it isn’t able to pick up too much momentum, and it covers a lot with only a few mechanisms in play. As the migration of smart capital continues and showroom forays made by speculative money in the crypto sector seem not yet to have ended, one can only emphasize the need to maintain a wary watch on the ever-evolving AI-crypto intersection. It’s not too soon, and it may not be too late, to keep a finger on the pulse of AI-driven crypto. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This pullback has put around 1.27 million Bitcoin addresses in the red; these holders are now underwater compared to their purchase price. Despite this short-term decline, on-chain data reveals a pretty amazing narrative of historic buying activity just below the $100,000 mark—suggesting that this level could serve as a potent support zone if Bitcoin visits it again in the not-too-distant future. Historic Buying and Strong Support at Key Psychological Level Bitcoin’s price has swung widely over the past few weeks, but significant demand has emerged near the $100,000 mark. Erik Vorhees, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur based in Puerto Rico, likens the situation to a game with two players. On one side are the sellers, who have managed to push the price below $100,000. On the other are the buyers, who keep snapping up Bitcoin anytime the price gets near this level. Important psychological benchmarks often exist in financial markets, serving as levels where many buyers and sellers seem to congregate. With respect to Bitcoin, the $100,000 price level has taken on huge amounts of attention, both as a price that buyers might be attracted to and as a price that some traders might be selling into. We could describe it as the price level with the most dual attraction, given that it is also a round number. This paragraph is essentially a translation of the previous one with slightly different wording. Why is the price level with the most dual attraction also a good candidate for a psychological price level? Because, as way too many commentators have also already pointed out, it’s a.k.a. a round number. Moreover, this latent support correlates with larger market demand patterns that have stayed strong during this cycle—even following Bitcoin’s former all-time highs. Demand for Bitcoin is now approaching the peak levels of the previous bull market. On average, about $1.8 billion in fresh capital flows into the market each day – roughly on par with the November 2021 high around $64K. The largest inflows of this cycle occurred at approximately… pic.twitter.com/XdfdUMaaKL — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 30, 2025 Investor Demand Mirrors Peak Levels of Previous Bull Market The total demand for Bitcoin is still extremely high, almost reaching the demand levels that we saw in the last bull market. Daily, Bitcoin sees fresh capital inflows of around $1.8 billion on average. This is about equivalent to what was happening in the 2021 bull run when we were trading at about $64,000. This cycle’s, from about $73,000 and $92,000 price levels, most huge capital came in. At $73,000, the market recorded its most substantial peak inflows of $3.6 billion, while at $92,000, the inflows grew to even more extreme $4.5 billion levels. Investors keep on channeling wah-wah wealth into Bitcoin, despite its steady diet of ups and downs in the price department. This trend shows that the market still has a good appetite for Bitcoin, and it proves that investors are still willing to put down large amounts of capital even after Bitcoin has set new all-time highs. This also seems to act as a validation of sorts for the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin, and more than anything, it shows that amidst the short-term price corrections, the commitment to Bitcoin seems to be as strong as ever. ETF Outflows Signal Temporary Profit-Taking Amid Overall Strength On May 29 (Eastern Time), the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net outflow of $359 million. This halted a 10-day streak of consistent net inflows into these potential investment vehicles. Bitcoin has slid ~5 % from last week’s peak, putting 1.27M addresses in the red. But on-chain data shows heavy historic buying just under $100 k, suggesting this key psychological level could act as strong support; and perhaps fuel the next leg up if revisited. pic.twitter.com/38eGCnr1Kl — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 ETFs commonly see outflows interpreted as temporary profit-taking. Who could blame them? ETF inflows had reached dizzying heights of over $700 billion per year, and they were used to finance not just the 2017-2018 bull run in cryptocurrency prices but also the 2018-2019 recovery. Withdrawals from ETFs might raise some concerns, since they are such reliable tools that support the price of cryptocurrencies, but those withdrawals are not necessarily a sign of a weakening market. This movement also reflects the broader dynamics of Bitcoin investment, where participants in the market regularly seek to optimize returns and create better-performing investable products. That this outflow happened after a long run of not just inflows but also net inflows into the Bitcoin space highlights that there really is ongoing interest in not just investing in Bitcoin itself but also ongoing engagement in Bitcoin-related financial products. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Looking Ahead: Resilience and Potential for Next Rally In general, the Bitcoin price decline of 5% appears to be a healthy correction rather than a dip that foretells sustained weakness. A review of buying in the dip from the historic lows under the $100,000 level reveals not only unrelenting support from retail investors but also strong participation from institutional investors. Should Bitcoin return to the crucial support zone near $100,000, the collection of buying demand there might serve as a launch mechanism, propelling fresh enthusiasm among investors and very possibly signaling the start of the next bull market. Over the next few weeks, investors and analysts will be keeping an eye on whether Bitcoin can maintain this critical level and push on toward new all-time highs or if it’s going to be shoveled by market forces into a prolonged period of consolidation. Currently, the on-chain data and inflow trends paint a mildly optimistic picture despite the recent volatility. They suggest that Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a reliable digital asset that attracts a great deal of global capital. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A single user lost $20,000 worth of BSC-USD (a stablecoin from the exchange Binance that is pegged to the U.S. dollar) in a double address poisoning attack. Data flagged by the scam alerting service Cyver show that this user was targeted not just once but twice in the span of a single hour. In each instance, they sent $10,000 to two different bad addresses—both of which were designed to look like the user’s real address. This episode highlights the enduring danger of address poisoning in decentralized systems. It serves as a clear reminder that even the most mundane crypto transactions can be perilous if sound verification practices are not followed. The Mechanics of Address Poisoning Address poisoning is a form of clever trickery that scammers use to carry out their schemes. They send worthless transactions from addresses that look very similar to the ones that a target has previously interacted with. The idea is to get the target to think they’ve been sent a transaction and, when they go to look at their transaction history, to get them to use a poisoned address in future transactions. If you know you haven’t sent a transaction to the address in your history, then somebody might be trying to scam you. The common user practice of using past transaction history to recycle wallet addresses is what this scam relies upon. It mimics the appearance of a legitimate address, usually by matching the first character and the last character of the address you would expect to see. It certainly doesn’t match the middle, which is the part of the address that actually matters, especially if we’re talking about using your eyes to tell the difference between a valid and a scam wallet. Knowing that we tend to trust the first and last characters, it would appear that scammy addresses follow the principle of a good magic trick. In this specific instance, the victim committed two expensive blunders. The first transaction was for $10,000 sent to a phony address. Just one hour later, the same victim sent another $10,000 to a different scammer, using the same hoax to get the money. This quick, double-dipping took place because the crooks were watching the victim’s wallet so closely they must have been salivating to go in for another hit after the first one worked so well. It also makes you wonder how many times the same scammer has done this with other not-so-smart victims. ALERT Today, our system detected 20K $BSC -USD lost due to address poisoning scams. A single victim was targeted twice by two different scammer addresses. First, victim mistakenly sent 10K $BSC -USD to a scammer. Just 1 hour later, victim sent another 10K $BSC -USD to a second… pic.twitter.com/OTU07UAyLK — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) May 30, 2025 BSC Ecosystem and Security Concerns Among the fastest and most used blockchain platforms in the world, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) boasts rapid transaction times and a nominal fee structure. Largely for these reasons, it has drawn the attention of bad actors holding malicious intentions. Address poisoning, a technique used by a number of blockchain bad actors, poses a very real threat to BSC users. BSC, like other Layer 1 chains, has a decentralized nature; that is, it is not controlled from a single place. Instead, it is run by numerous independent operators all over the world. This brings with it a familiar set of advantages and enables many of the functions of a blockchain. But it also brings some disadvantages—primarily, perhaps, that the end user is responsible for the custody of funds held in, and for the movement of funds to and from, BSC. Although detection systems and real-time alerts might be improved by platforms like Cyver and other firms specializing in blockchain security, these firms cannot stop a transaction from happening in the first place. They can only issue a warning after the fact or in real-time, if they’re really good, flag a suspicious pattern that just happens to be associated with the transaction in question. And in the realm of security, where a system can be only as good as its last update, alerts and warnings are not even a close second to prevention. Best Practices for Users: How to Stay Safe Losing $20,000 in BSC-USD to address poisoning is a recent, painful lesson, but one that offers takeaways for the wider crypto community. First and foremost: never copy wallet addresses directly from transaction history. Always use verified, manually saved addresses, or better yet, use wallet features that allow for whitelisting or address tagging. The second step is to turn on the anti-phishing tools and browser add-ons that look at the addresses you are trying to visit and let you know if they are not what they are supposed to be, like if they are really close to the name of a legit site but not quite right, or if they’re just plain old scammer sites. A lot of wallets and interfaces now have this functionality built in, but it’s up to you to use it and keep it updated. For the third point, verify that the addresses are correct down to each character before you dispatch any meaningful amount of cryptocurrency. A moment’s worth of carefulness could conserve thousands in not having to replace lost funds. Finally, keep yourself updated. Crypto develops quickly, and so do the schemes of bad actors. Following alert services like Cyver, reading up on the latest scams, and keeping an overall suspicious disposition are musts for safely navigating the crypto world. The ecosystem keeps on growing and maturing, and so must the behavior and protective practices of its users. Today’s incident is yet another reminder that in the decentralized world, security is not just a feature—it is a personal responsibility. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It was an imaginative allocation that never got any traction, largely because the financial technology needed to make it work simply didn’t exist. Fast forward to 2025, and Coinbase is resurrecting the dormant standard with x402, a “crypto-native” payments protocol that’s supposed to allow for instant, automatic transactions across the web. x402 signifies a big shift from the web payment systems of today. Those systems depend on platforms. Visa, Stripe, and PayPal are among the platforms we use to make payments on the web. They are not the only platforms we use; in fact, we use many centralized platforms to make payments on the web. x402 is not a centralized platform. It does not attempt to replace our centralized platforms with just another platform. To these ends, x402 is also something else: it is largely payment-agnostic. A Protocol for the Internet of Value At its heart, x402 allows websites, APIs, and applications to directly ask for and receive payments in cryptocurrency through the HTTP protocol. It’s not necessary to use plugins, middleware, or third-party integrations. Now, you can have direct interactions through simple web requests with stablecoins like USDC. x402 fufills a vision of web architecture that is decentralized, open, and extensible. The modern internet is about lightning-fast communications and interactions among people, devices, and systems. Three are the demands that need to be met: 1. Costs of transaction must be near zero. 2. The speed of finality must be in the neighborhood of 200 milliseconds (a little faster, a little slower, take my word for it, and I’m the one saying this). 3. The throughput must scale beyond 100,000 transactions per second (you have to love those peak moments when a lot is going on all at once). x402 takes care of business on meeting those demands. 1/ The internet reserved HTTP 402 for payments over 30 years ago, then forgot about it. Now, @coinbase is reviving it with x402, a protocol that lets websites and APIs accept crypto payments (like USDC) natively over HTTP. pic.twitter.com/S32a2ri7wI — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) May 29, 2025 This method makes way for a new manner of online interaction: independent transactions between machines. It may soon be possible for AI agents, for instance, to pay for access to APIs in real-time and without human intervention. Or for a smart contract to pay an invoice at the moment the service it governs is rendered. Or for some app coordinating cloud resources to pay in microtransactions. But these aren’t magic uses to which x402 can be put, because it reimagines payments themselves as an internet-native primitive. Traditional Giants Are Fighting Back Although x402 presents a radically open method for handling digital payments, the traditional giants of the payment industry are not lying low. They are, of course, trying to remain relevant in a swiftly changing landscape. For example, this past week, Visa introduced artificial intelligence agents for link to its payment network. And as for Stripe, it claims to have adopted AI for front-line fraud detection and prevention. It too is trying to process an evidently crypto-involved future and has issued stablecoin-related communications that sound a lot like PayPal’s. Why? Because PayPal has, for some time now, been issuing rewards for the holders of its stablecoin, PYUSD. Even though these developments represent a change in direction, traditional platforms still are, at their cores, closed systems. They are platform-first, built on central control, proprietary infrastructure, and human-centric workflows. x402, in contrast, offers an open, permissionless protocol that can be embedded directly into the logic of apps, APIs, and services. Indeed, it can even be embedded into the apps of traditional platforms. Throughout this book, we will argue that using an open, permissionless protocol—whether it be x402 or any number of other such protocols—always results in better, app-centered, user-focused outcomes. This rising rift mirrors the wider digital economy—between old institutions making piecemeal changes and new protocols attempting to rethink the web from the bottom up. The Promise and Risks of Agentic Payments As AI technology grows and takes on more responsibilities, the concept of agentic payments—transactions started and completed by AI agents or applications—shifts from being a speculative concept to a practical occurrence. x402 is designed for this scenario, where machines are not only reading and writing data but also directly exchanging value over the web. The significance of these implications is hard to overstate. They suggest that AI agents could eventually take over some pretty meaty tasks currently performed by humans—tasks like managing subscriptions to digital services, purchasing those services, allocating resources among the many cloud platforms that exist today, and even negotiating and settling the contracts that bind all those services together. However, the freedom this technology promises is not without risks. It raises big questions about key custody, authorization, and abuse mitigation. If an AI agent makes an unauthorized payment, for instance, or if malicious bots exploit machine-native payment systems, who is responsible? This is something the developers and regulators of the technology will have to address—preferably before something goes badly wrong. Even with these obstacles, x402’s momentum indicates that a new kind of Internet economy, where web-native payments intermingle with data and content, is emerging. The fact that Coinbase raised the 402’s profile may say more about the economy’s potential than just that it was an endeavor to, as one might say, Web 2.0, raise the profile of an unfashionable number.

At the heart of this explosive growth is increasing institutional investment in Bitcoin, which continues to act as the touchstone for market sentiment. But this time, the vitality is not confined to Bitcoin alone. A closer look reveals a broad-based expansion taking place across decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto credit markets, and the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This complex surge indicates that the present bull cycle is structurally different from previous ones. Pursuant both to not just the ecosystem’s but also the segment’s growing maturity and to a presage of regulatory clarity, the current bull cycle seems well and truly different and—lacking any sign of a speculative mania—much more sustainable. DeFi Eyes Historic Highs as Institutions Return Perhaps the most impressive development is the way in which institutional capital has re-emerged in decentralized finance (DeFi). The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has bounced back to approximately $178 billion, which is close to where it had been at the top of the previous cycle. Ethereum is still the clear leader, holding more than half of that TVL. This is due in large part to Ethereum’s powerful configuration of decentralized apps and Layer 2 solutions that allow it to scale. 1/ The global crypto market cap has climbed above $3.5 trillion, driven largely by mounting institutional demand for Bitcoin. That momentum looks set to continue; but strength is spreading across the broader ecosystem as well pic.twitter.com/j6g3IeDJ7F — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 29, 2025 Aave stands out among singularly-focused protocols, leading the decentralized lending market with an approximate total value locked of $25 billion. The protocol’s strength lies in its steady and multifaceted growth across several blockchains, akin to that of a blue-chip DeFi project. Both professional institutions and retail users have favored using Aave because they can count on it to serve as a secure, scalable, and always-available solution. This resurgence has reopened speculation about a possible “DeFi summer” comparable to the one in 2020. Nonetheless, numerous analysts contend that the current excitement is now rooted in something more concrete—in real, fundamental growth. For one, they insist that the protocols themselves have matured to a point where we can now actually use them without pulling our hair out in frustration. For another, they note that the security practices of those using DeFi have improved. And finally, they point out that institutions now approach DeFi with a clearer sense of the frameworks they want to operate under and the risk management strategies they’re comfortable with. Crypto Credit Makes a Comeback A main indicator of the crypto market’s evolution is the revival of lending and credit markets. After the savage deleveraging and widespread defaults that afflicted CeFi and DeFi lending platforms from the middle of 2022 onward, the sector has made a strong rebound. By the end of Q4 2023, the Cerulli report indicated that the combined loan books of both CeFi and DeFi platforms had reached an estimated $30 billion, with a range of performance metrics suggesting that overall credit quality has improved significantly. That does not yet mean that defaults are nonexistent. Lending in the crypto space, however, seems to be healthy. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been making strides in moving a part of the traditional finance world on-chain. One part of traditional finance that is now partly on-chain is credit provision. Over the past year, DeFi’s share of this credit activity has been growing, thanks in part to the return of institutional borrowers and lenders. DeFi credit provision, as offered by platforms like AAVE, has in many, if not most, respects proven to be a straightforward, transparent, and much more sensible on-chain alternative to the opaqueness of off-chain credit provision by banking institutions. The health of crypto credit is a key indicator for the whole ecosystem. When capital moves freely and credit conditions are stable, innovation and liquidity are usually not far behind. Most of us see the reemergence of this segment as a major catalyst for growth across the entire market in 2024. Stablecoins Emerge as the Year’s Breakout Use Case While Bitcoin and DeFi have stolen the spotlight, the real star of 2024 may well be the stablecoin market. With a nearly combined capitalization of $250 billion—up an incredible 56% from just $160 billion a year ago—the stablecoin market is crypto’s silent revolution. This growth is largely being pushed by new players coming in from traditional finance. Stablecoins put out by large financial institutions—like Société Générale’s EURCV, PayPal’s PYUSD, JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, and the rumored Bank of America dollar token—are really starting to gain traction. These are bank-grade digital assets. And they are not only causing the retail and DeFi payments perception of stablecoins to evolve; they are starting to be seen as something that can underpin a global-scale financial infrastructure and not just retail payments. As use of stablecoins increases, regulation is emerging. The U.S. is preparing to issue federal legislation governing stablecoins—codenamed GENIUS/STABLE. This will occur alongside a follow-up to the FIT 21 framework recently passed in Congress. We expect SEC and CFTC guidance to also be in the mix—potentially clarifying things like bank custody of digital assets. A lot of this will shake out by 2027. To sum up, the latest climb of the crypto market is being driven by more than just a surface amount of speculative energy. What’s really going on is the much more substantial and serious transition of the crypto world toward dependable, institutional-grade financial vehicles and processes, from credit markets to the kinds of efficient personal transfer systems that stablecoins offer to the average consumer. It seems fair to say that the crypto market isn’t what it used to be. And what’s more, it seems likely that the kind of price ascent we saw during Bitcoin’s maturity period is also a thing of the past. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While its core group of developers continued to build, only a handful of projects maintained any sort of visibility. For most members of the crypto community, the sentiment seemed to be that DeFi was in hibernation, waiting for the winter of crypto’s current bear market to pass. But now, discussions on social media and within the crypto industry around DeFi are picking up again. Even though the crypto space has recently been filled with memecoins, Bitcoin ETFs, and Layer 2 scaling developments, a return to DeFi fundamentals marks a crucial change in our space. This recent uprising is being driven not only by higher asset prices but also by greater user engagement, improved protocol performance, and interest from institutional players. Ethereum Reclaims the DeFi Crown Even with new Layer 1 blockchains and Layer 2 networks popping up, Ethereum remains the reigning champ of DeFi. It now has well over 50% of all the assets locked in smart contracts across the entire DeFi space. The DeFi application of Ethereum attracts much development and usage. The liquidity and confidence in DeFi on Ethereum are coming back. From the looks of it, the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, which is built and interacts mostly with the Layer 1 base layer of Ethereum, is looking much healthier with a rapid upswing in total value locked which seems to be hinting at bringing back some liquidity to the core financial-grade decentralized applications that use the base Ethereum Layer 1. Ethereum continues to face significant ongoing challenges. These include its still high gas fees and a capacity-stretched main chain, which together make it hard for some types of Ethereum projects to get off the ground. But with the payoff from its long-planned transition to proof of stake now in hand, Ethereum has opportunity to work through those challenges. AAVE and Lido Lead the DeFi Protocol Rankings Among distinct protocols, AAVE shines as the leading light in many ways, with an incredible $25.41 billion locked up in its lending markets across the chains. Of course, many folks know AAVE. It operates under a decentralized governance model, supports a wide variety of assets, and is present in many chains. Its relevance and resonance in this ecosystem are testaments to its user-centric design. Beyond the governance and asset support, though, the platform has captured attention in a good many ways. DeFi is gaining serious momentum again. Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to $178.52 billion, signaling a strong resurgence in decentralized finance activity. Ethereum remains the dominant force, accounting for more than half of all TVL. Among individual protocols, AAVE… pic.twitter.com/e6Kp8JVM6e — OLOBA THE ARTIST (@IamOloba_) May 30, 2025 AAVE is closely followed by Lido, which has a value locked of $24.57 billion. Lido is a liquid staking solution that works quite well and has built significant momentum. It allows users to stake Ethereum (as well as a handful of other assets) while keeping their assets liquid with derivative tokens. This model has gained considerable popularity as Ethereum transitions to proof-of-Stake, allowing way more users than previously access to Ethereum staking rewards while also letting them do stuff with their assets. Alongside AAVE, Lido has emerged as a key anchor within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Together, they exemplify two critical, closely intertwined, and almost universally needed building blocks of DeFi: permissionless lending (AAVE) and permissionless staking (Lido). They are quietly serving up a potent combination of services that is boosting DeFi to that next level of confidence and making the space seem even more solid than before. Is a New DeFi Season on the Horizon? Once again, DeFi’s total value locked is climbing toward historic highs, and with it, speculation is building around the possibility of a new DeFi season. Observers of the market are noting not only the influx of capital but also the increased stability and maturity of many top protocols compared to previous boom cycles. The most recent DeFi season brought us new experiments, great yields, and lots of hacks. Today, leading DeFi protocols make clearer promises about what users can expect. They emphasize something that should come as no surprise in the wake of last season’s breaches: safety. DeFi’s path to safety is more grounded in traditional finance, with protocols now promising comprehensive auditing and stronger governance. They may be using institutional capital to get there. This momentum might bring us a full-blown DeFi revival; it’s not yet certain. But the signs are strong. As protocols get better, ecosystems evolve, and user experience becomes more seamless, decentralized finance seems set for another significant expansion. One thing is certain: traction is returning to DeFi, and with close to $180 billion in the system, all is primed for the next installment of the tale that this is a decentralized financial world.

According to reports, over 4.9 billion shareholders voted against the move, with about 8.9 million shares absent, and over 205 million non-votes. The move makes Meta Platforms the latest big tech firm to consider a shareholder push to add Bitcoin to its treasury following the previous push by Microsoft some months ago. However, just like this move, it ended in disappointment after shareholders voted to reject the proposal citing concerns about volatility. According to reports, the company said it was prioritizing a push into artificial intelligence over cryptocurrency investments. The Meta Bitcoin treasury proposal was submitted by investor Ethan Peck, who stands as a representative of the National Center for Public Research (NCPPR), asking the company to look into the likelihood of converting some of its cash and bond holdings into Bitcoin to preserve shareholder value better. At the time, the proposal gained noticeable attention, with Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor publicly drumming support for the initiative. Meta shareholders vote down Bitcoin adoption push According to filings, Meta, as of September 30, 2024, had about $72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which the proposal claimed the values were being eroded by inflation and low returns. The move presents Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and strong trading pattern compared to bonds, as a reliable store of value in the long term. Meta Platforms Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Proposal pic.twitter.com/ZeIrUHq2OK — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixNewsIO) May 30, 2025 According to the filing, there has also been an increased push in institutional Bitcoin adoption, mentioning Strategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions, BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation, and speculations about potential US federal and state-level Bitcoin reserves in 2025. It also mentioned that Meta’s leadership had been showing interest in the asset, though via informal means, highlighting that its CEO Mark Zuckerberg had named his goats “Bitcoin” and “Max”. However, the board of directors was against the push, calling it unnecessary. In their response, the Meta board mentioned that the company already had a robust management practice in place, noting that it prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity to support its operations. The board also added that the company usually evaluates these broad ranges of investable assets and upon their recent evaluation, there was no need for a separate assessment focused on Bitcoin. Gravitation towards stablecoins and AI on the agenda According to a recent statement, the board explained its decision to ignore the buzz of digital assets. “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury,” Meta’s board of directors noted in a statement. While the company may not be eyeing Bitcoin in the short term, there won’t be any surprises if it decides to shift focus in the future. This is because there has been a considerable number of firms that have made the shift in the past, including Strategy. In addition, there is also a rising trend of industry players making Bitcoin-focused investments over the last few months due to the now relaxed regulations in the United States. Also, there are reports that Meta may be looking into stablecoins in the time being, with the company also choosing to focus on its ongoing push into artificial intelligence . According to Forbes, Meta has explored integrating stablecoins into its platforms to facilitate global payouts, holding discussions with crypto infrastructure firms to that effect. The move marks a re-entry into the crypto space for the company after its exit from the industry some years back following a regulatory setback with its Diem project. The initial effort was looking into the use of stablecoins for cross-border payments, with the firm hoping to provide a cheaper and faster alternative to the traditional system.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025.

All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 The external factors, like Trump’s tariff threat , have pushed the HBAR price into a consistent decline and have recently taken a strong rejection from the 200-day EMA band . Since mid-May, the HBAR crypto has shattered nearly 30%, coming from $0.233 to $0.162. Adding more fuel to the fire, the intraday sell pressure of 10% has broken the previous swing low of $0.170. On the daily chart, it is aiming for a decline towards retesting its critical support of $0.139, which also aligns with Q4 2024 momentum-based high volume profile level. This high volume profile showed strength in Q2 2025’s April month, where a recovery of over 80% from $0.125 to $0.228 was observed. This time, HABR approaching this level is critical, as it has become a “make or break level. If bullish forces step in again as seen last month, then a rally could spark, then there is a higher chance for its price to clear $0.401, and reach $0.750 by the 2025 year-end. But if the support has been weakened from a previous retest, then its break would be fearsome, which could even push HBAR price to the $0.072 level in a fast-paced momentum, as displayed in Q4 when bulls were in command. Unlike its price action, the internal fundamental factors are on the optimistic side. Its efforts have been reflected in significant progress in its ecosystem. In 2025, it introduced the first Hedera-native hardware wallet, Citadel, and AI-powered Hedera Agent Kit, allowing users to create tokens, reducing technical barriers. Another strong project is set to launch in Q3 2025, named HashSphere, a private, permissioned blockchain for highly regulated industries like payment providers and asset managers. To facilitate secure, low-cost cross-border transactions with stablecoins while ensuring regulatory compliance. Even in order to streamline their work, on May 15, 2025, Hedera rebranded, renaming the HBAR Foundation to the “Hedera Foundation” and the Hedera Governing Council to the “Hedera Council.” Overall, the internal factors suggest that optimism is not so shallow, right now, and we can see some big moves in 2025, if all things are aligned well. But, still, the external factors highlight great caution for market participants.

This latest distribution , which started on May 30, targets claimants in both the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who have successfully completed all pre-distribution requirements. According to a May 28 announcement, the payout covers various categories of claims. Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims will receive a 72% reimbursement, while U.S. Customer Entitlement Claims are set to receive 54%. Those holding Convenience Claims are being paid 120% of their entitled value, reflecting their priority in the distribution process. Meanwhile, General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims are slated to receive a 61% distribution. Recipients should expect to see the funds in their accounts within one to two business days via the official partners, Kraken and BitGo . Crypto Markets Watch Closely for Liquidity Impact Market analysts and crypto traders are watching the reimbursements closely due to their potential impact on digital asset prices. The release of billions of dollars back into the hands of retail and institutional investors could introduce short-term volatility, particularly if large sums are sold or exchanged for other assets on public platforms. This round of repayments follows the initial February 18 distribution, in which $1.2 billion was sent to creditors with claims under $50,000 . At the time, Bitget Wallet COO Alvin Kan noted that a significant share of those funds might find their way back into crypto markets, either as reinvestment or liquidity provision. Critics Continue to Question Fairness of FTX Payout Structure Despite the substantial funds being returned, the reimbursement process has not been without controversy. A key concern lies in the court ruling that determined payouts would be based on the value of assets at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy petition, rather than their current market prices. FTX creditor and vocal critic Sunil Kavuri highlighted that many creditors only received 10% to 25% of the current value of their crypto holdings due to the low market prices during the petition date. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $16,000—a fraction of its current value. Kavuri also raised alarm earlier this year over the exclusion of users in 163 countries , including Pakistan, Russia, Iran, and Greenland, who are ineligible to receive reimbursement under the current plan. As the FTX Recovery Trust continues its efforts , the broader crypto community remains divided on whether justice has truly been served.

Among the best cheap crypto to buy now, Dogecoin (DOGE), TRON (TRX), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as three promising coins, each offering unique fundamentals and bullish setups. DOGE remains a cultural force backed by strong community support and growing utility. TRX continues to lead in transaction volume across DeFi, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, a new crypto coin still in presale, is gaining momentum as a high-upside play for the next cycle. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). For those wondering what crypto to buy now or seeking the next big cryptocurrency, these sub-$0.50 gems offer real potential before the bull run takes full flight. DOGE and TRX: Affordable Altcoins Poised for Growth in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) is around $0.2051 being highly resistant despite the volatility in the market. Experts believe DOGE can reach as high as $0.37 in June driven by fan sentiment and potential ETF releases. TRON (TRX) is approximately $0.27 registering consistent growth. Forecasts say that TRX could reach $0.275 by the end of 2025 driven by its expanding DeFi system and increasing adoption. Both TRX and DOGE rank among the best cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in at present, with immense scope for investors seeking affordable entry points. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining popularity as potential future high-growth prospects in the cryptocurrency market. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those buying now will see a 16.67% profit when the next price phase starts. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. MUTM’s periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stablecoin Secures Future with Completed Certik Audit A new USD-pegged stablecoin running on the Ethereum chain is soon being launched by Mutuum Finance. The advantage of MUTM stablecoin being pegged to the dollar is that it stops the kind of collapse seen in algorithmic stablecoins. Using recently audited and confirmed smart contracts by Certik, Mutuum Finance can be trusted by all users and investors. Thanks to its special buy-and-distribute approach and an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM joins innovation, safety and trust among its members. Early investment gives daring traders a chance to join the project in its very initial days. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly rising to leadership among sub-$0.50 altcoins, and it has secured $9.7 million from 11,500+ investors. At a current price of $0.03 and an upcoming launch price of $0.06 in the next few weeks, early investors can reach for 100% gains. Backed by a Certik audited contract, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a new Buy-and-Distribute mechanism, MUTM offers innovation with long-term upside. While DOGE and TRX prepare for the next bull run, MUTM is a high-upside play to watch out for presale today.

But with more traders jumping in, especially through meme coins, the system gets overloaded fast. High gas fees, slow transactions, and risky trades can block Ethereum’s full potential. That is why projects like Pepeto matter. They do not just follow Ethereum’s rise , they make it easier for that rise to continue.

More than $5.2 million raised , and that’s just the start Investors are already showing strong belief in Pepeto. The project raised over $5.2 million in its presale stage, proving that serious crypto users are watching closely. With a token price of just $0.000000131, the upside is still big , especially for those who get in early. Even better, long-term holders can stake their Pepeto and earn up to 285 percent annually.

45322468,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69149,1748679321,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst Makes A Case on Why XRP Could Rise 99,900% from $3",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-makes-a-case-on-why-xrp-could-rise-99900-from-3/,"XRP Dragon (@DRAGON_XRP66), a prominent figure in the XRP community, recently sparked discussion by suggesting that, given XRP’s past rise from $0.003 to over $3, a future leap from $3 to $3,000 shouldn’t be dismissed outright. Reaching this target would require a 99,900% climb, and while many see this as unrealistic, XRP Dragon’s statement draws on the asset’s historical rise to its all-time high in 2017/2018 and expectations that it can repeat that performance. A notable aspect of this belief in the asset’s potential is the contrast between the speculative nature of its earlier rally and the current push toward real-world adoption and utility. In 2017, XRP reached its all-time high largely on investor speculation amid a broader crypto market boom. Today, however, Ripple has expanded its partnerships , strengthened its payment infrastructure, and weathered prolonged regulatory battles. If it could perform so well with speculation alone, these factors could help it replicate or even outperform its previous rally . If $XRP went from $0.003 to $3.31 before… who’s to say $3 to $3,000 is impossible?” #XRP pic.twitter.com/pcR0mU73UP — XRP DRAGON (@DRAGON_XRP66) May 29, 2025 Community Reactions XRP Dragon’s statement has prompted a wide range of reactions from the community. One user acknowledged the historical price increase but pointed out that the asset’s early pricing, particularly around $0.003, occurred during the “initial-cap phase” when liquidity was extremely limited. According to this perspective, the more meaningful growth period began around the $0.02–$0.03 range, and the move to $3 from there was already a 100x gain. Applying the same magnitude of growth from $3 would suggest a target closer to $300 rather than $3,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Others noted that broader market conditions today differ significantly from 2017. Increased competition from other blockchain projects, market saturation, and ongoing regulatory risks are seen as potential constraints on the cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory. One commenter noted that without “unprecedented global adoption,” such a leap in value would be “extremely unlikely.” Utility as a Catalyst for Long-Term Growth XRP Dragon is convinced that XRP’s future price movement will mirror its past and reach new heights as a result. However, unlike the speculative-driven surge in 2017, future appreciation could be driven by large-scale XRP adoption and a more favorable regulatory environment. Some experts have predicted that becoming a bridge for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could send XRP as high as $10,000 . Widespread use could contribute to this potential growth. While many in the community continue to debate the plausibility of a 99,900% price surge, the discussion highlights a critical shift in focus from speculation to utility. As utility grows, the asset’s price will reflect this shift. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
