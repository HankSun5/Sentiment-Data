After months of anticipation and complex legal proceedings, the team overseeing the FTX bankruptcy process has officially launched the second phase of its repayment efforts. This is a pivotal moment for FTX creditors who have patiently waited to recover assets lost in the exchange’s dramatic downfall. According to reports, this phase is expected to see a substantial FTX distribution of over $5 billion. The initial disbursements are slated to begin within a short window of 1–3 business days from today, marking a tangible step towards resolution for many. What Does This FTX Repayment Phase Entail? This isn’t the first step in the recovery process, but Phase 2 represents a major wave of distributions. The bankruptcy estate, managed by administrators, has been working diligently to locate, secure, and liquidate assets belonging to the collapsed exchange and its affiliated entities, such as Alameda Research. The goal has been to maximize the value available to repay creditors whose funds were frozen or lost. The specifics of this FTX repayment phase include: Significant Capital Outflow: The commitment to distribute over $5 billion indicates the significant progress made in asset recovery and valuation. This figure represents a large portion of the total estimated value available for distribution. Targeted Audience: These funds are specifically earmarked for eligible FTX creditors who filed claims during the bankruptcy proceedings. The complex process involved verifying claims, determining their value (often based on asset prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing in November 2022), and establishing a distribution hierarchy. Initial Timeline: The 1–3 business day window for the start of distributions suggests that the administrative and technical infrastructure for payout is ready. While distributing funds to a large number of creditors is a complex task, this initial timeframe provides a clear expectation for when the process will commence. Method of Payout: Creditors are typically being repaid based on the USD value of their holdings at the time of the bankruptcy filing. While some distributions might involve in-kind crypto where feasible and approved, a significant portion is expected to be in fiat currency or stablecoins, depending on the creditor’s preference and jurisdictional requirements. This helps manage volatility during the payout period. This phase follows extensive work, including asset sales, legal battles, and negotiations to consolidate assets and create a pool of funds for distribution. It’s a testament to the efforts of the bankruptcy administrators and legal teams involved. A Ray of Hope for FTX Creditors? For the thousands of individuals and institutions who had funds locked on FTX, this announcement is more than just a financial update; it’s a moment of potential relief. The past year and a half have been filled with uncertainty, frustration, and financial strain for many. The start of this major crypto payout offers a tangible outcome after a prolonged period of waiting. While the total recovery percentage for creditors is still subject to the final outcome of the bankruptcy process and asset liquidation, the fact that such a significant amount is being distributed in this phase is generally seen as a positive sign. Early estimates and market conditions (particularly the rise in value of some crypto assets held by FTX) have sometimes suggested a potentially higher recovery rate than is typical in large-scale bankruptcies, though this is not guaranteed for all claim types. This step helps to restore some faith in the process, demonstrating that even in the aftermath of a catastrophic failure like FTX, structured legal processes can yield results for affected parties. It moves the narrative from the collapse itself to the active resolution and restitution phase. Navigating the FTX Bankruptcy Update: What Should Creditors Do? With the distribution phase beginning, it’s crucial for FTX creditors to be informed and cautious. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed via Official Channels: Rely exclusively on official communications from the FTX bankruptcy administrators (like Kroll Restructuring Administration) or the court-appointed representatives. Be wary of unofficial sources, social media rumors, or direct messages claiming to facilitate your payout. Verify Your Payout Details: Ensure the payment method and destination you provided during the claims process are correct and up-to-date. If you need to update information, do so only through the official creditor portal or designated channels. Beware of Scams: Unfortunately, major events like this attract scammers. Be extremely cautious of any unsolicited contact (emails, texts, calls) asking for personal information, wallet keys, or fees to ‘expedite’ your FTX repayment. The administrators will not ask for this information via unofficial channels. Understand Your Claim Status: If you haven’t already, log into the official creditor portal to understand the status of your claim, the approved amount, and the expected method of distribution. Consult Financial/Legal Advisors: For complex claims or significant amounts, considering consulting with a financial advisor or legal counsel who specializes in bankruptcy recovery can be beneficial. Patience remains key, as distributing funds to a large number of creditors across various jurisdictions will take time, even after the initial phase begins. The 1–3 day window is for the *start* of the process, not necessarily the completion of all payouts. The Road Ahead for FTX Distribution and Resolution While the distribution of over $5 billion is a massive step, it’s important to remember that the FTX bankruptcy process is incredibly complex. There may be further phases of distribution as more assets are recovered or legal disputes are resolved. The administrators are tasked with maximizing recovery for all creditors, which can involve liquidating a diverse range of assets, from traditional investments to venture capital stakes and remaining crypto holdings. The successful execution of this phase will build confidence in the remaining steps of the resolution. It demonstrates the operational capability of the bankruptcy estate to handle large-scale financial movements and communicate progress to affected parties. The ultimate goal is to conclude the bankruptcy proceedings and provide as much restitution as possible to those who suffered losses. This FTX bankruptcy update is a critical turning point, shifting the focus from the failure of the exchange to the active process of making amends to those affected. While challenges remain, the commencement of this significant crypto payout is a positive development that offers tangible hope to the multitude of FTX creditors around the globe.

His stance directly opposes Mayor Adams, who is famous for his love of crypto. The division on the topic could be settled when the city heads to the polls, as both men are candidates for November’s mayoral election. Mayor Adams is running as an independent, and Lander is the Democratic candidate. Caught up with @NBCNewYork this morning to call out @andrewcuomo for his absurd attempts to rewrite history on his abysmal labor record. I fought DoorDash to deliver a $21 minimum wage, while Cuomo is taking $1M bribes to do their bidding. pic.twitter.com/zrdP5d8FpY — Brad Lander (@bradlander) May 28, 2025 Mayor Adams’ crypto plans may stall if he does not return to office Mayor Adams has been campaigning to make New York City a hub for crypto in the near future and has even set up an advisory council to that end. However, if he is unable to keep his seat as mayor, and a man who believes “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” takes over, there’s no telling what will happen to the things Mayor Adams sets in motion. Lander also believes that “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” Mayor Adams talked about his Bitbond proposal on Wednesday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, a speech that came a week after he hosted New York City’s inaugural crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion. At the event, he reiterated his pledge to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and announced the creation of a digital assets advisory council to “bring fintech jobs and investment right here to the Big Apple.” Lander called Mayor Adams’s proposal “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,” adding that “the current Federal Tax Law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs.” Lander does not buy the crypto hype While politicians like Adams, Francis Suarez, Cynthia Lummis, Andrew Yang, Tom Emmer, Pat Toomey, Ron DeSantis, and Kirsten Gillibrand have all taken a pro-crypto stance, others are either indecisive or suspicious of crypto. Aside from Lander, another famous critic of crypto is Elizabeth Warren . She is outspoken as a crypto critic and is famous for introducing the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023, which aimed to impose strict regulations on crypto transactions to curb illicit activities. She believes crypto is a “preferred tool” for terrorists, drug traffickers, and money launderers, and has made many other interesting claims. Warren’s stance on crypto is shared by Bernie Sanders and both of them have also worked together on regulations to restrict banks’ engagement with crypto, arguing it lacks “real public purpose” and primarily benefits speculators while causing financial losses for others. Sanders also supports measures to limit crypto’s environmental and economic impacts. These politicians who seem to be anti-crypto all share concerns about the industry’s volatility, potential for criminal use, environmental impact, and lack of consumer protections. Lander’s unenthusiastic response to Bitbonds reflects a cautious stance that aligns with broader Democratic skepticism about crypto’s stability and public utility. Landers and the other anti-crypto politicians have been pushing for stricter regulations in hopes that it will address perceived gaps in oversight, a concern Lander echoed in his critique of Bitbonds’ legal viability.

Recently, the TST Memecoin experienced a sharp reminder of this reality, undergoing a significant and sudden drop on major trading platforms, including Binance. This event underscores the inherent volatility and significant Cryptocurrency Risks associated with such speculative assets. What Triggered the TST Memecoin Crash? According to a report by Wu Blockchain shared on X, the Test (TST) memecoin saw a precipitous decline. Specifically, the token plummeted by a staggering 40% to a price point of $0.03456 across both the Binance spot and futures markets. This kind of rapid price movement is not uncommon in the memecoin space, but a 40% drop in a short period certainly grabs attention and causes concern among holders and traders involved in Binance Trading . While the exact catalyst for this specific drop wasn’t immediately clear from the initial report, memecoin crashes can be triggered by various factors: Whale Movements: Large holders selling off significant portions of their supply can overwhelm buy orders and drive prices down rapidly. Sentiment Shifts: Negative news, rumors, or a general shift in market sentiment away from speculative assets can lead to panic selling. Market-Wide Corrections: Sometimes, a memecoin crash is part of a broader downturn in the overall crypto market, driven by macroeconomic factors or regulatory news. Lack of Fundamentals: Memecoins often lack underlying technology or real-world use cases, making their value purely dependent on speculation and community hype. When that hype fades, the price can collapse. Understanding the Impact on Binance Trading The fact that the drop occurred on both Binance spot and futures markets is significant. The spot market reflects the immediate supply and demand for the asset, while the futures market allows traders to speculate on future price movements, often using leverage. A sharp drop like this affects traders in different ways: Spot Traders: Holders on the spot market see the value of their assets decrease directly. Futures Traders: Those with leveraged long positions (betting on the price going up) face potential liquidations, where their positions are automatically closed by the exchange because they can no longer cover potential losses. This can accelerate the price decline. Conversely, those with short positions (betting on the price going down) profit from the crash. The incident highlights the amplified risks involved in futures trading, especially with highly volatile assets like TST Memecoin . The potential for rapid and substantial losses is ever-present. Why Does Crypto Market Volatility Hit Memecoins Hardest? Crypto Market Volatility is a well-known characteristic of the entire digital asset space. However, memecoins often experience volatility to an extreme degree. Why is this the case? Unlike established cryptocurrencies with developed ecosystems or Bitcoin’s status as a digital store of value, memecoins derive their value primarily from community hype, social media trends, and speculative trading. This makes them incredibly susceptible to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. A viral tweet can send the price soaring, while a large sell-off or negative rumor can cause a rapid Memecoin Crash . Their low prices and high circulating supplies also mean that relatively small amounts of capital, compared to larger cap coins, can cause significant percentage swings in price. This low barrier to entry for price manipulation (intentional or unintentional) contributes to their extreme volatility. Navigating Cryptocurrency Risks in the Memecoin Space The TST incident serves as a stark reminder of the significant Cryptocurrency Risks present, particularly within the memecoin niche. For anyone considering or currently involved in trading these assets, understanding and mitigating these risks is paramount. Key Risks to Consider: Risk Type Description Impact on Memecoins Market Volatility Prices can change drastically and rapidly. Extreme price swings, potential for rapid crashes (like the TST Memecoin Crash ). Liquidity Risk Difficulty buying or selling large amounts without significantly affecting the price. Sudden large orders can cause disproportionate price drops or spikes. Rug Pulls/Scams Project developers abandon the project and steal funds. Complete loss of investment. High risk in unverified memecoins. Sentiment & Hype Driven Value based on social media trends and community excitement. Price is highly unstable and can collapse if hype disappears. Lack of Fundamentals No underlying technology, use case, or revenue stream. Value is purely speculative, making long-term holding risky. Actionable Insights for Traders on Binance (and Beyond) Given the inherent risks, especially with assets prone to a Memecoin Crash , what steps can traders take, particularly when engaging in Binance Trading or on other platforms? Strategies to Consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are investing in, even if it’s a memecoin. Look for community strength, developer activity (though often limited), and understand the tokenomics. Risk Management is Crucial: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Memecoins are highly speculative. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically sell your position if the price drops to a certain level, limiting potential losses during a sudden crash like the one seen with TST Memecoin . Avoid Excessive Leverage: While futures trading offers the potential for high returns, leverage magnifies losses during volatile swings. Be extremely cautious with leverage, especially on memecoins. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into one highly speculative asset. Spread your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies. Beware of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Don’t buy into a coin just because it’s pumping. You might be buying at the peak right before a crash. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources (like Wu Blockchain) and community sentiment, but verify information before acting on it. These strategies are not guarantees against losses, but they are essential tools for navigating the unpredictable landscape of Crypto Market Volatility and mitigating Cryptocurrency Risks . The Broader Picture: Crypto Market Volatility Remains While the TST specific event is noteworthy for its severity, it’s a symptom of the larger reality of the crypto market. Price swings of 10%, 20%, or even 40% in a day are not unheard of, especially further down the market cap ladder. This volatility is driven by a confluence of factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. Successful navigation of this environment requires a long-term perspective, robust risk management, and continuous learning. Summary: Lessons from the TST Memecoin Crash The recent 40% plummet of TST Memecoin on Binance serves as a potent case study in the extreme volatility and significant Cryptocurrency Risks inherent in the memecoin market. It highlights how quickly fortunes can change for those involved in Binance Trading of such assets. Understanding the factors contributing to a Memecoin Crash and implementing strict risk management strategies are vital for anyone venturing into this highly speculative corner of the crypto world. While the potential rewards can be high, the risks, as demonstrated by TST, are equally substantial.

At the same time, the Trump Coin is facing a retrace risk following its recent surge, fueled by hype.

Priced at $0.00000035 per token, investors receive 80% bonus tokens upon purchase. The Ethereum Price Sets Sights On $4,000 Amid Growing Bullish Momentum. Currently down 45.8% from its December 2024 peak of $4,000, the Ethereum price has arrived at a key resistance point. With limited historical barriers beyond this point, conditions appear favorable for the Ethereum price to move toward $4,000. A bullish continuation pattern is forming, hinting that another impulsive leg upward for the Ethereum price may be just around the corner. Crypto analyst Astronomer, in a lengthy post, emphasized the long-term inverse relationship between the Ethereum price and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). He noted that with the DXY dropping significantly, the Ethereum price is likely to range high, possibly reaching $4,000, calling the setup “flawless.” Trump Coin Faces Steep Decline As Retracement Threat Persists The Trump Coin surged in the lead-up to a fancy dinner hosted by President Donald Trump. Some investors spent nearly $150 million for access; however, prices dropped by 16% immediately after the event within hours. The Trump Coin reached a high of $16.50 before the May 23 black-tie gala but quickly fell back to $12.76 soon after. Technical charts show several large wallets sold a significant amount of the Trump coin right after the event. Crypto Analyst Kamil suggests that unless the Trump coin breaks above $15 again, a retracement risk remains high. Without a unique technology or use case, the Trump Coin value may struggle to hold its ground. As hype fades post-event, investors are moving on. Many are heading toward the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale for its long-term upside and the AI technology behind it.

This declaration isn’t just a statement; it signals a renewed focus on a contentious area of US trade policy that has significant implications beyond borders, potentially even rippling into financial markets watched closely by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Understanding the Trump Tariffs and the Trade Court Battle When we talk about Trump tariffs , we’re referring primarily to the duties imposed during his presidency under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (citing national security concerns, mainly on steel and aluminum imports) and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (in response to unfair trade practices, notably targeting China). These tariffs sparked significant opposition, leading to legal challenges in various courts, including the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The trade court battle involves complex legal arguments. Opponents argue that these tariffs were unlawfully imposed, exceeding presidential authority or violating procedural requirements. The government, under Trump, defended them as necessary measures to protect domestic industries and national security. The ongoing legal disputes center on the scope of presidential power under these trade statutes and whether the executive branch followed the correct legal procedures. Here’s a simplified look at the key legal fronts: Section 232 Cases: Challenges against tariffs on steel and aluminum, often arguing they weren’t truly based on national security or that the process was flawed. Section 301 Cases (China Tariffs): Lawsuits contending these tariffs were an unauthorized escalation of trade disputes beyond the scope of Section 301’s original intent or that the process lacked proper public notice and comment. Constitutional Challenges: Some cases touch upon the separation of powers, questioning whether Congress improperly delegated too much tariff authority to the President. Why is Winning the Court Battle So Crucial for Trump’s Political Strategy? Donald Trump’s political identity is heavily intertwined with his ‘America First’ economic agenda, where using tariffs as a tool for negotiation and protection was a centerpiece. Vowing to win the court battle isn’t just about the legal outcome; it’s a critical part of his ongoing political strategy . Securing legal victories would: Validate Past Actions: A court win would retroactively legitimize a core policy of his presidency, allowing him to claim vindication against critics who argued his tariffs were illegal or poorly implemented. Empower Future Policy: Winning sets potential precedents that could provide a stronger legal basis for implementing similar or expanded tariffs if he were to return to office. Reinforce Political Narrative: It aligns with his message of being a strong leader willing to fight for American workers and industries against foreign competition and perceived unfair practices. It’s a way to demonstrate resolve and commitment to his base. Maintain Leverage: While the specific cases might pertain to past actions, the legal principles at stake could influence the executive branch’s power regarding trade measures, impacting future negotiation leverage. This isn’t merely a legalistic stance; it’s a strategic move aimed at shaping public perception and solidifying his policy credentials ahead of potential future political endeavors. Challenges and Hurdles in the Trade Court Battle Despite Trump’s confident declaration, winning these legal challenges is far from guaranteed. The trade court battle presents significant challenges and legal hurdles: Legal Arguments Against Tariffs: The core of the opposition’s case often rests on challenging the statutory basis or the implementation process. For Section 232 tariffs, opponents question whether the national security justification was genuine or merely a pretext for economic protectionism, which is typically outside the scope of the act. For Section 301 tariffs, arguments often revolve around whether the actions taken directly addressed the ‘unfair practices’ identified and whether the process adhered to administrative law requirements, such as providing adequate opportunity for public input. Judicial Scrutiny: While courts often grant deference to the executive branch on matters of foreign policy and national security, this deference is not unlimited. Courts will examine whether the executive branch acted within the authority granted by Congress and followed the procedures mandated by law. Judges are tasked with interpreting complex trade statutes, and different panels of judges can arrive at different conclusions, leading to appeals and prolonged litigation. Precedent and Interpretation: Trade law is a specialized and often complex area. The outcome of these cases can depend heavily on how judges interpret specific phrases within decades-old statutes and how they apply existing legal precedents regarding executive power and administrative procedure. Novel arguments or interpretations could sway decisions. Winning requires successfully defending the administration’s interpretation of its authority and demonstrating that all legal procedures were correctly followed, a task made difficult by the complex and often controversial nature of the tariff decisions themselves. What is the Potential Economic Impact of the Tariff Court Outcomes? The outcome of the trade court battle carries potential implications for the economy. While specific impacts are debated among economists, here are some potential areas of influence: Certainty vs. Uncertainty: A definitive ruling, whether upholding or striking down the tariffs, could reduce uncertainty for businesses. If tariffs are upheld, companies that adjusted supply chains or absorbed costs might see the status quo confirmed. If struck down, it could lead to refunds of duties paid (potentially billions of dollars) and a reversal of trade flows, requiring new adjustments. Industry Competitiveness: Industries that benefited from tariff protection (like domestic steel and aluminum producers) could face renewed foreign competition if tariffs are removed. Industries that were harmed by retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports could see markets reopen. Consumer Costs and Inflation: Tariffs are taxes on imports, often leading to higher costs for consumers or businesses that use imported goods. Removing tariffs could potentially lower costs, while upholding them maintains this upward pressure on prices, contributing to inflationary concerns. Global Trade Relations: The legal outcome could influence the U.S.’s standing in global trade negotiations and its relationship with key trading partners. A ruling that limits presidential authority might necessitate a different approach to trade disputes in the future. For those watching the broader markets, including cryptocurrency, significant shifts in trade policy or large-scale refunds/impositions of duties could add to macroeconomic volatility, which sometimes correlates with movements in digital asset prices, although this link is indirect and complex. Exploring the Broader Implications for US Trade Policy The legal fight over Trump tariffs is more than just about past duties; it’s about the future of US trade policy . The court’s decisions will help define the boundaries of executive power in using tools like Section 232 and Section 301. Potential Outcomes and Their Effects: Tariffs Upheld: This would affirm broad presidential authority under these statutes, potentially making it easier for future administrations (including a potential second Trump term) to implement similar unilateral trade measures. Tariffs Struck Down: This would constrain presidential power, potentially forcing future administrations to rely more on congressional action or international trade bodies like the WTO (despite its current challenges) to address trade grievances. Mixed Rulings: Courts might uphold some tariffs while striking down others based on the specific legal arguments, leading to a more nuanced definition of executive trade authority. The outcome will be closely watched by trade partners, international organizations, and businesses worldwide, as it will signal how the U.S. government can and will likely use its trade levers in the years to come. This foundational aspect of economic interaction is a key factor in global stability, which in turn, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean? While this trade court battle might seem distant from the day-to-day world of cryptocurrency, understanding its potential ramifications offers valuable insights: Monitor Macro Trends: Pay attention to how major economic policy disputes like this progress. Outcomes could influence inflation, supply chain stability, and overall market sentiment – factors that can indirectly affect the crypto market. Understand Political Influence: Recognize that political strategies and legal battles over economic policy are interconnected. Trump’s vow highlights how trade remains a potent political tool, and its use can create volatility or shift economic landscapes. Diversification Awareness: The uncertainty generated by such high-stakes legal and political battles underscores the importance of understanding diverse market drivers and potentially considering diversification strategies, whether within crypto or across different asset classes (this is not financial advice, merely an observation on market dynamics). Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources covering trade law and economic policy. Understanding the potential legal precedents being set can provide context for future government actions impacting the economy. The declaration by Trump to win the court battle is a reminder that fundamental economic policies are still being shaped and challenged through legal and political means, with consequences that can extend into various facets of the financial world. Conclusion: The Stakes of the Tariff Court Battle Donald Trump’s pledge to secure victory in the ongoing legal challenges against his administration’s tariffs underscores the significant stakes involved. This isn’t just about past policies or collecting duties; it’s a pivotal trade court battle that will help define the future scope of presidential authority in setting US trade policy . The legal complexities, combined with the potential for substantial economic impact on industries, consumers, and global trade relations, make this a closely watched issue. For Trump, winning is also a crucial element of his ongoing political strategy , aiming to validate his ‘America First’ approach and position himself for future influence. While the direct link to cryptocurrency might seem tenuous, the broader implications for economic stability, market volatility, and the global political landscape are factors that informed participants in any market, including digital assets, should consider. The outcome of these legal battles will contribute to the complex web of forces shaping the economic environment for years to come.

For industry participants, the lack of a defined framework has created uncertainty and hindered innovation. However, a recent development on Capitol Hill is sparking optimism, particularly within companies navigating this complex landscape. Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at Ripple, has voiced strong support for a newly introduced bill, signaling a potentially pivotal moment for Crypto Clarity in the United States. Why the CLARITY Act is a Potential Game Changer for US Crypto Regulation On X (formerly Twitter), Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty lauded the introduction of the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , commonly referred to as the CLARITY Act , in the U.S. Congress. He described the bill as a significant stride towards establishing comprehensive rules for digital assets in the country. His sentiment, “Clarity shouldn’t be controversial — and this bill moves us closer to a smart, workable framework,” encapsulates the industry’s deep-seated desire for regulatory certainty. But what exactly is the CLARITY Act and why is it being hailed as such a crucial step forward? At its core, the bill aims to provide much-needed definitions and guidelines for digital assets, particularly concerning the distinction between a commodity and a security. This has been a major point of contention and the source of significant regulatory confusion, leading to enforcement actions and uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Here are some key areas the CLARITY Act seeks to address: Defining Digital Assets: Establishing clear legal definitions for different types of digital assets. Regulatory Jurisdiction: Providing clarity on which regulatory body (like the SEC or CFTC) has oversight over specific digital asset activities. Market Structure: Offering guidance on how digital asset markets should operate under U.S. law. How Does the CLARITY Act Address Industry Concerns? The existing regulatory environment in the U.S. for cryptocurrencies has often been criticized for being fragmented and relying on enforcement actions rather than clear rules. This has led to what many perceive as regulation by enforcement, making it difficult for companies to innovate and operate with confidence. For a company like Ripple , which has been embroiled in a high-profile legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of its XRP token, the call for clarity is particularly resonant. Stuart Alderoty’s comments reflect the industry’s frustration with the current state and its hope that legislative action can provide a more predictable path forward. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act aims to provide a framework that could potentially: Reduce regulatory uncertainty for businesses operating in the digital asset space. Foster innovation by providing clear rules of the road. Offer greater protection for consumers and investors by establishing clear market standards. What Are the Challenges and the Path Ahead for Crypto Clarity? While the introduction of the CLARITY Act is undoubtedly a positive development and a significant step towards comprehensive US crypto regulation , the legislative process is often lengthy and complex. The bill will need to gain traction, navigate committee reviews, and secure votes in both the House and the Senate before potentially becoming law. Furthermore, achieving true Crypto Clarity will likely require ongoing dialogue and collaboration between lawmakers, regulators, and industry participants. Different stakeholders may have varying perspectives on how digital assets should be regulated, and finding a consensus can be challenging. Stuart Alderoty’s statement highlights the importance of this legislative effort but also implicitly acknowledges that it is just one piece of the puzzle. The industry will be watching closely to see how the bill progresses and whether it can indeed deliver the smart, workable framework that is desperately needed. In conclusion, the introduction of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , championed by figures like Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty, represents a beacon of hope for those seeking a more defined and predictable regulatory landscape in the United States. While challenges remain, the bipartisan effort signifies a growing recognition in Congress of the need for legislative action to bring much-needed Crypto Clarity to the digital asset market. It is a crucial step that could pave the way for greater innovation, investor protection, and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies under a clearer regulatory umbrella.

At its current entry price of just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI is attracting comparisons to Ripple’s early days, when low-priced tokens with practical applications had the scope to dominate the market. With analysts projecting its value could hit $1 by Q4 2025, this fledgling token is offering a potential 100x return for investors eager to get in early. But what sets Ruvi AI apart, and could this truly be the next crypto giant? What makes Ruvi AI stand out? Unlike many cryptocurrencies driven by hype, Ruvi AI is rooted in real-world utility. The token leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to solve problems across industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. While Ripple gained recognition for revolutionizing cross-border payments, Ruvi AI aims to bring similar transformation to its chosen fields. Its practical applications include: Healthcare: Automating diagnostics, enhancing operational efficiency, and reducing costs. Logistics: Optimizing supply chain networks by identifying bottlenecks and improving performance. Finance: Strengthening fraud detection and boosting transactional security through AI-driven solutions. By focusing on utility from the outset, Ruvi AI has positioned itself as much more than a speculative asset. It’s a technology platform designed to impact industries that are increasingly dependent on innovation. Breaking records with its presale Ruvi AI’s market presence has already made waves. During its record-breaking presale, the project sold over 130 million tokens and raised an impressive $1.4 million, highlighting strong investor confidence in its potential. This early success, combined with an accessible starting price of $0.015, has laid a strong foundation for further growth. Strategic partnerships strengthen Ruvi AI’s prospects Ruvi AI recently announced a collaborative partnership with Weex Exchange, a significant step in its roadmap. This partnership bolsters its visibility and enhances trading accessibility, making it easier for new and seasoned investors to trade Ruvi AI tokens. Strategic alliances like this echo Ripple’s early successes with institutional partnerships that cemented its credibility and fueled adoption. Weex Exchange’s robust trading ecosystem allows Ruvi AI to expand its market reach while offering investors a seamless trading experience. Such a partnership not only ensures liquidity and stability but also reinforces Ruvi AI’s commitment to strategic growth. Ripple vs Ruvi AI: how they compare Ripple made headlines in its early days for introducing a blockchain solution that simplified international transactions, gaining adoption across banks and financial institutions. Ruvi AI echoes this sentiment by addressing inefficiencies across crucial sectors like healthcare and logistics, where the need for intelligent automation is growing more urgent. However, while Ripple eventually faced legal and regulatory hurdles, Ruvi AI operates in a landscape shaped by lessons learned from its predecessors. Its emphasis on compliance, utility, and functionality positions it as a strong contender to avoid similar pitfalls. Boosting returns with VIP investment tiers Ruvi AI isn’t just making waves with its utility and partnerships. Its VIP investment options are attracting numerous investors eager to maximize their returns. These tiers provide lucrative bonuses designed to reward early participants. Here’s how they work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens = 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07/token = $4,900. Value at $1/token = $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens = 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07/token = $15,680. Value at $1/token = $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens = 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07/token = $89,600. Value at $1/token = $1,280,000. For investors seeking exponential returns, these options create a clear incentive to back Ruvi AI early in its lifecycle. Is Ruvi AI the next big thing? Cryptocurrencies with low entry points and tangible use cases often generate long-term success, provided they can back up their potential with real outcomes. Ruvi AI combines the accessibility of an affordable token with the strategic vision of a technology designed for impactful applications. Its collaboration with Weex Exchange, robust presale performance, and projected valuation of $1 by Q4 2025 make it one of the most talked-about tokens today. Ripple’s meteoric rise stemmed from its early focus on streamlining finance. Similarly, Ruvi AI’s focus on solving inefficiencies across multiple industries positions it for comparable, if not greater, success. Final thoughts At just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI offers an opportunity that’s hard to ignore. Drawing comparisons to Ripple’s early days is not just a testament to its potential but also its readiness to redefine how modern industries utilize AI and blockchain. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, Ruvi AI’s commitment to utility, innovation, and strategic growth makes it a compelling case for the future.

This is more than just a presale, it’s a race. Why BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Are a Game Changer BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles add a new layer of excitement to the presale experience. Instead of simply buying coins, participants are ranked daily based on how much BDAG they accumulate, with the leaderboard resetting every 24 hours, and the top buyer of the day gets any unsold amount of a 150 million BDAG daily pool.

This comes just as the analyst predicted that the altcoin could hit a $1.5 trillion market. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $22 As Bullish Candle Forms In an X post, Egrag Crypto predicted that candle 13 on the yearly chart could be the breakout candle that sends the XRP price to $13 or $22. He also raised the possibility of the altcoin surging above these price levels, with a wick extending even higher. Based on his analysis of Candle 9, the 2021 yearly candle, the analyst noted that Candle 13 points to a target of around $17. Related Reading: XRP Holds Midline Support That Has Led To Breakout In The Past, Why $2.9 Could Be Next Egrag Crypto remarked that this aligns perfectly between $13 and $22 for the XRP price. He also commented on Candle 12, noting that it was the strongest Bullish Engulfing pattern. This engulfing process started from Candle 5 and continued through Candle 11. The analyst added that the body of these candles closed above all previous candles, which is a “classic bullish sign.” It is even more bullish when it occurs on a yearly or 12-month chart, as in this case. Commenting on the current XRP price action, Egrag Crypto stated that the noise is still loud on the high timeframes. He noted that the body of Candle 13 is above $1.85, and the wick extends up to around $3.40. The analyst claimed that a close below $1.85 could mark the end of the bull run, while a close above $3.40 confirms that XRP is heading to double digits. Interestingly, the crypto analyst declared that December 31 this year will be a date to remember in XRP history. He remarked that market participants will see where the XRP price stands and what kind of candle formations are shaping up for the legendary year. XRP At A Critical Level In an X post, Crypto analyst CasiTrades noted that the XRP price has returned to the $2.25 range, which is one of the most important levels on the chart. She stated that this zone has acted as both resistance and support since the $0.50 breakout, and now a proper backtest is underway. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Could Shoot To $12 Soon The analyst revealed that the smaller timeframes show that this level could hold. However, she warned that higher-timeframe confirmation is key and that the XRP price needs daily closes above $2.25 to confirm a bullish pivot. CasiTrades added that whether or not this is the final pivot, this level remains a high-probability zone for buyers. She noted that the next major support is at $1.90 if this $2.25 support fails. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.21, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Cardano Eyes a Rally & Tron Trends Upward,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-presale-hits-8-2-million-cardano-eyes-a-rally-tron-trends-upward/,"Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Unstaked each offer a different path for crypto utility, and all three are showing potential heading into 2025. TRX’s current price activity remains steady, holding above $0.20. If the resistance barriers near $0.30 and $0.45 are cleared, there’s a path toward $0.73 that analysts are beginning to take seriously. Cardano’s recent 20% push to $0.74 has brought it back into the spotlight despite recent community issues. But Unstaked , the AI-focused project priced under a cent, has already started showing real traction. Now in stage 17 of its presale, priced at $0.01043, and projecting a launch price of $0.1819, it could deliver a 2,700% return for early participants. TRON’s Stablecoin Progress Raises Eyes Toward $0.73 Goal TRON (TRX) has maintained strong momentum by staying above the $0.20 range, and some market watchers suggest that a climb toward $0.73 is possible if it can push past the hurdles at $0.30 and $0.45. TRON’s increasing use in DApps and its fast-speed infrastructure have made it attractive for those following scalable networks. Consistent growth in developer interest and active users on TRON helps strengthen this outlook. Still, success depends on TRX breaking through technical resistance. For those following projects with steady user adoption and network development, TRON remains in focus as the market moves toward 2025. ADA’s Price Targets Take Shape Despite Community Tensions ADA’s rebound to $0.74, following a notable 20% climb, has stirred fresh speculation about its ability to rise to $2.80. Experts point to $0.85 as the next key resistance, and if that’s surpassed, the possibility of further gains becomes real. Much of this optimism is based on Cardano’s consistent focus on research-backed growth and development. However, allegations linked to a $600 million ADA issue, though denied by founder Charles Hoskinson, have caused some uncertainty. Still, ADA’s stability and technical strength keep it in the conversation as a contender for higher returns. Unstaked: Growing Fast, Still Below a Cent, With AI Agents Coming After Launch Unstaked is building a platform meant to support creators and marketers in growing their reach using AI. Users will be able to design their own AI agents to manage engagement across platforms like Telegram, X, and Discord. These agents will post, respond, adapt, and improve based on data in real time. As confirmed in its whitepaper, the agents will go live after the presale ends and the platform launches. Now in stage 17, Unstaked is priced at $0.01043, with an expected listing price of $0.1819. This creates a projected return of 2,700%. With $8.2 million already raised, the platform is gaining attention rapidly. What makes Unstaked stand apart is how directly it connects its features with user benefits. Access to automation tools and platform utilities is linked to ownership, offering creators a powerful edge. As more digital brands look for faster ways to grow and stand out, Unstaked is becoming one of the most practical plays in Web3. At under a cent, this price range might not last much longer. Final Takeaway! TRON is showing strong technical structure, and Cardano continues to push upward through mixed sentiment. Both are advancing, but Unstaked brings something fresh: a product ecosystem about to go live. The crypto presale price is still just $0.01043, with a target launch price of $0.1819 and over $8.2 million already raised. With its unique AI angle and post-launch agent rollout, Unstaked is positioning itself as a serious contender for big gains in 2025. While TRX and ADA navigate the broader market, Unstaked is moving forward with clear momentum.

Recent market reports show structural optimism returning across the crypto sector, with macro players forecasting bullish patterns not just for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for platforms with deep real-world functionality. While VeChain focuses on supply-chain impact and Hedera inches closer to becoming a top Ethereum alternative, a lesser-known name— Qubetics —has shocked the market by surpassing 514 million $TICS tokens sold and $17.5 million raised in its ongoing presale. It’s this emerging trio that many are now calling the most potential crypto lineup of the quarter. And while Hedera’s HBAR is getting serious attention thanks to unique technical upside projections, and VeChain strengthens partnerships across logistics and ESG, Qubetics introduces a modular infrastructure with an on-chain tokenization marketplace that may reshape how physical and digital assets get exchanged in Web3. Each of these projects is riding its own wave of traction—whether technical, institutional, or community-driven—offering completely different angles for what the most potential crypto could actually look like in a complex 2025 market. So what sets Qubetics apart? Why does its presale price rise by 10% every single Sunday? And how exactly are Hedera and VeChain leveraging their latest expansions? Let’s break down the details. Qubetics Builds a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace That Solves What Others Couldn’t Qubetics isn’t another generic altcoin. It’s Web3’s first fully integrated aggregator, uniting the functionality of several top blockchains into one interoperable hub. But what truly defines its application is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace—a cross-chain protocol that enables real estate, commodities, luxury goods, and even private equity shares to be securely tokenized, bought, and sold. That alone is making it stand out as a most potential crypto candidate among seasoned market watchers. Imagine a small real estate firm in Miami. With Qubetics, they can tokenize fractional ownership of properties and offer them to global participants without involving centralized intermediaries. Or consider a collectibles startup in Los Angeles that wants to create transparent, tamper-proof NFT records tied to physical luxury watches. Qubetics provides the infrastructure to bridge those assets with on-chain smart contracts across Solana, Polygon, and Ethereum—all within one dashboard. That’s not theoretical. That’s what the Qubetics ecosystem is built for. With tokenized assets becoming a high-demand vertical for both retail and institutional participants, Qubetics’ use case aligns perfectly with the next chapter of Web3. It takes what traditional platforms promised—but couldn’t scale—and gives it frictionless, audited functionality. That alone gives $TICS the kind of narrative momentum typically seen in projects that later end up among the most potential crypto leaders of the cycle. Qubetics Presale Stats and ROI Forecasts Signal Why It May Be the Most Potential Crypto Now Right now, the Qubetics presale is in its 36th stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.3064. Over 27,300 participants have joined the Qubetics presale, pushing the total raise past $17.5 million and confirming demand through the sale of more than 514 million tokens. What makes this even more exciting for early adopters is that every presale stage lasts just 7 days, and price jumps by 10% at midnight every Sunday, creating a clear incentive structure for early entries. And here’s where the ROI math gets compelling. If $TICS hits just $1 after the presale, that’s a 226.32% return. But analysts are looking far beyond that, projecting scenarios where Qubetics reaches $5 to $15 following its Q2 2025 mainnet launch. If $TICS reaches $5, the ROI becomes 1,531.58%. At $10, returns expand to 3,163.16%, and a $15 milestone would deliver an eye-watering 4,794.74% ROI. Consider a simple $100 buy-in right now. At a $15 post-launch price, that same $100 would turn into $4,894.74—and the momentum suggests that possibility isn’t far-fetched. It’s this kind of structured growth opportunity that has community members dubbing it the best crypto pre sale of 2025. And with 10% weekly jumps, missing a Sunday could mean missing a major discount. Hedera Forecasts a Faster 5x Growth Than Ethereum In a detailed analysis published by Brave New Coin, Hedera’s native token HBAR is forecasted to grow 5x faster than Ethereum based on its efficient consensus model, sustainability, and active enterprise-grade integrations. Unlike typical proof-of-work platforms, Hedera utilizes the hashgraph consensus mechanism, which dramatically boosts speed and scalability while keeping costs low. That alone has drawn interest from institutions tired of ETH gas fees and throughput bottlenecks. One of the key signals in the report is Hedera’s institutional alignment. It is governed by a council that includes tech giants like Google, IBM, LG, and Boeing, ensuring both trust and innovation at the enterprise level. With over 33 council members and consistent mainnet transaction growth, Hedera’s infrastructure supports high-value apps in DeFi, gaming, and carbon offset markets. From a technical standpoint, HBAR’s fundamentals and adoption metrics suggest an exponential curve, especially as the market prepares for a post-Ethereum-scaling era. These factors combine to place Hedera as not just a competitor—but potentially one of the most potential crypto projects if its growth continues at this pace. VeChain Boosts Enterprise Ecosystem With X Node Upgrade In a recent update published by Binance Square, VeChain’s foundation has activated new X Node benefits to incentivize long-term participation and expand enterprise use. This strategic change increases node rewards and unlocks new staking options, directly targeting the network’s most active backers. These upgrades come as VeChain’s roadmap aligns deeper with real-world enterprise logistics, ESG tracking, and carbon footprint transparency. What makes this interesting is the dual-token economy of VeChain—VET for value transfer and VTHO for gas—which is being optimized through ecosystem upgrades to enhance scalability and reduce congestion. Additionally, with partnerships across the automotive, food safety, and logistics industries, VeChain is being looked at by stakeholders in Europe and Asia as a compliance-ready solution for blockchain-based supply chain traceability. From a tokenomics and corporate engagement standpoint, VeChain’s current positioning is more mature than many altcoins in its tier. And with structural upgrades and governance improvements underway, VET is re-entering expert watchlists as a most potential crypto—especially among ESG-conscious communities and real-world business platforms. Why These 3 May Be the Most Potential Crypto Trio to Watch This Quarter In a market that’s regaining its footing, these three projects represent a powerful blend of innovation and execution. Qubetics is bringing real-world asset tokenization to the forefront while climbing its presale ladder with clear ROI modeling and strong momentum. Hedera, backed by elite corporate nodes, is forecasted to outpace Ethereum in speed and efficiency, which could trigger a large-scale narrative shift. VeChain, meanwhile, is tapping into the tangible enterprise world, reinforcing its supply chain relevance while rolling out strategic upgrades. Together, they’re not just riding hype—they’re anchoring real-world utility to the blockchain promise. And that’s why Qubetics, VeChain, and Hedera are currently regarded among the most potential crypto opportunities on the table. Whether you’re searching for the top crypto presale , an enterprise-driven protocol, or a green, scalable layer-1, this lineup covers all bases. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the most potential crypto in 2025? Qubetics, Hedera, and VeChain are considered the most potential crypto projects due to their real-world applications, presale growth, and enterprise-grade infrastructure. How much can $100 grow in Qubetics presale? At a $15 post-launch price, a $100 investment in Qubetics presale could grow to $4,894.74 based on current ROI projections. Why is Qubetics called the best crypto pre sale? Due to weekly 10% price hikes, strong real-world applications, and over $17.5M raised, many participants call Qubetics the best crypto pre sale opportunity of the year.

Yet as the court weighs its options, new artificial intelligence rivals may already be chipping away at Google’s dominance faster than any judge’s ruling could take effect. A key issue at trial has been the rise of AI tools that appear to be eroding Google’s lead in the search engine game. Mehta is set to hear final arguments this Friday from the Justice Department and Google on remedies meant to boost competition in search. His ultimate decision could also shape how AI services gain ground in the search market. The Justice Department, which sued Google in 2020, wants sweeping changes. It has urged the court to force the company to sell its Chrome browser, restrict it from paying Apple to remain the default search engine, and require it to share its search data with competitors. Regulators say these strong steps are justified by a legal benchmark set more than 20 years ago, when the government attempted to break up Microsoft. “All three of the DOJ’s major remedies are aimed at helping generative AI providers take share from Google,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at TD Cowen. Mehta has indicated he plans to issue his ruling in August The search engine giant counters that the government’s proposed fixes go too far and would cause irreparable damage to its business. Holding about 90% market share of online search queries in the U.S., the company has suggested a narrower approach: tweak its agreements with Apple, Mozilla, and Android to carve out space for rivals. The tech firm says it will appeal the judge’s ruling. Each year, the company pays roughly $20 billion to Apple for default placement in Apple’s Safari browser. Any change to that arrangement could erase billions from Apple’s profits. Mehta is weighing whether to stop Google from sharing revenue with Apple under the current deal, which could change how Google is embedded in the Safari browser. Lawyers and experts warn that his decision may also influence future contracts among tech giants over how AI features are featured on their platforms. The Justice Department is against Google paying Samsung and Motorola to pre-install Gemini In court, the Justice Department pointed to Google’s more recent efforts to dominate AI-driven search. According to testimony, Google has begun paying Samsung and Motorola to pre-install its new AI system, Gemini, on their devices. The department argues that this practice aims to capture the next wave of internet search and should be banned. Shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, fell sharply this month after an Apple executive testified that Google searches in Safari had declined for the first time in nearly twenty years. The same executive said Apple plans to offer AI options such as ChatGPT or Perplexity in Safari within the following year. Google responded in a blog post, saying that overall searches for Apple devices and services have actually risen. “A formidable question that hovers over the entire proceeding is how should the judge take account of emerging developments and the technology that affect the fortunes of all of these companies,” said William Kovacic, a professor of antitrust law at George Washington University and former FTC chairman. During the trial, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, testified that Google aims to finalize a distribution agreement with Apple by midyear. Under that deal, Apple would tap Google’s own AI model and chatbot, Gemini, to answer user queries—an option Apple already offers using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Last week, Google announced the U.S. launch of “AI Mode,” a new way to respond to searches with conversational answers rather than the familiar list of blue links. It represents the biggest overhaul of its search engine in years and is powered by Gemini. Google has been steadily improving Gemini , which supports AI Mode and other features across its products. Although Gemini’s user base has grown in recent months, it still trails ChatGPT in popularity. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Speaking at a U.S. Steel facility in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, Trump told an applauding crowd of employees that he had a “major announcement.” He said the higher tariff would “secure the steel industry in the United States” and warned that no one would be able to “get around that” new tariff rate. “We are going to be imposing a 25% increase,” Trump explained. “We’re going to bring it from 25% to 50%, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States. Nobody’s going to get around that.” He added that he had considered setting the rate at 40%, but industry leaders persuaded him to go further. “At 25% they can sorta get over that fence,” Trump said. “At 50% nobody’s getting over that fence.” Trump’s move builds on the sweeping tariffs he first imposed on March 12, when he set a 25% tax on all steel imports and a 10% levy on aluminum. At the time, Canada responded with its own duties, and American auto makers warned of higher costs. The European Union also announced countermeasures, which it later dropped. On Friday, Trump praised those original measures, claiming they saved the U.S. steel sector from collapse. He said that without the first round of tariffs, “all steel would have been foreign-made and factories would have closed.” Analysts warn that steel prices may increase due to the tariffs Still, analysts warn that higher levies could push up prices for steel, a critical material in construction and manufacturing, two industries Trump has said he wants to strengthen. Since March, the price of domestically produced steel has climbed, as American mills no longer face as much competition from abroad. A 2023 report by the International Trade Commission looked back to when Trump applied steel tariffs in 2018, finding that U.S. steel output did rise, but costs climbed for cars, tools, and machines. Those higher expenses cut production in affected industries by more than $3 billion in 2021, the agency said. Trump is using a law known as Section 232, which lets the president impose tariffs on imports deemed a threat to national security. Last year, the U.S. bought $31.3 billion worth of iron and steel. Canada topped the list at $7.6 billion, according to Commerce Department figures. Later in his remarks, Trump turned to another issue: the sale of U.S. Steel to Japan’s Nippon Steel. During his 2024 campaign, he had opposed the deal, and President Joe Biden had blocked it, citing security concerns. But Trump said he came to believe Nippon could save the company and keep jobs in America. “U.S. Steel was being sold into foreign hands with no protections for our great steel workers,” he said. “And I said there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen. I was watching over you.” But he added that Nippon and U.S. Steel leaders kept improving the terms. “They kept asking me and I kept rejecting them: No way, no way, no way,” he said. “Every time they came in, the deal got better and better and better for the workers.” A key change was a so-called golden share that gives the U.S. government a say in company decisions. “I’m going to be in Washington; I’m gonna be watching over it,” Trump promised.

He invited several employees onstage, and they spoke about the challenges the industry had faced. They thanked him for his actions. “This is going to be a very big day,” Trump told the workers. “This is going to be one of the biggest days in your life.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Crypto Liquidations Have Surpassed $712 Million Over The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, chaos has occurred on the derivatives market following the volatility Bitcoin and the company have gone through during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet Below is a table that shows how the liquidations have looked for the cryptocurrency sector within this window. As is visible, almost $712 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure from their platform in the past day. About $477 million of these came during the last twelve hours alone. Bitcoin and the altcoins, especially, have seen a decline in this period, so it’s not surprising to see that the liquidations have overwhelmingly affected the long investors. More specifically, the holders betting on a bullish outcome have been involved in more than 90% of the flush. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze, and given the sharp imbalance toward the bulls, this particular event would be called a long squeeze. During a squeeze, a large amount of liquidations get triggered at once and feed back into the move that caused them. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations, making such events quite volatile. As for which of the individual tokens contributed the most to the long squeeze, the heatmap below shows it. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, have also come out on top in this list, with the former observing liquidations of $221 million and the latter that of $116 million. The third-ranked coin, however, hasn’t been XRP, but rather Solana, which is a couple of spots lower in terms of market cap. SOL’s $32 million in liquidations may be down to the fact that it has seen a larger decline than XRP. While Bitcoin has seen a push down during the past day, its downfall actually started much earlier, with the high around $112,000 from May 22nd acting as the top so far. According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this peak coincided with a spike in whale activity. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which tells us about how many whale-sized transfers are occurring on the BTC network every day.

It would appear that both versions of this metric (tracking transactions valued at more than $100,000 and $1 million) surged to a high level earlier in this month, a potential sign that profit-taking from these humongous entities forced Bitcoin toward a top. Bitcoin Price BTC saw a dip under the $105,000 level earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has since observed a small rebound as it’s now back at $105,800.

Data-breach hunter Jeremiah Fowler says he found an unprotected database of exactly 184,162,718 login records across more than 47 GB of data. Fowler says that judging on the size and the scope of the database, it may be some kind of compilation, either kept by researchers investigating a data breach or other criminal activity, or possibly directly owned by data thieves themselves who acquired the credentials using malware. “Knowing the login and passwords of millions of accounts is a dream come true for cyber criminals — they probably have a long list of how exposed credentials and emails could be exploited.” Fowler says a small sample of records he analyzed contained 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. The sample also included Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, X, WordPress, Yahoo, and many other types of login info, reports Wired , adding that the trove of data in its entirety has now been taken down. With the scope of information that was exposed, Fowler says the victims are now vulnerable to several kinds of attacks, including corporate espionage, phishing and social engineering, account takeovers, and more. He also mentions that government entities appeared to be included in the hack. “I saw numerous .gov accounts from countries around the world. These could be a serious potential risk if any of those compromised accounts had security clearance to sensitive areas of the state networks or data.” The exact origins of the database are unknown, but Fowler notes that the password field was labeled as “Senha,” which is “password” in Portuguese. Fowler says he believes it’s “highly possible” that a cybercriminal is to blame, calling it the only reasonable explanation for the massive collection of login data.

Rather than opting for a 19b-4 process for traditional ETF filings, REX Shares chose the 40-Act filing under the Investment Company Act 1940. This structure circumvents the protracted job of obtaining regulatory approval from the SEC and should expedite the launch in the market. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared this news on social media and confirmed the details about REXShares’ filing. BIG NEWS: @REXShares just filed an effective prospectus for Solana and Ethereum staking ETFs to list here in the US. Don’t know launch date but could be within the next few weeks. These are 40-act funds with a unique structure and do not go through the 19b-4 process pic.twitter.com/cqUCWlFAZW — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 30, 2025 The move is a major development in the growth of cryptocurrency investment products in the United States. Rex Shares uses C-Corp and Cayman subsidiaries to speed ETH & SOL staking ETFs Each fund will utilize a C-corporation structure, a rare choice in the ETF industry, to facilitate participation in staking activities while adhering to regulatory standards. The funds will gain exposure to ETH and SOL through wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiaries that will acquire and stake the cryptocurrencies. The launch date is uncertain, but Seyffart says these ETFs could be added within the next few weeks. Today’s filing comes in the wake of the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, having recently affirmed that staking through a PoS-based network is not considered securities. Commenting further on the Rex Shares filing, James Seyffart noted that it was a smart move “As you can see in screenshot above. They will be getting their spot exposure to ETH and SOL via Cayman subsidiaries. All of this, assuming they launch in near future, is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory work-arounds to get these products to market,” he said in the X post. SEC delays on spot crypto ETFs push Rex Shares to take alternative route Rex Shares opting for this not-so-traveled path is likely an indirect result of the United States not approving any crypto spot ETFs to date. The SEC recently delayed decisions on Grayscale’s Avalanche and Cardano spot ETF applications. This halt affects Grayscale’s work to transform its Avalanche Trust into a spot ETF and a similar application for Cardano. The SEC began the 240-day statutory review period of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF proposal in February, and expectations remained high as the deadline neared. Prediction markets like Polymarket put the odds at about 71%, suggesting investors were highly optimistic. However, the anticipation would be dampened by the delay. The SEC has also reopened comments to elicit feedback from the public, therefore continuing to assess both regulatory and market impact considerations. In related news, the SEC moved WisdomTree’s XRP spot ETF proposal to the next stage in the review process. The solicitation of comments is requested through public notice regarding investor protection and potential market manipulation concerns. This proposal is made pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B), which shows that continued review is appropriate. It would be one of the first spot XRP ETFs approved in the US if passed. Nasdaq has also filed a Form 19b-4 to list and trade shares of the 21Shares Sui ETF on its exchange, representing the launch of the initial regulatory review period. This comes after 21Shares filed an earlier S-1, signaling its interest in providing institutional exposure to the SUI token. Meanwhile, SUI — the native asset of the Sui network — saw a mere 2% price bump following the filing news. But it currently trades around $3.32, a drop of roughly 6.9% in keeping with the broader market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

However, recent developments are pointing to a possible altseason, which crypto experts believe could be one of the biggest phases for alts so far. Bitcoin Correlations With Altcoins Weakens As current market trends fluctuate, key indicators are starting to point to a potential shift from a Bitcoin season to an Altcoin Season. João Wedson, an on-chain expert and founder of the analytics platform Alphractal, shed light on the likelihood of an altseason, claiming it is happening this cycle. After delving into the Altcoin Season Index vs Bitcoin, the on-chain expert noted that the cryptocurrency market may be on the cusp of a major shift. Presently, the market is about to reach a point where a large number of altcoins will no longer follow Bitcoin’s trajectory as often observed in past cycles. According to Wedson, these digital assets are now charting their own path, stating they’ve become stubborn, suggesting a unique season for alts. This increasing decoupling from Bitcoin’s price trajectory has sparked new conjecture that an altseason , which is traditionally characterized by notable gains in non-BTC assets, may be rapidly approaching. The expert stated that while BTC is at all-time highs , most altcoins have limited room to fall, with the exception of a few of the top market-cap coins. Such a development usually marks the beginning of a phase in which capital begins to flow into non-BTC assets. Considering the current trend, the expert is confident that an altseason at this point is inevitable. When the season finally occurs, it is expected to run quickly, and the rotation will continue regardless of whether BTC’s price rises or falls in the near future. In the meantime, Wedson has issued a stark warning to investors about potential volatility as they continue to hold on to Bitcoin and stablecoins in the current market state. “From a big trader or fund manager’s perspective, there’s little sense in holding BTC or stablecoins exclusively right now,” the expert stated. A Massive Altseason On The Horizon A recent analysis from crypto analyst and trader Mags reveals that the crypto market is about to enter an altcoin season in the following weeks. His bold analysis is based on past cycle trends involving an RSI (Relative Strength Index) + MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) Confluence. Following an RSI + MACD confluence in the 2021 market cycle, BTC witnessed a sharp decline in its market dominance , which paved the way for an altseason. With the setup reappearing, the analyst anticipates a similar result. However, this time, Mags claims that the development might lead to the biggest altseason of this cycle.",Altcoin reviews|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|Altcoin Season Index vs Bitcoin|altcoins|Altcoins news|altseason|bitcoin|Bitcoin dominance|btc|ETH-BTC|Joao Wedson|MACD|Mags|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|relative strength index|RSI|RSI + MACD Confluence|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-31 00:30:13

Cross River Bank reportedly holds all bank accounts associated with the payment system. The Good news for the XRP community is that Cross River Bank has been a Ripple partner since 2014, providing real-time international payments. This connection was brought to the community’s attention by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a prominent crypto proponent on X, who highlighted the bank’s role in the development of X-Money. JUST IN: ELON MUSK TO LAUNCH 𝕏-MONEY WITH ALL BANK ACCOUNTS HELD BY CROSS RIVER BANK! CROSS RIVER BANK ALREADY INTEGRATED RIPPLE FOR REAL-TIME INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS! #XRP X MONEY https://t.co/6NaoNRfdSU pic.twitter.com/IMz61LvRYT — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 30, 2025 Musk has recently confirmed that a limited-access beta version of the payment system will launch soon. For many in the XRP community, this is a significant moment, as they have long advocated for XRP to be used in Musk’s financial platforms. The presence of Ripple-enabled banking infrastructure at the core of X-Money’s backend raises new questions about the possibility of XRP becoming a part of the global payments functionality Musk is building. Ripple’s Relationship With Cross River Bank Ripple’s collaboration with Cross River Bank began in September 2014, when the bank announced its adoption of the Ripple protocol to offer real-time international payments. According to a blog post published by Ripple, Cross River Bank became one of the first U.S. banks to integrate the Ripple network. The goal was to provide instant, secure, and compliant cross-border transactions, particularly between the United States and Western Europe. Many experts believe XRP can lead an instant payment revolution , and this partnership shows the asset’s potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Will Musk Integrate XRP? Ripple technology enables financial institutions to send funds in any currency in real time, without the need for reserve funding. It is built to provide a fast, low-cost, and secure settlement layer that complies with regulatory standards. Suppose Cross River Bank is serving as the foundational banking partner for X-Money. In that case, this creates a clear pathway for Ripple technology, particularly XRP, to become part of the broader payment architecture on X. Recent rumors suggest that Musk will integrate XRP into the new payment system. Although the billionaire has not confirmed these rumors, the infrastructure is likely in place to make it happen without requiring major changes. Grok, Musk’s AI-powered chatbot, has named XRP as the best asset for cross-border payments . Meanwhile, Ripple’s enterprise-grade systems have already proven with Cross River Bank. The conditions for potential XRP use in X-Money are aligned, and if Musk approves this integration, it could change the digital asset landscape.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander has rejected Mayor Eric Adams’s proposal to issue municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin, calling the idea both “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” Lander, who shares responsibility for the city’s debt issuance alongside the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, made clear that the city will not pursue any crypto-backed borrowing while he remains in office. Bitbond Battle Brews in NYC as Election Rivals Clash Over Crypto Policy Lander said in a statement on Thursday that “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” according to a report by Bloomberg. He added, “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander opposed Mayor Eric Adams’s proposed Bitcoin-backed municipal bond (Bitbond) plan, calling the idea “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” He noted that under U.S. tax law, municipal bonds cannot be used to purchase cryptocurrencies or… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 The response follows remarks made by Mayor Adams on Wednesday during his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . Addressing a crowd of crypto enthusiasts, Adams called for the creation of a “Bitbond,” expressing his intention to make New York a national leader in crypto innovation. “We need to have a Bitbond, and I’m going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York,” Adams said. “If it grows in New York, it will cascade through the entire country.” The mayor’s comments come just a week after he hosted the city’s first crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion . There, he unveiled a digital assets advisory council designed to boost fintech investment and job creation in the city. But Lander pushed back hard on the idea. He pointed to legal and regulatory constraints that limit how municipal bonds can be issued and used. According to him, the city can only issue debt for specific public purposes and must do so in compliance with federal tax law. “The current federal tax law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs,” Lander said. He also emphasized that the city does not have any system in place to handle infrastructure financing in cryptocurrencies or to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars. Adams, who is seeking re-election this November as an independent, did not respond to requests for comment. Lander, a Democrat and a candidate for mayor himself, made clear that under his watch, Bitcoin-backed bonds won’t be part of the city’s fiscal strategy. With both candidates positioning themselves for November, the clash over crypto policy could become a defining issue in the race. Mayor Echoes Trump’s Crypto Playbook Amid Growing Political Embrace of Digital Assets Mayor Adams is doubling down on crypto as part of his re-election campaign, echoing Donald Trump’s strategy from last year when Trump vowed to make the U.S . the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump’s actions included issuing an executive order to create a digital asset task force and hosting the White House’s first crypto summit in March with top industry executives. Trump Hosts First White House Crypto Summit President Donald Trump hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, a landmark event bringing together top industry leaders, regulators, and government officials together. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 14, 2025 Adams, recently cleared of corruption charges by the DOJ, a move that sparked backlash and resignations, has now become a prominent face at crypto events. In Las Vegas, he spoke at the industry’s largest conference alongside figures like VP J.D. Vance and Senator Cynthia Lummis. These events, once dominated by industry leaders, now increasingly feature political figures. At a side event hosted by Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, Adams appeared again, showing a long-standing relationship dating back to his Brooklyn days. Last fall, Pierce even co-hosted a fundraiser for him in Puerto Rico. Adams has championed crypto since his 2022 mayoral campaign, famously converting his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum . Now, NYC is forming a digital asset advisory council to explore launching a “Bitbond.” A similar federal initiative, proposed by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, suggests bonds partly backed by Bitcoin for a potential strategic reserve.

Bitcoin Could Hit $200,000 This Year Speaking from the perspective of a macro quant hedge fund operator, Edwards was unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, stating, “If the data stays in the current trend we’re in, I think $150–200K is definitely possible this year.” The founder of Capriole, a fund known for pioneering on-chain valuation models like Hash Ribbons, Energy Value, and the Macro Index, grounded this forecast in a web of interlocking technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming “We’re printing new all-time highs on daily and weekly closes,” Edwards noted. “As long as we stay above $104K as long as the Macro Index trends up, and US liquidity continues to rise, this environment is very bullish.” Capriole’s proprietary Macro Index—a machine learning model aggregating over 100 inputs from Fed liquidity to bond and equity markets—has turned decisively positive. Bitcoin’s rally, Edwards emphasized, is further reinforced by metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Hodler Growth Rates, and Energy Value, all signaling room for expansion. But while Bitcoin shows strength across multiple dimensions, altcoins are telling a very different story. The Death Of The Old Altcoin Cycle Edwards refrained from naming specific altcoins but delivered a clear macro verdict: the capital flow dynamics have changed, and altcoins are no longer on an equal footing with Bitcoin. “Structurally, things are quite a bit different this cycle […] the biggest driving forces are Bitcoin ETFs and US policy. That’s creating a centralizing effect—funneling capital directly into Bitcoin,” he explained. He pointed to the historical cycles of retail-led altcoin rallies, followed by catastrophic drawdowns—often exceeding 99% losses. “Retail has just gotten destroyed,” he said bluntly. “There’s a fatigue in the altcoin space that wasn’t there four or five years ago.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock The legacy of failed ICOs, broken tokenomics, and events like the FTX collapse have left lasting scars. Meanwhile, institutions are avoiding the risks and complexity of smaller-cap digital assets, opting instead for regulated Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. “It used to be more of a level playing field. That’s no longer the case,” Edwards said. “The real money is flowing into Bitcoin—and that probably continues for a while.” When Will Altcoins Wake Up? Despite the grim tone, Edwards does not dismiss altcoins entirely. He views a strong altcoin cycle as conditional—not impossible, but dependent on clear Bitcoin dominance first. Using Capriole’s Speculation Index and Crypto Breadth models, which track the relative strength and price movement of altcoins, he made a key observation: “Right now, only 5% of altcoins are above their 200-day moving average. That’s not bullish.” He compared the current setup to late 2020, when Bitcoin surged from $10K to $60K before altcoins began outperforming. That rotation required Bitcoin to first breach previous all-time highs decisively. “You want Bitcoin to hit something like $140K while alts are still underperforming. That would be the ideal setup […] that’s when capital begins rotating downstream,” he explained. Conversely, if altcoins begin pumping prematurely, while Bitcoin remains range bound, Edwards sees that as a top signal. “That’s usually the last puff of air,” he warned. Cycles Are Changing, Risks Are Evolving Beyond price action, Edwards questioned the relevance of traditional halving cycles. He argued that the impact of miners—once the primary driver of Bitcoin supply dynamics—has diminished significantly due to ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign actors like Michael Saylor. “That four-year cycle is dead—or at least dramatically weaker. Miners are now just 2–3% of the total supply flow. The real drivers today are institutions,” he said. This evolution reduces the probability of 80% drawdowns and increases the risk of systemic leverage—particularly from publicly traded Bitcoin-heavy firms. While not an immediate concern, Edwards sees potential for long-term vulnerabilities if major players overextend. Edwards also discussed diversification within Capriole’s portfolio. While Bitcoin remains the firm’s core allocation, he revealed exposure to quantum computing equities like IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D-Wave (QBTS), and QUBT. “I think quantum is like Bitcoin in 2015. It’s early, it’s volatile, but the long-term CAGR could be even higher than Bitcoin’s.” He added that gold also plays a strategic role, not as a replacement but as a hedge. Capriole monitors the gold-to-equity ratio closely, and its breakout above the 200-day moving average is seen as a historically bullish signal—both for gold and Bitcoin. In closing, Edwards urged investors to tune out most of the financial news cycle. “Probably 99% of headlines don’t matter,” he said. Instead, focus on game-changing shifts: Fed pivots, global liquidity expansions, and true structural reconfigurations of capital flow. “We’re wired to overreact to bad news. The key is to filter it down to a few macro drivers that actually move the market—and Bitcoin right now has those working in its favor.” Until altcoins show meaningful breadth and break their long-term resistance structures, Edwards’ message is clear: Bitcoin will soar. Altcoins won’t—at least, not yet. At press time, BTC traded at $105,557.
