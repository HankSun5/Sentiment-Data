After months of anticipation and complex legal proceedings, the team overseeing the FTX bankruptcy process has officially launched the second phase of its repayment efforts. This is a pivotal moment for FTX creditors who have patiently waited to recover assets lost in the exchange’s dramatic downfall. According to reports, this phase is expected to see a substantial FTX distribution of over $5 billion. The initial disbursements are slated to begin within a short window of 1–3 business days from today, marking a tangible step towards resolution for many. What Does This FTX Repayment Phase Entail? This isn’t the first step in the recovery process, but Phase 2 represents a major wave of distributions. The bankruptcy estate, managed by administrators, has been working diligently to locate, secure, and liquidate assets belonging to the collapsed exchange and its affiliated entities, such as Alameda Research. The goal has been to maximize the value available to repay creditors whose funds were frozen or lost. The specifics of this FTX repayment phase include: Significant Capital Outflow: The commitment to distribute over $5 billion indicates the significant progress made in asset recovery and valuation. This figure represents a large portion of the total estimated value available for distribution. Targeted Audience: These funds are specifically earmarked for eligible FTX creditors who filed claims during the bankruptcy proceedings. The complex process involved verifying claims, determining their value (often based on asset prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing in November 2022), and establishing a distribution hierarchy. Initial Timeline: The 1–3 business day window for the start of distributions suggests that the administrative and technical infrastructure for payout is ready. While distributing funds to a large number of creditors is a complex task, this initial timeframe provides a clear expectation for when the process will commence. Method of Payout: Creditors are typically being repaid based on the USD value of their holdings at the time of the bankruptcy filing. While some distributions might involve in-kind crypto where feasible and approved, a significant portion is expected to be in fiat currency or stablecoins, depending on the creditor’s preference and jurisdictional requirements. This helps manage volatility during the payout period. This phase follows extensive work, including asset sales, legal battles, and negotiations to consolidate assets and create a pool of funds for distribution. It’s a testament to the efforts of the bankruptcy administrators and legal teams involved. A Ray of Hope for FTX Creditors? For the thousands of individuals and institutions who had funds locked on FTX, this announcement is more than just a financial update; it’s a moment of potential relief. The past year and a half have been filled with uncertainty, frustration, and financial strain for many. The start of this major crypto payout offers a tangible outcome after a prolonged period of waiting. While the total recovery percentage for creditors is still subject to the final outcome of the bankruptcy process and asset liquidation, the fact that such a significant amount is being distributed in this phase is generally seen as a positive sign. Early estimates and market conditions (particularly the rise in value of some crypto assets held by FTX) have sometimes suggested a potentially higher recovery rate than is typical in large-scale bankruptcies, though this is not guaranteed for all claim types. This step helps to restore some faith in the process, demonstrating that even in the aftermath of a catastrophic failure like FTX, structured legal processes can yield results for affected parties. It moves the narrative from the collapse itself to the active resolution and restitution phase. Navigating the FTX Bankruptcy Update: What Should Creditors Do? With the distribution phase beginning, it’s crucial for FTX creditors to be informed and cautious. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed via Official Channels: Rely exclusively on official communications from the FTX bankruptcy administrators (like Kroll Restructuring Administration) or the court-appointed representatives. Be wary of unofficial sources, social media rumors, or direct messages claiming to facilitate your payout. Verify Your Payout Details: Ensure the payment method and destination you provided during the claims process are correct and up-to-date. If you need to update information, do so only through the official creditor portal or designated channels. Beware of Scams: Unfortunately, major events like this attract scammers. Be extremely cautious of any unsolicited contact (emails, texts, calls) asking for personal information, wallet keys, or fees to ‘expedite’ your FTX repayment. The administrators will not ask for this information via unofficial channels. Understand Your Claim Status: If you haven’t already, log into the official creditor portal to understand the status of your claim, the approved amount, and the expected method of distribution. Consult Financial/Legal Advisors: For complex claims or significant amounts, considering consulting with a financial advisor or legal counsel who specializes in bankruptcy recovery can be beneficial. Patience remains key, as distributing funds to a large number of creditors across various jurisdictions will take time, even after the initial phase begins. The 1–3 day window is for the *start* of the process, not necessarily the completion of all payouts. The Road Ahead for FTX Distribution and Resolution While the distribution of over $5 billion is a massive step, it’s important to remember that the FTX bankruptcy process is incredibly complex. There may be further phases of distribution as more assets are recovered or legal disputes are resolved. The administrators are tasked with maximizing recovery for all creditors, which can involve liquidating a diverse range of assets, from traditional investments to venture capital stakes and remaining crypto holdings. The successful execution of this phase will build confidence in the remaining steps of the resolution. It demonstrates the operational capability of the bankruptcy estate to handle large-scale financial movements and communicate progress to affected parties. The ultimate goal is to conclude the bankruptcy proceedings and provide as much restitution as possible to those who suffered losses. This FTX bankruptcy update is a critical turning point, shifting the focus from the failure of the exchange to the active process of making amends to those affected. While challenges remain, the commencement of this significant crypto payout is a positive development that offers tangible hope to the multitude of FTX creditors around the globe.

His stance directly opposes Mayor Adams, who is famous for his love of crypto. The division on the topic could be settled when the city heads to the polls, as both men are candidates for November’s mayoral election. Mayor Adams is running as an independent, and Lander is the Democratic candidate. Caught up with @NBCNewYork this morning to call out @andrewcuomo for his absurd attempts to rewrite history on his abysmal labor record. I fought DoorDash to deliver a $21 minimum wage, while Cuomo is taking $1M bribes to do their bidding. pic.twitter.com/zrdP5d8FpY — Brad Lander (@bradlander) May 28, 2025 Mayor Adams’ crypto plans may stall if he does not return to office Mayor Adams has been campaigning to make New York City a hub for crypto in the near future and has even set up an advisory council to that end. However, if he is unable to keep his seat as mayor, and a man who believes “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” takes over, there’s no telling what will happen to the things Mayor Adams sets in motion. Lander also believes that “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” Mayor Adams talked about his Bitbond proposal on Wednesday at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, a speech that came a week after he hosted New York City’s inaugural crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion. At the event, he reiterated his pledge to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and announced the creation of a digital assets advisory council to “bring fintech jobs and investment right here to the Big Apple.” Lander called Mayor Adams’s proposal “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,” adding that “the current Federal Tax Law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs.” Lander does not buy the crypto hype While politicians like Adams, Francis Suarez, Cynthia Lummis, Andrew Yang, Tom Emmer, Pat Toomey, Ron DeSantis, and Kirsten Gillibrand have all taken a pro-crypto stance, others are either indecisive or suspicious of crypto. Aside from Lander, another famous critic of crypto is Elizabeth Warren . She is outspoken as a crypto critic and is famous for introducing the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023, which aimed to impose strict regulations on crypto transactions to curb illicit activities. She believes crypto is a “preferred tool” for terrorists, drug traffickers, and money launderers, and has made many other interesting claims. Warren’s stance on crypto is shared by Bernie Sanders and both of them have also worked together on regulations to restrict banks’ engagement with crypto, arguing it lacks “real public purpose” and primarily benefits speculators while causing financial losses for others. Sanders also supports measures to limit crypto’s environmental and economic impacts. These politicians who seem to be anti-crypto all share concerns about the industry’s volatility, potential for criminal use, environmental impact, and lack of consumer protections. Lander’s unenthusiastic response to Bitbonds reflects a cautious stance that aligns with broader Democratic skepticism about crypto’s stability and public utility. Landers and the other anti-crypto politicians have been pushing for stricter regulations in hopes that it will address perceived gaps in oversight, a concern Lander echoed in his critique of Bitbonds’ legal viability.

Recently, the TST Memecoin experienced a sharp reminder of this reality, undergoing a significant and sudden drop on major trading platforms, including Binance. This event underscores the inherent volatility and significant Cryptocurrency Risks associated with such speculative assets. What Triggered the TST Memecoin Crash? According to a report by Wu Blockchain shared on X, the Test (TST) memecoin saw a precipitous decline. Specifically, the token plummeted by a staggering 40% to a price point of $0.03456 across both the Binance spot and futures markets. This kind of rapid price movement is not uncommon in the memecoin space, but a 40% drop in a short period certainly grabs attention and causes concern among holders and traders involved in Binance Trading . While the exact catalyst for this specific drop wasn’t immediately clear from the initial report, memecoin crashes can be triggered by various factors: Whale Movements: Large holders selling off significant portions of their supply can overwhelm buy orders and drive prices down rapidly. Sentiment Shifts: Negative news, rumors, or a general shift in market sentiment away from speculative assets can lead to panic selling. Market-Wide Corrections: Sometimes, a memecoin crash is part of a broader downturn in the overall crypto market, driven by macroeconomic factors or regulatory news. Lack of Fundamentals: Memecoins often lack underlying technology or real-world use cases, making their value purely dependent on speculation and community hype. When that hype fades, the price can collapse. Understanding the Impact on Binance Trading The fact that the drop occurred on both Binance spot and futures markets is significant. The spot market reflects the immediate supply and demand for the asset, while the futures market allows traders to speculate on future price movements, often using leverage. A sharp drop like this affects traders in different ways: Spot Traders: Holders on the spot market see the value of their assets decrease directly. Futures Traders: Those with leveraged long positions (betting on the price going up) face potential liquidations, where their positions are automatically closed by the exchange because they can no longer cover potential losses. This can accelerate the price decline. Conversely, those with short positions (betting on the price going down) profit from the crash. The incident highlights the amplified risks involved in futures trading, especially with highly volatile assets like TST Memecoin . The potential for rapid and substantial losses is ever-present. Why Does Crypto Market Volatility Hit Memecoins Hardest? Crypto Market Volatility is a well-known characteristic of the entire digital asset space. However, memecoins often experience volatility to an extreme degree. Why is this the case? Unlike established cryptocurrencies with developed ecosystems or Bitcoin’s status as a digital store of value, memecoins derive their value primarily from community hype, social media trends, and speculative trading. This makes them incredibly susceptible to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. A viral tweet can send the price soaring, while a large sell-off or negative rumor can cause a rapid Memecoin Crash . Their low prices and high circulating supplies also mean that relatively small amounts of capital, compared to larger cap coins, can cause significant percentage swings in price. This low barrier to entry for price manipulation (intentional or unintentional) contributes to their extreme volatility. Navigating Cryptocurrency Risks in the Memecoin Space The TST incident serves as a stark reminder of the significant Cryptocurrency Risks present, particularly within the memecoin niche. For anyone considering or currently involved in trading these assets, understanding and mitigating these risks is paramount. Key Risks to Consider: Risk Type Description Impact on Memecoins Market Volatility Prices can change drastically and rapidly. Extreme price swings, potential for rapid crashes (like the TST Memecoin Crash ). Liquidity Risk Difficulty buying or selling large amounts without significantly affecting the price. Sudden large orders can cause disproportionate price drops or spikes. Rug Pulls/Scams Project developers abandon the project and steal funds. Complete loss of investment. High risk in unverified memecoins. Sentiment & Hype Driven Value based on social media trends and community excitement. Price is highly unstable and can collapse if hype disappears. Lack of Fundamentals No underlying technology, use case, or revenue stream. Value is purely speculative, making long-term holding risky. Actionable Insights for Traders on Binance (and Beyond) Given the inherent risks, especially with assets prone to a Memecoin Crash , what steps can traders take, particularly when engaging in Binance Trading or on other platforms? Strategies to Consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand what you are investing in, even if it’s a memecoin. Look for community strength, developer activity (though often limited), and understand the tokenomics. Risk Management is Crucial: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Memecoins are highly speculative. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically sell your position if the price drops to a certain level, limiting potential losses during a sudden crash like the one seen with TST Memecoin . Avoid Excessive Leverage: While futures trading offers the potential for high returns, leverage magnifies losses during volatile swings. Be extremely cautious with leverage, especially on memecoins. Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into one highly speculative asset. Spread your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies. Beware of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Don’t buy into a coin just because it’s pumping. You might be buying at the peak right before a crash. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources (like Wu Blockchain) and community sentiment, but verify information before acting on it. These strategies are not guarantees against losses, but they are essential tools for navigating the unpredictable landscape of Crypto Market Volatility and mitigating Cryptocurrency Risks . The Broader Picture: Crypto Market Volatility Remains While the TST specific event is noteworthy for its severity, it’s a symptom of the larger reality of the crypto market. Price swings of 10%, 20%, or even 40% in a day are not unheard of, especially further down the market cap ladder. This volatility is driven by a confluence of factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. Successful navigation of this environment requires a long-term perspective, robust risk management, and continuous learning. Summary: Lessons from the TST Memecoin Crash The recent 40% plummet of TST Memecoin on Binance serves as a potent case study in the extreme volatility and significant Cryptocurrency Risks inherent in the memecoin market. It highlights how quickly fortunes can change for those involved in Binance Trading of such assets. Understanding the factors contributing to a Memecoin Crash and implementing strict risk management strategies are vital for anyone venturing into this highly speculative corner of the crypto world. While the potential rewards can be high, the risks, as demonstrated by TST, are equally substantial.

At the same time, the Trump Coin is facing a retrace risk following its recent surge, fueled by hype.

Priced at $0.00000035 per token, investors receive 80% bonus tokens upon purchase. The Ethereum Price Sets Sights On $4,000 Amid Growing Bullish Momentum. Currently down 45.8% from its December 2024 peak of $4,000, the Ethereum price has arrived at a key resistance point. With limited historical barriers beyond this point, conditions appear favorable for the Ethereum price to move toward $4,000. A bullish continuation pattern is forming, hinting that another impulsive leg upward for the Ethereum price may be just around the corner. Crypto analyst Astronomer, in a lengthy post, emphasized the long-term inverse relationship between the Ethereum price and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). He noted that with the DXY dropping significantly, the Ethereum price is likely to range high, possibly reaching $4,000, calling the setup “flawless.” Trump Coin Faces Steep Decline As Retracement Threat Persists The Trump Coin surged in the lead-up to a fancy dinner hosted by President Donald Trump. Some investors spent nearly $150 million for access; however, prices dropped by 16% immediately after the event within hours. The Trump Coin reached a high of $16.50 before the May 23 black-tie gala but quickly fell back to $12.76 soon after. Technical charts show several large wallets sold a significant amount of the Trump coin right after the event. Crypto Analyst Kamil suggests that unless the Trump coin breaks above $15 again, a retracement risk remains high. Without a unique technology or use case, the Trump Coin value may struggle to hold its ground. As hype fades post-event, investors are moving on. Many are heading toward the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale for its long-term upside and the AI technology behind it.

This declaration isn’t just a statement; it signals a renewed focus on a contentious area of US trade policy that has significant implications beyond borders, potentially even rippling into financial markets watched closely by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Understanding the Trump Tariffs and the Trade Court Battle When we talk about Trump tariffs , we’re referring primarily to the duties imposed during his presidency under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (citing national security concerns, mainly on steel and aluminum imports) and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (in response to unfair trade practices, notably targeting China). These tariffs sparked significant opposition, leading to legal challenges in various courts, including the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The trade court battle involves complex legal arguments. Opponents argue that these tariffs were unlawfully imposed, exceeding presidential authority or violating procedural requirements. The government, under Trump, defended them as necessary measures to protect domestic industries and national security. The ongoing legal disputes center on the scope of presidential power under these trade statutes and whether the executive branch followed the correct legal procedures. Here’s a simplified look at the key legal fronts: Section 232 Cases: Challenges against tariffs on steel and aluminum, often arguing they weren’t truly based on national security or that the process was flawed. Section 301 Cases (China Tariffs): Lawsuits contending these tariffs were an unauthorized escalation of trade disputes beyond the scope of Section 301’s original intent or that the process lacked proper public notice and comment. Constitutional Challenges: Some cases touch upon the separation of powers, questioning whether Congress improperly delegated too much tariff authority to the President. Why is Winning the Court Battle So Crucial for Trump’s Political Strategy? Donald Trump’s political identity is heavily intertwined with his ‘America First’ economic agenda, where using tariffs as a tool for negotiation and protection was a centerpiece. Vowing to win the court battle isn’t just about the legal outcome; it’s a critical part of his ongoing political strategy . Securing legal victories would: Validate Past Actions: A court win would retroactively legitimize a core policy of his presidency, allowing him to claim vindication against critics who argued his tariffs were illegal or poorly implemented. Empower Future Policy: Winning sets potential precedents that could provide a stronger legal basis for implementing similar or expanded tariffs if he were to return to office. Reinforce Political Narrative: It aligns with his message of being a strong leader willing to fight for American workers and industries against foreign competition and perceived unfair practices. It’s a way to demonstrate resolve and commitment to his base. Maintain Leverage: While the specific cases might pertain to past actions, the legal principles at stake could influence the executive branch’s power regarding trade measures, impacting future negotiation leverage. This isn’t merely a legalistic stance; it’s a strategic move aimed at shaping public perception and solidifying his policy credentials ahead of potential future political endeavors. Challenges and Hurdles in the Trade Court Battle Despite Trump’s confident declaration, winning these legal challenges is far from guaranteed. The trade court battle presents significant challenges and legal hurdles: Legal Arguments Against Tariffs: The core of the opposition’s case often rests on challenging the statutory basis or the implementation process. For Section 232 tariffs, opponents question whether the national security justification was genuine or merely a pretext for economic protectionism, which is typically outside the scope of the act. For Section 301 tariffs, arguments often revolve around whether the actions taken directly addressed the ‘unfair practices’ identified and whether the process adhered to administrative law requirements, such as providing adequate opportunity for public input. Judicial Scrutiny: While courts often grant deference to the executive branch on matters of foreign policy and national security, this deference is not unlimited. Courts will examine whether the executive branch acted within the authority granted by Congress and followed the procedures mandated by law. Judges are tasked with interpreting complex trade statutes, and different panels of judges can arrive at different conclusions, leading to appeals and prolonged litigation. Precedent and Interpretation: Trade law is a specialized and often complex area. The outcome of these cases can depend heavily on how judges interpret specific phrases within decades-old statutes and how they apply existing legal precedents regarding executive power and administrative procedure. Novel arguments or interpretations could sway decisions. Winning requires successfully defending the administration’s interpretation of its authority and demonstrating that all legal procedures were correctly followed, a task made difficult by the complex and often controversial nature of the tariff decisions themselves. What is the Potential Economic Impact of the Tariff Court Outcomes? The outcome of the trade court battle carries potential implications for the economy. While specific impacts are debated among economists, here are some potential areas of influence: Certainty vs. Uncertainty: A definitive ruling, whether upholding or striking down the tariffs, could reduce uncertainty for businesses. If tariffs are upheld, companies that adjusted supply chains or absorbed costs might see the status quo confirmed. If struck down, it could lead to refunds of duties paid (potentially billions of dollars) and a reversal of trade flows, requiring new adjustments. Industry Competitiveness: Industries that benefited from tariff protection (like domestic steel and aluminum producers) could face renewed foreign competition if tariffs are removed. Industries that were harmed by retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports could see markets reopen. Consumer Costs and Inflation: Tariffs are taxes on imports, often leading to higher costs for consumers or businesses that use imported goods. Removing tariffs could potentially lower costs, while upholding them maintains this upward pressure on prices, contributing to inflationary concerns. Global Trade Relations: The legal outcome could influence the U.S.’s standing in global trade negotiations and its relationship with key trading partners. A ruling that limits presidential authority might necessitate a different approach to trade disputes in the future. For those watching the broader markets, including cryptocurrency, significant shifts in trade policy or large-scale refunds/impositions of duties could add to macroeconomic volatility, which sometimes correlates with movements in digital asset prices, although this link is indirect and complex. Exploring the Broader Implications for US Trade Policy The legal fight over Trump tariffs is more than just about past duties; it’s about the future of US trade policy . The court’s decisions will help define the boundaries of executive power in using tools like Section 232 and Section 301. Potential Outcomes and Their Effects: Tariffs Upheld: This would affirm broad presidential authority under these statutes, potentially making it easier for future administrations (including a potential second Trump term) to implement similar unilateral trade measures. Tariffs Struck Down: This would constrain presidential power, potentially forcing future administrations to rely more on congressional action or international trade bodies like the WTO (despite its current challenges) to address trade grievances. Mixed Rulings: Courts might uphold some tariffs while striking down others based on the specific legal arguments, leading to a more nuanced definition of executive trade authority. The outcome will be closely watched by trade partners, international organizations, and businesses worldwide, as it will signal how the U.S. government can and will likely use its trade levers in the years to come. This foundational aspect of economic interaction is a key factor in global stability, which in turn, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean? While this trade court battle might seem distant from the day-to-day world of cryptocurrency, understanding its potential ramifications offers valuable insights: Monitor Macro Trends: Pay attention to how major economic policy disputes like this progress. Outcomes could influence inflation, supply chain stability, and overall market sentiment – factors that can indirectly affect the crypto market. Understand Political Influence: Recognize that political strategies and legal battles over economic policy are interconnected. Trump’s vow highlights how trade remains a potent political tool, and its use can create volatility or shift economic landscapes. Diversification Awareness: The uncertainty generated by such high-stakes legal and political battles underscores the importance of understanding diverse market drivers and potentially considering diversification strategies, whether within crypto or across different asset classes (this is not financial advice, merely an observation on market dynamics). Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources covering trade law and economic policy. Understanding the potential legal precedents being set can provide context for future government actions impacting the economy. The declaration by Trump to win the court battle is a reminder that fundamental economic policies are still being shaped and challenged through legal and political means, with consequences that can extend into various facets of the financial world. Conclusion: The Stakes of the Tariff Court Battle Donald Trump’s pledge to secure victory in the ongoing legal challenges against his administration’s tariffs underscores the significant stakes involved. This isn’t just about past policies or collecting duties; it’s a pivotal trade court battle that will help define the future scope of presidential authority in setting US trade policy . The legal complexities, combined with the potential for substantial economic impact on industries, consumers, and global trade relations, make this a closely watched issue. For Trump, winning is also a crucial element of his ongoing political strategy , aiming to validate his ‘America First’ approach and position himself for future influence. While the direct link to cryptocurrency might seem tenuous, the broader implications for economic stability, market volatility, and the global political landscape are factors that informed participants in any market, including digital assets, should consider. The outcome of these legal battles will contribute to the complex web of forces shaping the economic environment for years to come.

For industry participants, the lack of a defined framework has created uncertainty and hindered innovation. However, a recent development on Capitol Hill is sparking optimism, particularly within companies navigating this complex landscape. Stuart Alderoty, Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at Ripple, has voiced strong support for a newly introduced bill, signaling a potentially pivotal moment for Crypto Clarity in the United States. Why the CLARITY Act is a Potential Game Changer for US Crypto Regulation On X (formerly Twitter), Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty lauded the introduction of the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , commonly referred to as the CLARITY Act , in the U.S. Congress. He described the bill as a significant stride towards establishing comprehensive rules for digital assets in the country. His sentiment, “Clarity shouldn’t be controversial — and this bill moves us closer to a smart, workable framework,” encapsulates the industry’s deep-seated desire for regulatory certainty. But what exactly is the CLARITY Act and why is it being hailed as such a crucial step forward? At its core, the bill aims to provide much-needed definitions and guidelines for digital assets, particularly concerning the distinction between a commodity and a security. This has been a major point of contention and the source of significant regulatory confusion, leading to enforcement actions and uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Here are some key areas the CLARITY Act seeks to address: Defining Digital Assets: Establishing clear legal definitions for different types of digital assets. Regulatory Jurisdiction: Providing clarity on which regulatory body (like the SEC or CFTC) has oversight over specific digital asset activities. Market Structure: Offering guidance on how digital asset markets should operate under U.S. law. How Does the CLARITY Act Address Industry Concerns? The existing regulatory environment in the U.S. for cryptocurrencies has often been criticized for being fragmented and relying on enforcement actions rather than clear rules. This has led to what many perceive as regulation by enforcement, making it difficult for companies to innovate and operate with confidence. For a company like Ripple , which has been embroiled in a high-profile legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of its XRP token, the call for clarity is particularly resonant. Stuart Alderoty’s comments reflect the industry’s frustration with the current state and its hope that legislative action can provide a more predictable path forward. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act aims to provide a framework that could potentially: Reduce regulatory uncertainty for businesses operating in the digital asset space. Foster innovation by providing clear rules of the road. Offer greater protection for consumers and investors by establishing clear market standards. What Are the Challenges and the Path Ahead for Crypto Clarity? While the introduction of the CLARITY Act is undoubtedly a positive development and a significant step towards comprehensive US crypto regulation , the legislative process is often lengthy and complex. The bill will need to gain traction, navigate committee reviews, and secure votes in both the House and the Senate before potentially becoming law. Furthermore, achieving true Crypto Clarity will likely require ongoing dialogue and collaboration between lawmakers, regulators, and industry participants. Different stakeholders may have varying perspectives on how digital assets should be regulated, and finding a consensus can be challenging. Stuart Alderoty’s statement highlights the importance of this legislative effort but also implicitly acknowledges that it is just one piece of the puzzle. The industry will be watching closely to see how the bill progresses and whether it can indeed deliver the smart, workable framework that is desperately needed. In conclusion, the introduction of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act , championed by figures like Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty, represents a beacon of hope for those seeking a more defined and predictable regulatory landscape in the United States. While challenges remain, the bipartisan effort signifies a growing recognition in Congress of the need for legislative action to bring much-needed Crypto Clarity to the digital asset market. It is a crucial step that could pave the way for greater innovation, investor protection, and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies under a clearer regulatory umbrella.

At its current entry price of just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI is attracting comparisons to Ripple’s early days, when low-priced tokens with practical applications had the scope to dominate the market. With analysts projecting its value could hit $1 by Q4 2025, this fledgling token is offering a potential 100x return for investors eager to get in early. But what sets Ruvi AI apart, and could this truly be the next crypto giant? What makes Ruvi AI stand out? Unlike many cryptocurrencies driven by hype, Ruvi AI is rooted in real-world utility. The token leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to solve problems across industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. While Ripple gained recognition for revolutionizing cross-border payments, Ruvi AI aims to bring similar transformation to its chosen fields. Its practical applications include: Healthcare: Automating diagnostics, enhancing operational efficiency, and reducing costs. Logistics: Optimizing supply chain networks by identifying bottlenecks and improving performance. Finance: Strengthening fraud detection and boosting transactional security through AI-driven solutions. By focusing on utility from the outset, Ruvi AI has positioned itself as much more than a speculative asset. It’s a technology platform designed to impact industries that are increasingly dependent on innovation. Breaking records with its presale Ruvi AI’s market presence has already made waves. During its record-breaking presale, the project sold over 130 million tokens and raised an impressive $1.4 million, highlighting strong investor confidence in its potential. This early success, combined with an accessible starting price of $0.015, has laid a strong foundation for further growth. Strategic partnerships strengthen Ruvi AI’s prospects Ruvi AI recently announced a collaborative partnership with Weex Exchange, a significant step in its roadmap. This partnership bolsters its visibility and enhances trading accessibility, making it easier for new and seasoned investors to trade Ruvi AI tokens. Strategic alliances like this echo Ripple’s early successes with institutional partnerships that cemented its credibility and fueled adoption. Weex Exchange’s robust trading ecosystem allows Ruvi AI to expand its market reach while offering investors a seamless trading experience. Such a partnership not only ensures liquidity and stability but also reinforces Ruvi AI’s commitment to strategic growth. Ripple vs Ruvi AI: how they compare Ripple made headlines in its early days for introducing a blockchain solution that simplified international transactions, gaining adoption across banks and financial institutions. Ruvi AI echoes this sentiment by addressing inefficiencies across crucial sectors like healthcare and logistics, where the need for intelligent automation is growing more urgent. However, while Ripple eventually faced legal and regulatory hurdles, Ruvi AI operates in a landscape shaped by lessons learned from its predecessors. Its emphasis on compliance, utility, and functionality positions it as a strong contender to avoid similar pitfalls. Boosting returns with VIP investment tiers Ruvi AI isn’t just making waves with its utility and partnerships. Its VIP investment options are attracting numerous investors eager to maximize their returns. These tiers provide lucrative bonuses designed to reward early participants. Here’s how they work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens = 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07/token = $4,900. Value at $1/token = $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens = 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07/token = $15,680. Value at $1/token = $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens = 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07/token = $89,600. Value at $1/token = $1,280,000. For investors seeking exponential returns, these options create a clear incentive to back Ruvi AI early in its lifecycle. Is Ruvi AI the next big thing? Cryptocurrencies with low entry points and tangible use cases often generate long-term success, provided they can back up their potential with real outcomes. Ruvi AI combines the accessibility of an affordable token with the strategic vision of a technology designed for impactful applications. Its collaboration with Weex Exchange, robust presale performance, and projected valuation of $1 by Q4 2025 make it one of the most talked-about tokens today. Ripple’s meteoric rise stemmed from its early focus on streamlining finance. Similarly, Ruvi AI’s focus on solving inefficiencies across multiple industries positions it for comparable, if not greater, success. Final thoughts At just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI offers an opportunity that’s hard to ignore. Drawing comparisons to Ripple’s early days is not just a testament to its potential but also its readiness to redefine how modern industries utilize AI and blockchain. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, Ruvi AI’s commitment to utility, innovation, and strategic growth makes it a compelling case for the future.

This is more than just a presale, it’s a race. Why BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Are a Game Changer BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles add a new layer of excitement to the presale experience. Instead of simply buying coins, participants are ranked daily based on how much BDAG they accumulate, with the leaderboard resetting every 24 hours, and the top buyer of the day gets any unsold amount of a 150 million BDAG daily pool.

This comes just as the analyst predicted that the altcoin could hit a $1.5 trillion market. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $22 As Bullish Candle Forms In an X post, Egrag Crypto predicted that candle 13 on the yearly chart could be the breakout candle that sends the XRP price to $13 or $22. He also raised the possibility of the altcoin surging above these price levels, with a wick extending even higher. Based on his analysis of Candle 9, the 2021 yearly candle, the analyst noted that Candle 13 points to a target of around $17. Related Reading: XRP Holds Midline Support That Has Led To Breakout In The Past, Why $2.9 Could Be Next Egrag Crypto remarked that this aligns perfectly between $13 and $22 for the XRP price. He also commented on Candle 12, noting that it was the strongest Bullish Engulfing pattern. This engulfing process started from Candle 5 and continued through Candle 11. The analyst added that the body of these candles closed above all previous candles, which is a “classic bullish sign.” It is even more bullish when it occurs on a yearly or 12-month chart, as in this case. Commenting on the current XRP price action, Egrag Crypto stated that the noise is still loud on the high timeframes. He noted that the body of Candle 13 is above $1.85, and the wick extends up to around $3.40. The analyst claimed that a close below $1.85 could mark the end of the bull run, while a close above $3.40 confirms that XRP is heading to double digits. Interestingly, the crypto analyst declared that December 31 this year will be a date to remember in XRP history. He remarked that market participants will see where the XRP price stands and what kind of candle formations are shaping up for the legendary year. XRP At A Critical Level In an X post, Crypto analyst CasiTrades noted that the XRP price has returned to the $2.25 range, which is one of the most important levels on the chart. She stated that this zone has acted as both resistance and support since the $0.50 breakout, and now a proper backtest is underway. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Could Shoot To $12 Soon The analyst revealed that the smaller timeframes show that this level could hold. However, she warned that higher-timeframe confirmation is key and that the XRP price needs daily closes above $2.25 to confirm a bullish pivot. CasiTrades added that whether or not this is the final pivot, this level remains a high-probability zone for buyers. She noted that the next major support is at $1.90 if this $2.25 support fails. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.21, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Cardano Eyes a Rally & Tron Trends Upward,https://thecoinrise.com/unstakeds-presale-hits-8-2-million-cardano-eyes-a-rally-tron-trends-upward/,"Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Unstaked each offer a different path for crypto utility, and all three are showing potential heading into 2025. TRX’s current price activity remains steady, holding above $0.20. If the resistance barriers near $0.30 and $0.45 are cleared, there’s a path toward $0.73 that analysts are beginning to take seriously. Cardano’s recent 20% push to $0.74 has brought it back into the spotlight despite recent community issues. But Unstaked , the AI-focused project priced under a cent, has already started showing real traction. Now in stage 17 of its presale, priced at $0.01043, and projecting a launch price of $0.1819, it could deliver a 2,700% return for early participants. TRON’s Stablecoin Progress Raises Eyes Toward $0.73 Goal TRON (TRX) has maintained strong momentum by staying above the $0.20 range, and some market watchers suggest that a climb toward $0.73 is possible if it can push past the hurdles at $0.30 and $0.45. TRON’s increasing use in DApps and its fast-speed infrastructure have made it attractive for those following scalable networks. Consistent growth in developer interest and active users on TRON helps strengthen this outlook. Still, success depends on TRX breaking through technical resistance. For those following projects with steady user adoption and network development, TRON remains in focus as the market moves toward 2025. ADA’s Price Targets Take Shape Despite Community Tensions ADA’s rebound to $0.74, following a notable 20% climb, has stirred fresh speculation about its ability to rise to $2.80. Experts point to $0.85 as the next key resistance, and if that’s surpassed, the possibility of further gains becomes real. Much of this optimism is based on Cardano’s consistent focus on research-backed growth and development. However, allegations linked to a $600 million ADA issue, though denied by founder Charles Hoskinson, have caused some uncertainty. Still, ADA’s stability and technical strength keep it in the conversation as a contender for higher returns. Unstaked: Growing Fast, Still Below a Cent, With AI Agents Coming After Launch Unstaked is building a platform meant to support creators and marketers in growing their reach using AI. Users will be able to design their own AI agents to manage engagement across platforms like Telegram, X, and Discord. These agents will post, respond, adapt, and improve based on data in real time. As confirmed in its whitepaper, the agents will go live after the presale ends and the platform launches. Now in stage 17, Unstaked is priced at $0.01043, with an expected listing price of $0.1819. This creates a projected return of 2,700%. With $8.2 million already raised, the platform is gaining attention rapidly. What makes Unstaked stand apart is how directly it connects its features with user benefits. Access to automation tools and platform utilities is linked to ownership, offering creators a powerful edge. As more digital brands look for faster ways to grow and stand out, Unstaked is becoming one of the most practical plays in Web3. At under a cent, this price range might not last much longer. Final Takeaway! TRON is showing strong technical structure, and Cardano continues to push upward through mixed sentiment. Both are advancing, but Unstaked brings something fresh: a product ecosystem about to go live. The crypto presale price is still just $0.01043, with a target launch price of $0.1819 and over $8.2 million already raised. With its unique AI angle and post-launch agent rollout, Unstaked is positioning itself as a serious contender for big gains in 2025. While TRX and ADA navigate the broader market, Unstaked is moving forward with clear momentum.

Recent market reports show structural optimism returning across the crypto sector, with macro players forecasting bullish patterns not just for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but for platforms with deep real-world functionality. While VeChain focuses on supply-chain impact and Hedera inches closer to becoming a top Ethereum alternative, a lesser-known name— Qubetics —has shocked the market by surpassing 514 million $TICS tokens sold and $17.5 million raised in its ongoing presale. It’s this emerging trio that many are now calling the most potential crypto lineup of the quarter. And while Hedera’s HBAR is getting serious attention thanks to unique technical upside projections, and VeChain strengthens partnerships across logistics and ESG, Qubetics introduces a modular infrastructure with an on-chain tokenization marketplace that may reshape how physical and digital assets get exchanged in Web3. Each of these projects is riding its own wave of traction—whether technical, institutional, or community-driven—offering completely different angles for what the most potential crypto could actually look like in a complex 2025 market. So what sets Qubetics apart? Why does its presale price rise by 10% every single Sunday? And how exactly are Hedera and VeChain leveraging their latest expansions? Let’s break down the details. Qubetics Builds a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace That Solves What Others Couldn’t Qubetics isn’t another generic altcoin. It’s Web3’s first fully integrated aggregator, uniting the functionality of several top blockchains into one interoperable hub. But what truly defines its application is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace—a cross-chain protocol that enables real estate, commodities, luxury goods, and even private equity shares to be securely tokenized, bought, and sold. That alone is making it stand out as a most potential crypto candidate among seasoned market watchers. Imagine a small real estate firm in Miami. With Qubetics, they can tokenize fractional ownership of properties and offer them to global participants without involving centralized intermediaries. Or consider a collectibles startup in Los Angeles that wants to create transparent, tamper-proof NFT records tied to physical luxury watches. Qubetics provides the infrastructure to bridge those assets with on-chain smart contracts across Solana, Polygon, and Ethereum—all within one dashboard. That’s not theoretical. That’s what the Qubetics ecosystem is built for. With tokenized assets becoming a high-demand vertical for both retail and institutional participants, Qubetics’ use case aligns perfectly with the next chapter of Web3. It takes what traditional platforms promised—but couldn’t scale—and gives it frictionless, audited functionality. That alone gives $TICS the kind of narrative momentum typically seen in projects that later end up among the most potential crypto leaders of the cycle. Qubetics Presale Stats and ROI Forecasts Signal Why It May Be the Most Potential Crypto Now Right now, the Qubetics presale is in its 36th stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.3064. Over 27,300 participants have joined the Qubetics presale, pushing the total raise past $17.5 million and confirming demand through the sale of more than 514 million tokens. What makes this even more exciting for early adopters is that every presale stage lasts just 7 days, and price jumps by 10% at midnight every Sunday, creating a clear incentive structure for early entries. And here’s where the ROI math gets compelling. If $TICS hits just $1 after the presale, that’s a 226.32% return. But analysts are looking far beyond that, projecting scenarios where Qubetics reaches $5 to $15 following its Q2 2025 mainnet launch. If $TICS reaches $5, the ROI becomes 1,531.58%. At $10, returns expand to 3,163.16%, and a $15 milestone would deliver an eye-watering 4,794.74% ROI. Consider a simple $100 buy-in right now. At a $15 post-launch price, that same $100 would turn into $4,894.74—and the momentum suggests that possibility isn’t far-fetched. It’s this kind of structured growth opportunity that has community members dubbing it the best crypto pre sale of 2025. And with 10% weekly jumps, missing a Sunday could mean missing a major discount. Hedera Forecasts a Faster 5x Growth Than Ethereum In a detailed analysis published by Brave New Coin, Hedera’s native token HBAR is forecasted to grow 5x faster than Ethereum based on its efficient consensus model, sustainability, and active enterprise-grade integrations. Unlike typical proof-of-work platforms, Hedera utilizes the hashgraph consensus mechanism, which dramatically boosts speed and scalability while keeping costs low. That alone has drawn interest from institutions tired of ETH gas fees and throughput bottlenecks. One of the key signals in the report is Hedera’s institutional alignment. It is governed by a council that includes tech giants like Google, IBM, LG, and Boeing, ensuring both trust and innovation at the enterprise level. With over 33 council members and consistent mainnet transaction growth, Hedera’s infrastructure supports high-value apps in DeFi, gaming, and carbon offset markets. From a technical standpoint, HBAR’s fundamentals and adoption metrics suggest an exponential curve, especially as the market prepares for a post-Ethereum-scaling era. These factors combine to place Hedera as not just a competitor—but potentially one of the most potential crypto projects if its growth continues at this pace. VeChain Boosts Enterprise Ecosystem With X Node Upgrade In a recent update published by Binance Square, VeChain’s foundation has activated new X Node benefits to incentivize long-term participation and expand enterprise use. This strategic change increases node rewards and unlocks new staking options, directly targeting the network’s most active backers. These upgrades come as VeChain’s roadmap aligns deeper with real-world enterprise logistics, ESG tracking, and carbon footprint transparency. What makes this interesting is the dual-token economy of VeChain—VET for value transfer and VTHO for gas—which is being optimized through ecosystem upgrades to enhance scalability and reduce congestion. Additionally, with partnerships across the automotive, food safety, and logistics industries, VeChain is being looked at by stakeholders in Europe and Asia as a compliance-ready solution for blockchain-based supply chain traceability. From a tokenomics and corporate engagement standpoint, VeChain’s current positioning is more mature than many altcoins in its tier. And with structural upgrades and governance improvements underway, VET is re-entering expert watchlists as a most potential crypto—especially among ESG-conscious communities and real-world business platforms. Why These 3 May Be the Most Potential Crypto Trio to Watch This Quarter In a market that’s regaining its footing, these three projects represent a powerful blend of innovation and execution. Qubetics is bringing real-world asset tokenization to the forefront while climbing its presale ladder with clear ROI modeling and strong momentum. Hedera, backed by elite corporate nodes, is forecasted to outpace Ethereum in speed and efficiency, which could trigger a large-scale narrative shift. VeChain, meanwhile, is tapping into the tangible enterprise world, reinforcing its supply chain relevance while rolling out strategic upgrades. Together, they’re not just riding hype—they’re anchoring real-world utility to the blockchain promise. And that’s why Qubetics, VeChain, and Hedera are currently regarded among the most potential crypto opportunities on the table. Whether you’re searching for the top crypto presale , an enterprise-driven protocol, or a green, scalable layer-1, this lineup covers all bases. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the most potential crypto in 2025? Qubetics, Hedera, and VeChain are considered the most potential crypto projects due to their real-world applications, presale growth, and enterprise-grade infrastructure. How much can $100 grow in Qubetics presale? At a $15 post-launch price, a $100 investment in Qubetics presale could grow to $4,894.74 based on current ROI projections. Why is Qubetics called the best crypto pre sale? Due to weekly 10% price hikes, strong real-world applications, and over $17.5M raised, many participants call Qubetics the best crypto pre sale opportunity of the year.

Yet as the court weighs its options, new artificial intelligence rivals may already be chipping away at Google’s dominance faster than any judge’s ruling could take effect. A key issue at trial has been the rise of AI tools that appear to be eroding Google’s lead in the search engine game. Mehta is set to hear final arguments this Friday from the Justice Department and Google on remedies meant to boost competition in search. His ultimate decision could also shape how AI services gain ground in the search market. The Justice Department, which sued Google in 2020, wants sweeping changes. It has urged the court to force the company to sell its Chrome browser, restrict it from paying Apple to remain the default search engine, and require it to share its search data with competitors. Regulators say these strong steps are justified by a legal benchmark set more than 20 years ago, when the government attempted to break up Microsoft. “All three of the DOJ’s major remedies are aimed at helping generative AI providers take share from Google,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at TD Cowen. Mehta has indicated he plans to issue his ruling in August The search engine giant counters that the government’s proposed fixes go too far and would cause irreparable damage to its business. Holding about 90% market share of online search queries in the U.S., the company has suggested a narrower approach: tweak its agreements with Apple, Mozilla, and Android to carve out space for rivals. The tech firm says it will appeal the judge’s ruling. Each year, the company pays roughly $20 billion to Apple for default placement in Apple’s Safari browser. Any change to that arrangement could erase billions from Apple’s profits. Mehta is weighing whether to stop Google from sharing revenue with Apple under the current deal, which could change how Google is embedded in the Safari browser. Lawyers and experts warn that his decision may also influence future contracts among tech giants over how AI features are featured on their platforms. The Justice Department is against Google paying Samsung and Motorola to pre-install Gemini In court, the Justice Department pointed to Google’s more recent efforts to dominate AI-driven search. According to testimony, Google has begun paying Samsung and Motorola to pre-install its new AI system, Gemini, on their devices. The department argues that this practice aims to capture the next wave of internet search and should be banned. Shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, fell sharply this month after an Apple executive testified that Google searches in Safari had declined for the first time in nearly twenty years. The same executive said Apple plans to offer AI options such as ChatGPT or Perplexity in Safari within the following year. Google responded in a blog post, saying that overall searches for Apple devices and services have actually risen. “A formidable question that hovers over the entire proceeding is how should the judge take account of emerging developments and the technology that affect the fortunes of all of these companies,” said William Kovacic, a professor of antitrust law at George Washington University and former FTC chairman. During the trial, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, testified that Google aims to finalize a distribution agreement with Apple by midyear. Under that deal, Apple would tap Google’s own AI model and chatbot, Gemini, to answer user queries—an option Apple already offers using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Last week, Google announced the U.S. launch of “AI Mode,” a new way to respond to searches with conversational answers rather than the familiar list of blue links. It represents the biggest overhaul of its search engine in years and is powered by Gemini. Google has been steadily improving Gemini , which supports AI Mode and other features across its products. Although Gemini’s user base has grown in recent months, it still trails ChatGPT in popularity.

Speaking at a U.S. Steel facility in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, Trump told an applauding crowd of employees that he had a “major announcement.” He said the higher tariff would “secure the steel industry in the United States” and warned that no one would be able to “get around that” new tariff rate. “We are going to be imposing a 25% increase,” Trump explained. “We’re going to bring it from 25% to 50%, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States. Nobody’s going to get around that.” He added that he had considered setting the rate at 40%, but industry leaders persuaded him to go further. “At 25% they can sorta get over that fence,” Trump said. “At 50% nobody’s getting over that fence.” Trump’s move builds on the sweeping tariffs he first imposed on March 12, when he set a 25% tax on all steel imports and a 10% levy on aluminum. At the time, Canada responded with its own duties, and American auto makers warned of higher costs. The European Union also announced countermeasures, which it later dropped. On Friday, Trump praised those original measures, claiming they saved the U.S. steel sector from collapse. He said that without the first round of tariffs, “all steel would have been foreign-made and factories would have closed.” Analysts warn that steel prices may increase due to the tariffs Still, analysts warn that higher levies could push up prices for steel, a critical material in construction and manufacturing, two industries Trump has said he wants to strengthen. Since March, the price of domestically produced steel has climbed, as American mills no longer face as much competition from abroad. A 2023 report by the International Trade Commission looked back to when Trump applied steel tariffs in 2018, finding that U.S. steel output did rise, but costs climbed for cars, tools, and machines. Those higher expenses cut production in affected industries by more than $3 billion in 2021, the agency said. Trump is using a law known as Section 232, which lets the president impose tariffs on imports deemed a threat to national security. Last year, the U.S. bought $31.3 billion worth of iron and steel. Canada topped the list at $7.6 billion, according to Commerce Department figures. Later in his remarks, Trump turned to another issue: the sale of U.S. Steel to Japan’s Nippon Steel. During his 2024 campaign, he had opposed the deal, and President Joe Biden had blocked it, citing security concerns. But Trump said he came to believe Nippon could save the company and keep jobs in America. “U.S. Steel was being sold into foreign hands with no protections for our great steel workers,” he said. “And I said there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen. I was watching over you.” But he added that Nippon and U.S. Steel leaders kept improving the terms. “They kept asking me and I kept rejecting them: No way, no way, no way,” he said. “Every time they came in, the deal got better and better and better for the workers.” A key change was a so-called golden share that gives the U.S. government a say in company decisions. “I’m going to be in Washington; I’m gonna be watching over it,” Trump promised.

He invited several employees onstage, and they spoke about the challenges the industry had faced. They thanked him for his actions. “This is going to be a very big day,” Trump told the workers. “This is going to be one of the biggest days in your life.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-30 23:59:56

Crypto Liquidations Have Surpassed $712 Million Over The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, chaos has occurred on the derivatives market following the volatility Bitcoin and the company have gone through during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Signals Price Hot, But Not In Danger Zone Yet Below is a table that shows how the liquidations have looked for the cryptocurrency sector within this window. As is visible, almost $712 million in cryptocurrency contracts have seen forceful closure from their platform in the past day. About $477 million of these came during the last twelve hours alone. Bitcoin and the altcoins, especially, have seen a decline in this period, so it’s not surprising to see that the liquidations have overwhelmingly affected the long investors. More specifically, the holders betting on a bullish outcome have been involved in more than 90% of the flush. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze, and given the sharp imbalance toward the bulls, this particular event would be called a long squeeze. During a squeeze, a large amount of liquidations get triggered at once and feed back into the move that caused them. This unleashes a cascade of further liquidations, making such events quite volatile. As for which of the individual tokens contributed the most to the long squeeze, the heatmap below shows it. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, have also come out on top in this list, with the former observing liquidations of $221 million and the latter that of $116 million. The third-ranked coin, however, hasn’t been XRP, but rather Solana, which is a couple of spots lower in terms of market cap. SOL’s $32 million in liquidations may be down to the fact that it has seen a larger decline than XRP. While Bitcoin has seen a push down during the past day, its downfall actually started much earlier, with the high around $112,000 from May 22nd acting as the top so far. According to a report from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this peak coincided with a spike in whale activity. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which tells us about how many whale-sized transfers are occurring on the BTC network every day.

It would appear that both versions of this metric (tracking transactions valued at more than $100,000 and $1 million) surged to a high level earlier in this month, a potential sign that profit-taking from these humongous entities forced Bitcoin toward a top. Bitcoin Price BTC saw a dip under the $105,000 level earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has since observed a small rebound as it’s now back at $105,800.

Data-breach hunter Jeremiah Fowler says he found an unprotected database of exactly 184,162,718 login records across more than 47 gigabytes of data. Fowler says a small sample of records he analyzed contained 479 Facebook accounts, 475 Google accounts, 240 Instagram accounts, 227 Roblox accounts, 209 Discord accounts, and more than 100 each of Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal accounts. The trove of data also includes Amazon, Apple, Nintendo, Snapchat, Spotify, X, WordPress, Yahoo, and many other types of login info, reports Wired , adding that all of the data in its entirety has now been taken down. With the scope of information that was exposed, Fowler says the victims are now vulnerable to several kinds of attacks, including corporate espionage, phishing and social engineering, account takeovers, and more. He also mentions that government entities appeared to be included in the hack. “I saw numerous .gov accounts from countries around the world. These could be a serious potential risk if any of those compromised accounts had security clearance to sensitive areas of the state networks or data.” The exact origins of the database are unknown, but Fowler notes that the password field was labeled as “Senha,” which is “password” in Portuguese. Fowler says he believes it’s “highly possible” that a cybercriminal is to blame, calling it by far the most reasonable explanation for the massive collection of login data. According to Fowler, the length of time that the data was exposed and whether anyone else accessed the files remains unknown.

Rather than opting for a 19b-4 process for traditional ETF filings, REX Shares chose the 40-Act filing under the Investment Company Act 1940. This structure circumvents the protracted job of obtaining regulatory approval from the SEC and should expedite the launch in the market. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared this news on social media and confirmed the details about REXShares’ filing. BIG NEWS: @REXShares just filed an effective prospectus for Solana and Ethereum staking ETFs to list here in the US. Don’t know launch date but could be within the next few weeks. These are 40-act funds with a unique structure and do not go through the 19b-4 process pic.twitter.com/cqUCWlFAZW — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 30, 2025 The move is a major development in the growth of cryptocurrency investment products in the United States. Rex Shares uses C-Corp and Cayman subsidiaries to speed ETH & SOL staking ETFs Each fund will utilize a C-corporation structure, a rare choice in the ETF industry, to facilitate participation in staking activities while adhering to regulatory standards. The funds will gain exposure to ETH and SOL through wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiaries that will acquire and stake the cryptocurrencies. The launch date is uncertain, but Seyffart says these ETFs could be added within the next few weeks. Today’s filing comes in the wake of the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, having recently affirmed that staking through a PoS-based network is not considered securities. Commenting further on the Rex Shares filing, James Seyffart noted that it was a smart move “As you can see in screenshot above. They will be getting their spot exposure to ETH and SOL via Cayman subsidiaries. All of this, assuming they launch in near future, is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory work-arounds to get these products to market,” he said in the X post. SEC delays on spot crypto ETFs push Rex Shares to take alternative route Rex Shares opting for this not-so-traveled path is likely an indirect result of the United States not approving any crypto spot ETFs to date. The SEC recently delayed decisions on Grayscale’s Avalanche and Cardano spot ETF applications. This halt affects Grayscale’s work to transform its Avalanche Trust into a spot ETF and a similar application for Cardano. The SEC began the 240-day statutory review period of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF proposal in February, and expectations remained high as the deadline neared. Prediction markets like Polymarket put the odds at about 71%, suggesting investors were highly optimistic. However, the anticipation would be dampened by the delay. The SEC has also reopened comments to elicit feedback from the public, therefore continuing to assess both regulatory and market impact considerations. In related news, the SEC moved WisdomTree’s XRP spot ETF proposal to the next stage in the review process. The solicitation of comments is requested through public notice regarding investor protection and potential market manipulation concerns. This proposal is made pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B), which shows that continued review is appropriate. It would be one of the first spot XRP ETFs approved in the US if passed. Nasdaq has also filed a Form 19b-4 to list and trade shares of the 21Shares Sui ETF on its exchange, representing the launch of the initial regulatory review period. This comes after 21Shares filed an earlier S-1, signaling its interest in providing institutional exposure to the SUI token. Meanwhile, SUI — the native asset of the Sui network — saw a mere 2% price bump following the filing news. But it currently trades around $3.32, a drop of roughly 6.9% in keeping with the broader market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Cross River Bank reportedly holds all bank accounts associated with the payment system. The Good news for the XRP community is that Cross River Bank has been a Ripple partner since 2014, providing real-time international payments. This connection was brought to the community’s attention by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a prominent crypto proponent on X, who highlighted the bank’s role in the development of X-Money. JUST IN: ELON MUSK TO LAUNCH 𝕏-MONEY WITH ALL BANK ACCOUNTS HELD BY CROSS RIVER BANK! CROSS RIVER BANK ALREADY INTEGRATED RIPPLE FOR REAL-TIME INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS! #XRP X MONEY https://t.co/6NaoNRfdSU pic.twitter.com/IMz61LvRYT — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 30, 2025 Musk has recently confirmed that a limited-access beta version of the payment system will launch soon. For many in the XRP community, this is a significant moment, as they have long advocated for XRP to be used in Musk’s financial platforms. The presence of Ripple-enabled banking infrastructure at the core of X-Money’s backend raises new questions about the possibility of XRP becoming a part of the global payments functionality Musk is building. Ripple’s Relationship With Cross River Bank Ripple’s collaboration with Cross River Bank began in September 2014, when the bank announced its adoption of the Ripple protocol to offer real-time international payments. According to a blog post published by Ripple, Cross River Bank became one of the first U.S. banks to integrate the Ripple network. The goal was to provide instant, secure, and compliant cross-border transactions, particularly between the United States and Western Europe. Many experts believe XRP can lead an instant payment revolution , and this partnership shows the asset’s potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Will Musk Integrate XRP? Ripple technology enables financial institutions to send funds in any currency in real time, without the need for reserve funding. It is built to provide a fast, low-cost, and secure settlement layer that complies with regulatory standards. Suppose Cross River Bank is serving as the foundational banking partner for X-Money. In that case, this creates a clear pathway for Ripple technology, particularly XRP, to become part of the broader payment architecture on X. Recent rumors suggest that Musk will integrate XRP into the new payment system. Although the billionaire has not confirmed these rumors, the infrastructure is likely in place to make it happen without requiring major changes. Grok, Musk’s AI-powered chatbot, has named XRP as the best asset for cross-border payments . Meanwhile, Ripple’s enterprise-grade systems have already proven with Cross River Bank. The conditions for potential XRP use in X-Money are aligned, and if Musk approves this integration, it could change the digital asset landscape.

Lander warned that using volatile crypto assets to fund infrastructure and housing projects could undermine investor confidence in the city’s debt. Political tensions escalate as Lander (a mayoral candidate) positions himself as a fiscal pragmatist against Adams’s crypto-friendly agenda. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander has rejected Mayor Eric Adams’s proposal to issue municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin, calling the idea both “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” Lander, who shares responsibility for the city’s debt issuance alongside the Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, made clear that the city will not pursue any crypto-backed borrowing while he remains in office. Bitbond Battle Brews in NYC as Election Rivals Clash Over Crypto Policy Lander said in a statement on Thursday that “Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our city’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” according to a report by Bloomberg. He added, “Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our city to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our city.” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander opposed Mayor Eric Adams’s proposed Bitcoin-backed municipal bond (Bitbond) plan, calling the idea “legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible.” He noted that under U.S. tax law, municipal bonds cannot be used to purchase cryptocurrencies or… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 The response follows remarks made by Mayor Adams on Wednesday during his speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . Addressing a crowd of crypto enthusiasts, Adams called for the creation of a “Bitbond,” expressing his intention to make New York a national leader in crypto innovation. “We need to have a Bitbond, and I’m going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York,” Adams said. “If it grows in New York, it will cascade through the entire country.” The mayor’s comments come just a week after he hosted the city’s first crypto and digital assets summit at Gracie Mansion . There, he unveiled a digital assets advisory council designed to boost fintech investment and job creation in the city. But Lander pushed back hard on the idea. He pointed to legal and regulatory constraints that limit how municipal bonds can be issued and used. According to him, the city can only issue debt for specific public purposes and must do so in compliance with federal tax law. “The current federal tax law regime would most likely neither permit tax-exempt financing for acquiring cryptocurrency nor permit investment gains in excess of the federally subsidized financing costs,” Lander said. He also emphasized that the city does not have any system in place to handle infrastructure financing in cryptocurrencies or to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars. Adams, who is seeking re-election this November as an independent, did not respond to requests for comment. Lander, a Democrat and a candidate for mayor himself, made clear that under his watch, Bitcoin-backed bonds won’t be part of the city’s fiscal strategy. With both candidates positioning themselves for November, the clash over crypto policy could become a defining issue in the race. Mayor Echoes Trump’s Crypto Playbook Amid Growing Political Embrace of Digital Assets Mayor Adams is doubling down on crypto as part of his re-election campaign, echoing Donald Trump’s strategy from last year when Trump vowed to make the U.S . the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump’s actions included issuing an executive order to create a digital asset task force and hosting the White House’s first crypto summit in March with top industry executives. Trump Hosts First White House Crypto Summit President Donald Trump hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, a landmark event bringing together top industry leaders, regulators, and government officials together. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 14, 2025 Adams, recently cleared of corruption charges by the DOJ, a move that sparked backlash and resignations, has now become a prominent face at crypto events. In Las Vegas, he spoke at the industry’s largest conference alongside figures like VP J.D. Vance and Senator Cynthia Lummis. These events, once dominated by industry leaders, now increasingly feature political figures. At a side event hosted by Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, Adams appeared again, showing a long-standing relationship dating back to his Brooklyn days. Last fall, Pierce even co-hosted a fundraiser for him in Puerto Rico. Adams has championed crypto since his 2022 mayoral campaign, famously converting his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum . Now, NYC is forming a digital asset advisory council to explore launching a “Bitbond.” A similar federal initiative, proposed by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, suggests bonds partly backed by Bitcoin for a potential strategic reserve.

With major players like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) cooling off after strong rebounds, new altcoins with low market caps and disruptive potential are beginning to steal the spotlight. While ETH and SOL continue to dominate in terms of utility and infrastructure, they may offer more modest upside compared to fast-rising Mutuum Finance, which are drawing interest for their exponential ROI potential. Mutuum Finance presale has raised more than $9.5 million and attracted over 11,400 participants, ahead of a token price rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Those investing at this stage stand to make up to 100% in profit once the projected launch price of $0.06 is reached. In a shifting market where crypto investing is increasingly focused on value-entry points, MUTM is quickly becoming a go-to option for those looking to get in early on the next big cryptocurrency. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.5 million and accumulated 11,400 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its launch price of $0.06. Certik Audit Finalized: Mutuum Finance Strengthens Position in DeFi Lending The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while consolidating its market position. A Certik smart contract audit has now been officially completed, and the results shared across various media platforms boosting investor confidence in the project. With this milestone, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. Gamified Leaderboard Engages the Community In addition to securing community ties, Mutuum Finance has established a leaderboard feature which displays the top 50 token holders in real-time. Bonus tokens will be received by the top 50 ranks, which becomes an entertaining, game-like incentive for users to move up and hold their positions. It is a smart merge of DeFi mechanics and community involvement. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance continues to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its growing investor community. To award early investors Mutuum Finance platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. One of the revolutionary aspects of the Mutuum Finance model is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. The Buy-and-Distribute mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction as the next altcoin to watch, with over $9.5 million raised and 11,400+ investors already in. With a current presale price of $0.03 and a launch price of $0.06, early buyers could see 100% gains, plus more if post-launch momentum continues.

With institutional money flowing back into digital assets and key tokens making sharp upward moves, the hunt for the best performing crypto today is heating up. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, some of the strongest action is happening just outside the top spot. From altcoins with real-world use cases to presale tokens with aggressive entry points, momentum is building fast. This list covers four names pulling serious attention right now, Web3 ai , TRON, Binance Coin (BNB), and XRP, each offering different entry angles for traders and investors looking for real upside. Whether it’s AI-powered innovation, high-speed chains, DeFi backbone tokens, or utility coins ready for an ETF breakout, these tokens are showing why they’re being tagged as the best performing crypto today. Let’s break it down starting with the project making early buyers rethink their entry levels, Web3 ai . 1. Web3 ai: Whales Are Buying at $0.000402 Web3 ai has already crossed $5.8 million in its presale and is currently priced at just $0.000402 per token in Stage 7. That alone is pulling in traders. But what really sets it apart is what comes next, $WAI unlocks a full suite of AI crypto tools on launch. These tools include trading bots, portfolio optimizers, and fraud detection modules that plug directly into real trader workflows. With a listing price locked at $0.005242, just entering the presale gives early buyers over 1,747% ROI baked in. It’s no surprise whales are front-running the crowd on this one. While the $777K giveaway might get retail attention, high-volume wallets are clearly stacking $WAI for its long-term potential. Web3 ai is gaining traction fast as the best performing crypto today, not just for the price action, but for what it offers post-launch. With AI dominating headlines across industries, this is one of the few tokens offering usable AI crypto products. If $WAI hits its projected $4 price in the coming years, missing the $0.000402 entry will feel like watching history from the sidelines. No fluff, just clear tokenomics, roadmap execution, and use-case-driven hype making Web3 ai the best performing crypto today right now. 2. TRON: Volume Surge and Expanding Use Case TRON (TRX) is currently trading at $0.2779, backed by a 24-hour trading volume of $590 million and a market cap of over $26 billion. That’s a strong signal of renewed interest, especially considering how consistently TRON’s ecosystem has expanded in 2024 and into 2025. The network continues to show reliability for hosting decentralized applications and stablecoins, with growing integration in digital identity platforms and data storage layers. TRON’s high-speed throughput and low fees keep attracting developers, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. With new partnerships forming around enterprise-level integrations, TRX isn’t just another old name hanging around, it’s being used. It’s already outperforming many tokens that were quiet just a few months back, putting it squarely on the radar as one of the best performing crypto today . The technical structure also supports short-term upside, with analysts noting buy-side strength around the $0.27–$0.30 range. It may not carry meme coin excitement, but in terms of steady market traction, TRON is making a very real case. 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Strong Utility, Stronger Price Action BNB is back in the spotlight with a current price around $684.75 and a market cap near $96.5 billion. While that size may make it seem less explosive compared to smaller cap coins, its recent performance tells another story. With daily trading volumes at $1.8 billion and consistent exchange-driven burn mechanisms tightening supply, BNB has been pushing up charts steadily. What makes it one of the best performing crypto today is that its demand is real. Traders need BNB for fee reductions, launchpad access, and liquidity provisioning across the Binance ecosystem. As Binance continues to expand its footprint into new regions and launch new financial tools, BNB scales right alongside. Analysts are pointing to $750 as the next resistance zone, and strong exchange inflows suggest BNB might be on that path faster than expected. The asset’s blend of utility, low volatility compared to peers, and firm institutional trust makes it more than just a coin, it’s a core trading asset in 2025. 4. XRP: ETF Buzz and Institutional Backing Fuel Momentum XRP is trading around $2.30 with volume surging past $2.6 billion in 24 hours. That’s big on its own, but with the launch of CME XRP futures and ETF speculation on the table, the entire XRP price structure is being reevaluated. Analysts are tracking short-term targets near $5, with longer-term expectations floating as high as $27 depending on how the institutional setup unfolds. With that kind of upside potential in play, it’s no stretch to call XRP one of the best performing crypto today. What makes XRP especially compelling right now is the alignment between retail buzz and institutional tools. With the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve considering XRP, and regulatory paths clearing up post-lawsuit, traders are starting to re-enter positions they exited long ago. The support range near $2.25 is holding firm, while futures open interest builds. Whether you’re day-trading patterns or watching ETF headlines, XRP is flashing signals that can’t be ignored. Summing Up In a market full of noise, some names are showing real substance, and those are the tokens making moves. Web3 ai is leading the pack with its aggressive crypto presale pricing and AI-powered utility suite, positioning itself as the best performing crypto today from both a retail and whale perspective. Meanwhile, TRON is gaining renewed momentum with increased use case adoption and transaction volume. Binance Coin (BNB) continues to prove why real-world utility and platform dominance matter in market cycles. And XRP is recharging its narrative with fresh institutional interest and bullish technical signals. Whether you’re looking for an early-stage gem or a large-cap with stable momentum, each of these projects is showing why they belong on your radar as the best performing crypto today. The market is moving, fast. And sitting on the sidelines means missing out. Entry windows don’t stay open forever. Choose wisely, and time it right.

Bitcoin Could Hit $200,000 This Year Speaking from the perspective of a macro quant hedge fund operator, Edwards was unequivocally bullish on Bitcoin, stating, “If the data stays in the current trend we’re in, I think $150–200K is definitely possible this year.” The founder of Capriole, a fund known for pioneering on-chain valuation models like Hash Ribbons, Energy Value, and the Macro Index, grounded this forecast in a web of interlocking technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming “We’re printing new all-time highs on daily and weekly closes,” Edwards noted. “As long as we stay above $104K as long as the Macro Index trends up, and US liquidity continues to rise, this environment is very bullish.” Capriole’s proprietary Macro Index—a machine learning model aggregating over 100 inputs from Fed liquidity to bond and equity markets—has turned decisively positive. Bitcoin’s rally, Edwards emphasized, is further reinforced by metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Hodler Growth Rates, and Energy Value, all signaling room for expansion. But while Bitcoin shows strength across multiple dimensions, altcoins are telling a very different story. The Death Of The Old Altcoin Cycle Edwards refrained from naming specific altcoins but delivered a clear macro verdict: the capital flow dynamics have changed, and altcoins are no longer on an equal footing with Bitcoin. “Structurally, things are quite a bit different this cycle […] the biggest driving forces are Bitcoin ETFs and US policy. That’s creating a centralizing effect—funneling capital directly into Bitcoin,” he explained. He pointed to the historical cycles of retail-led altcoin rallies, followed by catastrophic drawdowns—often exceeding 99% losses. “Retail has just gotten destroyed,” he said bluntly. “There’s a fatigue in the altcoin space that wasn’t there four or five years ago.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock The legacy of failed ICOs, broken tokenomics, and events like the FTX collapse have left lasting scars. Meanwhile, institutions are avoiding the risks and complexity of smaller-cap digital assets, opting instead for regulated Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. “It used to be more of a level playing field. That’s no longer the case,” Edwards said. “The real money is flowing into Bitcoin—and that probably continues for a while.” When Will Altcoins Wake Up? Despite the grim tone, Edwards does not dismiss altcoins entirely. He views a strong altcoin cycle as conditional—not impossible, but dependent on clear Bitcoin dominance first. Using Capriole’s Speculation Index and Crypto Breadth models, which track the relative strength and price movement of altcoins, he made a key observation: “Right now, only 5% of altcoins are above their 200-day moving average. That’s not bullish.” He compared the current setup to late 2020, when Bitcoin surged from $10K to $60K before altcoins began outperforming. That rotation required Bitcoin to first breach previous all-time highs decisively. “You want Bitcoin to hit something like $140K while alts are still underperforming. That would be the ideal setup […] that’s when capital begins rotating downstream,” he explained. Conversely, if altcoins begin pumping prematurely, while Bitcoin remains range bound, Edwards sees that as a top signal. “That’s usually the last puff of air,” he warned. Cycles Are Changing, Risks Are Evolving Beyond price action, Edwards questioned the relevance of traditional halving cycles. He argued that the impact of miners—once the primary driver of Bitcoin supply dynamics—has diminished significantly due to ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign actors like Michael Saylor. “That four-year cycle is dead—or at least dramatically weaker. Miners are now just 2–3% of the total supply flow. The real drivers today are institutions,” he said. This evolution reduces the probability of 80% drawdowns and increases the risk of systemic leverage—particularly from publicly traded Bitcoin-heavy firms. While not an immediate concern, Edwards sees potential for long-term vulnerabilities if major players overextend. Edwards also discussed diversification within Capriole’s portfolio. While Bitcoin remains the firm’s core allocation, he revealed exposure to quantum computing equities like IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D-Wave (QBTS), and QUBT. “I think quantum is like Bitcoin in 2015. It’s early, it’s volatile, but the long-term CAGR could be even higher than Bitcoin’s.” He added that gold also plays a strategic role, not as a replacement but as a hedge. Capriole monitors the gold-to-equity ratio closely, and its breakout above the 200-day moving average is seen as a historically bullish signal—both for gold and Bitcoin. In closing, Edwards urged investors to tune out most of the financial news cycle. “Probably 99% of headlines don’t matter,” he said. Instead, focus on game-changing shifts: Fed pivots, global liquidity expansions, and true structural reconfigurations of capital flow. “We’re wired to overreact to bad news. The key is to filter it down to a few macro drivers that actually move the market—and Bitcoin right now has those working in its favor.” Until altcoins show meaningful breadth and break their long-term resistance structures, Edwards’ message is clear: Bitcoin will soar. Altcoins won’t—at least, not yet. At press time, BTC traded at $105,557.

Analysts suggest the move employs strategic regulatory workarounds to bypass conventional SEC procedures. Unique Structure Behind the REX ETFs According to ETF analyst James Seyffart, the REX filings utilize an unusual structural classification. “These ETFs are structured as c-corps. Which is very rare in the ETF world,” he explained on May 30. REX confirmed that the fund would be taxed as a C-corporation, meaning both current and deferred tax expenses will be factored into the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV). This model deviates from the norm and raises questions about its implications for investors. Staking as a Missing Puzzle Piece Staking has been one of the most anticipated features for spot Ethereum ETFs since their debut in July 2024. Many industry executives believe the absence of staking has made these products incomplete. ETF Store President Nate Geraci called REX’s approach a “regulatory end-around” and expressed confidence in their imminent launch. Bypassing the SEC’s Traditional Path Seyffart noted that the REX funds are 40-act funds and thus avoid the usual 19b-4 regulatory review process. This is a critical workaround, particularly in light of the SEC’s recent delay on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its own Ether ETF. “This was one way to get some level of signoff from the SEC,” Seyffart said. Fund Mechanics and Market Entry REX’s proposed ETFs will gain spot exposure to Ether and Solana through Cayman-based subsidiaries. The structure is designed to allow staking of at least 50% of each token, marking a significant shift from earlier offerings. Seyffart added, “All of this, assuming they launch in the near future, is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory workarounds to get these products to market.” The launch, though not yet dated, appears imminent based on regulatory patterns and market positioning. BlackRock Perspective Adds Weight On March 20, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, described their own Ether ETF as a “tremendous success.” However, he admitted the lack of staking made the product “less perfect.” The addition of staking capabilities is seen by many as essential for ETFs aiming to fully capture the benefits of Ethereum and Solana’s proof-of-stake networks. The developments from REX could potentially open the floodgates for similar fund structures, signaling a new phase of innovation in crypto-linked investment vehicles.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-31 01:30:29

He calls it a significant step toward establishing a clear and consistent regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. Alderoty argued that “Clarity shouldn’t be controversial” and that the bill would allow for a practical and intelligent regulatory environment . The Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer thanked some prominent lawmakers for their role in leading the charge. This list includes Representatives French Hill, Congressman Glenn Thompson, Angie Craig, the GOP Majority Whip Dusty Johnson, Don Davis, Bryan Steil, Ritchie, and Davidson. Their work underscores the need for new regulatory guidelines that can be spun up and revised quickly as the digital assets space accelerates. Rep. Bryan Steil released the following statement regarding the CLARITY Act on X. The post mentions that the bill is designed to bring clarity to digital assets during this golden period. Supporters of the bill are united by a desire to enable the digital assets sector to expand by establishing a trustworthy and predictable set of laws. Right now, businesses and investors are often uncertain about which of their activities may delay the future of the industry. Bipartisan CLARITY Act redefines crypto oversight Introduced on May 29, 2025, by members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, the CLARITY Act seeks to clarify the regulatory roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding digital assets. The bill is looking to categorize most cryptocurrencies as virtual commodities overseen by the CFTC rather than as a security regime, as is the current practice of the SEC. With the rising use of digital assets, now is a good moment for such a move. This is because their increasing adoption and market maturity offer opportunities for broader economic integration. The rising use of these assets is also a concept shared by MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor . Alderoty noted the bill’s significance in bringing “long-overdue clarity” to the digital asset landscape. The bill, he said, takes the industry closer to a “smart, workable framework” that creates an equilibrium between innovation and consumer protection. CLARITY Act safe harbor advances as Ripple calls for clear crypto rules The CLARITY Act also introduces a four-year safe harbor provision for primary token offerings if the underlying network reaches a “mature blockchain system” status and the total raise stays below $75 million during any 12-month window. Alderoty also supported the CLARITY Act, as Ripple remains committed to advocating for regulatory clarity regarding the cryptocurrency industry. He has sent a letter to the SEC requesting the commission to clarify when a digital asset ceases to be an investment contract . Not all of them, he contended, should be subject to the same securities regulations — especially not on secondary market transactions — and he offered a safe harbor to shield compliant crypto issuers from enforcement risk. As XRP regains attention as a top crypto buy with the Ripple SEC lawsuit nearing resolution, uncertainty lingers following SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s recent “New Paradigm” speech. Ripple’s letter directly responds to the pivotal question posed in the speech: “When does a digital asset separate from an investment contract?” Ripple referenced established securities law analysis from legal experts like Lewis Cohen in its response. Cohen’s analysis contends that current US investment contract law does not consider routine transfers of most fungible crypto assets in secondary markets as securities. With the CLARITY Act, the US may finally start taking concrete steps to provide regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. While the bill gets consideration in the legislative committee, its passage would lay a benchmark for the future of how US regulators will oversee digital assets.

He spoke after Ripple handed over the “Skull of Satoshi” artwork at the 2025 Bitcoin conference. Larsen said the gift was a way to recognize progress and to build a better rapport between the two camps. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?

The plan didn’t pan out as he had hoped. Still, Larsen seemed upbeat about moving past that setback. He made clear Ripple itself didn’t put any cash into the drive. In early 2023 when I funded the “Change the Code” campaign, my goal was to see if there was a way to turn Bitcoin into an accelerator for direct air capture. The campaign didn’t work, and that’s ok!

That includes wind, hydropower and even nuclear energy. Miners have also tapped into waste gas projects, turning flared natural gas into fuel for their rigs. Five years ago, those numbers were far smaller. Today, the shift shows that Bitcoin can clean up its act without rewriting its code.

The Skull will now have a permanent home at the Bitcoin Museum in Nashville. pic.twitter.com/Eo3kNqRvGp — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 Skull Of Satoshi Donation At yesterday’s conference, Ripple formally handed the skull sculpture to the wider Bitcoin community. The gesture was more than a photo-op. It signaled that Ripple wants to ease the tension between XRP supporters and Bitcoin purists. In the past, the two groups have sparred over fees, speed and now environmental impact. By giving away an artwork meant to spark debate, Ripple is saying, “Let’s talk, not fight.” Call For A United Crypto Front Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined in the show of goodwill. He called on all crypto players to pull together. He urged regulators to carve out clearer rules, and asked industry insiders to focus on serving the unbanked. Garlinghouse stressed that XRP and Bitcoin fans have more in common than they might think. He said it’s time to unite against outside pressures, like tightening regulations and market skepticism.

These projects are gaining traction through strong fundamentals, active communities, and real-world use cases that set them apart from the noise. In a market where utility matters more than hype, these five contenders, including BlockDAG (BDAG) , are building systems people want to use. From AI agents to privacy tools to decentralised marketplaces, each project brings something distinct to the table. If you are searching for the best crypto 2025 opportunities before they hit exchanges, read on to discover the presales that are making waves for all the right reasons. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): $277M Raised as Testnet and Tools Set the Pace BlockDAG has surged past $277 million in its presale, now entering stage 28 with growing attention from developers and analysts alike. Its hybrid architecture, which blends a Directed Acyclic Graph with Proof of Work, delivers scalability and speed without compromising decentralisation. Unlike many tokens still stuck in theory, BlockDAG already has a live testnet featuring full EVM compatibility. Developers can mint NFTs, run smart contracts, and interact through MetaMask, making it immediately usable for real-world applications. The broader ecosystem includes the X1 mobile miner app, and high-powered X Series mining hardware. Each product adds a layer of function and engagement that sets BlockDAG apart from typical presale tokens. With its GO Live Reveal scheduled for June 13, and a growing number of daily participants, BlockDAG is being widely discussed as a best crypto 2025 pick. Its momentum and utility are aligning for serious long-term potential. 2. Web3Bay (3BAY): Can Retail Be Rebuilt on Blockchain? Web3Bay is on a mission to decentralise e-commerce by eliminating third-party control and enabling users to trade directly using the 3BAY token. The platform rewards activity with lower fees, staking bonuses, and exclusive discounts, all governed by blockchain records that ensure fairness and traceability. This model reimagines digital commerce as something owned, not rented. Currently priced at $0.1959 in stage 5 with $2.1 million already raised, Web3Bay is shaping up to be one of the best crypto 2025 picks in the commerce sector. As transaction volume grows, token value could climb quickly. The potential here mirrors early BNB, only this time with a retail focus that’s drawing serious attention. 3. Unstaked (UNSD): Could AI Agents Replace Entire Web3 Teams? Unstaked is introducing decentralised AI agents that operate across Web3 ecosystems. These agents handle tasks like growth, moderation, and analytics without needing centralised management or software subscriptions. Every action is validated through Proof of Intelligence, recorded on-chain, and rewarded transparently, creating a self-operating infrastructure for digital communities. Now in stage 17 at $0.01043 with $8 million raised, Unstaked is drawing attention from DAOs and crypto builders searching for scalability. As automation becomes essential, many see this as a contender for best crypto 2025 based on utility alone. Its agent economy could soon become the operational core for countless decentralised platforms. 4. Cold Wallet (CWT): Privacy Is No Longer Optional in Crypto Cold Wallet is creating a secure wallet experience that protects user privacy with zero-knowledge proofs and cold-storage grade protection, while maintaining DeFi and staking functionality. Unlike typical wallets, it allows users to engage anonymously without sacrificing access to the broader crypto ecosystem. Control and stealth come standard, not as an afterthought. At $0.00853 in stage 11, and with a future launch price of $0.3517, Cold Wallet is capturing attention for its blend of privacy and utility. Its DAO-based governance and anonymous staking options add another layer of value. In a world pushing for more transparency, Cold Wallet is emerging as one of the best crypto 2025 plays for those seeking control without compromise. 5. Web3 ai (WAI): Merging AI and On-Chain Utility Web3 ai isn’t chasing hype around artificial intelligence. It’s focused on building tools that integrate large language models, risk engines, and NLP-powered bots directly into crypto workflows. These systems will help users automate trading, sentiment analysis, and wallet actions based on real-time blockchain data. Now in stage 7 with over $6.4 million raised, Web3 ai offers entry at just $0.000402 per token. With the right traction and utility rollout, it doesn’t need to reach astronomical prices to deliver exponential returns. Its $777,000 giveaway is also increasing investor participation and creating a sense of urgency around the presale. In Summary The 2025 presale season is not about hype, it is about substance. Projects like BlockDAG, Web3Bay, Unstaked, Cold Wallet, and Web3 ai are not just promising ideas, they are building real tools with clear use cases. Each one targets a gap in the market, from privacy to AI automation to decentralised commerce. BlockDAG leads the pack with its live testnet and full smart contract functionality, making it a strong contender for best crypto 2025. As these five projects continue gaining traction, they represent some of the most credible and utility-driven presales worth watching this year.

They are experimenting with XRP staking via Flare Networks. The company shared an X post : “Welcome to smart contracts and DeFi opportunities, #XRPArmy. The company then asked its users to “Stay tuned for the beta.” Uphold intends to take root in the US in following Trump’s pro-crypto stance In the last quarter of 2023, Uphold released Vault , a self-custodianship wallet that the company says empowers user to have more ownership of their digital assets. The wallet launched initially with XRP as an option, in keeping with Uphold’s existing dedication to the token. The company has also highlighted the Flare Network (an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain emphasizing cross-chain interoperability). The recent release of USDT₀, an omnichain variant of Tether’s USDT on Flare, has massively increased the network’s TVL, indicating surging demand for cross-chain DeFi utility. Uphold is further expanding its users’ functionality with the re-launch of its crypto debit card, which is available in the UK and US. It plans to extend the offering to other countries soon. The card (available in a virtual and physical version) offers people a way to spend digital currencies directly from their wallets and thus use crypto more as everyday money. The company’s broader push into the US market reflects a wider trend among crypto firms looking to capitalize on a more favorable regulatory climate under President Donald Trump’s administration. Uphold appears keen to position itself at the forefront of this shift. In March, Uphold reinstated staking rewards for US customers on 19 digital assets such as Ethereum, Solana, and NEAR. Concerning this, Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin highlighted that staking is important in how blockchain works and the online economy. Based on his argument, users should be able to back this activity and earn rewards. He further stated that with the new focus on blockchain in the US, they are excited to provide staking services to their customers in the US once more. Building on that momentum, Uphold announced on May 30 that it will soon offer direct deposits with integrated rewards for US users. This feature includes a “Direct Salary Deposit” option, paired with the industry’s first 4% XRP-back reward. Additionally, users can earn 5% rewards on RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-backed stablecoin. Through a mix of DeFi integrations, payment tools, and rewards, Uphold is aggressively expanding its footprint in the US while bringing greater utility to XRP and other digital assets. Uphold disabled staking amid regulatory uncertainties As of 2023, Uphold did not offer staking services in the US due to regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto staking. According to an SEC complaint, many staking firms failed to provide adequate information to clients, particularly regarding how they secured staked assets. The SEC also considered whether staking services could be considered unregistered securities offerings. Accordingly, many companies were forced to cease or limit their staking activities in the United States. One prime instance of this regulatory force was the SEC’s $30 million settlement with Kraken, one of the largest crypto exchanges, for unauthorized staking services. This high-profile case was a cautionary tale to the whole industry. It might have factored in Uphold’s decision to pause their staking offerings, shedding some light on why many companies still hesitate to offer staking services. Uphold’s recent consideration to take root in the US in the staking sector marks a significant milestone in the crypto community. This is because as investors earn passive income through staking, liquidity, and stability will be achieved, thus representing a giant bet on cryptocurrencies.

Here’s Why Qubetics is the Next Big Thing—Top Cryptos to Buy This Month,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-ethereum-heres-why-qubetics-is-the-next-big-thing-top-cryptos-to-buy-this-month/,"The crypto market has been buzzing with excitement lately, especially with Bitcoin’s market dips and rising interest in decentralized finance (DeFi). Recently, global institutions have been increasingly turning their attention toward blockchain platforms that offer real-world applications, utility, and scalability. This shift has caused some tokens to surge, while others fade into the background. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, which once dominated the scene, are now being eclipsed by emerging projects that promise even greater returns. Investors who missed out on Ethereum’s early stages may now find themselves regretting the missed opportunity—just as Qubetics ($TICS) rises as the next must-have token. Qubetics ($TICS) is steadily gaining attention as it moves through its presale phases, offering a unique opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the next big thing. Unlike Ethereum, which faced scalability issues early on, Qubetics aims to solve these challenges head-on. With its focus on interoperability and cross-chain capabilities, Qubetics stands out as a revolutionary blockchain project that could transform how businesses, professionals, and everyday users interact with decentralized technology. This presents an exciting opportunity to jump in early, before it gains mainstream adoption. The Missed Opportunity: Ethereum’s Peak and What Could Have Been Ethereum’s rise to prominence was nothing short of remarkable. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum opened the floodgates for decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Its impact on the crypto ecosystem cannot be overstated, and the platform became the go-to for developers and investors looking for a reliable blockchain. But as Ethereum grew, so did its challenges. High transaction fees, scalability issues, and slower processing times became increasingly apparent. Despite efforts like Ethereum 2.0, these problems have persisted, making Ethereum less appealing for new projects and business adoption. In hindsight, Ethereum’s early adopters reaped the benefits of being part of its ICO and presale phases. For those who missed those early opportunities, Ethereum’s price movements have made it harder to jump in now. Ethereum’s all-time high price of over $4,000 in 2021 may seem like a missed opportunity, especially when considering that early investors could have bought at less than $1 during its ICO in 2014. Now, at its current price range, Ethereum seems a bit overvalued compared to the early days. While Ethereum is still a significant player in the crypto world, its capacity for exponential growth may have plateaued, making it less exciting for newcomers looking for the next big thing. And this is where Qubetics enters the picture. Qubetics: The New Rising Star—Best Cryptos to Buy This Month Qubetics ($TICS) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about tokens in the crypto world, and for good reason. As of now, Qubetics is still in its presale, and its price is incredibly affordable—offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in early. The project is currently in its 36th presale stage, and it has already sold over 514 million tokens to more than 27,300 holders, raising over $17.5 million in funds. The price per token stands at $0.3064 in Stage 36, with predictions showing that it could rise significantly once the mainnet launches. Unlike Ethereum, which struggled with scalability and high fees, Qubetics offers a seamless multi-chain experience, allowing different blockchains to communicate with each other. This solves one of the most pressing issues in the crypto space—interoperability. Qubetics’ platform offers a variety of real-life applications, making it ideal for businesses, professionals, and individuals across different sectors. Whether it’s for financial services, supply chain management, or decentralized finance, Qubetics is poised to fill gaps left by Ethereum and similar platforms. For businesses, Qubetics offers a unique proposition: the ability to develop cross-chain decentralized applications without being restricted by the limitations of a single blockchain. Professionals can utilize Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet to manage assets across multiple platforms, improving efficiency and security. For individuals, Qubetics offers the potential for exponential returns, especially as the presale price remains low and analysts predict significant price growth. Real-Life Scenarios: How Qubetics Will Impact Different Sectors Businesses: In the world of finance and banking, Qubetics’ interoperability can drastically reduce the friction involved in cross-border transactions. By using its multi-chain platform, businesses can ensure faster and more cost-effective payment solutions. For example, a global supply chain company could use Qubetics to track the movement of goods across different regions and blockchains, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud. Professionals: Qubetics offers unique solutions for professionals in the tech and finance industries. Developers can create decentralized applications with greater ease, leveraging Qubetics’ cross-chain functionality. Financial advisors could integrate Qubetics’ technology into their systems to offer more secure and efficient investment solutions for their clients. Individuals: The potential for individual users to benefit from Qubetics is huge. By participating in the ongoing presale, they can secure TICS tokens at a low price, potentially reaping substantial rewards once the mainnet launches. With analysts predicting a 226% return if the token reaches $1 and a 4794% ROI if it hits $15 after the mainnet, the opportunity to buy early is undeniable. Interoperability: Bridging the Gap in the Blockchain Ecosystem Interoperability is a critical advancement for blockchain technology, as it allows different blockchain networks to communicate and work together seamlessly. Traditionally, blockchain networks have operated in isolation, limiting the transfer of assets and data between them. This fragmentation creates inefficiencies and barriers for developers, businesses, and users. However, with Qubetics’ cross-chain interoperability, this challenge is overcome by enabling seamless communication between various blockchains, ensuring that decentralized applications (dApps) can operate smoothly across multiple networks. This integration helps streamline processes, reducing friction and improving the overall user experience. For businesses and individual users, Qubetics’ interoperability opens up new possibilities by facilitating cross-chain transactions and services. Companies can utilize this technology to create more efficient solutions, such as cross-border payments or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that draw on liquidity from multiple networks. For users, it means greater flexibility, enabling them to interact with assets and services across different blockchain ecosystems without being confined to a single platform. By bridging the gap between disparate blockchain systems, Qubetics empowers a more interconnected and dynamic blockchain ecosystem, driving widespread adoption and innovation. Qubetics Presale Details: The Countdown to the Next Big Launch The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in Stage 36, with the token priced at $0.3064.

Trump says on Truth Social that he had previously decided to make a deal with China because his tariffs were plunging the Asian giant into “grave economic danger.” But according to Trump, his efforts did not pay off, as he says China breached a deal with the United States. “I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH the US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.32% on Friday, while the S&P 500 traded closer to even, only slumping by 0.0081%. Crypto, on the other hand, fell further, with the overall digital market cap dropping by more than 4%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell by more than 1%. The Trump Administration announced multiple waves of tariffs on China in early April, which China responded to with retaliatory measures. Earlier this month, the White House announced that it had reached a deal with China to suspend and lower many of those tariffs, which kickstarted the equities market.

It joins a list of other Western technology companies pulling out of the Russian market. Geopolitical tensions are again affecting the technology industry as Microsoft is joining a list of other Western companies such as Google that are closing their Russian subsidiaries. Microsoft Corp.’s Russian subsidiary, Microsoft Rus LLC, has announced that it will declare bankruptcy. The announcement was made through a notice published on the official Russian registry Fedresurs on Friday, May 30. This decision seems like it was brought on by the ongoing pullback of Western technology companies from the Russian market, considering the escalating political tensions and economic isolation stemming from the war in Ukraine. Microsoft’s Russia unit is on the brink While Microsoft has not issued an official statement in response to inquiries, the notice signifies an end to the company’s already scaled-down presence in Russia. Over the last two years, the company has significantly reduced its presence in the country. The notice came just days after the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, publicly criticized and suggested that foreign digital service providers like Microsoft and Zoom should be “throttled” in favor of domestically developed alternatives. Microsoft was one of several Western technology giants that responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 by curtailing services and operations in the country. Initially, the company continued to provide essential services such as security updates and cloud support, but by June 2022, the company announced a substantial downsizing of its Russian operations due to the deteriorating economic environment and geopolitical instability. After the announcement, the company removed the RT (formerly Russia Today) app from the Windows App Store and banned advertisements from Russian state-affiliated media. The Fedresurs registry entry states that Microsoft Rus LLC is now proceeding with legal steps to enter bankruptcy, which would potentially dissolve its presence as a formal business entity in Russia. This is the pattern that other foreign companies exiting Russia have followed. Russia’s TASS news agency noted that Microsoft operates three other affiliated entities in the country, namely: Microsoft Development Center Rus, Microsoft Mobile Rus, and Microsoft Payments Rus. At this time, the status of these units remains unclear. Whether they will also initiate bankruptcy proceedings or attempt to continue operating under restricted conditions is yet to be seen. Other companies exiting Russia Earlier this week, President Vladimir Putin emphasized the need to wean Russia off Western digital tools, specifically naming Microsoft and Zoom. While Russia’s “technological sovereignty” policy is not new, the pressure to use regulation to suppress foreign firms to prop up Russian-developed alternatives has grown since the war in Ukraine began. In 2022, Google’s Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after authorities froze its bank accounts, making it impossible for the company to pay local employees or fulfill obligations to suppliers. Some foreign software continues to be used in Russia as of now and are often circulated through gray market channels or rebranded alternatives, but official policy increasingly favors domestic innovation, even at the cost of performance, reliability, or global integration. Microsoft’s exit might accelerate Russia’s domestic innovation ambitions as sectors that relied on the company’s productivity tools, cloud services, and cybersecurity infrastructure will now be left empty handed. Industry observers have noted that replicating the sophistication and integration of Microsoft’s ecosystem will be a significant challenge for Russian developers, at least in the short term.

Ethereum’s shift toward broader institutional use, Solana’s appearance in strategic reserves, Cardano’s fresh DeFi integrations, and BlockDAG’s surging presale have all sparked interest. Each project brings a unique angle, from scalability and smart contract utility to low-cost entry and active ecosystems, but one project is clearly drawing the most eyes. This isn’t just about who’s rising in price. When considering the top crypto to buy now, investors are evaluating technical strength, ecosystem development, and near-term momentum. Based on these factors, BlockDAG has emerged with standout traction, while ETH, SOL, and ADA continue to show solid reasons to stay on watch. Here’s a detailed look at how they compare. 1. BlockDAG: $0.0018 Pricing & Exchange Reveal Set the Stage BlockDAG is showing rapid growth as it moves toward a key milestone in its presale phase. The coin is still available at $0.0018, while total presale funding is now closing in on $277 million. What’s driving interest? On June 13, BlockDAG will reveal 20 centralized exchanges where BDAG will be listed, a turning point that could fuel its public breakout. The project’s strength goes beyond exchange plans. BlockDAG merges DAG scalability with PoW security and supports 2,000 TPS at launch, scaling to 15,000 TPS. Its mobile app, X1, already has over 1 million users, while community-focused features like Buyer Battles and a 25% referral program have increased user engagement. A refreshed Double Up Reset also gives buyers a renewed chance to increase their holdings. With low entry pricing, growing visibility, and a defined path to listings, BlockDAG is building strong fundamentals. These factors explain why many see it as the top crypto to buy now, especially for those looking at long-term upside with real near-term catalysts. 2. Solana: Testing Support With Strategic Boost From Institutional Backing Solana is trading at $163.19, down 5.5% over the past day. Despite the dip, it’s holding firm after a solid recovery from April lows around $115. The current zone between $158 and $163 is a crucial support range. If it holds, analysts say SOL could test resistance at $183, with potential upside toward $195 and $210. What’s reinforcing confidence in Solana is its inclusion in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a notable recognition of its broader utility. The platform continues to attract developers and users through its growing Web3 and DeFi ecosystem. If price stability continues, Solana remains a technically sound option. For swing traders and long-term believers, it continues to earn a place among the top crypto to buy now. 3. Ethereum: Institutional Demand & $4K Forecasts Support Strength Ethereum is currently priced at $2,620, having dipped 3.9% in the last 24 hours, with intraday movement between $2,591 and $2,732. This drop follows a strong monthly gain of nearly 45%, fueled by spot ETF inflows and renewed interest from institutions. Ethereum remains the leader in DeFi, holding more TVL than its closest competitors. The latest upgrade, Pectra, increased validator limits from 32 ETH to 2,048 and introduced faster, lower-cost network performance. While a $2.4 billion options expiry on May 30 may create short-term price swings, long-term targets remain high. Analysts at Standard Chartered see a $4,000 price point in 2025 and $7,500 by 2029. Ethereum’s continued relevance and technical strength make it a consistent pick among those scanning for the top crypto to buy now. 4. Cardano: Expanding Utility Through Bitcoin DeFi Cardano’s current price is $0.7009, showing a 6.7% decline on the day. Its trading range is sitting between $0.699 and $0.755. While price action has stayed muted, Cardano has been making quiet but meaningful moves. A major one is its integration of Bitcoin DeFi through the Lace Wallet, giving BTC users access to ADA-based financial tools. Alongside Solana, Cardano was recently added to the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a move that boosts its credibility. Analysts are projecting ambitious targets, including $2.05 by the end of 2025 and potentially $10 by 2030. These projections are tied to the blockchain’s ability to scale and integrate real-world use cases. While ADA isn’t stealing headlines right now, its developments and price range make it a relevant name in any discussion about the top crypto to buy now. Why BlockDAG Commands the Most Attention Ethereum brings institutional confidence. Solana continues to test important support levels while expanding its network. Cardano is quietly adding real-world use through Bitcoin integration. Yet BlockDAG is combining all the key elements, accessible pricing, strong technology, user incentives, and a confirmed roadmap to listings. With the presale target set at $600 million and the current price still at $0.0018, BlockDAG offers one of the most compelling setups. Its growing user base, solid architecture, and scheduled exchange reveal give it a clear advantage. For those searching for the top crypto to buy now , BlockDAG presents a rare opportunity to get in before the public launch and potential price shift begin. The days leading up to June 13 may represent the last chance to enter before a major wave of visibility and demand reshapes its market position. For buyers focused on value, growth, and timing, BlockDAG might just be the move worth making.

45313672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=762183,1748660451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45313672.jpeg,"Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‘Highly Likely’ To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-upward-momentum-highly-likely-to-continue-on-chain-data-shows/,"Although Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stalled in the mid-$100,000 range, on-chain data indicates that the top cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum is far from over. BTC recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980, prompting several crypto analysts to forecast even higher prices in the near term. Bitcoin Rally Far From Over, Data Suggests According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crypto Dan, Bitcoin is still “highly likely” to continue its upward trajectory. The analyst shared the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart to support this outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? The NRPL chart highlights the scale of realized profits and losses by market participants who are selling BTC. A relatively low NRPL during price increases typically signals that profit-taking is limited, often indicating the continuation of a bullish trend. In the chart, the current level of profit realization is highlighted in right-most red box. While the recent price surge may trigger a short-term correction, the extent of realized profits does not suggest the end of the ongoing upward cycle. As Dan noted: Compared to the NRPL spikes at past cycle peaks, this round of profit-taking is relatively limited. In particular, when compared to the movements at the highs in March and November 2024, the current level of profit realization is notably lower. Dan concluded that the current level of profit-taking does not point to a major trend reversal. Instead, Bitcoin is poised to continue climbing, potentially targeting levels beyond $120,000 in the coming weeks. Despite the optimism, some market watchers remain cautious. Noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently suggested that Bitcoin’s current price action might be a bull trap, with BTC at risk of falling below the $100,000 threshold. For the uninitiated, a bull trap refers to when the asset briefly breaks above a well-established resistance range, leading traders to believe a breakout is occurring, but then quickly reverses and falls back below the resistance level. This move often plays out to lure in long positions before liquidating them as the price drops back into the previous range. Bitcoin Selling Pressure Weak, Retail Yet To Arrive On a more positive note, multiple on-chain indicators suggest Bitcoin is not yet near its cycle top. Notably, retail investor participation in the current rally remains limited – a sign that the market may still have room for a second wave of capital inflow. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Massive 7,883 BTC Outflow From Coinbase – Are Institutions Loading Up? Likewise, Binance inflow data shows that certain investor groups are not eager to sell their BTC, possibly anticipating further gains. At press time, BTC is trading at $105,659, down 2.5% over the past 24 hours.

Musk, wearing a black outfit and sporting a noticeable black eye, stood beside the president during a joint news conference. The gathering was meant to signal that Trump continues to support the billionaire entrepreneur. During the event, the president presented Musk with a golden key and described him as someone who has endured “slings and arrows,” suggesting that public criticism of Musk has been unfair. “He had to go through the slings and the arrows, which is a shame,” Trump said. Trump bids Elon Musk farewell. Source: FOX 35 Orlando In recent months, Tesla has faced protests, acts of vandalism, and a steep decline in its stock price. Many of these challenges have followed Musk’s growing involvement with DOGE and cost-cutting efforts. By publicly endorsing Musk, Trump aimed to show that he stands firmly behind the man who played a significant role in his own political comeback. The relationship between Trump and Musk, however, was not always smooth. At one point, Musk suggested that Trump should not run for office. In response, Trump even posted on social media in 2022 that he “could have said, ‘Drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it.” Despite that rocky start, the two eventually found common ground. Elon Musk donated generously to Trump’s political campaign and offered praise on social media. In turn, President Trump allowed Musk to be involved in various federal agencies without much resistance. In February, he even took to the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference carrying a chainsaw, saying it was “easy” to “save billions of dollars sometimes in, in an hour.” That display drew attention, but in practice, Musk’s team did not come near to achieving the goal of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget. Musk admits that cutting costs was far more difficult than he had anticipated By Friday, however, Musk admitted that identifying and securing huge savings proved far more difficult than he had anticipated. Standing alongside Trump, he described the task of reviewing government spending as “extraordinarily time-consuming and difficult,” involving careful scrutiny of countless line items. “It’s mostly just a lot of hard work,” he said. Even though Musk was stepping away from his formal role in DOGE, both men insisted the effort would continue. Trump noted that Musk had “installed geniuses with an engineering mindset and unbelievably talented people in computers” to carry on the work in multiple agencies. “Elon is really not leaving,” the President said. “He’s going to be back and forth. I have a feeling it’s his baby.” Musk reiterated that the cost-cutting effort is far from over Musk promised that DOGE will achieve $1 trillion in cuts eventually, even though the DOGE website currently lists $175 billion in proposed cuts. “This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,” he said, likening the effort to a way of life, “like Buddhism.” During the news conference, a reporter asked Musk about a recent report in The New York Times suggesting he had been using drugs more heavily than was previously known. Musk did not address the report’s specifics, instead criticizing the newspaper’s credibility and saying, “Let’s move on.” Another question focused on Musk’s black eye. He explained that it was the result of roughhousing with his 5-year-old son, X. “I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face,’” Musk recalled. “And he did.” His answer drew laughter and eased the tension in the room for a moment. Toward the end of the session, Musk rejoined the discussion to criticize federal judges who have upheld limits on the administration’s power. He accused judges of “immense judicial overreach that is unconstitutional.” “It needs to stop,” he said. “It’s gone too far.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 03:30:29
45315984,https://invezz.com/?p=2743378,1748663878,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Best crypto presales to buy as Bitcoin sees renewed volatility,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/31/best-crypto-to-buy-as-bitcoin-sees-renewed-volatility/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) slipped 2.5% and 5%, respectively, on Saturday after President Donald Trump accused China of violating its trade agreement with the United States, reigniting fears of escalating trade tensions. The decline followed the release of the latest US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, which came in line with expectations and initially kept the crypto market steady. However, sentiment turned negative after Trump’s statement on Truth Social suggested that China had reneged on the terms of a previously negotiated deal. He emphasized the impact of his 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, claiming they had placed China in “grave economic danger” and triggered civil unrest, prompting him to strike a quick agreement to stabilize conditions. This development adds to the volatility traders have seen since February, when tariff threats on Canada and Mexico began surfacing. With Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing renewed volatility, retail interest is rotating toward high-risk, high-reward opportunities like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now in the final phase of its presale. As speculative capital seeks fresh momentum plays, early-stage tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe are gaining traction among traders looking to capture outsized returns. The appeal lies in the typical presale dynamic—low entry price, viral branding, and the potential for explosive upside once listings go live. BTC to slip to $100K? Bitcoin (BTC) is down 4.50% for the week to $103,332 and appears vulnerable to a short-term retest of the $100,000 mark. However, blockchain data suggests that any sustained move below that threshold may be short-lived. According to CryptoQuant, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which measures the realized gains and losses from Bitcoin transactions, shows only moderate profit-taking at current levels. This contrasts sharply with the elevated spikes seen during the March and November 2024 peaks, which preceded significant sell-offs and market tops. The relatively restrained selling now suggests that the market is not exhibiting signs of overheating, leaving room for further upside. Supporting the case for a strong bounce if BTC dips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, currently at $96,000. This metric reflects the average acquisition price of coins moved recently and has historically served as a reliable support during bullish phases. In prior cycles, Bitcoin has typically not stayed below this level for long, underscoring solid investor conviction and persistent demand. Taken together, the muted profit-taking and a key support near the $96,000 point to a high likelihood that any pullback under six figures would attract dip-buying interest, reinforcing the broader bullish trend. Why market attention is on Bitcoin Pepe Even as Bitcoin grapples with short-term volatility, its recent move to new highs has buoyed sentiment across the broader crypto market, an environment that has historically set the stage for wider rallies. In this risk-on backdrop, investor appetite is again turning toward speculative corners of the market, with meme coins among the early beneficiaries. One standout in this rotation is Bitcoin Pepe, which is positioning itself not just as another viral token but as a meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. The project claims to combine Bitcoin’s security with scalability comparable to Solana—an infrastructure edge that differentiates it from the majority of meme tokens, which typically offer little beyond branding. To build out its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has lined up several strategic partnerships. These include collaborations with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, as well as a tie-up with the GETE Network aimed at expanding into the cross-chain Web3 gaming segment. These moves suggest an effort to blend meme culture with real-world blockchain utility. Investor interest appears to be following. Bitcoin Pepe has raised more than $12.7 million in its ongoing presale, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0396. The presale is set to close on May 31, 2025, and a centralized exchange listing is expected shortly thereafter—an event that could act as a near-term price catalyst. As speculative capital continues to rotate into meme coins and early-stage projects, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself at the convergence of infrastructure development and retail-driven hype.

While traders keep an eye on Aave’s (AAVE) resistance zone after its bounce from key Fibonacci support, and Uniswap’s (UNI) breakout above $6.50 with bullish indicators flashing, another move may be brewing in the shadows. Web3 ai recently launched a $777,000 giveaway, but it’s not just about the giveaway. The true value lies in Web3 ai ($WAI) , now in stage 7 of its 50-stage presale at just $0.000402. With projections pointing to $4 in the future, this coin could offer a 10,000x return for early holders. Web3 ai is packed with real AI tools, such as auto-trading bots and scam detectors. For those serious about long-term gains, Web3 ai presents a compelling opportunity, going far beyond just the giveaway. AAVE Bounces at $250, Eyes $414 Breakout Target Aave (AAVE) recently bounced off the golden ratio at $250, with its resistance zone becoming the key focus for bullish traders aiming for a breakout. The coin is currently trading at around $265, up by 16% over the past week. Analysts predict a 43.8% price increase, potentially reaching $414.06 if momentum holds. The 0.618 Fibonacci level has acted as strong support, and breakout patterns suggest a shift from last year’s downtrend. AAVE’s fundamentals remain robust, particularly in lending and borrowing. Bulls are targeting $582 by year-end, but volatility remains a concern, and risk management is crucial. Uniswap Breaks $6.50, Targets $7.50 on Volume Surge Uniswap (UNI) has seen a significant breakout above trendline resistance, pushing the coin above $6.50 with a target of $7.50. UNI experienced a strong intraday move, with Open Interest rising by 14% to $400 million and trading volume up 54% to $467 million. Liquidations of short positions surged, indicating a potential short squeeze. Technical indicators back the bullish sentiment, with UNI breaking above the 50, 100, and 200-period EMAs on the 4-hour chart. If it holds the breakout level, UNI could test the May high of $7.50. Positive momentum signals solid gains in the near term. From $0.000402 to $4 Ahead for Web3 ai: Big Wins Are Hiding in Plain Sight Web3 ai has launched a $777,000 prize pool, divided between 10 lucky buyers. To enter, all it takes is a $100 purchase of $WAI coins. However, the real prize is what’s being built behind the scenes. In stage 7 of its 50-stage presale, Web3 ai has already raised over $6.2 million. Each $WAI coin is priced at just $0.000402, with analysts predicting a future price of $4 by the future. This could result in a 10,000x return, but the real story is that Web3 ai’s platform is already developing tools like auto-balancing portfolios and scam detection features. These aren’t just future promises; they’re already being developed. This makes Web3 ai more than a meme coin: it’s a practical, timely asset. For those serious about finding the best crypto for the future, Web3 ai ticks all the boxes: utility, timing, and massive upside. While the giveaway grabs attention, long-term holders are after sustained returns driven by real tools. The strategy is clear: get in early and hold through the growth. Whether someone wins the $77,700 prize or not, the real jackpot could lie in holding $WAI before it hits major exchanges. This is one of the best cryptos to consider for anyone building a future-focused portfolio. Key Takeaways Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI) both show bullish short-term potential, with AAVE reclaiming the 0.618 Fibonacci level, setting up for a 43% move. UNI’s breakout above trendline resistance targets $7.50. However, for those seeking long-term gains, Web3 ai presents a stronger opportunity. While the $777,000 giveaway garners attention, the real potential lies in the $WAI coin. Priced at $0.000402 in stage 7, with $6.2 million raised, Web3 ai offers automated portfolio tools, trading bots, and scam detection features powered by AI. This combination makes Web3 ai one of the best long-term crypto opportunities.

He suggested that cargo ships could speed up their transit through the Panama Canal if they paid in Bitcoin. It was a brief comment, but it set off a flurry of questions about how it might work in practice. Related Reading: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO Bitcoin Payments For Priority Passage According to reports from the panel, Mizrachi spoke alongside El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy leaders, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert. He said that ships could “cut the line” by paying tolls in Bitcoin. He offered the idea as a way to reward early adopters. It was presented in a casual tone, but it touched on a serious topic: how fast payments could tie into a long-standing shipping process. Ships Could Pay Panama Canal Transit Fees in Bitcoin The mayor of Panama City, Mayer Mizrachi, said he is exploring bitcoin payment options for ships passing Panama Canals. “What if you have a perk for paying in bitcoin?” Mizrachi mused. “You’d get to go faster.” 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/zciROaSGjM — Ray (@ray4tesla) May 30, 2025 Questions Over Fees And Fairness Based on what was discussed, the Canal’s current rule is first-come, first-served. Changing that would need approval from the Panama Canal Authority and Panama’s national government. Shipping companies might push back if they feel smaller carriers are priced out. US President Donald Trump weighed in late last year, arguing that US ships faced “unfair tolls” and hinting at reclaiming the Canal in December 2024. That episode showed how sensitive Canal changes can be. Handling A $5 Billion Business According to the Panama Canal website, the waterway brought in around $5 billion in revenue between October 2023 and September 2024. Nearly 10,000 ships passed through, carrying about 423 million tons of goods. That’s about 5% of global maritime commerce. If Bitcoin payments were allowed, the Authority would need a plan to deal with price swings. One day’s checkout could be 50 BTC, the next it might jump to 60 BTC. Panama would likely need a quick exchange system to turn BTC into dollars or other stable currencies. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ A Push For City-Level Crypto Mizrachi has also backed letting people pay city fees—taxes, fines and permits—in Bitcoin, Ether and USDC. He raised the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for Panama City, which produces over half of the nation’s GDP. He noted he wouldn’t need more laws to start one. But real steps will depend on lawmakers and officials at the national level. For now, it remains a mayoral proposal, rather than a binding plan. Mizrachi claimed over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions happen in Panama every year, though much of it is “behind closed doors,” he said.

Speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum in California, Jamie said, “You are going to see a crack in the bond market, OK? It is going to happen.” He made the statement while criticizing the US government and the Federal Reserve for how far they’ve pushed spending and monetary policy since the pandemic. According to remarks reported by the Wall Street Journal , Jamie believes the government’s debt-driven policies are pushing the system toward instability. At the center of it is a House-passed tax plan supported by President Donald Trump that would blow up the federal deficit by about $2.7 trillion over ten years. The US national debt is already more than $36 trillion. That proposal has freaked out traders, with a spike in 10-year Treasury yields to 4.418% earlier this month and a credit downgrade from Moody’s, which pointed to the government’s “towering pile of debt.” Traders react to growing fiscal risk Jamie said things got unsteady back in early 2020 when Covid-19 shook the system. But the government’s reaction—which worked at first—eventually spiraled. “They massively overdid” the response in the following years, he said, leaving the economy bloated with cheap money and debt. The result now is a bond market that’s showing signs of real stress, starting with a lack of demand at a Treasury auction on May 21. The financial system has also been slowed down by rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Jamie pointed out that banks have less room to hold bonds under current regulations. That means they can’t easily step in when markets turn shaky. This creates a situation where, if sellers flood the market and there aren’t enough buyers, there’s no buffer to prevent a deeper freeze. To respond, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other financial officials have floated the idea of relaxing capital rules. The goal is to make it easier for banks to absorb more government bonds. But Jamie wasn’t exactly convinced that would fix the real problem. He warned regulators directly: “It’s going to happen, and you’re going to panic.” He added that he’s not sure if the breakdown comes in six months or six years, but he’s certain it’s on the way unless something changes soon. Jamie Dimon sees bigger risks beyond bonds While most of Jamie’s message focused on the debt situation, he also hit other areas he thinks are being ignored. He said investors are underestimating the damage from Trump’s tariffs , which were reintroduced after the president returned to the White House. Jamie said the market is too confident considering how these trade policies can hit real companies. “It’s an extraordinary amount of complacency,” he said. His concerns go beyond money. Jamie said America’s place in the world is at risk if it doesn’t stay strong both economically and militarily. He warned that the US dollar’s role as the global reserve currency could vanish in the future. “If we are not the pre-eminent military and the pre-eminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency,” he said. Jamie admitted that China, the main target of the trade war, is a “potential adversary”, but said the bigger issue is internal. “What I really worry about is us,” he said. “Can we get our own act together—our own values, our own capabilities, our own management?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On Friday, Commerce Department data revealed that consumer prices rose 2.1% in April compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. That puts inflation within touching distance of the Fed’s target, but officials aren’t ready to change course just yet, especially not while President Donald Trump is ramping up tariffs . According to Reuters , Fed officials are choosing patience, not action. The risk of cutting rates too early while tariffs continue to raise import costs is just too high. And they’re not convinced inflation is going to stay low either. Goods prices are already rising again, which means businesses are likely passing costs from higher import taxes straight to consumers. Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said the April inflation dip will probably be seen by the Fed “as the calm before the storm.” He said unless consumer spending collapses or job losses spike, the central bank will keep waiting. Fed freezes as tariffs drive caution On the same day the inflation data came out, the government also reported that consumer spending only grew 0.2% in April. That’s weak. Meanwhile, the personal saving rate jumped to 4.9%, up from 4.3%. Households are saving more and spending less, likely because tariff policy changes so frequently that people are bracing for whatever comes next. Karim Basta from III Capital Management put it simply: “There’s nothing to do but wait.” Since December, the Fed has held short-term rates between 4.25% and 4.50%. And after their most recent meeting in May, officials made clear they’re focused on inflation . Multiple policymakers said they’re worried that Trump’s tariffs could wipe out any progress on prices. Mary Daly, President of the San Francisco Fed, said on Thursday that inflation is still above target. “Inflation is going to be my focus,” she said. Daly also emphasized that rates have to stay “moderately restrictive” to keep downward pressure on prices. Later that evening, Lorie Logan, who leads the Dallas Fed, said it could be “quite some time” before the Fed knows if Trump’s trade policies will do more damage to jobs or prices. She said those risks are “in rough balance,” and that’s enough reason for the Fed to stay on hold. Still, traders are betting that by September, the Fed will start cutting rates slowly. They expect the policy rate to land between 3.75% and 4.0% by the end of the year. But unless inflation drops hard or unemployment jumps, the Fed is showing no sign of blinking.

One such token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently priced at $0.03, with analysts forecasting a $5 price target after launch. The experts point out that this token has the value proposition, coupled with the perfect time to support this breakout. At its current price of $0.03, a rise to $5 would represent an over 100x gain post-launch. While in the legacy financial world, these gains are almost unheard of, they are quite possible in the crypto world. However, for a crypto project to be worthy of such high price targets, it must fulfill several criteria, which Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has done perfectly. One of them is that its value proposition has to be built on solid fundamentals that point to long-term value addition for its community. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could achieve $5 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a unique protocol design that has left analysts amazed at how low its current valuation is compared to its fundamentals. The MUTM token is currently selling for $0.03 per token in Phase 5 of the presale, with over $9.4 million having been raised so far. Buyers who participate in the current phase are assured of a 100% ROI. In Phase 1, the pricing was even cheaper at $0.01 per token. Since then, the price has risen 200%, and it is set to rise another 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6. So far, over 11,300 unique buyers have participated in the presale, with many of them buying tokens since the start of the presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on utility The crypto market has gradually been shifting focus from quick flips that leave most of its community trapped due to low liquidity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focused on building a decentralized, dual-mode liquidity protocol that will deliver long-term growth for its community. In the first mode, called the P2C (peer-to-contract), lenders receive an annualized percentage yield on their assets when they deposit them in a smart contract. This yield rate is based on the utilization rate, and the pool is designed to be self-sustaining by constantly shifting rates based on demand and supply. When the utilization rate in a P2C pool rises, the rate increases, which encourages even more liquidity to enter the pool. That also makes it unfavorable for borrowers to participate, which pushes down the rate to more acceptable levels. In the other mode, which is peer-to-peer (P2P), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows lenders and borrowers to engage directly with each other in separate smart contracts. The focus of the P2P mode is on highly volatile assets like the PEPE meme coin. By placing it in a separate section, it ensures the high volatility does not bleed into the P2C pools, while also providing an avenue for holders of highly volatile assets to earn passive income. mtTokens for instant liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has correctly assessed that depositors in a liquidity pool are often discouraged from doing so since staking takes liquidity away from them. To solve this issue, Mutuum Finance has introduced a revolutionary concept called mtTokens. For instance, when a depositor places $2,500 worth of ETH in a pool, they receive mtETH tokens in return. The mtTokens ensure that depositors can take advantage of market opportunities as they arise. These tokens are built on the ERC-20 token standard, which means they can be freely exchanged on secondary markets or used as collateral for new loans on the protocol. Long-term dividend payouts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has created a smart solution for dividends that also supports the overall growth of the project. The team plans to use profits from the protocol to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which they will then distribute to the stakers. These purchases will support the price of the MUTM tokens while also incentivizing more stakers to sign up. Consequently, it will support the long-term health of the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating that with a commitment to utility in the crypto space, a new project can drive real value for its community. With the success of the recent Certik audit, the number of firm believers in the project has shot through the roof and is expected to keep climbing after launch. Consequently, the modest projection of a rise to $5 is feasible.

Borrowing costs have hit record highs, demand is collapsing, and investors are walking away. According to the Financial Times , policymakers are now scrambling to figure out how to stop things from spiraling further. Last week, 30-year bond yields hit 3.2%, up from 2.3% earlier this year. 40-year bond yields climbed to 3.7%, right after two auctions flopped in a row. Traders in Tokyo described it bluntly as a “buyers’ strike,” and it confirmed something deeper. Investors no longer want Japan’s super-long-term debt. Yields shot up because prices tanked, and that’s happening for one big reason: nobody is buying. Aging investors and the demand problem A major reason for the weak demand is demographics. Kevin Zhao, who leads global sovereign and currency strategy at UBS Asset Management, said the country’s wealthy postwar baby boomers aren’t investing for the long term anymore. Another chunk of missing demand is coming from life insurance firms. Last year, they were pushed to buy up long-term bonds, and they did. But traders now say that the buying wave has ended. Insurance companies aren’t reliable buyers anymore. They’re pulling back, and it’s showing up clearly in the auctions. A recent 20-year bond auction barely attracted interest, the lowest demand since 2012. Then came this week’s 40-year bond sale, which had the weakest bid-to-cover ratio in nearly a year. Traders said the lack of interest confirmed what’s been building for months. The usual buyers are gone, and new ones haven’t stepped in. BoJ policy changes and critical decisions ahead The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is making things even tighter. It raised interest rates to 0.5% and has been trimming its bond buying by ¥400 billion — about $2.8 billion — each quarter. That tapering will continue until March 2026. But without strong buyers, every cut in BoJ purchases adds stress to the system. The bank already owns around 52% of Japan’s bond market, and there’s growing concern about how much more pressure the market can take. All eyes are now on the week of June 16. That’s when the BoJ’s Monetary Policy Committee meets for two days. They’ll review the past year of reduced bond purchases. Some in the market believe the committee might slow down the tapering to keep a lid on yields. The BoJ’s decisions that week could decide whether things calm down or get worse. Just after that, the Ministry of Finance is expected to meet with market players to discuss its debt issuance plans. One likely move would be to cut back on sales of long-dated bonds. Yields dropped slightly on Tuesday after reports that the ministry had started asking brokers how they feel about the current bond market environment. At JPMorgan, economists told clients the spike in yields makes the upcoming BoJ meeting even more important. But Benjamin Shatil, a senior economist there, thinks the central bank is lagging behind. Japan is now in its fourth year of inflation above target, yet policies haven’t caught up. “It all begs the question — why buy?” Benjamin asked. He also pointed to Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, which has not shifted allocations toward domestic bonds despite the volatility. And with liquidity tightening fast in Japan’s commercial banks, fewer institutions are able — or willing — to buy this debt. On the trading desks in Tokyo, the long end of the bond market — the super-long JGBs — is flashing all the alarms. Shinichiro Kadota, a strategist at Barclays, said Wednesday’s failed auction shows the deep problems are now front and center. Issues like BoJ tapering, budget pressure from defense spending, and household savings moving into tax-free NISA accounts are all hitting at the same time. Income for life insurers is also shrinking, and their investment products are losing out to other alternatives. Shinichiro said he doesn’t expect the BoJ to reverse course. “There may be some tweaks . . . but the solution has to be the Ministry of Finance [reducing] issuance,” he said.

While the bulls have held higher lows in the short term, repeated rejection from the same level raises questions about buyer conviction at these highs. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Ethereum is currently consolidating below the major resistance at $2,800, which aligns with the 200-day moving average. The uptrend that began near $1,500 has paused, and the RSI has slightly dropped below 70, reflecting weakening bullish momentum. Despite this, the price remains above the 100-day MA and the previous breakout zone near $2,200, indicating structure remains bullish unless those levels are lost. A clean breakout above $2,800 would open the path toward the $3,400–$3,600 supply zone. On the other hand, failure to do so could trigger a retest of the $2,200 demand block. The 4-Hour Chart The 4H chart shows that the price has formed a clear ascending triangle between the $2,800 resistance and roughly $2,500 support. The structure resembles a potential distribution phase following two strong accumulation zones below $1,850 earlier this month. While ETH continues to set higher lows, the repeated rejection at the highs is starting to weigh on the short-term outlook. The RSI is also hovering near 47, suggesting a neutral momentum shift. A break below $2,500 and the lower boundary of the pattern would signal bearish reversal toward $2,100, while a confirmed breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the distribution idea and favor upside expansion. Sentiment Analysis The Coinbase Premium Index is currently holding slightly above zero, indicating moderate spot demand from US-based investors. Historically, a rising premium has often preceded strong bullish trends driven by institutional or high-volume retail buyers on Coinbase. Although the current levels are not aggressively high, they reflect underlying strength in the spot market and a willingness to pay slightly more for ETH on U.S. exchanges. If this premium begins expanding while ETH approaches resistance again, it could signal renewed confidence and front-running of a breakout. On the other hand, if the premium fades or turns negative, it may signal waning interest and a possible short-term top, which is the scenario that is seemingly occurring at the moment. Therefore, if the demand from the US declines, it would be highly likely for ETH to go into a correction phase once more.

Following this new all-time high, Bitcoin has retraced approximately 4% in the past seven days, bringing its current trading price down to $105,485. This represents a daily decline of 1.8%, reflecting cautious market sentiment and potential profit-taking among traders. In light of these recent price movements, a CryptoQuant analyst has been closely observing market dynamics, particularly concerning the launch of the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). A detailed analysis provided by Joao Wedson, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has shed new light on the liquidation trends observed in Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. Related Reading: This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why Liquidation Disparity Between Bitcoin and Altcoins Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, market behaviors have demonstrated a notable divergence between Bitcoin and altcoin liquidations. According to Wedson, Bitcoin liquidations on Binance have predominantly involved short positions, indicating traders who bet against Bitcoin were systematically liquidated during its recent price rise. Specifically, the Cumulative Liquidation Delta (CLD) showed short liquidations surpassing longs by approximately $190 million. This suggests market participants holding bearish positions were compelled to exit as Bitcoin’s value surged, pushing the price further upward. In stark contrast, altcoins have experienced a markedly different scenario. During the same period, altcoins faced nearly $1 billion more in long liquidations compared to shorts. This liquidation imbalance indicates that traders betting on a broad altcoin recovery faced substantial losses. The sustained downward pressure on altcoins reveals the failure of expectations surrounding an “Altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies typically outperform BTC. Implications of Market Asymmetry The distinct patterns in liquidations between BTC and altcoins reflect critical shifts in investor risk sentiment and leverage usage. BTC’s favorable price performance primarily impacted traders with bearish outlooks, forcing the liquidation of short positions and contributing to a bullish market perception. Conversely, the altcoin sector’s persistent price declines have led to widespread liquidation of bullish positions, highlighting the misalignment between trader expectations and actual market behavior. According to Wedson, since December 2024, this liquidation asymmetry has widened considerably, underscoring a shift in market focus. Investors have increasingly viewed BTC as a safer or more reliable bet amidst broader market uncertainty, while altcoins have suffered due to heightened leverage and speculative positioning. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming? This trend has intensified following the ETF’s approval, as traders appear more confident betting on Bitcoin’s stability and growth potential compared to the volatility and unpredictability of the altcoin market. Moving forward, the current market conditions suggest that investors may continue to approach Bitcoin with measured optimism while maintaining a cautious stance toward altcoins.

The native token has been hit hard once again due to the overall market-wide crash, and has wiped out all the gains registered since the hype rally earlier this month. This One Is for Users, Gamers, Developers Pi Network’s Core Team often publishes (or refurbishes) guidelines and updates for all of its users, and the latest one, which went live hours ago, is mostly targeting gamers, developers, and PI investors. It reads that games, in general, and those built on its network, are particularly important for user participation as gaming is a “strong fit for driving fun, engagement, and utility in the Pi ecosystem.” The post highlights the launch of a new game app, called FruityPi, which “shows how integration with multiple Pi products like Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network can benefit developers.” It is also advertised that it can leverage what the project’s community has to offer, such as signups, attention, and the aforementioned engagement. The team also advised developers to integrate their newly minted games with Pi’s ecosystem, as it will allow them to take advantage of all of its products and collective resources. If the app manages to gain traction from Pi users, then they should also “apply to Pi Network Ventures.” As previously reported , Pi Network Ventures is a $100 million fund that launched in the middle of the month, which aims to invest in startups that advance the utility of real-world Pi adoption. PI’s Price Keeps Dropping Interestingly, when the team first hinted about a big announcement coming later in May (which was on May 8), the community was quick to pick up the news and blow it out of proportion. As a result, the native token exploded from $0.6 to roughly $1.7 within days. However, that hype-driven rally was short-lived, and the asset began to lose value even before the Pi Network Ventures announcement went live. Since then, PI’s price troubles have only deepened, and the market-wide correction in the past 48 hours didn’t help. In fact, PI is down by 10% in the past day alone and has returned to its starting position of around $0.6. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko Perhaps one other reason behind the substantial price dump is the growing number of unlocked PI tokens in the past few weeks.

The current price of $3.86 hovers just above the lower Bollinger Band at $3.77, which could act as short-term support. The RSI is at 45.46, indicating weakening bullish momentum and nearing oversold territory. The bearish candle formations confirm the downward pressure, while the drop from recent highs signals a possible correction phase. If support at $3.77 fails, Pendle may slide further. Otherwise, a rebound would need to reclaim the $4.23 level to restore bullish confidence. PENDLE/USD 4-hour chart PENDLE 4-hour price chart; Tradingview Based on the 4-hour chart of Pendle (PENDLE/USDT), the current outlook suggests intensified bearish momentum. The price has declined to $3.86, decisively breaching the lower Bollinger Band at $3.90, which may indicate oversold conditions or further downside risk. The Balance of Power indicator reads -0.57, signaling bearish dominance. Furthermore, the MACD has turned negative with widening histogram bars and a bearish crossover, reinforcing the downward trajectory. Unless Pendle reclaims the mid-Bollinger Band at $4.34 or higher, continued selling pressure may drive the price toward the next support zone near $3.60. Reversal signs remain weak and largely absent for now.

On the daily timeframe, the price has dropped to the lower Bollinger Band, and RSI is at 45.46, indicating weakening momentum but not yet oversold. This suggests more room for downside or consolidation. On the 4-hour chart, the RSI hovers near 40 with a bearish MACD crossover, reinforcing selling pressure. The Balance of Power also favors sellers. If the price fails to hold above the $3.76 support zone, a deeper pullback is possible. Caution is advised in the near term. Is PENDLE a good investment?

In early February, Pendle price made a sharp decline as it touched the ground around $2.6. Though the price of Pendle recovered later toward $3.7, it failed to maintain that level and dropped toward $2.7 by February’s end. Pendle’s market price further plunged in March due to rising trade war between the US and China. As a result, Pendle dropped below $2 on March 11. It continued to face intense volatility toward $3 by the end of March. In April, Pendle price witnessed a steady surge as trade war eased between the US and China. The price maintained its momentum above $3 throughout the month. Pendle ended April at $3.4. At the start of May, Pendle price is trading between $3.1 and $3.4.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|PENDLE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 05:53:10

The altcoins have it even worse, with massive price drops from the likes of SUI, LINK, DOGE, SOL, ADA, and more. CRO has defied the market-wide trend with a double-digit price surge. BTC Dumps to $103K Ever since it skyrocketed to almost $112,000 last Thursday to chart a new all-time high, bitcoin’s price has been unable to recapture or even sustain its momentum. It started to fall on the next day when US President Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. Although he delayed their implementation for over a month, BTC failed to bounce off decisively and was stopped at around $110,000 on a couple of occasions. The latest rejection, which came on Thursday at $109,000, was the worst one (for now) as it drove BTC down to $105,000. It recovered some ground to $106,000 yesterday, but the bears reemerged and pushed the cryptocurrency south to a 12-day low of just over $103,000. This decline transpired after Trump said China “violated” the trade agreement between the two, while Beijing responded kindly. Although BTC has regained some ground and now sits above $103,500, its market cap has slid to $2.06 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has shot up to 61.3%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Bleed Out, Not CRO The alternative coins have marked some big losses over the past day. Ethereum is close to breaking below $2,500 after a 4.5% drop. XRP has plunged beneath $2.15, while DOGE, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX have plummeted by up to 9%. The situation with the lower-cap alts is even more painful, as many, such as ENA, INJ, VIRTUAL, and PEPE, have charted double-digit price declines. CRO is the only exception, having gained 17% in the past day and trading close to $0.11. The total crypto market cap has seen roughly $200 billion gone in the past two days and is down to $3.360 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

After days of bullish momentum, ETH now hovers around the $2,550 level—a line that could determine the short-term trajectory. Despite the pullback, Ethereum remains relatively strong compared to other assets, showing signs that bulls still maintain control of the structure. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support However, risks are rising. If Ethereum loses this key demand zone, bearish pressure could intensify and trigger further downside across the altcoin market. Investors are watching closely as ETH tries to stabilize after multiple attempts to reclaim higher levels in recent weeks. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical signal that could offer hope for bulls. According to Martinez, if ETH manages to hold above $2,550, the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart is flashing a buy signal, pointing to a potential rebound toward $2,650. This aligns with the idea that consolidation near strong demand often leads to upside continuation if momentum holds. Ethereum Builds Strength Amid Uncertainty Ethereum is holding up well despite widespread market volatility, trading confidently above the $2,400 level. The asset continues to show strength as it consolidates within a key demand zone, positioning itself for a potential move higher. This resilience is drawing the attention of analysts, many of whom believe ETH is preparing for an impulsive breakout that could ignite a broader altseason. While the technical outlook remains constructive, global tensions continue to shape investor sentiment. The ongoing trade friction between the US and China, combined with rising US Treasury yields, is injecting uncertainty into the macroeconomic landscape. These systemic risks have the potential to disrupt financial markets, but so far, cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin and Ethereum—have remained relatively firm. Martinez shared a technical setup that could validate the bullish thesis. According to Martinez, Ethereum is flashing a TD Sequential buy signal on the 4-hour chart, signaling a likely rebound if ETH continues to hold above $2,550. This would position the asset for a move toward $2,650—a level that could confirm bullish momentum and bring altcoins back into focus. If Ethereum can maintain its current support and break through immediate resistance, it could serve as a spark for renewed optimism across the crypto sector.

On the 4-hour chart, ETH has clearly lost momentum, slipping below the 34 EMA ($2,608) and also breaking beneath the 50 and 100 SMAs—levels that previously acted as support during consolidation. The recent rejection from the $2,800 range triggered a sharp correction, with increasing volume suggesting strong selling activity. The next key area to watch is around $2,450, which aligns with previous consolidation zones and could serve as short-term support. If this level fails to hold, ETH could retest the 200 SMA near $2,300, a crucial level that also lines up with early May breakout levels.

The TD Sequential buy signal, previously active above $2,550, has now been invalidated, signaling caution for traders. All eyes are now on the bulls to see if they can defend this region and reset the short-term structure for a rebound.

With a 2000% rise in trading volume, the LPT price triggered a strong rise from levels around $5 to mark local highs at around $13.48. The rise in the value is due to the listing on the popular South Korean exchange, Upbit, which has increased its trading volume and market exposure. Now that the token has triggered a strong upswing and the technicals surge over the upper threshold, is the LPT price heading for a correction? The historical price chart suggests the price has rebounded from the lowest support around $3.3. In the times when the price has been forming a consecutive higher high and lower low, the listing seems to have come as a blessing in disguise. The rally almost reached the pivotal resistance zone between $11.56 and $12.78 but failed to sustain which may point towards a small correction phase. As seen in the above chart, these levels have been the trend reversal zone before, and hence, they need to be either broken up or down to flip the ongoing trend. The price surged above the resistance zone during Q1 2024 and remained consolidated throughout the year as it offered a strong base, which turned into a resistance that persists till now. Therefore, rising above this zone is extremely important for the LPT price to reach the neckline of the v-shaped recovery above $21; otherwise, the token may continue to consolidate below the range. Technically, the bullish dominance over the rally has just started as the weekly MACD has turned bullish after remaining bearish since the start of the year. Besides, the weekly RSI has risen above the descending trend line, hinting towards the beginning of the bullish trend. Therefore, the Livepeer (LPT) price is believed to maintain a consistent ascending trend by withstanding the bearish pressure and eventually rising above the resistance zone. On the other hand, the token has been attracting significant volume at frequent intervals, which suggests the investors remain vigilant over the token. Therefore, a rise above the range may attract fresh liquidity that may lead the LPT price close to its ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|LPT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 06:28:08

Square's new biannual product launch cadence, the first of which included Square Handheld and a Square AI teaser, positions the company to reignite Square segment growth. AI integration into Square POS leverages proprietary data and distribution, offering robust upselling potential and should drive strong future subscription and services revenue. Block is among the best bitcoin businesses available on public markets, with a full-stack approach and the ability to deploy bitcoin services into enormous ecosystems of merchants and consumers. Further, the company earns a very lucrative yield on its Lightning channel, which is seeing booming growth. Block is at a crossroads; it has faced several years of multiple compression and poor stock performance, but recently has inflected EPS and is looking to re-accelerate Square and Cash App growth. Now, execution is everything. Just a few short weeks ago, I wrote one of the most uncomfortable articles in my time writing here for Seeking Alpha. Jack Dorsey's Block ( XYZ ) reported objectively bad earnings, with slowing growth and meager guidance. The stock got decimated. It dropped from 20% from around $60 to $45 upon release. Block is personally my top holding and a stock I have written on several times with consistently bullish stances. Watching this stock underperform high-flying AI names and fintech competitors alike for the past few years has been a challenge, to say the least. Even worse, I have been recommending others to buy the stock, just to watch it consistently underperform. My conviction was shaken for the first time after seeing the market response to the recent earnings. But I read through the report with an open mind. What I saw didn't justify a 20% selloff. I began writing. The article was titled 'Don't Let This Selloff Go To Waste' and I rated XYZ a strong buy. It felt horrible at the moment, but I had to stomach that discomfort. Since then, the stock has returned to its pre-earnings level above $60. I didn't expect such a rapid recovery, but there are very clear reasons for such. Since the earnings report, the company has announced significant product launches, management has been far more engaged with retail, and there's been a major step toward the company's bitcoin (BTC-USD) inflection. The company is showing renewed focus on innovation and product velocity. The thesis underpinning my Strong Buy rating in this article is simple: Block will reaccelerate growth through product stack depth, innovation, and solid execution. I typically wouldn't cover a stock again so soon, but there's much to talk about here. Let's dive right in. Square Releases The recovery began with the company's first Square Releases, a new biannual product launch cadence for Square merchants. The first Releases announcement was on May 13th, which coincided with the J.P. Morgan 53rd Annual Technology, Media and Communications Conference. Both CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Amrita Ahuja presented at the conference. I have a detailed writeup of the conference on my X account . The core takeaways from their talk were: Four key priorities for the rest of the year: expand Cash App Borrow ramp Afterpay on Cash App card market share gains in square and re-acceleration of GPV growth launch of Proto, the Bitcoin mining ASIC business. Expansion of Cash App Borrow is not predicated on an expansion of risk appetite. It’s based on the improved unit economics by switching to SFS (Square Financial Services) for origination & the improved profitability thereof. They can now profitably lend to more users. Acceleration of Square GPV growth will be driven by a revamp of marketing strategy. Currently, 80% of Square customer acquisition is organic/self-serve. The company wants a 50/50 balance between self-serve and internal sales led/partnership driven. Meaning, the sales approach has changed to favor more outbound, free hardware, and contract-driven sales. This approach is what allowed competitors to gain share vs Square in recent years. The shift to field sales has resulted in positive early signs with larger customer wins. Cash App gross profit accelerated in April vs to the March run rate, which now makes the company's poor Q2 guide look ""uncharacteristically conservative"" since it assumed a weakening consumer. Such weakening has not materialized through April and May. The goal of codename: goose is to have a fully autonomous AI agent that can act as a CFO or COO for Square merchants and a personal financial assistant in Cash App. Product velocity and innovation are what will regain shareholder trust, belief, and enthusiasm Both Dorsey and Ahuja expressed far more optimism during the investor conference compared to the earnings call. The stock climbed from $55 to $58 on that day. On the morning of the conference, the company announced one huge product release and one huge teaser: Square Handheld and Square AI. Square Handheld is the best-in-class portable point-of-sale (""POS"") system currently available. It is the thinnest, lightest, has the best camera, offers the most payment methods, can process payments offline, and is very cost competitive. X.com user @nachunja A handheld POS is important for retail stores, restaurants, and any other business where it's advantageous for customers to check out at a non-fixed location. This product launch, alongside the company's revamped marketing strategy, aims to reaccelerate Square GPV growth. I believe it's a winning equation. Square Handheld was the flagship launch of the first Square Releases, but this also came with a host of other updates for each of the company's specific verticals (Food & Beverage, Retail, Services, and Health & Beauty). The most important software update was the launch of a new Square POS unified software interface . It enhances the cross-compatibility of Square software across different devices and is a critical step toward moving up the value chain from SMB's (small-to-medium business) to large enterprises. Finally, the company teased Square AI, an AI model that is native to the Square POS software. It's difficult to understate the opportunity that Square has here. I have consistently shared what, I believe, are the keys to success for AI companies: proprietary data and distribution capability. Square fits both of these very well. Data makes the AI smart and useful, and distribution makes the economics work. Integrating AI into the Square software stack moves it up the value chain once again: it started as a simple way to accept card payments, then became a POS solution for merchants, and then a full-stack ERP platform. Square AI will make it a full-stack business operating system. This is an incredibly robust value proposition for existing merchants and should also attract new merchants quite well. On the distribution front, it will be as simple as a software update. My assumption is that a base-level Square AI offering will be bundled into the Free plan with additional features available for both Plus and Premium plans. www.squareup.com This will help generate further subscription & services growth over time as AI has very clear upselling benefits for both existing and new merchants. In my recent article , I summarized my core long-term thesis as such: Meanwhile, the market is completely ignoring the ongoing profitability inflection Block is enjoying. The company demonstrated strong operating leverage in its subscription and services line item, growing revenue by over $200m YoY (+12.5% YoY) while segment COGS grew only 2%. Segment gross margin grew from 83.9% to 85.5% YoY. Segment contributions here grew YoY from both Square and Cash App, and I maintain the conviction that this line item is the future driver of Block's growth. It's the key to a sustainable profitability inflection for the company, and recent news regarding Cash App Borrow, discussed below, will begin driving strong operating leverage in this line item. The Cash App Borrow news referenced was that the company would begin originating Cash App Borrow loans internally within Square Financial Services, which has a US banking charter. This improves the unit economics of the segment and will generate further growth from the Cash App segment contribution. Square AI will accelerate subscription & services growth from the Square segment contribution. Combined with the company's renewed focus on outbound marketing and customer acquisition, I see a very clear path for Square to begin regaining market share and accelerating growth. Don't just take my word for it, though. Block CEO Jack Dorsey himself agreed with my take on X: x.com The seminal Square Releases Day was a great success and was met with excitement from the market. It encapsulates perfectly my thesis: execution excellence underpinned by deepening POS hardware offerings (deepening the product stack), enhancing software functionality (innovating UI/UX), and building hype for future product innovations with Square AI. This brings me to my next point: management engagement. Management Engagement I have been posting about Block for well over a year now on X but have never seen Jack Dorsey engage with the retail community as much as he has recently. It seems the response to the recent earnings call really did light a fire under him. Just look through his replies . He's been replying directly to retail analysts like myself that provide in-depth coverage of the company, its products, and its growth runway. X.com There are many such examples. Engaging with the retail community on X has become much more common in recent years, with many CEOs and other executives using it as a vehicle to communicate directly to a retail audience. Again, returning to my thesis: engagement with the retail community ensures investors understand the strategic direction the company is pursuing. It's not necessarily enough to launch innovative new products; you also need to market them well and ensure the market understands the innovation. The final component of the stock's recovery is Bitcoin. The company's full-stack bitcoin offerings are attracting more attention as the leading cryptocurrency hits new all-time highs and Bitcoiners gather at bitcoin 2025 . Block's Bitcoin Strategy Block has one of the most robust Bitcoin strategies of any publicly traded company. It offers products aimed at accelerating the adoption of bitcoin as a currency, the capability to buy bitcoin easily and hold it safely, and soon the ability to mine bitcoin. The company also has a Bitcoin treasury dollar-cost-averaging strategy. In other words, it holds bitcoin, allows users to buy bitcoin, is increasing access to bitcoin mining, offers cold storage capabilities, and supports the open-source development community. The biggest product announcement to date for Block's bitcoin strategy, however, came just recently on May 27th at the Bitcoin Conference. The company launched a pilot test allowing Square sellers to accept bitcoin as payment. It hopes to have this feature widely available by 2026. x.com These transactions will be processed on the Lightning Network , a payments protocol on the Bitcoin Blockchain that greatly improves processing time for transactions. Historically, a major criticism of bitcoin as a currency is that transactions take roughly 10 minutes to settle. This is due to the design of the blockchain itself, in which new blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes. Each block contains a variety of data, most importantly it contains a 'merkle root' expression of all transactions that were accepted by nodes during that block time. This is slow and clunky. Lightning, on the other hand, essentially allows two nodes to stow some bitcoin away in a multi-sig channel. The two parties within this channel can now transact privately and instantaneously in a private channel off the main blockchain. Next, many of these nodes can be interconnected to create a web of Lightning nodes, effectively creating the Lightning Network. The network supports multi-hop routing, where payments are forwarded throughout the web of connected channels. These transactions are enforced using hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) and can settle in milliseconds, as long as each node along the path has sufficient liquidity. Block's Cash App is Lightning compatible, and Square bitcoin payments will also rely on Lightning. This allows both Square merchants and Cash App users to transact with bitcoin instantaneously. It creates the most widely deployed bitcoin payment rail. Block's head of Bitcoin, Miles Suter, spoke at the bitcoin conference on May 28th. He mentioned that Cash App has seen a 7x increase YoY in Lightning payment volume and 25% of outbound transactions are now on Lightning. Why does this matter? It matters because Block operates a sizable Lightning channel (the 7th largest, known as c=) and earns nearly 10% bitcoin on bitcoin yield. With 189 bitcoins in the channel (according to mempool), this represents a yield of nearly 20 btc per year. At $100k per coin, this is $2m per year in passive yield on the company's bitcoin, which is otherwise sitting in its treasury. Yield is generated by Lightning nodes when they place BTC liquidity in a channel and open that channel up to route payments through it. This is non-custodial yield, meaning Block still maintains ownership of that bitcoin. They are generating yield with an asset on their balance sheet without introducing counterparty risk. If payments stop flowing, there is no risk to the bitcoin. The yield will just dry up. Bitcoin 2025 livestream The biggest question mark for Square payments, though, is on tax treatment. As it stands, bitcoin is classified as property, meaning it is a commodity and is regulated by the CFTC. Selling a commodity triggers a taxable event, requiring a calculation of profit by taking asset value at time of sale versus cost basis. On the back end of a Square bitcoin transaction, Block would sell bitcoin for the equivalent amount of USD, allowing the customer to pay in bitcoin and the merchant to receive USD. The issue is that this creates a taxable event. But how can you calculate the cost basis? It is conceivable that this is possible for bitcoin purchased through Cash App and held in Cash App, but for any bitcoin paid from an external wallet, it becomes prohibitively difficult to calculate tax. Further, this creates a two-tiered tax (capital gains and sales tax) for customers and disincentivizes use. This question is likely the reason that Block said ""The roll out... is expected to reach all eligible Square sellers in 2026, subject to applicable regulatory approvals."" in the first section of the announcement. Regardless, this move highlights how well the company is driving forward the bitcoin ecosystem. It is helping to bridge the gap of bitcoin adoption from enthusiasts to everyday people. It is building the infrastructure required to facilitate this and has the expansive two-sided merchant / consumer network required to greatly accelerate it. For those that believe that Bitcoin will play an integral role in the financial world of tomorrow, it's difficult to find a company better positioned to boom from that paradigm shift. Assuming that both bitcoin payments on Square and Proto's bitcoin mining chip reach mass rollout in 2026 (this is a fairly big assumption), Block will have successfully tied together its entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Again, this ties into my thesis of product stack deepening (bitcoin mining ASIC) and innovation in existing products (bitcoin payments on square). All that's left for the company's Bitcoin segment is to execute on this. Risks The biggest risk to the thesis of this article is in the thesis itself: execution. Block has faced challenges in the past with execution. The stock has tumbled a long way from the COVID-era highs around $280. In the past few years, Block has gone through layoffs, executive reshuffles, an influx of competitive threats, an ever-changing regulatory environment, a short report, countless analyst downgrades, mass inflation, and the fastest rate hike cycle in recent history. Not a favorable environment for a fintech. Throughout this time, they have been evolving as a company as well. Jack Dorsey sold Twitter and moved back to full-time CEO of the company and brought renewed focused on the ecosystem of ecosystems strategy. Amidst the challenging macro backdrop, the company lost focus on the Square segment. Square is still the market leader, but only by a narrow margin, with around 28% share. Cash App made up for much of this weakness for a while but hasn't grown monthly active users in 5 consecutive quarters. The stock has suffered severe multiple compression since. Despite reporting booming EPS growth, the stock is completely range-bound and has been for 3 years now. Data by YCharts Investor Takeaway We are now at a crossroads. Block's traditional finance segments, Square and Cash App, need to reaccelerate growth. The company is focused on the following things to achieve this: outbound marketing and large business acquisition for Square and network density and teen customer acquisition for Cash App. The company's bitcoin business is doing phenomenal, as we discussed, but this is largely ignored by the market. It is not yet very accretive to Block's financial results, but that will change over time. The execution risk remains. Should the company fail to reignite Square and Cash App growth, the stock will continue lagging the market. This is the opportunity, though. The market is basically pricing in a lack of execution. Despite exceptional EPS growth, the stock trades at only 22x forward PE. Using estimated 2026 earnings, the stock trades at 15x forward PE.

Known for drastically reducing gas fees while enhancing transaction speeds, Arbitrum is emerging as one of the most adopted scaling platforms. With its Orbit upgrade expanding compatibility and new dApps launching rapidly, the ARB token is gaining governance relevance. The network’s surge in usage highlights the growing demand for faster, more efficient Ethereum-compatible chains.Even with these advances, Arbitrum did not address the full spectrum of challenges facing blockchain today—developer friction, real-world onboarding, and cross-domain utility. Qubetics ($TICS) rises to meet those demands. Designed as a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain, Qubetics combines breakthrough development infrastructure with streamlined utility tools, making it a strong candidate for the top cryptocurrency to buy in 2025. With deep developer accessibility, security-first frameworks, and smart contract modularity, Qubetics sets a higher standard for future-ready digital finance ecosystems. Meanwhile, Near Protocol (NEAR) is riding a 20% monthly gain as it tests the neckline of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. Priced at $2.94, the token is nearing the $3 resistance zone, which could trigger a breakout if momentum sustains. Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network has climbed from $124 million in early April to $173 million, reflecting rising DeFi activity. While DEX volume is holding above $17 million, a 7% drop in the stablecoin market cap hints at looming liquidity constraints. Still, NEAR’s technical structure and increasing TVL show promise for growth and adoption. Qubetics: Developer-Centric Innovation That Defines the Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Qubetics is rapidly becoming a front-runner among the top cryptocurrency to buy for developers, businesses, and early adopters. At the core of its value proposition are two powerful tools— QubeQode , a simplified smart contract language designed for efficiency and security, and Qubetics IDE , a custom integrated development environment that allows professionals to build, test, and deploy applications with minimal friction. This developer-first ecosystem lowers the barrier to entry, offering intuitive tooling while ensuring formal verification and modularity remain intact. For businesses, Qubetics creates an accessible path to blockchain integration. The Qubetics IDE supports multi-chain deployment, on-chain automation, and dynamic permission systems that streamline enterprise operations. Professionals can build sector-specific tools without navigating steep learning curves. Individuals benefit from secure dApp engagement and decentralized access, backed by seamless updates and zero downtime architecture. Qubetics Presale ROI and Analyst Insight This foundation of utility is matched by surging community momentum. The ongoing crypto presale of Qubetics has reached stage 36, selling over 514 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,300 participants, with $17.5 million raised. At the current presale price of $0.3064, Qubetics provides a unique entry point into one of the fastest-growing Web3 ecosystems. Those who entered at stage 1, priced at $0.01, are already looking at a 2,964% ROI. Yet the presale isn’t over—participants entering now are still strategically positioned for compelling gains. If $TICS reaches $1 post-launch, stage 36 buyers see a 226% ROI. At $5, the return expands to 1,531%, and at $6 it climbs to 1,857%. A move to $10 implies a 3,163% return, while a post-mainnet rally to $15 could deliver up to 4,794% ROI. The presale continues to attract developers and backers seeking the top cryptocurrency to buy before market-wide awareness kicks in. With innovation, traction, and tools already in place, Qubetics is not just a potential contender—it’s setting the benchmark. Arbitrum: Ethereum’s Most Practical Scaling Layer Gains Traction Arbitrum’s rise as a Layer-2 solution has made it a staple for Ethereum-based projects aiming to minimize gas fees and accelerate execution. Full EVM compatibility allows seamless deployment of existing Ethereum apps, making the migration process effortless. Governance under the ARB token allows participants to vote on network upgrades, staking mechanics, and long-term development strategy. With the Arbitrum Orbit upgrade, new use cases continue to roll out, and projects are increasingly choosing the platform for its speed and affordability. Arbitrum is viewed as essential infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, especially as the demand for L2 adoption climbs across DeFi, NFT, and gaming. Arbitrum is among the top cryptocurrency to buy for participants seeking proven scalability and Ethereum synergy, but it lacks the holistic builder toolset and modular design offered by Qubetics. Near Protocol: Momentum Builds Amid Technical Reversal Hopes Near Protocol (NEAR) is testing a breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, suggesting bullish strength. With its current price nearing the critical $3 neckline, the next few sessions may define its short-term trajectory. The MACD indicator is nearing a bullish crossover, while TVL has steadily climbed to $173 million. Still, caution exists. The 7% drop in Near’s stablecoin market cap suggests some users are pulling liquidity, raising questions about the network’s short-term capital health. That said, strong on-chain metrics like consistent DEX volume and rising TVL indicate a rebound could be near. NEAR is positioned among the top cryptocurrency to buy for those seeking trend reversals backed by on-chain growth, but it lacks the early-stage ROI opportunity and developer integration edge seen in Qubetics. Final Thoughts Arbitrum delivers scalability. Near shows strengthening DeFi metrics and technical promise. Yet only Qubetics offers a comprehensive environment built for speed, flexibility, and real-world usability—all while enabling entry at an early presale phase with unmatched upside. Qubetics stands apart with QubeQode and Qubetics IDE—developer tools that simplify smart contract creation and streamline enterprise adoption. The numbers are clear: over 27,300 participants, $17.5 million raised, and more than 514 million tokens sold. With the presale still open at $0.3064, this is more than a blockchain opportunity—it’s a chance to gain early access to a network with foundational advantages. For those seeking the top cryptocurrency to buy with tangible utility, scalable potential, and immediate access—Qubetics delivers the full package.

45319694,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69123,1748673263,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Zumo Acknowledges XRP Powerful Use Cases As Bridge Currency,https://timestabloid.com/zumo-acknowledges-xrp-powerful-uses-cases-as-bridge-currency/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has drawn attention to a newly surfaced insight from a Zumo report, identifying Ripple’s XRP token as a highly suitable candidate for wholesale applications within single-currency domestic zones. The assessment appears in Zumo’s publication, titled “Digital assets 2023: identifying the opportunities across the enterprise landscape.” It refers to the specific benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in business-to-business (B2B) digital asset payments. Ripple’s XRP token—> “attractive for WHOLESALE applications in domestic/single-currency-zone contexts, where blockchain/DLT-derived advantages (cost/ speed/programmability/automated reconciliation) can potentially be realised without the awkwardness of the digital asset fiat… https://t.co/DDvBlO58Cb pic.twitter.com/PDa15AYV1N — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 28, 2025 Enterprise Friction in Crypto-to-Fiat Conversion The report makes the case that the inefficiencies and friction associated with converting cryptoassets into local fiat currencies remain a core challenge in early-stage enterprise adoption. The analysis specifically notes that many crypto-based payments currently require off-ramps back into fiat to complete transactions or satisfy regulatory, tax, and accounting requirements. This hinders their seamless integration into operational payment flows. Ripple and XRP Positioned for Domestic Optimization Zumo highlights several blockchain projects that aim to address these cost and conversion issues. Ripple is mentioned directly alongside Stellar in the context of working to reduce these frictions, with the report calling out XRP and its intermediary token role as part of this effort. In a key section, the authors write that the XRP token is “attractive for wholesale applications in domestic/single-currency-zone contexts, where blockchain/DLT-derived advantages (cost/speed/programmability/automated reconciliation) can potentially be realised without the awkwardness of the digital asset fiat bridge.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This analysis suggests that XRP’s architecture and integration features make it particularly well-suited for domestic wholesale environments, where the need to convert between different fiat currencies is removed. Institutions can more directly benefit from blockchain’s technical efficiencies. Gradual Adoption Within Enterprise Financial Infrastructure The commentary aligns with Ripple’s long-standing positioning of XRP as a liquidity and settlement token for financial institutions and enterprises. By eliminating the need for complex cross-border fiat bridges in domestic contexts, XRP may offer banks and corporations a viable path to DLT integration without requiring full-scale disruption of existing fiat systems. This has implications for how enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure may be deployed in the near term, focusing first on domestic efficiencies before scaling into more complex, cross-border models. CBDC Complexity Reinforces XRP’s Immediate Use Case The Zumo report also includes a statement from HSBC Managing Director Mark Williamson, reinforcing the broader challenges surrounding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and digital assets in cross-border use. Williamson emphasizes the need to solve what he calls the “CBDC Rubik’s cube,” encompassing wholesale and retail models, token- and account-based systems, as well as primary and secondary market integration. The inclusion of such commentary further contextualizes the digital asset landscape, within which XRP is positioned as a practical tool for enterprise-level financial applications. SMQKE’s tweet underscores growing institutional acknowledgment of XRP’s potential in practical, regulated settings. The recognition of XRP’s advantages—specifically cost reduction, speed, and programmability—adds to the token’s evolving narrative as a purpose-built settlement mechanism within tokenized finance frameworks. As enterprises continue to evaluate and adopt blockchain solutions, XRP’s utility in streamlined, domestic payment environments may become increasingly relevant.

The AI pace of change feels unlike anything we’ve witnessed before – distinct from the shifts brought by mobile, social media, or cloud computing. This isn’t just a feeling; it’s a reality underscored by data. Venture capitalist Mary Meeker, renowned for her previous ‘Internet Trends’ reports, has released a new, extensive slideshow report titled “Trends — Artificial Intelligence.” Across its 340 pages, the word “unprecedented” appears 51 times, specifically used to describe the speed of AI’s development, adoption, investment, and usage. As Meeker writes, “The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented, as supported by the data.” Understanding the Unprecedented AI Speed What exactly makes this wave of AI different? The data points highlighted in the Mary Meeker report paint a clear picture of acceleration. Here are some key indicators: User Adoption: Achieving 800 million users in just 17 months, as seen with platforms like ChatGPT, is a speed of consumer adoption never before recorded for a new technology. Company Growth: The rate at which new AI companies are reaching high annual recurring revenue (ARR) milestones is significantly faster than in previous tech cycles. Cost Reduction (Inference): The cost of using AI models (inference costs), calculated per 1 million tokens, has dropped dramatically by 99% over the past two years, according to research cited by Meeker. This rapid decrease makes AI more accessible and fuels wider adoption. Cost Increase (Training): While usage costs fall, the cost of training large AI models has surged, sometimes reaching up to $1 billion. This highlights the immense investment required at the foundational level of AI development. This combination of rapid user adoption and plunging usage costs, despite high training costs, creates a unique market dynamic. What’s Driving the AI Adoption Speed? Beyond user demand, several factors contribute to the astonishing AI adoption speed documented by Meeker. Competition is fierce, leading companies to quickly match and improve upon features offered by rivals, often at lower costs. The rise of open-source AI models, particularly from international players, further intensifies this competition and lowers barriers to entry. Hardware advancements are also playing a crucial role. Meeker points out significant efficiency gains in specialized AI chips. For example, Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell GPU is vastly more energy-efficient per token than its 2014 predecessor. Companies like Google and Amazon are heavily investing in developing their own custom AI chips (TPUs and Trainium, respectively) at scale for their cloud infrastructure. These are not minor initiatives; they are described as “foundational bets” that enable faster and cheaper AI processing, directly impacting the pace of adoption. Exploring Key AI Technology Trends The report delves into several critical AI technology trends shaping the current landscape. The shift towards more efficient hardware, the increasing sophistication of models, and the proliferation of specialized AI applications are all contributing to this accelerated pace. The competition between proprietary models and open-source alternatives is also a significant trend, driving innovation and potentially lowering costs for end-users and businesses. While the technological progress is undeniable and happening at an unprecedented AI speed, the financial returns story is less clear-cut. Venture capital is flowing into AI companies rapidly, but these companies, along with cloud providers, are also incurring massive expenses due to the infrastructure demands of AI development and deployment. The significant investment required for computing power, data storage, and talent means that profitability for many remains a future goal. Benefits, Challenges, and the Path Ahead The rapid advancements and dropping inference costs are largely beneficial for consumers and enterprises. They gain access to increasingly powerful AI tools and services at more affordable rates, fostering innovation and efficiency across various sectors. This is a direct result of the intense competition and technological progress highlighted in the Mary Meeker report . However, the primary challenge remains identifying which companies will successfully navigate the high investment requirements and intense competition to become profitable, long-term leaders in the AI space. As Meeker aptly puts it, “Only time will tell which side of the money-making equation the current AI aspirants will land.” For individuals and businesses, the actionable insight is clear: stay informed and be prepared for continuous, rapid change. The AI revolution is not slowing down; understanding its drivers and implications is crucial for navigating the future landscape, whether you are involved in technology, finance, or any industry being reshaped by AI. In conclusion, Mary Meeker’s report confirms what many have sensed: the current era of AI development and adoption is truly unprecedented in its speed and scope. Driven by technological advancements, fierce competition, and massive investment, the AI pace of change is reshaping industries and presenting both incredible opportunities and significant challenges.

Bitcoin is down over 2% today, trading at $103,700. Smart contract platforms also took a big hit as Solana fell 6.3%, Sui dropped 7.8%, and Avalanche slid 7.3%. Crypto stocks were also affected as Bitdeer (BTDR) sank 8.3% after a big rally, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) dipped 2.7% and Coinbase (COIN) lost 1.3%. U.S.-China Trade Tensions Startle Crypto Markets The rising U.S.-China tensions are back in focus after a brief truce earlier this month. President Trump accused China of violating the tariff agreement, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox interview that trade talks with Chinese representatives had “stalled.” In response, China called on the U.S. to “immediately correct its erroneous actions and cease discriminatory restrictions,” according to the BBC. Earlier, the easing of tensions had fueled a rally in risk assets like Bitcoin, but the renewed conflict could now erase those gains. Memecoins See Sharp Pullback Bitcoin has dropped 6% over the past week. Whale activity shows signs of a comeback, but technical signals are still flashing warning signs. A death cross also looms for Bitcoin, and if it falls below the $104,584 support, it could slide further toward $100,694. Bulls need to reclaim $106,726 to regain control and prevent deeper losses. Memecoins also saw a sharp pullback, with over $10 billion wiped from their market cap in just seven days. It dropped from $74 billion to $64 billion, which is the lowest since May 9. Over $11.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options were to expire yesterday , which had a major impact on their short-term price action. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Liquidations Nearly $1B Today: Time to Exit and Take Profits? , Open Interest Drops, Liquidations Hit $800M The Fear and Greed Index has also dropped from 74 to 69, a three-week low. Over 217,000 traders were liquidated recently, with over $800 million in total liquidations across the crypto market. Over the past 24 hours, there have been $716 million in total liquidations. Bitcoin futures saw a $3.7 billion drop in open interest as BTC fell from $108,000 to $104,500. This sharp pullback signals a healthy reset, clearing out overleveraged positions and cooling market hype. While Bitcoin could soon dip to $100,000, however, data shows that a drop below that level could be short-lived. CryptoQuant’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart shows there is only mild profit-taking, which is far less than the sell-offs seen at market tops in 2024. This hints that the market isn’t overheated and Bitcoin’s uptrend may still have room to run. If Bitcoin drops below $100,000, the $96,000 would be a key support level attracting buyers and limiting further drops. Trader Altcoin Sherpa points to a strong support zone between $102K–$104.5K and expects a bounce that could push Bitcoin above $107K in the coming days . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

An analyst suggests that holding the current range over the weekend will be key for the long-awaited rally back to $200. Related Reading: Bitcoin $106,800 Support Retest To Determine Next Move – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Solana Hits Multi-Week Low Amid the crypto market pullback, most cryptocurrencies are recording a red Friday, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) momentarily losing some key levels. Solana, one of the cycle’s leading Altcoins, followed the rest of the market and registered a 6% retracement in the daily timeframe. SOL has seen a significant recovery from its multi-month downtrend, which led the token to hit a 14-month low of $95 during the early April retraces. Over the past month and a half, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed multiple crucial levels, setting the stage for a potential rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the key $180 resistance despite hitting a three-month high of $187 a week ago. A reclaim of this key barrier could push SOL’s price toward the $200 mark, enabling a rally to new highs. Today’s price action has sent Solana to a 22-day low of $156 after losing its $164-$180 price range and the $160 support zone for the first time since the May 8 breakout. Trader and analyst Crypto Bullet shared a bearish outlook for Solana, suggesting that the token will underperform for the rest of the year. He highlighted SOL’s trading pair against ETH, noting that the cryptocurrency has been in a rising wedge in the weekly chart since the Q4 2024 rally. According to the SOL/ETH chart posted by the trader, the cryptocurrency has broken down out of the formation after losing the 0.069 mark. To Crypto Bullet, this signals that “ETH will soon pump way harder than SOL.” All Eyes On SOL’s Weekly Close Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Solana is attempting to continue Weekly Closing within its Range High resistance, which is key for its long-term rally. He previously explained that the cryptocurrency re-entered its Post-Halving Re-Accumulation Range after successfully reclaiming the $120 barrier last month and consolidating within the $160-$175 range high. To the analyst, SOL’s price “needs to continue demonstrating price stability” around this zone, as that is what is “required for SOL to break out from this range into the $200+ levels.” He affirmed that Solana needs to aim for a retest similar to late 2024, when the cryptocurrency built a base around the Range High ahead of the breakout with multiple weekly closes near the resistance zone, which led to a massive breakout to the $200 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeating Early 2024’s Playbook – $3,800 Target In Sight? Rekt Capital highlighted that SOL has been successfully retesting this area as support over the past few weeks. However, he warned that cryptocurrency mustn’t close below the current price zone as it would “tease a possible loss of this region as support.” A drop below this range could lead to a retrace into the Range Low, between the $120-$135 mark. “Price stability at the Orange Range High going forward is thus key here,” he concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $159, an 11.6% decline in the weekly timeframe.

New U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings show Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 – a 6.64% increase in three months. According to the filing, Buffett has allocated most of the firm’s cash reserves to US Treasuries as of Q1 2025, followed by investments in equity securities at $263.735 billion. Berkshire also has a $36.892 billion cash position as of last quarter, which ended in March. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire’s trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan’s holdings at $297.8 billion. If Warren Buffett’s investment firm were a nation, it would be the 11th-largest foreign holder of Treasury Securities, just behind France’s $363.1 billion, Ireland’s $329.3 billion and Switzerland’s $311.6 billion holdings. Berkshire’s push for yield on its cash comes after the firm offloaded $3.23 billion worth of shares in three US banking giants last quarter. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million.

These texts detail Ripple’s compatibility with existing financial standards and networks, suggesting that Ripple’s distributed ledger technology can operate in conjunction with, rather than in replacement of, traditional systems. Yes, Ripple can integrate with NACHA, SWIFT and the Federal Reserve. Documented 4x. https://t.co/HYf3336Xd1 pic.twitter.com/DIoeS5v7wA — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 29, 2025 NACHA and Ripple: Parallel Roles in Payment Governance One excerpt underscores the idea that Ripple could be integrated into or modeled after a self-regulatory body like NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association). NACHA governs ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions in the U.S. and sets rules and responsibilities for financial institutions. The document indicates that Ripple’s structure, based on distributed and decentralized user participation, aligns with the framework NACHA provides. The implication is that Ripple could operate within the same regulatory scope without disrupting existing legal and operational frameworks. It also notes that NACHA’s rules could be extended to define how financial institutions interact with Ripple. SWIFT’s Messaging Standards and Ripple’s Settlement Layer Another section cited in the tweet distinguishes SWIFT and Ripple . While SWIFT operates as a messaging system that does not settle payments itself, Ripple offers a full settlement layer using its distributed ledger. Despite their functional differences, the document explicitly states that “SWIFT and Ripple could easily exist in the same space,” including scenarios where SWIFT could utilize Ripple’s distributed ledger . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This speaks directly to concerns about redundancy or conflict between traditional messaging systems and blockchain-based solutions. The documentation confirms that interoperability, rather than exclusivity, is a feasible and perhaps intended design goal. Ripple’s Settlement Protocol and Global Institutional Adoption A further excerpt outlines the possibility that several financial institution networks could be built on top of Ripple’s common settlement protocol. The example given involves NACHA using Ripple’s infrastructure to create standardized rules for dispute resolution, compliance, and other aspects of payment processing. This is further supported by the mention of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) region banks in Europe potentially adopting a similar approach. The potential scope of Ripple’s network is therefore not limited to the U.S., reinforcing its global relevance. Federal Reserve Compatibility and Standards Enforcement Finally, one document emphasizes the role of regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Reserve, in setting and enforcing standards for Ripple. The excerpt clearly states that messaging standards, such as those used by SWIFT, can be integrated into Ripple. This indicates that Ripple is built with compliance and interoperability in mind, allowing it to operate within the boundaries set by central regulatory institutions. The documentation highlighted by SMQKE provides concrete references to Ripple’s ability to work alongside and within existing financial systems such as NACHA, SWIFT , and the Federal Reserve. Rather than acting as a disruptive force that seeks to replace these institutions, Ripple is positioned as a complementary system capable of enhancing efficiency while remaining compatible with established regulatory frameworks. This perspective, backed by multiple citations from formal texts, reinforces Ripple’s potential role in the modernization of global payment systems.

45320746,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738264,1748675461,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45320746.jpeg,FTX begins its second payout round of $5 billion,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ftx-kicks-off-5b-payout-to-creditors/,"FTX has started its second distribution round of payments to its creditors. The exchange is set to pay more than $5 billion to holders in the Plan’s Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who met pre-distribution requirements. In a post on X on Friday, the FTX stated that creditors should begin seeing the funds reflected in their accounts within one to three business days. FTX revealed second round payout breakdown FTX previously announced that the second distribution would include a 72% payout for Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims, 54% for US Customer Entitlement Claims, and 61% each for General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims. Convenience Claims are set to receive a 120% payout. The exchange also stated that all eligible creditors will receive funds through its distribution service partners, Kraken and Bitgo. On Friday, John J. Ray III, Plan Administrator of the FTX Recovery Trust, commented on the rollout’s start, saying: “Today’s announcement represents continued progress returning cash to FTX’s customers and creditors. I am proud of the outstanding success of the recoveries to date. Our work continues on recovering more for creditors and resolving outstanding claims.” John J. Ray III On X, the exchange also asked customers to remain cautious of phishing emails and scam websites from channels that may appear to look like the FTX Customer Portal. Meanwhile, crypto investors and speculators are waiting for the impact of reimbursements, knowing how they could easily sway digital asset market prices if recipients sell or swap their funds on retail exchanges. In February, FTX completed its first round of repayments, distributing $1.2 billion to holders with claims under $50,000. At the time, Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, suggested that a significant portion of these funds might find their way back into the crypto markets. FTX payouts are based on 2022 crypto prices During its first round of payments, Julian Grigo, head of institutions and fintech at asset custody, argued that some creditors may have been dissatisfied. He claimed that while its reimbursements brought relief to some of its customers, there were still some concerns over the plan. He argued that most holders will only get a portion of their original holdings, and then again, they will only be repaid based on asset prices at the time of the exchange’s collapse. BTC-related repayments, especially, have troubled investors since they are calculated using November 2022 valuations, when it was only trading at around $20,000. Since then, the crypto asset has risen in value, currently trading between $90,000 and $112,000. The pricing differences have undoubtedly caused analysts to question fair value determination in bankruptcy proceedings. FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri and other creditors had previously filed a petition to have the exchange repay customers as per current market prices. However, the court ruled against the proposal, and Kavuri claims that, as a result, creditors received only 10%–25% of the current value of their crypto holdings. Earlier this year, Kavuri also called the people’s attention to multiple creditors in 163 countries who are ineligible to receive reimbursements. He stated that countries like Egypt, Pakistan, Greenland, Iran, Russia, and China have imposed restrictions on custodial exchanges Kraken and BitGo; hence, residents cannot claim distributions. He noted that China is the largest jurisdiction ineligible for FTX claim distributions, seeing that it makes up about 8% of the global customer base.

However, the whale still holds 497.5 billion PEPE tokens worth $6.41 million.

These are Shiba Inu (SHIB) with whispers of another potential 16,290% rally and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a rising altcoin challenging legacy tokens with aggressive growth momentum. Mutuum Finance is emerging as the best altcoin to invest in now, drawing eyes with its low entry point and high-return projections. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.4 million with over 11,500 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. As the market shifts and investors weigh what cryptocurrency to buy now, this matchup between legacy hype and fresh innovation may define which portfolios outperform in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Upside as Burn Rate and Community Fuel Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000014, with minimal downward action but resolute within the broader market consolidation context. Overall, all things considered, SHIB continues to gain speculative attention in spite of recent price stasis owing to its continuous burn programs, this week’s 41 million token burn among them, aimed at reducing circulating supply and enhancing scarcity. With long-term forecasts pointing to potential moves towards $0.0001, several analysts are forecasting over 600% returns are within reach in a healthy bull cycle. With SHIB building increasing utility via its Shibarium Layer-2 network and being well-supported by its community, it is a top pick among meme-based investments. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also attracting investor attention for its low-cap growth potential ahead of the next cycle. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built not to fall to the collapse risk of its algorithmic counterparts. This transparent and secure architecture, supported by open-source smart contracts and now formally attested through the completion of a Certik audit, guarantees healthy financial transactions. With the intersection of next-generation lending technology and robust infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is reshaping the future of decentralized finance. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.4 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,500 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. SHIB may offer explosive returns through speculation and burn mechanics, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings real DeFi innovation, strong utility, and audited security. With $9.4M raised, 11,500+ investors, and a presale price of $0.03 (set to rise by 16.67%), early buyers could see 100% gains by launch. Act now before the next price jump.

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum price of $19.30 with an average of $16.75. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $61.24 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $4.48 (+0.49%) Market Cap $7.08 Billion Trading Volume $200.27 Million Circulating Supply 1.58B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $4.61 24-hour Low $4.36 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.64% 50-Day SMA $4.25 14-Day RSI 48.32 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $4.78 Polkadot price analysis: DOT faces bearish domination around $4 Downtrend persists. DOT stays in a bearish pattern, with repeated tests of support and resistance levels showing continued seller control. Price pressure tightens resistance at $4.22, holds firm, while $3.91 is tested repeatedly, increasing the risk of a breakdown. Buyers’ weak recovery efforts have failed to regain momentum, leaving DOT near its session low and signaling hesitation to reverse the trend. Polkadot (DOT) is currently priced at $3.96, reflecting a 5.78% drop on May 31, 2025. The daily session opened with sharp declines, driven by increased selling pressure. The intraday low reached $3.91, while the high was capped at $4.22. The current price action signals a prevailing bearish sentiment with sellers dominating the market. DOT’s all-time high stands at $55.00 from November 4, 2021, and its all-time low is $2.69, set on August 20, 2020. This marks a steep 92.76% decline from its peak but a 47.86% rise from its historical low. Polkadot on 1-day chart: DOT has a persistent downtrend and bearish momentum DOT established a downtrend during the daily timeframe that persisted through May. The chart shows multiple failed attempts to break above $4.20, leading to further declines. The daily candlesticks exhibit strong bearish control, with long upper wicks and solid red bodies. Sellers are aggressively pushing prices lower, leaving limited room for recovery within the daily session. DOT/USDT Chart: 1-day Volume patterns indicate a substantial increase in sell-side activity, while the RSI trends toward oversold conditions. The MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, suggesting sustained downward momentum. If $3.91 breaks, DOT could slide further. However, if buyers manage to reclaim $4.22, a potential reversal may occur. Polkadot on 4-hour chart: DOT consolidation with strong resistance and weak support The 4-hour chart reveals a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows, confirming the bearish market structure. DOT’s resistance at $4.22 has held firm, preventing any upward move. Sellers have consistently rejected breakout attempts, with price levels returning toward support at $3.91. DOT/USDT Chart: 4-hour The RSI is below 30, indicating ongoing pressure. The MACD remains negative, with both lines diverging downward. If $3.91 is broken decisively, DOT could face deeper declines, with the next key support below. A breakout above $4.22 could signal an intraday reversal, but current momentum suggests this is unlikely without a shift in volume. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $4.62 BUY SMA 5 $4.93 SELL SMA 10 $4.78 SELL SMA 21 $4.47 BUY SMA 50 $4.13 BUY SMA 100 $4.42 BUY SMA 200 $4.9 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $4.35 BUY EMA 5 $4.17 BUY EMA 10 $4.07 BUY EMA 21 $4.13 BUY EMA 50 $4.44 BUY EMA 100 $4.95 SELL EMA 200 $5.4 SELL What to expect next? Polkadot’s (DOT) price remains under pressure as it consolidates between resistance at $4.22 and support at $3.91. If sellers continue to dominate and the $3.91 support breaks decisively, DOT may head lower toward the next key support, intensifying the bearish trend. However, a sudden reversal above $4.22 could shift sentiment, opening the way for a potential short-term recovery. The overall market mood for DOT appears bearish, with traders watching for either a breakdown or a rebound from these critical levels. Until a clear breakout occurs, consolidation with a downward bias is likely to persist. Is Polkadot a good investment? Currently, Polkadot (DOT) faces intense downward pressure, with technicals pointing to a prevailing bearish trend. Resistance at $4.22 and repeated testing of $3.91 support suggest limited upward momentum and heightened risk of further declines. The long-term potential of DOT depends on broader market recovery and the network’s continued development. However, the current price action and market structure indicate caution for new entries until an apparent reversal or strong support is confirmed. Traders should monitor key levels closely for signs of stabilization or further breakdown. Why is Polkadot down today Polkadot (DOT) is down 5.78% today, trading at $3.96, due to sustained selling pressure in the broader market and persistent bearish sentiment. The resistance at $4.22 has prevented any significant upward move, while repeated tests of the $3.91 support level have signaled market hesitation and vulnerability to further declines. Will Polkadot recover? Polkadot (DOT) shows signs of recovery with a recent upward trend. If favorable market conditions continue, we could see a bullish trend, and Polkadot has the potential to recover.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021.

In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space.

In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8.

This announcement follows a decision made earlier this year confirming that these tokens do not meet the legal definition of securities under U.S. law. Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasized that while meme coins are part of a vibrant crypto niche, they do not fall under the agency’s regulatory purview. Peirce made the statement during the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas , noting that investors in meme coins should not expect traditional protections from the SEC. SEC Takes a Hands-Off Approach — Similar to NFTs Peirce drew comparisons between the current surge in meme coin interest and the NFT boom of 2021. Like NFTs, meme coins often fall outside regulatory frameworks, meaning buyers are engaging with minimal oversight or recourse in the event of fraud or volatility. The meme coin segment has grown substantially, with a current market capitalization of over $62 billion and a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $10 billion. Top tokens in this category include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, $TRUMP, and Bonk. The $TRUMP Token: A Politically Charged Meme Coin Launched in January shortly before the presidential inauguration, the $TRUMP token surged to $44.28 before stabilizing around $10.71. Notably, around 80% of its token supply is reportedly controlled by the Trump Organization and its affiliates, raising concerns over potential conflicts of interest. Lawmakers such as Senator Richard Blumenthal have raised ethical questions about the Trump family potentially profiting from crypto projects while holding political influence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is the Crypto Market Down Today? , Regulatory Shift or Political Strategy? The SEC has also recently dropped its legal battle against Binance , a move many see as reflective of the current administration’s more crypto-friendly stance. While some speculate that these regulatory decisions may align with President Trump’s pro-crypto policies , Commissioner Peirce firmly denied any political motivation. “Our goal is to create a better regulatory environment for all participants,” she said . Peirce also defended the SEC’s decision to rescind Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which previously restricted banks from offering crypto custody services. Investor Takeaway: Proceed With Caution While the SEC’s clarification offers legal clarity, it simultaneously underscores the risk for retail investors. Without regulatory protection, meme coin investments remain highly speculative. As this space continues to grow and intertwine with political narratives, it is increasingly important for investors to conduct due diligence, verify token ownership structures, and consider the broader implications of their investment choices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

45321364,https://nulltx.com/?p=150090,1748676956,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Pump.fun Sends $25.7M in SOL to Kraken as Transaction Fee Revenue Surges,https://nulltx.com/pump-fun-sends-25-7m-in-sol-to-kraken-as-transaction-fee-revenue-surges/,"Pump.fun , a top platform in the Solana ecosystem for creating and trading meme tokens, has made the news again—but this time, it’s not about a new meme token. At 11:30 AM (UTC) yesterday, pump.fun moved a colossal 156,000 SOL (equivalent to $25.71 million) to the centralized exchange Kraken. This transaction represents almost three weeks’ worth of stale fee income. And it isn’t just another horn-blowing at what has to be regarded as an insane revenue-generating platform. This is more than a profit. The pump.fun team’s actions have serious implications for the Solana ecosystem and might lead to the latest token generation event on Solana. The platform’s revenue model, which charges fees on token launches and transactions, continues to rake in millions of dollars on a consistent basis. According to data from DeFiLlama, pump.fun has been averaging around $1.3 million per day in transaction fees. The timing of this recent transfer aligns closely with that daily figure over the past 19 days, pointing to a systematic off-ramping strategy employed by the platform to convert on-chain earnings into fiat or centralized holdings. Regular Transfers Suggest Systematic Revenue Strategy It is not the first time that pump.fun has made a move like this. On-chain data illustrates that the platform routinely accumulates transaction fees in SOL over a period of one to two weeks before transferring them out in bulk to Kraken. These withdrawals are part of a long-standing pattern — a well-oiled revenue engine quietly extracting value from one of the most speculative corners of the crypto market. According to reports, pump.fun has sold more than 4.025 million SOL over the past year. The total roughly amounts to $727 million. That volume has been liquidated at an average price of $180.70 per SOL, a not-so-obvious indication of what might be the first truly profitable crypto exchange. pump. fun 在半小时前将 15.6 万枚 SOL ($25.71M) 手续费收入转进 Kraken。 根据 defillama 上的数据，近期 pump. fun 每天的手续费收入在 $130 万左右。这跟他们本次隔了 19 天转出的 SOL 价值是比较吻合的。 pump. fun 每在积累了一到两周的手续费收入后就会将这些 SOL 转进… https://t.co/acS6GMtMrq pic.twitter.com/xsWvfhKqbV — 余烬 (@EmberCN) May 30, 2025 Most of our activity in crypto space happens on exchanges. So if you pay close attention to almost any crypto project or platform these days, you’ll notice they all say something like: “Watch us on exchanges!” Or, “Follow our price fluctuations on exchanges!” With this in mind, let’s try to understand the events of the last few days under an even_mi_meme umbrella. Meme Token Frenzy Fuels the Engine pump.fun has achieved current success due to the meme token frenzy, especially among those on the Solana blockchain. In recent months, there has been a wild uptick in the number of inexpensive, viral tokens being thrown around on Solana — many of which seem to be spun up within moments on platforms like pump.fun. Even if most of these tokens are bound to death spiral anyway, the sheer volume and transactional activity of them across the pump.fun ecosystem is generating huge fee income for the platform. What makes pump.fun unique is how straightforward its interface is and how large its user base is. Every new token that gets launched pays a fee, and every trade adds to the transaction fee pool — which the platform collects in SOL. With the hype around meme coins showing no sign of letting up, especially on Solana, pump.fun is perfectly positioned to capture more of this slice of the mania-fueled economy. The most recent $25.71 million payment to Kraken underscores the effect spinning into action here. More user speculation means more fees, and those fees lead directly to greater liquidity for pump.fun and its principals. What This Means for the Broader Solana Ecosystem Pump.fun consistently brings in a healthy income; this shows Solana is a healthy network. The mean transaction volume of pump.fun is a string of soloing on Solana; this means the pump.fun is confirming Solana’s claims of being a low-fee, fast-speed network. Some people suggest more and more that the meme coin activity is unsustainable, and that’s just a signal for the crypto whales to pull out. In fact, the raw numbers coming out of pump.fun suggest otherwise: They’re real, driving real volume, and they’re bringing in real dinero. Platform sends regular payments to Kraken; why? Periodic payments from the platform to Kraken raise more questions than they answer about pump.fun’s sustainability and long-term planning. Is the platform just a short-term liquidity extractor, or does it have some kind of long-term roadmap? So far, the team has kept largely mum on the question. No matter what happens from this point, pump.fun has made itself a potent presence in the current crypto world. As long as guesswork crypto trading remains alive and well — and as long as users are willing to pay for the privilege — pump.fun will likely continue to be one of the most minting-at-will entities in the DeFi space. For both watchers and merchants, the communication is evident: keep an eye on the fees. For in the midst of a speculative frenzy, pump.fun is almost assuredly right there at the peak, collecting its quiet, ancillary profits, and sending tens of millions in SOL out to Kraken.

Massive amounts of ETH have flowed out of exchanges, suggesting that a move into cold storage has taken place. Cold storage is when traders move their assets off exchanges and into hardware wallets, a storage solution that is much more secure than keeping crypto on an exchange. Ethereum appears to have very secure long-term holders. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Exchange Outflows Suggest Strategic Accumulation This week, Ethereum saw extremely large volumes of coins leaving centralized exchanges, which is an indicator that has usually foreshadowed an increase in the cryptocurrency’s price. When Ethereum and other altcoins are moving off exchanges in large amounts, it’s a net positive for their prices. Although Bitcoin has had a relatively stable price, Ethereum has performed significantly better and continued to do so over the same timeframe. This performance differential, along with net outflows, signals a change in sentiment. Investors seem to be moving into ETH as they anticipate major events that could catalyze the price. This sentiment has been intensified by recent spot inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds in the U.S. On May 29, those funds recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million. The funds, in fact, are riding a streak of nine consecutive days of positive net inflows. With these kinds of consistent inflows, Ethereum ETFs are a way for institutions and retail investors to access Ethereum in a regulated manner. And this kind of demand for something like an Ethereum ETF is a sign of growing accessibility for crypto. On May 29 (ET), U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net outflow of $359 million, ending a 10-day streak of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $91.93 million, marking a 9-day streak of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 30, 2025 Dormant ICO Whales Awaken: Massive ETH Movements Raise Eyebrows Together with the wider market, two Ethereum wallets from the time of the ICO have awakened from long dormancy and are now making huge transactions that have caught the eye of blockchain analysts. An early participant in the Ethereum ICO has an address tied to it and at one time held a mind-boggling 1 million ETH. Just five hours ago, this address moved 959.69 ETH to the OKX exchange. At current market valuations, the transferred amount is approximately worth $2.54 million. Despite this massive transaction, the address still retains a whopping 50,704 ETH on-chain, valued at around $132 million. 这次是两个 ICO 巨鲸一起发力了，成本都是低至 0.31 美金的大佬 1⃣ ETH ICO 100 万枚 $ETH 巨鲸 5 小时前向 #OKX 充值 959.69 ETH，价值 254 万美元；链上仍剩余 50704 ETH，价值 1.32 亿美元 https://t.co/JFVlWHNe7N 2⃣ 2015 年 ICO 10 万枚 $ETH 的 OG 3 小时前向 #Kraken 充值 587 ETH，价值… https://t.co/xOj0szBX2C pic.twitter.com/5Rh5zgUmVE — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) May 30, 2025 Not only is this address’s holding large, but it also has a significant historical context. According to blockchain records, this wallet acquired its ETH during the ICO at the astonishingly low price of around $0.31 per coin. Such moves made by early adopters can be interpreted in various ways — they may have been profit-taking or involve a kind of strategic reallocation. This week also saw news emerge about a second wallet, believed to be associated with a participant in the 2015 Ethereum ICO and currently holding around 100,000 ETH. Just three hours ago, this wallet transferred 587 ETH to Kraken, which, at the current market rate, equates to about $1.56 million. Since March 13, 2023, the same address has sold a total of 14,398 ETH, bringing in approximately $28.47 million at an average price of $1,977. This slow and almost laboriously drawn-out sell-off pattern indicates that if this address is indeed a whale, it’s presently exiting either the Ethereum or Web3 space, or diversifying its assets. Market Implications and the Road Ahead These synchronized actions create a many-sided depiction of Ethereum’s contemporary condition. On one side, institutional investors are embracing Ethereum with a swift-paced buying frenzy, as shown by the ETF inflow now stretching across nine consecutive days. On the other side, a handful of very old and very large Ethereum holders — some of which have been clutching their assets since the Ethereum ICO back in 2014 — are starting to sell off portions of their holdings after nearly a decade. Even with these substantial sales, ETH’s price has held strong, thanks to the collective confidence in the crypto market and because of the dwindling supply of liquid Ethereum resulting from the cold wallet migrations. If the current trend of outflows holds, Ethereum may see less of an obligation to sell and more of a platform for price increases. Ethereum 2.0 is in a progressive stage of its upgrades, layer 2 adoption is rising, and ETF inflows are on the upswing, putting Ethereum (ETH) in a robust position. Yet, even with all these positive developments, there is a group of investors who could still negatively impact Ethereum’s price in the near term. Those investors are the ICO whales. Ethereum is proving its relevance yet again as the crypto market heads into the second half of 2025. It’s not just a smart contract platform; it’s a maturing financial asset drawing interest from both long-term believers and institutional capital.

In the wake of this notable development, a pseudonymous crypto journalist, known as Jungle Inc on X, has highlighted what this means for XRP and its teeming holders. VivoPower’s XRP-Focused Strategy VivoPower has successfully raised a total of $121 million in funding to implement what it describes as a comprehensive XRP-focused treasury and infrastructure strategy. Of this total, $100 million originates from Prince Abdulaziz, making his participation the most significant component of the fundraising round. This marks the first time a public company has officially committed to building its treasury operations around XRP rather than more established digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Jungle Inc, VivoPower’s strategy includes allocating capital to directly purchase and hold XRP as a reserve asset . The company also plans to build new infrastructure on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , which will support a broader pivot toward decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. As part of its strategic shift, VivoPower is preparing to spin off certain legacy divisions to focus its operations exclusively on cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. Leadership and Strategic Appointments In a notable personnel move, Ripple veteran Adam Traidman has been appointed as advisory chairman to guide the company’s transformation. Traidman, who has experience in the XRP ecosystem, is expected to assist in VivoPower’s transition into a crypto-first corporate entity with a focus on XRPL-based applications. Institutional Implications and Market Perception Jungle Inc emphasized the broader implications of this initiative. He referred to the investment as a “royal-level endorsement” of XRP and stated that the development “proves XRP’s growing DeFi and treasury use case.” He also highlighted that this move could lead to increased institutional interest in XRP, similar to how MicroStrategy’s acquisition of Bitcoin catalyzed corporate interest in BTC during previous market cycles. The announcement presents a notable inflection point in XRP’s institutional narrative. Unlike other public companies that have thus far preferred Bitcoin or Ethereum for treasury allocation, VivoPower’s decision to center its capital strategy around XRP introduces a new precedent. The involvement of Prince Abdulaziz further distinguishes this investment by providing it with geopolitical and economic weight, particularly given Saudi Arabia’s broader interest in emerging financial technologies. Jungle Inc concluded by stating, “The XRP narrative just changed. Institutions are watching.” This statement reflects a growing perception among market observers that XRP may be entering a new phase of institutional relevance, driven by high-profile endorsements and a maturing use case within both treasury management and decentralized financial infrastructure.

45321466,https://nulltx.com/?p=150088,1748677157,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Virtuals Daily Recap: AI Agent Sector Sees Pullback as Virtuals Dips Post-Echo Rally,https://nulltx.com/virtuals-daily-recap-ai-agent-sector-sees-pullback-as-virtuals-dips-post-echo-rally/,"The AI Agent economy gave back a hefty portion of its recent gains in the last 24 hours, with valuations across the sector declining after a not-so-sustained spike in $VIRTUAL. Total market cap for the AI Agent sector? Now at $10.59 billion, which gets us to an -8.77% change on the day. We see an ecosystem pullback that really hit some of the core layer tokens pretty hard, and a good example of that is the Virtuals ecosystem. They saw their ecosystem market cap dip a little bit to $2.59 billion, and we got an -8.28% price decline in the $VIRTUAL token. Even though prices are cooling, investor attention and market activity, which are gauged by mindshare, remain high. Indeed, mindshare rose 2.25% to 38.83%. This suggests that while some short-term holders may be rotating out of major tokens like $VIRTUAL, the overall interest in the sector remains robust. Vigorous investor attention is likely to lead to more market activity in the not-so-distant future. Volatility Follows Echo Rally as $VIRTUAL Retreats $VIRTUAL has seen a drop in its value, only a few days removed from a powerful price increase. That rally was largely attributed to a massive uptick in user engagement and trading activity post-“Echo” update. The update had propelled $VIRTUAL up by nearly 40% earlier this week, pushing it into the realm of the ecosystem “VIRTUAL”. However, as in most instances when a huge upsurge in value occurs, a retracement is now following. On May 30, the price of $VIRTUAL corrected by -8.33%, landing at $2.1851. With profit-taking underway and speculative interest cycling into newer entrants, the recent decline appears more technical than fundamental. Virtuals’ overall market cap dropped by a similar percentage, reflecting synchronized movements across its sub-projects and partners. Yet, the platform holds one of the most robust positions in the AI agent economy. Its total sector share of mind is 38.83%, suggesting that traders and developers are continuing to pay it heed, even amidst a broader cooldown. In fact, the potential for a rebound seems high, considering that in this fast-moving, AI-infused Web3 landscape, sentiment often rotates in a matter of days. Mindshare and Momentum Shift Toward Rising Stars Although $VIRTUAL has stepped back, a number of smaller projects in the Virtuals ecosystem and the broader AI agent space are beginning to attract investor interest. Traders seem to be rotating into these newer or more nimble plays, in search of the higher beta opportunities that might give us the next leg up. MISATO (@Misato_virtuals), which jumped by +8.08%. Its focus on lightweight, autonomous decision-making for micro-agents seems to have caught the eye of traders looking for next-gen performance assets, and the market seems to be rewarding that with a nice bump in price. Next in line is TRISIG (@tri_sigma_), reaping +5.70%, and not far behind is POLY (@polytraderAI) at +5.15%. Both projects are building agent frameworks geared towards decentralized trading and finance. These are two sectors where AI is starting to make significant inroads. GRPH (@soulgra_ph) and SIREN (@genius_sirenai) likewise saw modest gains of +2.41% and +1.18%, respectively, indicating that a shift in momentum toward the kind of under-the-radar projects with which they are associated may be in play. And that is a shift with which investors in speculative projects might be more than pleased. Virtuals Daily Update | May 30th, 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/SxfKmbD79H — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 30, 2025 Capital moving into smaller capitalized projects is common following a sector surge. When major tokens such as $VIRTUAL begin a consolidation phase, high-risk opportunity investors often move to the next tier, seeking potential micro-cap projects and aiming to catch the next early breakout wave of the sector. Looking Ahead: Temporary Reset or the Start of Rotation? The present decline is in the question—is it a temporary dip following the exuberant advance or a developing scenario of prolonged underperformance for certain segments in the AI agent ecosystem? At the rate of innovation we are seeing, and with the consistent level of new project launches across the ecosystem, the answer may well be both. It seems likely that for the large-cap leaders like $VIRTUAL, a cooling-off period may be in store. At the same time, we may see emerging projects take up the narrative in the short term. The ongoing increase in mindshare indicates that attention isn’t departing from the sector but is instead reallocating within it. This seems more indicative of a healthy AI Agent market than an unhealthy one—especially with the not-so-recent memory of some big-name players leaving the space. The project is able to maintain relevance and doesn’t seem likely to disappear anytime soon. It retains a foundational pillar in the AI ecosystem. With its price decline, it isn’t able to pick up too much momentum, and it covers a lot with only a few mechanisms in play. As the migration of smart capital continues and showroom forays made by speculative money in the crypto sector seem not yet to have ended, one can only emphasize the need to maintain a wary watch on the ever-evolving AI-crypto intersection. It’s not too soon, and it may not be too late, to keep a finger on the pulse of AI-driven crypto. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45321499,https://nulltx.com/?p=150087,1748677257,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Bitcoin Dips 5% from Last Week’s High, But Strong On-Chain Support Near $100K Signals Potential Rebound",https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-dips-5-from-last-weeks-high-but-strong-on-chain-support-near-100k-signals-potential-rebound/,"Recently, Bitcoin has had a notable correction and has come down about 5% from last week’s peak. This pullback has put around 1.27 million Bitcoin addresses in the red; these holders are now underwater compared to their purchase price. Despite this short-term decline, on-chain data reveals a pretty amazing narrative of historic buying activity just below the $100,000 mark—suggesting that this level could serve as a potent support zone if Bitcoin visits it again in the not-too-distant future. Historic Buying and Strong Support at Key Psychological Level Bitcoin’s price has swung widely over the past few weeks, but significant demand has emerged near the $100,000 mark. Erik Vorhees, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur based in Puerto Rico, likens the situation to a game with two players. On one side are the sellers, who have managed to push the price below $100,000. On the other are the buyers, who keep snapping up Bitcoin anytime the price gets near this level. Important psychological benchmarks often exist in financial markets, serving as levels where many buyers and sellers seem to congregate. With respect to Bitcoin, the $100,000 price level has taken on huge amounts of attention, both as a price that buyers might be attracted to and as a price that some traders might be selling into. We could describe it as the price level with the most dual attraction, given that it is also a round number. This paragraph is essentially a translation of the previous one with slightly different wording. Why is the price level with the most dual attraction also a good candidate for a psychological price level? Because, as way too many commentators have also already pointed out, it’s a.k.a. a round number. Moreover, this latent support correlates with larger market demand patterns that have stayed strong during this cycle—even following Bitcoin’s former all-time highs. Demand for Bitcoin is now approaching the peak levels of the previous bull market. On average, about $1.8 billion in fresh capital flows into the market each day – roughly on par with the November 2021 high around $64K. The largest inflows of this cycle occurred at approximately… pic.twitter.com/XdfdUMaaKL — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 30, 2025 Investor Demand Mirrors Peak Levels of Previous Bull Market The total demand for Bitcoin is still extremely high, almost reaching the demand levels that we saw in the last bull market. Daily, Bitcoin sees fresh capital inflows of around $1.8 billion on average. This is about equivalent to what was happening in the 2021 bull run when we were trading at about $64,000. This cycle’s, from about $73,000 and $92,000 price levels, most huge capital came in. At $73,000, the market recorded its most substantial peak inflows of $3.6 billion, while at $92,000, the inflows grew to even more extreme $4.5 billion levels. Investors keep on channeling wah-wah wealth into Bitcoin, despite its steady diet of ups and downs in the price department. This trend shows that the market still has a good appetite for Bitcoin, and it proves that investors are still willing to put down large amounts of capital even after Bitcoin has set new all-time highs. This also seems to act as a validation of sorts for the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin, and more than anything, it shows that amidst the short-term price corrections, the commitment to Bitcoin seems to be as strong as ever. ETF Outflows Signal Temporary Profit-Taking Amid Overall Strength On May 29 (Eastern Time), the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net outflow of $359 million. This halted a 10-day streak of consistent net inflows into these potential investment vehicles. Bitcoin has slid ~5 % from last week’s peak, putting 1.27M addresses in the red. But on-chain data shows heavy historic buying just under $100 k, suggesting this key psychological level could act as strong support; and perhaps fuel the next leg up if revisited. pic.twitter.com/38eGCnr1Kl — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 ETFs commonly see outflows interpreted as temporary profit-taking. Who could blame them? ETF inflows had reached dizzying heights of over $700 billion per year, and they were used to finance not just the 2017-2018 bull run in cryptocurrency prices but also the 2018-2019 recovery. Withdrawals from ETFs might raise some concerns, since they are such reliable tools that support the price of cryptocurrencies, but those withdrawals are not necessarily a sign of a weakening market. This movement also reflects the broader dynamics of Bitcoin investment, where participants in the market regularly seek to optimize returns and create better-performing investable products. That this outflow happened after a long run of not just inflows but also net inflows into the Bitcoin space highlights that there really is ongoing interest in not just investing in Bitcoin itself but also ongoing engagement in Bitcoin-related financial products. ETH experienced unusually large exchange outflows this week while it outperformed Bitcoin; both signs that traders are buying and moving coins into cold wallets. pic.twitter.com/ce3C4Hwx3A — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) May 30, 2025 Looking Ahead: Resilience and Potential for Next Rally In general, the Bitcoin price decline of 5% appears to be a healthy correction rather than a dip that foretells sustained weakness. A review of buying in the dip from the historic lows under the $100,000 level reveals not only unrelenting support from retail investors but also strong participation from institutional investors. Should Bitcoin return to the crucial support zone near $100,000, the collection of buying demand there might serve as a launch mechanism, propelling fresh enthusiasm among investors and very possibly signaling the start of the next bull market. Over the next few weeks, investors and analysts will be keeping an eye on whether Bitcoin can maintain this critical level and push on toward new all-time highs or if it’s going to be shoveled by market forces into a prolonged period of consolidation. Currently, the on-chain data and inflow trends paint a mildly optimistic picture despite the recent volatility. They suggest that Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a reliable digital asset that attracts a great deal of global capital. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A single user lost $20,000 worth of BSC-USD (a stablecoin from the exchange Binance that is pegged to the U.S. dollar) in a double address poisoning attack. Data flagged by the scam alerting service Cyver show that this user was targeted not just once but twice in the span of a single hour. In each instance, they sent $10,000 to two different bad addresses—both of which were designed to look like the user’s real address. This episode highlights the enduring danger of address poisoning in decentralized systems. It serves as a clear reminder that even the most mundane crypto transactions can be perilous if sound verification practices are not followed. The Mechanics of Address Poisoning Address poisoning is a form of clever trickery that scammers use to carry out their schemes. They send worthless transactions from addresses that look very similar to the ones that a target has previously interacted with. The idea is to get the target to think they’ve been sent a transaction and, when they go to look at their transaction history, to get them to use a poisoned address in future transactions. If you know you haven’t sent a transaction to the address in your history, then somebody might be trying to scam you. The common user practice of using past transaction history to recycle wallet addresses is what this scam relies upon. It mimics the appearance of a legitimate address, usually by matching the first character and the last character of the address you would expect to see. It certainly doesn’t match the middle, which is the part of the address that actually matters, especially if we’re talking about using your eyes to tell the difference between a valid and a scam wallet. Knowing that we tend to trust the first and last characters, it would appear that scammy addresses follow the principle of a good magic trick. In this specific instance, the victim committed two expensive blunders. The first transaction was for $10,000 sent to a phony address. Just one hour later, the same victim sent another $10,000 to a different scammer, using the same hoax to get the money. This quick, double-dipping took place because the crooks were watching the victim’s wallet so closely they must have been salivating to go in for another hit after the first one worked so well. It also makes you wonder how many times the same scammer has done this with other not-so-smart victims. ALERT Today, our system detected 20K $BSC -USD lost due to address poisoning scams. A single victim was targeted twice by two different scammer addresses. First, victim mistakenly sent 10K $BSC -USD to a scammer. Just 1 hour later, victim sent another 10K $BSC -USD to a second… pic.twitter.com/OTU07UAyLK — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) May 30, 2025 BSC Ecosystem and Security Concerns Among the fastest and most used blockchain platforms in the world, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) boasts rapid transaction times and a nominal fee structure. Largely for these reasons, it has drawn the attention of bad actors holding malicious intentions. Address poisoning, a technique used by a number of blockchain bad actors, poses a very real threat to BSC users. BSC, like other Layer 1 chains, has a decentralized nature; that is, it is not controlled from a single place. Instead, it is run by numerous independent operators all over the world. This brings with it a familiar set of advantages and enables many of the functions of a blockchain. But it also brings some disadvantages—primarily, perhaps, that the end user is responsible for the custody of funds held in, and for the movement of funds to and from, BSC. Although detection systems and real-time alerts might be improved by platforms like Cyver and other firms specializing in blockchain security, these firms cannot stop a transaction from happening in the first place. They can only issue a warning after the fact or in real-time, if they’re really good, flag a suspicious pattern that just happens to be associated with the transaction in question. And in the realm of security, where a system can be only as good as its last update, alerts and warnings are not even a close second to prevention. Best Practices for Users: How to Stay Safe Losing $20,000 in BSC-USD to address poisoning is a recent, painful lesson, but one that offers takeaways for the wider crypto community. First and foremost: never copy wallet addresses directly from transaction history. Always use verified, manually saved addresses, or better yet, use wallet features that allow for whitelisting or address tagging. The second step is to turn on the anti-phishing tools and browser add-ons that look at the addresses you are trying to visit and let you know if they are not what they are supposed to be, like if they are really close to the name of a legit site but not quite right, or if they’re just plain old scammer sites. A lot of wallets and interfaces now have this functionality built in, but it’s up to you to use it and keep it updated. For the third point, verify that the addresses are correct down to each character before you dispatch any meaningful amount of cryptocurrency. A moment’s worth of carefulness could conserve thousands in not having to replace lost funds. Finally, keep yourself updated. Crypto develops quickly, and so do the schemes of bad actors. Following alert services like Cyver, reading up on the latest scams, and keeping an overall suspicious disposition are musts for safely navigating the crypto world. The ecosystem keeps on growing and maturing, and so must the behavior and protective practices of its users. Today’s incident is yet another reminder that in the decentralized world, security is not just a feature—it is a personal responsibility. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It was an imaginative allocation that never got any traction, largely because the financial technology needed to make it work simply didn’t exist. Fast forward to 2025, and Coinbase is resurrecting the dormant standard with x402, a “crypto-native” payments protocol that’s supposed to allow for instant, automatic transactions across the web. x402 signifies a big shift from the web payment systems of today. Those systems depend on platforms. Visa, Stripe, and PayPal are among the platforms we use to make payments on the web. They are not the only platforms we use; in fact, we use many centralized platforms to make payments on the web. x402 is not a centralized platform. It does not attempt to replace our centralized platforms with just another platform. To these ends, x402 is also something else: it is largely payment-agnostic. A Protocol for the Internet of Value At its heart, x402 allows websites, APIs, and applications to directly ask for and receive payments in cryptocurrency through the HTTP protocol. It’s not necessary to use plugins, middleware, or third-party integrations. Now, you can have direct interactions through simple web requests with stablecoins like USDC. x402 fufills a vision of web architecture that is decentralized, open, and extensible. The modern internet is about lightning-fast communications and interactions among people, devices, and systems. Three are the demands that need to be met: 1. Costs of transaction must be near zero. 2. The speed of finality must be in the neighborhood of 200 milliseconds (a little faster, a little slower, take my word for it, and I’m the one saying this). 3. The throughput must scale beyond 100,000 transactions per second (you have to love those peak moments when a lot is going on all at once). x402 takes care of business on meeting those demands. 1/ The internet reserved HTTP 402 for payments over 30 years ago, then forgot about it. Now, @coinbase is reviving it with x402, a protocol that lets websites and APIs accept crypto payments (like USDC) natively over HTTP. pic.twitter.com/S32a2ri7wI — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) May 29, 2025 This method makes way for a new manner of online interaction: independent transactions between machines. It may soon be possible for AI agents, for instance, to pay for access to APIs in real-time and without human intervention. Or for a smart contract to pay an invoice at the moment the service it governs is rendered. Or for some app coordinating cloud resources to pay in microtransactions. But these aren’t magic uses to which x402 can be put, because it reimagines payments themselves as an internet-native primitive. Traditional Giants Are Fighting Back Although x402 presents a radically open method for handling digital payments, the traditional giants of the payment industry are not lying low. They are, of course, trying to remain relevant in a swiftly changing landscape. For example, this past week, Visa introduced artificial intelligence agents for link to its payment network. And as for Stripe, it claims to have adopted AI for front-line fraud detection and prevention. It too is trying to process an evidently crypto-involved future and has issued stablecoin-related communications that sound a lot like PayPal’s. Why? Because PayPal has, for some time now, been issuing rewards for the holders of its stablecoin, PYUSD. Even though these developments represent a change in direction, traditional platforms still are, at their cores, closed systems. They are platform-first, built on central control, proprietary infrastructure, and human-centric workflows. x402, in contrast, offers an open, permissionless protocol that can be embedded directly into the logic of apps, APIs, and services. Indeed, it can even be embedded into the apps of traditional platforms. Throughout this book, we will argue that using an open, permissionless protocol—whether it be x402 or any number of other such protocols—always results in better, app-centered, user-focused outcomes. This rising rift mirrors the wider digital economy—between old institutions making piecemeal changes and new protocols attempting to rethink the web from the bottom up. The Promise and Risks of Agentic Payments As AI technology grows and takes on more responsibilities, the concept of agentic payments—transactions started and completed by AI agents or applications—shifts from being a speculative concept to a practical occurrence. x402 is designed for this scenario, where machines are not only reading and writing data but also directly exchanging value over the web. The significance of these implications is hard to overstate. They suggest that AI agents could eventually take over some pretty meaty tasks currently performed by humans—tasks like managing subscriptions to digital services, purchasing those services, allocating resources among the many cloud platforms that exist today, and even negotiating and settling the contracts that bind all those services together. However, the freedom this technology promises is not without risks. It raises big questions about key custody, authorization, and abuse mitigation. If an AI agent makes an unauthorized payment, for instance, or if malicious bots exploit machine-native payment systems, who is responsible? This is something the developers and regulators of the technology will have to address—preferably before something goes badly wrong. Even with these obstacles, x402’s momentum indicates that a new kind of Internet economy, where web-native payments intermingle with data and content, is emerging. The fact that Coinbase raised the 402’s profile may say more about the economy’s potential than just that it was an endeavor to, as one might say, Web 2.0, raise the profile of an unfashionable number.

At the heart of this explosive growth is increasing institutional investment in Bitcoin, which continues to act as the touchstone for market sentiment. But this time, the vitality is not confined to Bitcoin alone. A closer look reveals a broad-based expansion taking place across decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto credit markets, and the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This complex surge indicates that the present bull cycle is structurally different from previous ones. Pursuant both to not just the ecosystem’s but also the segment’s growing maturity and to a presage of regulatory clarity, the current bull cycle seems well and truly different and—lacking any sign of a speculative mania—much more sustainable. DeFi Eyes Historic Highs as Institutions Return Perhaps the most impressive development is the way in which institutional capital has re-emerged in decentralized finance (DeFi). The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has bounced back to approximately $178 billion, which is close to where it had been at the top of the previous cycle. Ethereum is still the clear leader, holding more than half of that TVL. This is due in large part to Ethereum’s powerful configuration of decentralized apps and Layer 2 solutions that allow it to scale. 1/ The global crypto market cap has climbed above $3.5 trillion, driven largely by mounting institutional demand for Bitcoin.

The protocol’s strength lies in its steady and multifaceted growth across several blockchains, akin to that of a blue-chip DeFi project. Both professional institutions and retail users have favored using Aave because they can count on it to serve as a secure, scalable, and always-available solution. This resurgence has reopened speculation about a possible “DeFi summer” comparable to the one in 2020. Nonetheless, numerous analysts contend that the current excitement is now rooted in something more concrete—in real, fundamental growth. For one, they insist that the protocols themselves have matured to a point where we can now actually use them without pulling our hair out in frustration. For another, they note that the security practices of those using DeFi have improved. And finally, they point out that institutions now approach DeFi with a clearer sense of the frameworks they want to operate under and the risk management strategies they’re comfortable with. Crypto Credit Makes a Comeback A main indicator of the crypto market’s evolution is the revival of lending and credit markets. After the savage deleveraging and widespread defaults that afflicted CeFi and DeFi lending platforms from the middle of 2022 onward, the sector has made a strong rebound. By the end of Q4 2023, the Cerulli report indicated that the combined loan books of both CeFi and DeFi platforms had reached an estimated $30 billion, with a range of performance metrics suggesting that overall credit quality has improved significantly. That does not yet mean that defaults are nonexistent. Lending in the crypto space, however, seems to be healthy. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been making strides in moving a part of the traditional finance world on-chain. One part of traditional finance that is now partly on-chain is credit provision. Over the past year, DeFi’s share of this credit activity has been growing, thanks in part to the return of institutional borrowers and lenders. DeFi credit provision, as offered by platforms like AAVE, has in many, if not most, respects proven to be a straightforward, transparent, and much more sensible on-chain alternative to the opaqueness of off-chain credit provision by banking institutions. The health of crypto credit is a key indicator for the whole ecosystem. When capital moves freely and credit conditions are stable, innovation and liquidity are usually not far behind. Most of us see the reemergence of this segment as a major catalyst for growth across the entire market in 2024. Stablecoins Emerge as the Year’s Breakout Use Case While Bitcoin and DeFi have stolen the spotlight, the real star of 2024 may well be the stablecoin market. With a nearly combined capitalization of $250 billion—up an incredible 56% from just $160 billion a year ago—the stablecoin market is crypto’s silent revolution. This growth is largely being pushed by new players coming in from traditional finance. Stablecoins put out by large financial institutions—like Société Générale’s EURCV, PayPal’s PYUSD, JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, and the rumored Bank of America dollar token—are really starting to gain traction. These are bank-grade digital assets. And they are not only causing the retail and DeFi payments perception of stablecoins to evolve; they are starting to be seen as something that can underpin a global-scale financial infrastructure and not just retail payments. As use of stablecoins increases, regulation is emerging. The U.S. is preparing to issue federal legislation governing stablecoins—codenamed GENIUS/STABLE. This will occur alongside a follow-up to the FIT 21 framework recently passed in Congress. We expect SEC and CFTC guidance to also be in the mix—potentially clarifying things like bank custody of digital assets. A lot of this will shake out by 2027. To sum up, the latest climb of the crypto market is being driven by more than just a surface amount of speculative energy. What’s really going on is the much more substantial and serious transition of the crypto world toward dependable, institutional-grade financial vehicles and processes, from credit markets to the kinds of efficient personal transfer systems that stablecoins offer to the average consumer. It seems fair to say that the crypto market isn’t what it used to be. And what’s more, it seems likely that the kind of price ascent we saw during Bitcoin’s maturity period is also a thing of the past. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45321701,https://nulltx.com/?p=150083,1748677668,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,DeFi Roars Back to Life: TVL Soars Past $178 Billion as Market Eyes a New Season,https://nulltx.com/defi-roars-back-to-life-tvl-soars-past-178-billion-as-market-eyes-a-new-season/,"For several months, the decentralized finance movement within the crypto ecosystem seemed to be winding down. While its core group of developers continued to build, only a handful of projects maintained any sort of visibility. For most members of the crypto community, the sentiment seemed to be that DeFi was in hibernation, waiting for the winter of crypto’s current bear market to pass. But now, discussions on social media and within the crypto industry around DeFi are picking up again. Even though the crypto space has recently been filled with memecoins, Bitcoin ETFs, and Layer 2 scaling developments, a return to DeFi fundamentals marks a crucial change in our space. This recent uprising is being driven not only by higher asset prices but also by greater user engagement, improved protocol performance, and interest from institutional players. Ethereum Reclaims the DeFi Crown Even with new Layer 1 blockchains and Layer 2 networks popping up, Ethereum remains the reigning champ of DeFi. It now has well over 50% of all the assets locked in smart contracts across the entire DeFi space. The DeFi application of Ethereum attracts much development and usage. The liquidity and confidence in DeFi on Ethereum are coming back. From the looks of it, the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, which is built and interacts mostly with the Layer 1 base layer of Ethereum, is looking much healthier with a rapid upswing in total value locked which seems to be hinting at bringing back some liquidity to the core financial-grade decentralized applications that use the base Ethereum Layer 1. Ethereum continues to face significant ongoing challenges. These include its still high gas fees and a capacity-stretched main chain, which together make it hard for some types of Ethereum projects to get off the ground. But with the payoff from its long-planned transition to proof of stake now in hand, Ethereum has opportunity to work through those challenges. AAVE and Lido Lead the DeFi Protocol Rankings Among distinct protocols, AAVE shines as the leading light in many ways, with an incredible $25.41 billion locked up in its lending markets across the chains. Of course, many folks know AAVE. It operates under a decentralized governance model, supports a wide variety of assets, and is present in many chains. Its relevance and resonance in this ecosystem are testaments to its user-centric design. Beyond the governance and asset support, though, the platform has captured attention in a good many ways. DeFi is gaining serious momentum again. Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to $178.52 billion, signaling a strong resurgence in decentralized finance activity. Ethereum remains the dominant force, accounting for more than half of all TVL. Among individual protocols, AAVE… pic.twitter.com/e6Kp8JVM6e — OLOBA THE ARTIST (@IamOloba_) May 30, 2025 AAVE is closely followed by Lido, which has a value locked of $24.57 billion. Lido is a liquid staking solution that works quite well and has built significant momentum. It allows users to stake Ethereum (as well as a handful of other assets) while keeping their assets liquid with derivative tokens. This model has gained considerable popularity as Ethereum transitions to proof-of-Stake, allowing way more users than previously access to Ethereum staking rewards while also letting them do stuff with their assets. Alongside AAVE, Lido has emerged as a key anchor within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Together, they exemplify two critical, closely intertwined, and almost universally needed building blocks of DeFi: permissionless lending (AAVE) and permissionless staking (Lido). They are quietly serving up a potent combination of services that is boosting DeFi to that next level of confidence and making the space seem even more solid than before. Is a New DeFi Season on the Horizon? Once again, DeFi’s total value locked is climbing toward historic highs, and with it, speculation is building around the possibility of a new DeFi season. Observers of the market are noting not only the influx of capital but also the increased stability and maturity of many top protocols compared to previous boom cycles. The most recent DeFi season brought us new experiments, great yields, and lots of hacks. Today, leading DeFi protocols make clearer promises about what users can expect. They emphasize something that should come as no surprise in the wake of last season’s breaches: safety. DeFi’s path to safety is more grounded in traditional finance, with protocols now promising comprehensive auditing and stronger governance. They may be using institutional capital to get there. This momentum might bring us a full-blown DeFi revival; it’s not yet certain. But the signs are strong. As protocols get better, ecosystems evolve, and user experience becomes more seamless, decentralized finance seems set for another significant expansion. One thing is certain: traction is returning to DeFi, and with close to $180 billion in the system, all is primed for the next installment of the tale that this is a decentralized financial world.

According to reports, over 4.9 billion shareholders voted against the move, with about 8.9 million shares absent, and over 205 million non-votes. The move makes Meta Platforms the latest big tech firm to consider a shareholder push to add Bitcoin to its treasury following the previous push by Microsoft some months ago. However, just like this move, it ended in disappointment after shareholders voted to reject the proposal citing concerns about volatility. According to reports, the company said it was prioritizing a push into artificial intelligence over cryptocurrency investments. The Meta Bitcoin treasury proposal was submitted by investor Ethan Peck, who stands as a representative of the National Center for Public Research (NCPPR), asking the company to look into the likelihood of converting some of its cash and bond holdings into Bitcoin to preserve shareholder value better. At the time, the proposal gained noticeable attention, with Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor publicly drumming support for the initiative. Meta shareholders vote down Bitcoin adoption push According to filings, Meta, as of September 30, 2024, had about $72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which the proposal claimed the values were being eroded by inflation and low returns. The move presents Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and strong trading pattern compared to bonds, as a reliable store of value in the long term. Meta Platforms Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Proposal pic.twitter.com/ZeIrUHq2OK — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixNewsIO) May 30, 2025 According to the filing, there has also been an increased push in institutional Bitcoin adoption, mentioning Strategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions, BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation, and speculations about potential US federal and state-level Bitcoin reserves in 2025. It also mentioned that Meta’s leadership had been showing interest in the asset, though via informal means, highlighting that its CEO Mark Zuckerberg had named his goats “Bitcoin” and “Max”. However, the board of directors was against the push, calling it unnecessary. In their response, the Meta board mentioned that the company already had a robust management practice in place, noting that it prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity to support its operations. The board also added that the company usually evaluates these broad ranges of investable assets and upon their recent evaluation, there was no need for a separate assessment focused on Bitcoin. Gravitation towards stablecoins and AI on the agenda According to a recent statement, the board explained its decision to ignore the buzz of digital assets. “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury,” Meta’s board of directors noted in a statement. While the company may not be eyeing Bitcoin in the short term, there won’t be any surprises if it decides to shift focus in the future. This is because there has been a considerable number of firms that have made the shift in the past, including Strategy. In addition, there is also a rising trend of industry players making Bitcoin-focused investments over the last few months due to the now relaxed regulations in the United States. Also, there are reports that Meta may be looking into stablecoins in the time being, with the company also choosing to focus on its ongoing push into artificial intelligence . According to Forbes, Meta has explored integrating stablecoins into its platforms to facilitate global payouts, holding discussions with crypto infrastructure firms to that effect. The move marks a re-entry into the crypto space for the company after its exit from the industry some years back following a regulatory setback with its Diem project. The initial effort was looking into the use of stablecoins for cross-border payments, with the firm hoping to provide a cheaper and faster alternative to the traditional system.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1?

Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.16285180 -7.10% Market Cap. $ 6,878,821,145.3133 Trading Volume. $ 221,124,094.2324 Circulating Supply. 0.00 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 The external factors, like Trump’s tariff threat , have pushed the HBAR price into a consistent decline and have recently taken a strong rejection from the 200-day EMA band . Since mid-May, the HBAR crypto has shattered nearly 30%, coming from $0.233 to $0.162. Adding more fuel to the fire, the intraday sell pressure of 10% has broken the previous swing low of $0.170. On the daily chart, it is aiming for a decline towards retesting its critical support of $0.139, which also aligns with Q4 2024 momentum-based high volume profile level. This high volume profile showed strength in Q2 2025’s April month, where a recovery of over 80% from $0.125 to $0.228 was observed. This time, HABR approaching this level is critical, as it has become a “make or break level. If bullish forces step in again as seen last month, then a rally could spark, then there is a higher chance for its price to clear $0.401, and reach $0.750 by the 2025 year-end. But if the support has been weakened from a previous retest, then its break would be fearsome, which could even push HBAR price to the $0.072 level in a fast-paced momentum, as displayed in Q4 when bulls were in command. Unlike its price action, the internal fundamental factors are on the optimistic side. Its efforts have been reflected in significant progress in its ecosystem. In 2025, it introduced the first Hedera-native hardware wallet, Citadel, and AI-powered Hedera Agent Kit, allowing users to create tokens, reducing technical barriers. Another strong project is set to launch in Q3 2025, named HashSphere, a private, permissioned blockchain for highly regulated industries like payment providers and asset managers. To facilitate secure, low-cost cross-border transactions with stablecoins while ensuring regulatory compliance. Even in order to streamline their work, on May 15, 2025, Hedera rebranded, renaming the HBAR Foundation to the “Hedera Foundation” and the Hedera Governing Council to the “Hedera Council.” Overall, the internal factors suggest that optimism is not so shallow, right now, and we can see some big moves in 2025, if all things are aligned well. But, still, the external factors highlight great caution for market participants.

This latest distribution , which started on May 30, targets claimants in both the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes who have successfully completed all pre-distribution requirements. According to a May 28 announcement, the payout covers various categories of claims. Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims will receive a 72% reimbursement, while U.S. Customer Entitlement Claims are set to receive 54%. Those holding Convenience Claims are being paid 120% of their entitled value, reflecting their priority in the distribution process. Meanwhile, General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims are slated to receive a 61% distribution. Recipients should expect to see the funds in their accounts within one to two business days via the official partners, Kraken and BitGo . Crypto Markets Watch Closely for Liquidity Impact Market analysts and crypto traders are watching the reimbursements closely due to their potential impact on digital asset prices. The release of billions of dollars back into the hands of retail and institutional investors could introduce short-term volatility, particularly if large sums are sold or exchanged for other assets on public platforms. This round of repayments follows the initial February 18 distribution, in which $1.2 billion was sent to creditors with claims under $50,000 . At the time, Bitget Wallet COO Alvin Kan noted that a significant share of those funds might find their way back into crypto markets, either as reinvestment or liquidity provision. Critics Continue to Question Fairness of FTX Payout Structure Despite the substantial funds being returned, the reimbursement process has not been without controversy. A key concern lies in the court ruling that determined payouts would be based on the value of assets at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy petition, rather than their current market prices. FTX creditor and vocal critic Sunil Kavuri highlighted that many creditors only received 10% to 25% of the current value of their crypto holdings due to the low market prices during the petition date. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $16,000—a fraction of its current value. Kavuri also raised alarm earlier this year over the exclusion of users in 163 countries , including Pakistan, Russia, Iran, and Greenland, who are ineligible to receive reimbursement under the current plan. As the FTX Recovery Trust continues its efforts , the broader crypto community remains divided on whether justice has truly been served.

Among the best cheap crypto to buy now, Dogecoin (DOGE), TRON (TRX), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out as three promising coins, each offering unique fundamentals and bullish setups. DOGE remains a cultural force backed by strong community support and growing utility. TRX continues to lead in transaction volume across DeFi, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, a new crypto coin still in presale, is gaining momentum as a high-upside play for the next cycle. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). For those wondering what crypto to buy now or seeking the next big cryptocurrency, these sub-$0.50 gems offer real potential before the bull run takes full flight. DOGE and TRX: Affordable Altcoins Poised for Growth in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) is around $0.2051 being highly resistant despite the volatility in the market. Experts believe DOGE can reach as high as $0.37 in June driven by fan sentiment and potential ETF releases. TRON (TRX) is approximately $0.27 registering consistent growth. Forecasts say that TRX could reach $0.275 by the end of 2025 driven by its expanding DeFi system and increasing adoption. Both TRX and DOGE rank among the best cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in at present, with immense scope for investors seeking affordable entry points. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining popularity as potential future high-growth prospects in the cryptocurrency market. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those buying now will see a 16.67% profit when the next price phase starts. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. MUTM’s periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stablecoin Secures Future with Completed Certik Audit A new USD-pegged stablecoin running on the Ethereum chain is soon being launched by Mutuum Finance. The advantage of MUTM stablecoin being pegged to the dollar is that it stops the kind of collapse seen in algorithmic stablecoins. Using recently audited and confirmed smart contracts by Certik, Mutuum Finance can be trusted by all users and investors. Thanks to its special buy-and-distribute approach and an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM joins innovation, safety and trust among its members. Early investment gives daring traders a chance to join the project in its very initial days. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly rising to leadership among sub-$0.50 altcoins, and it has secured $9.7 million from 11,500+ investors. At a current price of $0.03 and an upcoming launch price of $0.06 in the next few weeks, early investors can reach for 100% gains. Backed by a Certik audited contract, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a new Buy-and-Distribute mechanism, MUTM offers innovation with long-term upside. While DOGE and TRX prepare for the next bull run, MUTM is a high-upside play to watch out for presale today.

But with more traders jumping in, especially through meme coins, the system gets overloaded fast. High gas fees, slow transactions, and risky trades can block Ethereum’s full potential. That is why projects like Pepeto matter. They do not just follow Ethereum’s rise , they make it easier for that rise to continue. PepetoSwap brings calm to the chaos of meme trading The meme coin space is full of hype, but also full of risk. Rug pulls and scam tokens flood basic swap tools, costing users money and trust.

While headlines focus on the lucky break, the broader market is digesting something more strategic—the underlying shift toward utility-driven projects with active ecosystems. As speculation dies down, names like Qubetics , Bitcoin Cash, and Tron are resurfacing as the top cryptos to hold for short term due to their unique positions in payments, smart contract utility, and developer tooling. Unlike overbought meme coins or stagnant layer-1 tokens, Qubetics is building a full-stack developer and application framework with multichain reach. Bitcoin Cash is gaining traction with increased whale interest and a strong technical pattern. Tron, meanwhile, is fast becoming the backbone of global stablecoin payments, according to newly released metrics. Whether for developers, power users, or ecosystem participants, these three names are shaping up as some of the top cryptos to hold for short term, and the data supports it. Qubetics Offers Real Utility With Developer-First Tools Not every token builds its name on hype—Qubetics has anchored its roadmap on something far more durable: usability. The platform’s key innovation lies in QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE, tools designed to simplify smart contract development across multiple chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Avalanche. This isn’t just a tech stack—it’s a structured approach to onboarding developers, enabling no-code and low-code deployment in real-world environments. Think of a small business wanting to tokenize event tickets on Ethereum while running loyalty rewards on Solana. Under current tools, they’d need separate dev teams and protocols. With Qubetics, they can use QubeQode’s drag-and-drop interface to design, test, and deploy those functions—all under one dashboard. Qubetics IDE complements this by offering preconfigured environments, GitHub-integrated workflows, and template libraries that speed up project delivery by weeks. As ecosystem adoption rises, projects that reduce development friction become critical. Qubetics bridges the fragmented world of dApp development and deployment, and that’s why it’s considered one of the top cryptos to hold for short term—especially as Web3 moves toward application-layer demand. Qubetics Presale Heats Up as ROI Potential Climbs The Qubetics crypto presale is already making waves. Currently in Stage 36, $TICS is priced at $0.3064. Over 514 million tokens have been sold, with more than 27,300 wallets already participating. The presale has raised over $17.5 million, and the clock is ticking—each stage lasts only 7 days, and the price jumps 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. Now here’s where things get compelling. If $TICS hits $1 post-presale, early buyers are looking at 226.32% ROI. At $5, that rockets to 1,531.58%, while $10 hits 3,163.16%, and $15 tops it off at 4,794.74%. Even a modest $100 allocation could turn into $1,531 at $5 and $4,794 at $15. As the Qubetics mainnet gears up for its Q2 2025 launch, the potential is becoming harder to ignore. Structured pricing, finite timelines, and aggressive tech rollout make the Qubetics presale stand out as the best crypto pre sale in today’s market. And in the short term, the token’s momentum and stage-based urgency place Qubetics firmly among the top cryptos to hold for short term. Bitcoin Cash Shows Whale Momentum and Breakout Structure According to Binance Square, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading in a pattern that technical analysts describe as a symmetrical triangle, a setup typically associated with a strong breakout potential. The asset recently saw increased buying volume that pushed it above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating bullish momentum in the short term. More notably, BCH has been attracting the attention of large-scale participants. Whale wallet activity has risen, signaling accumulation at current levels, and social metrics around BCH have surged. Analysts are pointing to possible price targets in the $280–$300 range, contingent on volume follow-through and continuation of the current chart pattern. The symmetry in recent consolidation also supports the possibility of a measured upward move. With liquidity returning to the market and altcoins rotating into attention, Bitcoin Cash’s breakout structure and whale-backed support give it strong candidacy as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term—especially for those looking at legacy coins with renewed life. Tron and Tether Dominate Stablecoin Payments, Says Survey As per CoinDesk, Tron (TRX) is now home to over 50% of all stablecoin transactions, primarily driven by Tether (USDT) volumes. The newly released survey shows that $53 billion in USDT payments were settled on Tron in April 2025 alone—outpacing all other chains combined, including Ethereum. This dominance isn’t by accident. Tron has actively positioned itself as a low-cost, high-speed blockchain for financial settlement, especially in regions where stablecoins are a viable alternative to banking. The platform’s cost efficiency and integration with payment providers have allowed it to scale quickly in Latin America, Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe. In an industry where real-world usage often lags behind speculation, Tron’s dominance in stablecoin transaction volume speaks volumes. As the stablecoin narrative intensifies—especially with CBDC rollouts and regulatory clarity improving—Tron remains a core asset on the list of the top cryptos to hold for short term. Infrastructure, Usage, and Momentum: The Winning Short-Term Trio Crypto narratives are shifting. Memecoins and unsustainable APYs are losing steam, replaced by adoption-focused frameworks, cross-chain efficiency, and macro integration. Qubetics, with its robust IDE and developer ecosystem, targets the root of Web3 expansion: simplified deployment. Bitcoin Cash brings a high-probability technical pattern to the table, supported by whale accumulation and growing volume. And Tron, dominating stablecoin transactions at a global level, is the clearest signal of real-world utility meeting blockchain at scale. Each of these projects fits neatly into a strategy of short-term accumulation with medium-term potential. For community members seeking entries below peak pricing but above vaporware risk, Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Tron are currently ranked among the top cryptos to hold for short term. And when it comes to the best crypto presale with structured price increases, time-sensitive rewards, and true developer traction, Qubetics presale continues to stand out above the noise. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What’s the best crypto to hold for short term gains right now? Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Tron are currently seen as the most strategic short-term options based on news, volume, and adoption. How much can early participants earn from the Qubetics presale? A $100 entry could return over $4,794 if $TICS reaches $15 post-mainnet launch, based on current stage pricing and ROI estimates. Why is Tron dominating the stablecoin market? Tron processed $53 billion in Tether transactions in April 2025, thanks to low fees and global adoption for stablecoin-based payments.

Reaching this target would require a 99,900% climb, and while many see this as unrealistic, XRP Dragon’s statement draws on the asset’s historical rise to its all-time high in 2017/2018 and expectations that it can repeat that performance. A notable aspect of this belief in the asset’s potential is the contrast between the speculative nature of its earlier rally and the current push toward real-world adoption and utility. In 2017, XRP reached its all-time high largely on investor speculation amid a broader crypto market boom. Today, however, Ripple has expanded its partnerships , strengthened its payment infrastructure, and weathered prolonged regulatory battles. If it could perform so well with speculation alone, these factors could help it replicate or even outperform its previous rally . If $XRP went from $0.003 to $3.31 before… who’s to say $3 to $3,000 is impossible?” #XRP pic.twitter.com/pcR0mU73UP — XRP DRAGON (@DRAGON_XRP66) May 29, 2025 Community Reactions XRP Dragon’s statement has prompted a wide range of reactions from the community. One user acknowledged the historical price increase but pointed out that the asset’s early pricing, particularly around $0.003, occurred during the “initial-cap phase” when liquidity was extremely limited. According to this perspective, the more meaningful growth period began around the $0.02–$0.03 range, and the move to $3 from there was already a 100x gain. Applying the same magnitude of growth from $3 would suggest a target closer to $300 rather than $3,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Others noted that broader market conditions today differ significantly from 2017. Increased competition from other blockchain projects, market saturation, and ongoing regulatory risks are seen as potential constraints on the cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory. One commenter noted that without “unprecedented global adoption,” such a leap in value would be “extremely unlikely.” Utility as a Catalyst for Long-Term Growth XRP Dragon is convinced that XRP’s future price movement will mirror its past and reach new heights as a result. However, unlike the speculative-driven surge in 2017, future appreciation could be driven by large-scale XRP adoption and a more favorable regulatory environment. Some experts have predicted that becoming a bridge for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could send XRP as high as $10,000 . Widespread use could contribute to this potential growth. While many in the community continue to debate the plausibility of a 99,900% price surge, the discussion highlights a critical shift in focus from speculation to utility. As utility grows, the asset’s price will reflect this shift. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a press release issued by the central bank, it stated that its earlier warnings about the assets were mainly a precautionary measure. Over the last few years, the State Bank of Pakistan has issued an advisory, directing banks, micro-finance institutions, development finance institutions (DFIs), electronic money institutions (EMIs), and other financial service providers to refrain from dealing in virtual assets. However, it has now clarified that the directive was never an outright ban on dealing or using the assets, but a measure to slow the negative impacts on residents of the country. Pakistan central bank clarifies stance on digital assets According to a statement from the bank, the advisory was to protect the financial institutions and their users. “The advisory was issued solely to protect our regulated entities and their customers, not because VAs were declared illegal,” the central bank stated. However, the SBP said that establishing a formal framework will provide the much-needed clarity to the legal status of digital assets in the country, while also ensuring that investors are protected and consumer safeguards are put in place. The update comes in the wake of a recent briefing to the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance, where it was suggested that trading and holding digital assets in Pakistan remain illegal. According to reports, the committee was told that individuals and firms carrying out cryptocurrency transactions were mandated to report the activities to the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU), which then forwards it to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for more probes. During the committee meeting, SBP Executive Director Sohail Jawad addressed the attendees, confirming that the directive, which was first established in 2018, remains in force. However, the central bank has also mentioned that it is currently coordinating with the Finance Division and the recently formed Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to design a comprehensive regulatory and legal framework for digital assets in the country. Attendees query SBP’s clarification amid a wider crypto push While the SBP were quite clear in their clarification, attendees were not convinced of their stance on digital assets. Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal maintained at the committee briefing that digital assets were banned. He noted that if they were not banned, those dealing in the assets would not have to face investigations from the relevant authorities, including the FMU and FIA. The finance secretary also answered questions on why the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was established without consultations with the parliament or the SPB. He mentioned that the task force was created under the directive of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif via executive orders. He added that the PCC is taking on an advisory role that aims to propose a legal and procedural path forward for the crypto industry. The details of the planned allocation of 2,000 megawatts of electricity for crypto mining and AI data centers were also at the briefing, with Committee member Mirza Ikhtiyar Baig discussing government priorities. He mentioned that such an endeavor should have been used to support local industries in Pakistan instead. The country announced the move earlier this month, soaking debates about the country’s crypto stance going forward. Pakistan is currently ranked in the top ten countries in terms of crypto adoption, with the country previously taking the third spot according to the Global Crypto Index. With over 20 million active users and about $20 billion in crypto transactions, the potential for crypto innovation in the country remains high. The country also sees about $35 billion in annual remittances, with experts noting that it could benefit from blockchain-based financial solutions. Meanwhile, the Standing Committee on Finance is expected to summon the SBP, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and members of the Pakistan Crypto Council in its next meeting to seek further clarity on the legal and economic implications of digital asset adoption.

Whale Activity and On-Chain Signals Hint at Further Correction,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-at-risk-whale-activity-and-on-chain-signals-hint-at-further-correction/,"Ethereum’s price action has demonstrated a pullback in recent days, reacting to broader market cues, including geopolitical developments. As of the time of writing, the asset is trading at $2,621, marking a 3.2% decline over the last 24 hours. The drop follows recent reports of a federal court reinstating US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which appear to have triggered a brief wave of risk-off sentiment across the crypto asset space. Despite this short-term weakness, ETH remains up approximately 45% over the past month, supported by momentum built earlier in the quarter. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot Premium Signals Strength – $2,800 Resistance In Focus Large Ethereum Inflows to Binance Spark Caution This latest pullback coincides with a notable increase in on-chain activity, particularly surrounding Ethereum transfers to exchanges. On May 27, an unusually large transfer of ETH was observed moving to Binance, a trend that has caught the attention of a CryptoQuant analyst monitoring potential profit-taking behavior. Parallel to this, Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric has reached a key level historically associated with market cooling phases, hinting that broader sentiment may be at a transitional point. According to CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, Ethereum experienced a substantial net inflow of approximately 385,000 ETH to Binance beginning on May 27. This marks one of the largest daily exchange inflows for the asset in recent months. Exchange inflows of this magnitude are often interpreted as signals of increased selling intent, particularly when driven by larger holders or institutional entities. The movement of such a high volume of ETH to a centralized exchange may reflect preparations for liquidity provision or anticipated market volatility. At the same time, Bitcoin’s NUPL, a metric that calculates the difference between unrealized profits and losses relative to market cap, has approached the 0.6 threshold. Historically, this level has acted as a pivot point where investors begin realizing gains, typically leading to price consolidation or downward pressure. Previous occurrences in early March and late 2024 saw NUPL at similar levels, followed by pullbacks in Bitcoin’s price, which also influenced broader market direction. Signals Suggest Potential Consolidation Phase Taken together, these developments present key indicators that market participants are adjusting their positions amid heightened uncertainty. Taha emphasized that while not definitive sell signals, the 385,000 ETH inflow to Binance and the NUPL’s rise to 0.6 are noteworthy. In prior cycles, similar patterns coincided with phases where investors reduced exposure or rotated assets. As ETH remains near local highs, the potential for short-term correction or sideways movement cannot be dismissed. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Outlook: Technical Indicators Signal Possible Continuation of Uptrend Taha concluded that investors may consider monitoring exchange inflows alongside NUPL and other on-chain metrics to better gauge sentiment shifts. Additionally, developments in regulatory or macroeconomic narratives, such as US trade policies or broader equity market behavior, could further influence crypto price dynamics. While Ethereum continues to demonstrate long-term strength, recent signals point to a phase of caution and strategic reassessment in the near term.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00001328, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00001514. PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00001073, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000779. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price gained minor selling demand after sellers gained control and plunged the price toward $0.00001. This was triggered by the recent low buying activity and increasing profit-taking sentiment. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040.

Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005.

Tron , a long-standing blockchain network, has enjoyed steady growth this month, but its trajectory feels cautious compared to the explosive potential of Ruvi AI . Priced at an accessible $0.015 , with a bold projection of $1 by Q4 2025 , Ruvi AI is captivating smart investors who are looking beyond modest returns for high-impact opportunities. Here’s why Ruvi AI is attracting massive interest, leaving Tron’s steady pace in the dust. Tron’s Steady Yet Conservative Growth Tron has long been recognized for its role in decentralized applications and content sharing platforms. Its network has consistently delivered incremental advancements, and recent months have seen a steady rise in user adoption. While these gains are commendable, Tron’s growth, though positive, remains measured and lacks the explosive potential that defines higher-risk, higher-reward cryptos. For cautious investors, Tron presents a familiar and relatively stable haven. However, for those hungry to capture exponential returns in emerging markets, a project like Ruvi AI is impossible to ignore. Ruvi AI Emerges as a Game-Changer Ruvi AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to solve pressing challenges across multiple industries. It’s this focus on real-world utility that has positioned the project as a frontrunner in the crypto arena. Unlike Tron’s steady growth, Ruvi AI is in a rapid ascension phase, fueled by clear mission-driven goals. From healthcare and logistics to finance, the project delivers innovative solutions that cater to modern demands. Real-World Applications Redefining Utility Ruvi AI isn’t just promising; it’s actively delivering impact across sectors that drive global economies. Healthcare : Ruvi AI improves diagnostics, streamlines operations, and reduces costs, helping medical systems operate more efficiently. Logistics : Its AI-powered solutions tackle supply chain bottlenecks, enhancing productivity and reducing waste. Finance : By offering advanced fraud detection and secure transaction mechanisms, Ruvi AI provides practical tools to level up financial systems. Tron may provide stable blockchain fundamentals, but Ruvi AI is working toward reshaping industries right now. This capacity to provide immediate value is a key reason why over 130 million tokens were sold during Ruvi AI’s record-breaking presale , which raised an impressive $1.4 million . From Presale Success to Strategic Partnerships Momentum often defines a project’s trajectory, and Ruvi AI has been on an undeniable roll. Its collaboration with Weex Exchange , a user-friendly trading platform, ensures easy market accessibility for Ruvi AI’s utility token. Early accessibility through platforms like Weex supports liquidity, expands its audience reach, and offers seamless trading opportunities for retail and institutional investors alike. This partnership reflects Ruvi AI’s forward-thinking approach, contrasting with Tron’s predominantly developmental focus. VIP Investment Opportunities Another reason behind Ruvi AI’s surging popularity lies in its highly rewarding VIP investment tiers , which are designed to maximize returns for early adopters. With bonuses as high as 100% , these tiers amplify potential returns as the token’s value grows. Here are some highlights of Ruvi AI’s VIP tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens = 70,000 . Value at $0.07/token = $4,900 . Value at $1/token = $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens = 224,000 . Value at $0.07/token = $15,680 . Value at $1/token = $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens = 1,280,000 . Value at $0.07/token = $89,600 . Value at $1/token = $1,280,000 . These VIP opportunities are helping Ruvi AI generate unparalleled buzz, giving early movers a huge incentive to get involved now. Why Smart Investors Are Betting on Ruvi AI While Tron’s steady growth signals reliability, it’s Ruvi AI’s dynamic combination of innovation and execution that offers the potential for massive returns .

Ruvi AI’s affordable entry price and sheer upward potential make it an attractive opportunity for forward-thinking investors. Final Thoughts For those tracking cryptocurrency trends, the comparison between steady approaches like Tron and the disruptive rise of Ruvi AI offers valuable insight. While Tron appeals to investors seeking stability, Ruvi AI offers a rare opportunity to capture explosive growth by addressing pressing global challenges. With industry-specific use cases, record-breaking presale success, and future-focused strategies, Ruvi AI is not only just getting started but also setting the stage for long-term relevance in the crypto market. Smart investors are already making the shift toward Ruvi AI, preparing to be part of what could be a defining movement in blockchain innovation. Don’t miss the opportunity to be an early participant in Ruvi AI’s promising future.

The move is a copy of the Bitcoin purchasing script utilized by MicroStrategy and co-founder Michael Saylor, with SharpLink using Ethereum as its target asset. “We intend to utilize almost all of the net proceeds of this offering to buy Ether,” the company stated in a filing on May 30. Strategic Shift Toward Ethereum SharpLink announced the move on May 27 to an Ethereum-based treasury model and appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as board chairman. Shares of SharpLink surged 400% on one trading day following the announcement. SharpLink also plans to utilize part of the proceeds for operations, affiliate marketing, and general corporate purposes. Identifying Risks with ETH Holdings The filing identified regulatory and marketplace risks of holding Ether to the extent. Risks include the potential to treat ETH as a security, increasing compliance expenses, and the threat to CBDCs to undermine the acceptance of private cryptocurrencies. “The emergence of central bank digital currencies can potentially render private-sector issued cryptocurrencies obsolete or redundant,” SharpLink stated. Known as Ethereum’s Michael Saylor SharpLink’s move has drawn parallels with Michael Saylor, whose firm MicroStrategy holds in excess of 580,000 Bitcoin. Crypto commentators and analysts were quick to refer to SharpLink as “Ethereum’s Saylor.” Crypto analyst 0xBoboShanti on X, “Ethereum finally has its own Saylor.” Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano added, “You are not bullish enough.” Wider Ethereum Momentum This comes amidst rising institutional demand for Ethereum.

Legal expert and XRP advocate Bill Morgan has drawn attention to June 16, the date when the SEC’s 60-day deadline to submit a status update to the Court of Appeals will end. This report deadline stems from earlier court proceedings that left unresolved matters requiring appellate review. According to Morgan, the expiration of this window could signal upcoming activity in the case, as the regulatory body is expected to notify the appeals court of any material developments. I was expecting some filing in the SEC v Ripple case given what happened to the last motion that was dismissed two weeks ago, especially given that the 60 day period which the parties have before the SEC is required to file a status report with the court of appeals expires on 16… pic.twitter.com/I250sVGKLx — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 29, 2025 Background and Procedural Update The status report obligation arises in the context of a broader legal process following the dismissal of recent motions. Most notably, Judge Analisa Torres denied both Ripple and the SEC’s joint request for an indicative ruling, classifying the motion as procedurally inappropriate. Indicative rulings allow trial courts to express whether they would grant a motion if the appellate court were to remand the case. In this instance, the parties sought to resolve issues regarding a long-standing injunction and the distribution of escrowed funds. With Judge Torres declining to issue a position on the matter, future procedural steps will depend on whether the parties resubmit a properly formatted request. Unusual Filing Highlights Courtroom Tensions While developments from the primary parties are anticipated, an unexpected filing recently surfaced in the court docket. Bill Morgan noted the submission of a lengthy statement by a third party criticizing the application of the Howey Test, a legal standard used to determine whether an asset qualifies as a security. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The filing, which reportedly spans several pages, argues against judicial interpretations of the term “investment contract” and challenges the SEC’s use of the Howey test. Although unlikely to influence the outcome of the case, the document underscores the broader tensions and public interest surrounding the litigation. What Could Happen Next? If a properly submitted motion for an indicative ruling is accepted, Judge Torres would then need to clarify whether she would dissolve the standing injunction. This step is essential for the parties to proceed with requests involving the distribution of funds; $50 million would be transferred to the SEC, while the remainder would be released back to Ripple. Following a favourable indicative ruling, both parties are expected to jointly request a limited remand from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. If granted, Ripple and the SEC would return to Judge Torres’ court to formally seek the agreed-upon relief. Once those conditions are fulfilled, the appellate court could dismiss both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal, effectively concluding the current phase of litigation. As June 16 approaches, all eyes remain on whether the SEC will file its update and whether either side will submit the appropriate documents to move the case forward. The outcome will not only influence Ripple’s operational future but may also set precedents for regulatory oversight in the broader cryptocurrency industry.

However, if you have let past winning opportunities pass you by, 2025 is your year, thanks to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Just like all other millionaire-makers of the past, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently trading at less than $1 per coin. It also has a massive social media following of over 10k followers on X alone, which is rare for a presale token in the DeFi space. However, past whales that have minted millions in other projects are also looking to grow their wealth. As such, they have been quietly entering the MUTM presale. So far, over $9.4 million worth of presale tokens have been taken off the table. The presale is in Phase 5, where each token is going for $0.03, which marks a 200% increase from the Phase 1 pricing of $0.01. At the current price, investors stand to make a 100% return on the listing price of $0.06. However, this opportunity will not last long, with the price set to go up by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to a price of $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing the rules Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not paying by the well-established rules of hype before purpose. Instead, it is changing the rulebook and using utility to drive growth. As proof of this, the project recently posted the results of its Certik audit, which has provided a massive boost in trust. Naysayers who had been quietly watching from the sidelines have now fully committed, looking to be part of a new wave of innovation. A look at the protocol’s design reveals why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting so much attention. It is built as a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol, which features two modes. In the first mode, called P2C (peer-to-contract), lenders deposit their funds in a collective pool and earn an annualized percentage yield on their deposits. The interest rate is dynamically decided by the pool’s utilization rate. The second mode is called the peer-to-peer (P2P), where lenders and borrowers interact directly with each other to set the terms of a trade. They pick the interest rate, the repayment period, partial fills, and more. P2P contracts are maintained separately from the P2C mode to ensure that the high volatility used in this mode does not impact the overall DeFi marketplace. This mode is built for assets like the BONK meme coin, known for high volatility and low liquidity. Another unique aspect of this project is the mtTokens, which give depositors in the lending pools access to instance liquidity. For instance, when lenders deposit $1,500 worth of BNB in a pool, they receive mtBNB tokens, whose value is equivalent to their share in the pool, plus accrued interest. These mtTokens allow lenders to keep track of their portfolio in real time. Additionally, they ensure that holders do not need to actively compound their gains. The system is built to enhance transparency while ensuring non-custodial ownership. It also unlocks liquidity for lenders by allowing them to transfer their mtTokens to secondary markets or use them to acquire loans on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As such, they can benefit from all new market opportunities, even while still earning interest. Transparent dividend payouts Mutuum Finance aims to ensure transparency at all levels, which ensures that users make informed decisions while also promoting trust in the ecosystem. One example of this is dividend payouts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens at market rates and distributes them to stakers on the platform. These stakers are thus incentivized to continue playing their important role. Since all transactions are on the blockchain, it boosts trust, which will encourage more stakers to provide liquidity on the platform. This positive feedback loop is the hallmark of all products launched by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project relies on market forces and positive reinforcement to create a long-lasting project that will become a staple of DeFi once it goes live. The project recently revealed that it plans to launch a beta version of the platform on listing day, which could push up interest in MUTM to dizzying heights. A working proof of concept available for anyone to inspect and try should help eliminate doubt. All those still amazed at how such a brilliant project could be priced at the low entry price of $0.03 per token will finally be convinced.

Bitcoin fell over 2% to under $104,000 and traded just over $103,600 in Asian afternoon hours Saturday, while the CoinDesk 20 index slumped 4.2% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) fell nearly 4%, xrp (XRP), BNB Chain (BNB), Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL showed losses between 2-5%. Cronos Network’s CRO was the only gainer in the top 100 tokens with a 12% on no immediate catalyst. Analysts attributed the downturn to renewed U.S.-China trade tensions. ""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email. “President Trump accused China on social media of violating the recent trade truce, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admitted in an interview that talks with Beijing had stalled.” The derivatives market also pointed to increasing investor caution. Open interest in Bitcoin futures is up 51% since April, while options have ballooned by 126%, according to data from Deribit. Whale wallets, which had been accumulating Bitcoin throughout the year, recently shifted to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges — a classic sign of profit-taking.

In a recent interview , Tischhauser pointed to what she calls a “supply shock” — a state in which Bitcoin’s liquid supply is dwindling while institutional demand continues to grow. “Large demand will have a strong multiplier effect,” Tischhauser said, estimating that for every $1 of net new demand, Bitcoin’s market capitalization could increase by $20 to $30. “We have already seen this multiplier effect after the launch of the BTC spot ETFs or around the US elections,” she added. BTC’s supply, particularly the portion actively traded, has been declining over the past 18 months. Tischhauser attributes this trend to the rise of long-term holding structures such as institutional acquisition vehicles, including Strategy and Twenty One Capital. These entities are accumulating Bitcoin with the intention of holding it off exchanges, which reduces the amount available to meet new demand. A Perfect Storm of Bullish Drivers Tischhauser also pointed to macroeconomic and regulatory developments contributing to her bullish outlook. With rising concerns over inflation and increasing global interest in BTC as a deflationary store of value, the narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” is gaining traction. Additionally, regulatory clarity in the United States and other major economies is encouraging institutional participation, which could further reduce supply available for retail investors. Since April 16, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have only seen four days of outflows , indicating steady institutional interest and capital inflow. This consistent demand, combined with structural supply constraints, sets up what some analysts believe could be a dramatic rally in the coming quarters. Healthy Pause in Bitcoin Price Nick Forster, founder of on-chain options protocol Derive, agrees that Bitcoin could be preparing for its next major move , but not before taking a breather. “The current price action suggests a phase of consolidation,” Forster said, calling it a “healthy pause” that allows the market to stabilize after reaching new highs. This period of sideways movement may also serve as a base for a strong upward push, with some analysts projecting BTC’s next peak between $200,000 and $300,000. As the supply continues to tighten and demand holds strong, the groundwork may already be in place for next bull run.

According to on-chain data, this whale address missed out on a potential profit of $42.64 million in total by “buying high and selling low.” The address in question sold 50,754 ETH at $1,754 on April 23, earning 89.03 million USDT. It was reported that 15,000 of these ETH were used to open a short position with borrowed assets. However, 27 days later, this USDT amount was only able to buy 34,343 ETH at $2,592. Thus, the investor suffered a loss of 16,452 ETH. The 35,754 ETH he initially owned fell to 19,302 ETH after the transaction. Related News: The Big Day Has Arrived: FTX's $5 Billion Payments Are Beginning - Here Are the Official Statements When compared to today’s market value of these transactions, the loss becomes even clearer. The 19,302 ETH in his hand is currently worth approximately $5004 million, while the current value of the 35,754 ETH he had before the transaction is $92.69 million. The difference indicates a loss of $42.64 million. Meanwhile, institutional interest in Ethereum continues to grow. According to Farside data, US spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded net inflows for nine consecutive trading days, attracting a total of $486 million in capital. *This is not investment advice.

If you thought May was going to close out quietly, think again. This past week has been chaotic – full of volatility, influence, and power plays. From sudden exchange bans to surprising legal reversals, the industry is being pushed – and pulled – by regulators across the globe. Thailand’s crackdown, the SEC’s unexpected move to drop charges, and growing political pressure in the U.S. are just a few signs that the industry is moving fast. But let’s take a step back to get you all caught up. Here’s the top stories that you might have missed + everything you need to know to go into June well prepared. Let’s begin. #1 Trump-Era Shift? SEC Walks Away from Binance Battle After nearly two years of headline-grabbing allegations, the SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Binance and co-founder Changpeng Zhao. The dismissal, filed with prejudice , means the regulator can’t reopen the case. The SEC simply said the decision was made “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter.” The move follows a 60-day pause and growing speculation about a regulatory tone shift under President Trump. Binance was originally accused of inflating volumes, misusing funds, and trading unregistered securities. Now? The case is closed with no admission of guilt. Binance, as expected, celebrated the win as did the larger crypto community. Huge win for crypto today. The SEC’s case against us is dismissed. Thank you to Chairman Atkins & the Trump team for pushing back against regulation by enforcement. U.S. innovation is back on track – and it’s just the beginning. — Binance (@binance) May 29, 2025 #2 Reform’s Farage Set to Make UK a Global Crypto Powerhouse Nigel Farage is betting big on Bitcoin AND the British ballot. At Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, the Reform UK leader unveiled his party’s “Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill,” promising to slash crypto capital gains tax to 10%, create a Bitcoin reserve at the Bank of England, and outlaw banks from de-banking crypto users. “We are going to launch in Britain a crypto revolution,” he said, holding up the bill on stage. With crypto adoption soaring among young Brits, Farage says it’s time to catch up and he’s ready to lead that charge. #3 U.S. Lawmakers Launch CLARITY Act for Clear Crypto Rules Regulatory confusion has been a constant headache for the U.S. crypto industry but that may be about to change. On May 29, bipartisan lawmakers introduced the CLARITY Act, aiming to draw clear lines around digital assets. Led by Rep. French Hill and supported by key figures like Tom Emmer, this bill wants to assign clear agency oversight and legal definitions to the crypto market. With areas like exchange registration and stablecoin rules on the table, it could bring much-needed certainty. If passed, the CLARITY Act might be the framework the U.S. has long lacked, giving both investors and innovators room to breathe. Can’t wait! #4 Trump Media to Join Bitcoin Billionaires’ Club President Donald Trump’s media startup, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), is making a headline-grabbing move: it plans to pour $2.5 billion into bitcoin. The company, known for Truth Social and Truth+, announced it will fund the purchase by selling stock and convertible bonds. Devin Nunes, TMTG’s CEO and Trump ally, called bitcoin “an apex instrument of financial freedom” and said holding crypto will protect the company from “harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.” This deal could soon put TMTG among the largest public corporate holders of bitcoin, showing how the Trump camp is doubling down on digital assets. #5 Thailand Cuts Off Five Unlicensed Crypto Giants Thailand is drawing the line! Starting June 28, five big-name centralized exchanges – Bybit, 1000X, CoinEx, OKX, and XT – will be cut off from the country’s internet. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made it clear: these platforms have been operating without proper registration. This is a protective move against crypto-related crimes and money laundering. The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society will enforce the ban, aiming to shield investors and clean up Thailand’s digital scene. #6 GameStop Buys Bitcoin, Loses Wall Street GameStop just made a $500 million bet on Bitcoin but investors are not on board. The move, intended to offset falling video game sales, triggered a 10% stock drop immediately, and a total plunge of 23%. While the company raised $1.5 billion to fund the pivot, critics aren’t sold. Many fear it’s like past mistakes, exposing GameStop to Bitcoin’s volatility. With store closures increasing and revenue declining, this shift has left the market asking: is this an act of desperation? #7 Solana to Hit $275? Standard Chartered Thinks So Standard Chartered dropped a bold forecast: Solana could hit $275 by end-2025 and stretch to $500 by 2029. The bank sees strength in Solana’s low-fee, high-volume use cases especially for financial and consumer apps. But there’s a catch: “achieving scale… could take time.” Despite leading meme coin activity, the bank notes $SOL looks cheap compared to its application revenue. Still, it expects Solana to underperform Ethereum near-term, with the $ETH/$SOL ratio rising to 17 by 2027, before correcting. Big potential, but the road’s not smooth. #8 Elon Musk Exits Trump Administration Elon Musk is out. The billionaire has officially stepped down from his role in the Trump administration, citing mounting frustration with the federal government’s resistance to cost-cutting reforms. As head of the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Service, Musk had aimed to rein in bloated spending but Trump’s sweeping budget plan pushed the deficit in the opposite direction. “Much worse than I realized,” he admitted, referring to the bureaucratic pushback. #9 New Stablecoin Bill May Lock In Dollar’s Digital Future The GENIUS Act recently cleared a major hurdle in the Senate, and it could redefine how the U.S. treats stablecoins and the dollar’s role in Web3. Backed by a 66–32 procedural vote, the bill demands 1:1 dollar reserves, strict audits, and federal licensing. Foresight Ventures says this would make the USD the “world’s digital settlement currency.” However, let’s hold further speculation till the final floor vote. #10 Cantor Fitzgerald Launches Bitcoin Fund Crypto cautious? This might be for you. Cantor Fitzgerald is launching a five-year Bitcoin fund – but here’s the twist: it’s hedged 1:1 with gold. Capture Bitcoin’s upside while using gold to lock in downside protection. “It’s designed to bring traditional investors into the ecosystem,” said Chairman Brandon Lutnick at Bitcoin 2025. Cantor’s previously teamed up with Maple and FalconX on BTC lending. Now, they’re taking a bigger swing at merging legacy finance with digital assets. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! SharpLink Doubles Down on ETH: In an interesting play, SharpLink Gaming shifted $425M into ETH and named Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman, marking one of the largest crypto treasury plays by a public company to date. NY Crypto Investor Held Hostage: Michael Carturan, an Italian crypto investor, was abducted in New York and held hostage for 17 days – all so his captors could get to his Bitcoin. The suspects have been caught, but the case is a reminder that holding crypto wealth isn’t just a digital risk anymore. Hong Kong Sets the Stage for Stablecoin Licensing: Hong Kong passed a law creating a formal license for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. This puts it among the first to offer clear rules, aiming to attract global crypto firms and boost its Web3 ambitions. SEC’s High-Profile June Summit: On June 5, the SEC will hold a conference highlighting how tokenization is transforming asset management and explore regulatory frameworks to support innovation in digital assets. TON’s New VP Hire Sparks Rally: TONcoin surged nearly 16% after Nikola Plecas, ex-Visa payments exec, joined TON Foundation as VP of Payments. His move ignited a sharp buying spree, pushing $TON past $3.25 with strong volume support. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead: With regulatory fog finally starting to clear, June looks set to bring some major moves. The GENIUS Act could reach final approval, potentially locking in the U.S. dollar’s digital future. Expect more institutional players to jump in as clearer rules and new products, like Cantor Fitzgerald’s gold-hedged Bitcoin fund, gain traction. Hong Kong is positioning itself as a stablecoin hub, attracting global crypto firms with fresh licensing laws and a clear regulatory framework. May’s mix of regulatory progress, growing adoption, and security challenges shows the market is volatile but also maturing fast.

The trader pseudonymously known as Sherpa tells his 246,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is still in a “strong bullish trend” despite breaking below the $106,000 support level. According to the widely followed analyst and trader, Bitcoin is primed to “bounce” as there is strong support at around the $104,000 price level. Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on Sherpa’s chart on the four-hour time frame, Bitcoin could fall lower to just above $103,000 and then trade sideways for a while in a consolidation zone. “Things look okay for now, I would expect more pokes around this area but the longer the time spent here, the better in my opinion. You want to see a good low form.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,841 at time of writing. Turning to Popcat ( POPCAT ), Sherpa says the memecoin built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem is one of the altcoins that is in “dangerous territory.” Based on Sherpa’s chart of POPCAT on the four-hour time frame, the memecoin is at risk of breaking a crucial support area after printing a bearish lower high setup. “Coins that were great before like POPCAT might have just made a lower high and could be breaking this last low. I’m not saying it won’t bounce but I’m much more cautious right now than two weeks ago.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X POPCAT is trading at $0.385 at time of writing, down by around 30% over the past week.

The report, focusing on the first three months of 2025, says scams and market manipulation have gone up by 200% compared to the previous quarter. Most of these cases were found in India, Indonesia, and the CIS region. Fraud Attempts Skyrocket MEXC discovered over 80,000 cases of fraud in the first quarter alone. These scams included coordinated efforts by groups using fake trades and automated bots. In total, the exchange says it found over 3,000 fraud groups. Two main factors seem to have caused this jump. First, MEXC listed new tokens from smaller markets, which attracted both new users and scammers. Second, MEXC’s low trading fees brought in more people, including those looking to take advantage of weak oversight. India and Indonesia Lead the Pack India saw the highest number of suspicious accounts, with nearly 27,000 flagged. Indonesia had about 5,600 suspicious accounts, and the CIS region reported over 6,400. Indonesia’s numbers are especially worrying, with a 1,300% jump compared to late 2024. Experts say the excitement around crypto in these areas often grows faster than people’s knowledge about safe trading. A February report from India’s National Centre for Financial Education found that only 27% of Indian adults know the basics of managing money. Among younger people, the number drops to just 19%. This lack of knowledge gives scammers an easy way in. False Promises from Fake Influencers Many people in these countries learn about crypto through social media, like Telegram or YouTube. Unfortunately, not everyone giving advice is honest. Some pretend to be trusted influencers, sharing fake tips and secret investment schemes. They promise fast gains, but many of these are scams meant to trick people. MEXC Steps Up ProtectionIn response, MEXC is strengthening its systems. They’re using real-time fraud detection and reviewing suspicious accounts. MEXC also plans to teach users how to avoid scams and protect their money. Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, said, “2025 has shown a new kind of scam. We’re focused on stopping these tricks and helping our users trade safely.”",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 09:25:38

Currently, DOGE is priced at $0.22, slightly down on the day but holding a solid position after a strong May rally. With renewed momentum and persistent social media buzz, many believe DOGE could still see further upside this cycle, yet some long-time holders are beginning to diversify. While DOGE remains a nostalgic favorite, its massive market cap limits explosive potential compared to early-stage altcoins. That’s why a growing segment of investors is rotating gains into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , eyeing the kind of returns DOGE delivered in its prime. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.4 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,500 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Its groundbreaking two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,500 investors have invested $9.4 million in the presale pointing to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, Mutuum Finance is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $10.7 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. On the security front, the platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards to early investors. Ten lucky participants in the ongoing Mutuum Finance Giveaway will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. While Dogecoin continues to ride waves of social buzz and whale accumulation, its upside may be limited compared to high-potential early-stage projects. That’s why savvy DOGE holders are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a next-gen DeFi platform offering powerful innovation, audited security, and real-world utility. With over $9.4 million raised and 11,500+ investors already on board, the momentum is undeniable. Investors getting in at $0.03 today are set for a 100% ROI at launch, with long-term forecasts suggesting a potential 17,800% surge. With a Certik audit complete and a unique dual-lending model in place, now’s the time to move. Join the presale before the next price jump.

A total of $688 million in liquidations hit traders, with 89% of them on the long side — reflecting a heavily bullish market. The largest single liquidation order was a $12.25 million BTC/USDT on OKX, Coinglass data shows. Bitcoin-tracked futures led losses at over $153 mmillion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at around $122 million. Solana (SOL) faced liquidations totaling about $33 million, XRP futures at $30 million, and Dogecoin (DOGE) futures at over $22 million. ""Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a bilateral trade deal, prompting him to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% to protect domestic industries. He claimed China reneged on a May agreement to ease trade tensions, adding that he might discuss the matter with President Xi. While China is a top steel exporter, most of its steel is already subject to existing tariffs, per Reuters . Trump’s move rattled global trade markets, with potential implications for key minerals and overall relations between the two nations. The broader crypto market was also swept by the sell-off, with Ether down nearly 4%, XRP and Solana falling around 4-5%, and Dogecoin diving over 8% on the day. Data from Deribit shows open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April, with options up 126%, signaling increasing investor appetite for leverage. But whales — large holders with more than 10,000 BTC — have shifted from accumulation to net selling, sending coins back to exchanges in a classic sign of profit-taking. A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Still, the renewed tariff flare-up, combined with a jittery derivatives market, has traders bracing for more volatility ahead.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-31 09:31:12

Now, several evidence point to the altcoin’s struggles throughout the 2023-25 cycle, which revealed both volatility and capital flow patterns that contrast sharply with prior cycles and competitor assets like Bitcoin and Solana. Ethereum Faces Significant Headwinds One of the most notable indicators is Ether’s realized volatility, which has compressed across cycles as the asset’s size grows, currently hovering around 80%, down from over 120% in earlier periods, according to Glassnode’s latest report . Typically, Ether’s 3-month realized volatility rises during bull markets and falls during bearish trends. However, this cycle has defied that pattern. In fact, after reaching 60% at the mid-2024 peak of roughly $4,000, realized volatility surprisingly climbed above 90% even as the price declined toward $1,500. This atypical increase in volatility amid falling prices signals increased market uncertainty and instability. Moreover, while the drawdown structure in this cycle generally aligns with the typical Ether bull market pattern – where corrections of 40% or more from local peaks are common – the key deviation lies in the absence of a fresh ATH price for the altcoin, unlike Bitcoin and Solana, both of which set new peaks in this cycle. This lack of a new high has been a disappointment for many investors who expected the world’s second-largest crypto asset to track more closely with its peers. Additionally, Ether’s downside price movements have been unusually volatile, with multiple drawdowns exceeding 40% and the current 2025 drawdown peaking at an unusually severe 65.4%. While previous cycles have seen similar or worse drawdowns, they tended to occur later in the cycle. As such, this early, steep correction suggests structural weaknesses unique to this period. In terms of capital inflows, the Realized Cap – a measure of the value of all Ether based on the price at which coins last moved – has increased by only 38% since the cycle low in January 2023, growing from $176 billion to $243 billion. This pales in comparison to the massive growth during the 2021 cycle, which saw more than a 1,000% increase. The relatively muted capital inflow of approximately $67 billion during this cycle underlines weaker liquidity support and helps explain the crypto asset’s subdued price performance. Supporting this narrative, trade activity on major centralized exchanges has mirrored these trends: spot volume, which peaked at $14.7 billion per day during the $4,000 price high in December 2024, plunged by roughly 80% to $2.9 billion per day. Though recent trading volumes have rebounded to $8.6 billion daily, spot volumes have yet to establish new cycle highs, as seen with previous cycles. Average ETH ETF investor Substantially Underwater The firm’s analysis further revealed that the average investor in the BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETFs is currently facing an unrealized loss of approximately 21%. Net outflows from these ETFs have tended to accelerate whenever Ethereum’s spot price drops below the average cost basis, observed during important declines in August 2024 and again in January and March 2025. Despite initial excitement, the ETFs accounted for only around 1.5% of spot market trade volume at launch, pointing to a lukewarm reception. While this rose to over 2.5% in November 2024, it has since reverted back to 1.5%. While the current market conditions reveal mounting pressure for the crypto asset, certain market experts also predict that it could hit the $3,000 mark as early as June.

The bill would also ban banks from denying services to crypto users, addressing concerns over “debanking.” The UK plans to enforce mandatory crypto trade reporting from January 2026 to boost tax compliance. Nigel Farage, leader of Britain’s Reform Party, has thrown his full backing behind cryptocurrency, unveiling an ambitious pro-crypto legislative plan at this year’s Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Taking the stage on Thursday , Farage promised that if elected prime minister in the UK’s next general election, scheduled for 2029, his government would champion crypto-friendly reforms. Waving a draft of the proposed “Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill,” Farage declared, “We will campaign for this and we will put it in place when we win the next general election… Bring crypto and digital assets in from the cold.” UK Bill Proposes 10% Crypto Tax The proposed bill would significantly lower capital gains tax on crypto from the current 24% to 10%, mandate that the Bank of England create a Bitcoin reserve, and prohibit banks from denying services to individuals or businesses based on their crypto-related activities. The practice of so-called “debanking” has become a flashpoint in both political and crypto circles. Farage himself has claimed he was denied bank accounts for political reasons, a grievance he leveraged to connect with the conference’s audience. “I went to 10 banks, all of whom refused me an account,” Farage told the crowd. “No wonder so many people are going for Bitcoin—because they can’t close you down, and that is the ultimate freedom.” Farage is no stranger to controversy. He previously led UKIP, the driving force behind Brexit, and has long been a polarizing figure in British politics. The Reform Party, his current platform, has faced its own accusations of racism, which party leaders have denied. On Thursday, Farage also announced that the Reform Party now accepts crypto donations via its website, supporting Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and USD Coin (USDC). Let’s get the British economy into the 21st century. Read Reform UK’s Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill. https://t.co/5QytUV1p1V pic.twitter.com/pfqdAxhHPe — Nigel Farage MP (@Nigel_Farage) May 30, 2025 The party’s pro-crypto push aligns with a growing global trend among right-wing parties embracing digital assets. In recent years, politicians in the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina have advanced similar initiatives, linking crypto’s decentralization ethos with broader anti-establishment narratives. Farage closed his speech by appealing to the conference audience, framing the Reform Party’s crypto-friendly stance as part of a larger fight for financial freedom. “It’s about freedom and control of your own money,” he said, “and that’s what we stand for.” UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred.

PBS claimed that the order sought to use the federal government’s power to punish PBS, whose content Trump argued was biased against conservatives. PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural northern and central Minnesota areas. The lawsuit said Trump’s order was an “existential threat” to the network. A PBS spokesman said the station concluded it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public TV’s editorial independence and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations. Trump ordered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the system. Through the corporation alone, the network received roughly $325M this year, most of which went directly to individual stations. PBS also disclosed that 22% of its revenue came directly from the feds. PBS disputes charged assertions in the ‘strongest possible terms’ BREAKING – YOUR REACTION: @PBS sues Trump, citing First Amendment violations over taxpayer funding. The public broadcaster claims the May 1 order cutting its funding infringes on its constitutional rights. pic.twitter.com/6eY56cErDQ — Simon Ateba (@simonateba) May 30, 2025 PBS’ lawyer, Z.W. Julius Chen, wrote in the suit filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington that the station disputed Trump’s allegations in the strongest possible terms. The suit alleged Trump’s order was unlawful, exceeded his authority as president, and violated Constitutional protections of free speech because he had made clear he did not like PBS’s news coverage and programming. The station stated that for Minnesota residents, the order threatened the “Lakeland Learns” education program and “Lakeland News,” described in the lawsuit as the only television program in the region providing local news, weather, and sports. The network also disclosed that the U.S. Department of Education had canceled a $78 million grant to the system for educational programming, which would have been used to make children’s shows like “Sesame Street,” “Clifford the Big Red Dog,” and “Reading Rainbow.” “Trump’s order would have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans.” – Z.W. Julius Chen , PBS Lawyer PBS claimed that its action challenged an unnecessary presidential directive attacking it and its member stations in a manner that would tumble public television. It added that the order made no attempt to hide the fact that it was cutting off the flow of funds out of a desire to alter the network’s content. Trump’s administration receives another lawsuit from NPR Trump recently described what NPR published as left-wing propaganda and ordered the CPB to cut the network’s federal funding. However, the CPB clarified that the president had no standing or power to issue the executive order. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations also argued that Trump admitted he was using his power to target the station because he disagreed with the content of their speech. The lawsuit also argued that Trump’s executive order was “textbook retaliation” and “viewpoint-based discrimination.” It explained that the government’s targeting of not just the substance of speech but also a speaker’s particular views was presumptively unconstitutional. Katherine Maher, NPR’s CEO, said it was not right that Trump’s order sought to force the network to adapt its journalistic standards and editorial choices to the preferences of the government if it was to continue to receive federal funding. However, NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik confirmed that the Corporation of Public Broadcasting had not yet frozen money. The lawsuit made a strong case that the Trump administration lacked the power to direct the CPB to stop funding it. It also noted that, even if the CPB did, Trump’s efforts violated the First Amendment rights of the station and its listeners. NPR also argued that Trump violated the Public Broadcasting Act because he could not, by an executive order, tell the CPB to stop funding it. The station also claimed that the executive branch did not have the constitutional power to tell the CPB to stop funding it. The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, spending power.

This plan contrasts with the short-term strategies followed by many investors. Rather than seeking immediate returns, Farina aims to retain most of his position until the token’s value reaches triple-digit territory. XRP is currently trading at $2.19, and while this is much lower than Farina’s long-term objective, he remains focused on future milestones, with his approach centered on value retention, selective profit-taking, and long-term utility through decentralized finance. A Milestone to Celebrate Growth Farina does not intend to sell a substantial portion of his XRP, even when the token reaches higher valuations. He has previously warned community members not to sell their tokens at current levels and explained in his video that his first small sale will occur when the asset hits $10, a point he considers suitable for locking in a minor percentage of gains. According to him, this step is not an exit but rather a way to celebrate progress and redirect some funds into real estate investments, particularly in Greece, where he has already been active with proceeds from other cryptocurrencies. He also shared how his holdings are managed. The vast majority of his XRP is stored offline in cold wallets, with only a small portion held on exchanges for liquidity purposes. He recently drew attention to the Mt. Gox collapse that ruined the lives of many Bitcoin holders and warned XRP holders to move their tokens off centralized exchanges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Taking Profit at Future Price Levels Farina revealed that he would sell some tokens at $50, but noted that the scale would be modest. The next target is $100 , and Farina has explained that selling just 1,000 tokens at this price would bring in $100,000. Farina argued that withdrawing the original capital investment is a sound practice in risk management, but insisted that the majority of his tokens will not be sold. A Better Option than Selling Farina’s ultimate goal does not involve liquidation but rather participation in lending opportunities once the legal framework for XRP becomes more defined. He believes that lending XRP through regulated platforms will allow investors to earn yield in stablecoins, fiat currencies, or even XRP itself. Other experts have also advocated for this approach , as they expect large-scale institutional adoption once all regulatory issues are resolved. While some experts believe XRP may not hit $100 until the next decade, Farina remains unfazed, emphasizing long-term utility and passive income potential. He advises strategic selling, not reacting to short-term price shifts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In crypto and web3, money can be created, lost, or multiplied within seconds. It’s the polar opposite of old money, which grew slowly, accruing value over years or even decades. Crypto accelerates that, posting double-digit moves before TradFi wakes up and has breakfast. You might also like: From crypto projects to digital asset companies: It’s time to level up web3 comms | Opinion This hyper-cycle of onchain value creation—and eradication—compels us to reconsider what money truly is and how it functions in a decentralized future. While traditional money was based on nation-states and central banks, web3 money is founded on code, consensus, and community belief. It writes its own rules—and then forces the rest of the world to follow along. Not because they have to, but because if they don’t, they risk being left behind. It’s a case of innovate or die. And right now, web3 is doing most of the innovating as it reimagines what money is capable of achieving—and who it achieves it for. In this new environment, capital is not just capital: it represents culture, software, and storytelling. Value is digital, 24/7 tradable, and accessible to everyone, not just the suits in their glass towers. The future of finance is being rapidly built before our eyes, and mastering this transformation calls for rewriting the rulebook on what money means. A generation of digital natives is growing up, to whom money doesn’t mean checking accounts and 401 Ks—it means self-custodied stablecoins, yield-producing assets, and collectibles that can command eye-watering prices. Navigating this future calls for viewing money through five new perspectives. Reimagining money First, money has become a networked belief. In crypto, money is no longer issued by governments but created through consensus. Bitcoin ( BTC ) represents trust in a limited supply and decentralization, while Ethereum ( ETH ) shows faith in programmable agreements. Even memecoins demonstrate that stories, viral spread, and community engagement can generate market value without practical utility. In this system, value grows with belief. Money becomes a network effect: a shared idea we all participate in. We know why Bitcoin is valuable: because it’s hard to obtain, has a fixed supply, and is secured by the world’s largest decentralized network. But precious as these attributes are, Bitcoin’s value ultimately comes down to a shared, networked belief. We believe it is precious, and hundreds of millions of others share our conviction, so Number Go Up. Second, money functions as infrastructure rather than status. In traditional finance, wealth is the goal. In web3, it serves as a tool to build ecosystems, coordinate communities, and motivate action. Tokens fund development. DAOs direct capital toward common goals. NFTs serve as programmable access layers, not just collectibles. Here, money works as infrastructure: it is a tool, not a trophy. It’s the means, not the endgame. It’s often said that money doesn’t buy happiness—merely freedom of choice. What is crypto if not the ultimate embodiment of that concept? Freedom to build; freedom to collaborate; freedom to buy and sell anything, any time, to anyone. Third, money exists as a transparent flow. Blockchain technology makes every transaction visible. Unlike traditional systems hidden behind intermediaries, on-chain finance transforms money into traceable, verifiable movement. This creates a new dynamic: behavior becomes observable, and economic patterns become public. It makes us think about not just how money moves, but why. The important question becomes: What does this movement reveal about our true values? The psychology of money Fourth, money operates as a temporal illusion. Crypto’s volatility shows an important truth: value is not fixed; it’s constructed. In web3, fortunes appear or disappear in minutes. This volatility affects both finances and psychology. It teaches us that money does not equal security but represents a constantly changing narrative. This instability requires humility, not exaggeration. Quick profits may come easily, but their real cost often becomes apparent later. As the bitcoiners’ mantra goes, “Stay humble and stack sats.” In other words, don’t flaunt your wealth: be grateful for what you’ve got and keep quietly adding to it if your conviction in its value remains undiminished. Finally, money functions as a moral code. Programmable money allows us to embed values directly into code. Incentive structures can reward transparency, collaboration, environmental protection, or long-term contribution, not just speculation. This means web3 gives us the unique opportunity to design moral money—money that reflects shared principles, not just market forces. In the web3 era, money isn’t merely what you possess: it’s what you help create. It reflects collective belief, functions as a programmable social layer, and serves as a tool that can either strengthen or weaken the values we care about. This is why astute web3 VCs invest not only in technical innovation but in value-aligned ecosystems. Because if we can redesign financial infrastructure, we also have the responsibility to ask: what kind of world should it serve? Let’s not just earn money. Let’s reimagine it.

HYPE, ADA, XYZ, SEI, and NEAR Stand Out",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-digital-assets-are-building-momentum-for-2025-hype-ada-xyz-sei-and-near-stand-out/,"With 2025 fast approaching, certain digital assets are capturing attention. HYPE, ADA, XYZ, SEI, and NEAR are making waves with advancements and community growth. This article examines these assets, uncovering what makes them unique and how they might shape the digital landscape in the near future. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $13 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.003333 . At the next 13th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.005 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Hyperliquid: Fast, Fee-Free Trading on a New Blockchain Platform Hyperliquid is changing the world of decentralized finance with it’s a new blockchain that was made from scratch to be quick and useful. The blockchain makes sure that transactions are swift and safe by using its own mechanism called HyperBFT. With HyperBFT, traders do not have to wait when you trade on Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid stands out because it also lets people trade perpetual futures without having to pay gas expenses. That’s right—there are no extra charges to worry about as everything happens on-chain, so all transactions are safe and clear. The blockchain platform is in a good position to make a huge difference since it has a team of professionals from leading universities and IT businesses. Cardano’s ADA: The Green Blockchain Revolution A lot of people are interested in Cardano in the crypto market. ADA is Cardano’s own coin, and it competes with Ethereum’s ETH. Cardano is a blockchain that was developed to support smart contracts. This means that developers may create new cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance apps, and games here. Cardano is distinct because it aims to be beneficial for the planet. It uses a system called Ouroboros, which doesn’t need as much energy as proof-of-work models do. Cardano’s blockchain has two levels: one for processing transactions and the other for running smart contracts. This design might allow it manage as many as a million transactions per second. ADA has a lot of prospects in the crypto market. Many people appreciate Cardano’s environmental benefits, particularly as concerns about the impact of cryptocurrencies on the environment grow. Ethereum has been the greatest choice for smart contracts, but Cardano’s way of doing things uses less energy and can develop. In 2021, Cardano native tokens were added, which made smart contracts safer and cheaper to use. ADA is a wonderful choice for people who want things to work well and last. SEI: A Sector-Specific Layer 1 Blockchain for Trading Sei is getting a lot of attention because it is the first Layer 1 blockchain for trade. The blockchain is quick and effective because it can handle a lot of orders every second and complete transactions in just 380 milliseconds. Sei is making itself look like a strong platform for the future of online trading. It has support from big companies and a strong promise to keep things safe. If Sei’s currency hits its highest price forecast, analysts say it could go up by 323.76% by 2030. This potential sets Sei apart from other businesses in the current market cycle. Sei’s unique approach to things could be its biggest strength, unlike other blockchains that try to do too much. In an industry where speed and safety are very important, Sei’s unique technology stands out. Sei’s one-of-a-kind service could give it an edge over other companies as more people trade and want things to happen faster. Sei could be a coin to watch if you’re an investor who wants to keep up with what’s going on in the blockchain world. NEAR Protocol: A Fresh Start for Scalable and Decentralized Apps The NEAR Protocol blockchain platform is meant to help developers who are making decentralized applications (dApps) by making their lives easier. NEAR makes things more efficient and scalable by using a technology called sharding, which is what their Nightshade solution does. This means it can do more transactions at faster speeds and for less money. Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin started the project, and it has gotten the attention of big venture firms, which have given it more than $20 million. NEAR works on a distributed network, which is like centralized data storage systems but with the benefits of being decentralized. NEAR stands out because it cares about how well different systems work together and how easy it is for users to use. The Rainbow Bridge makes it easy to move tokens between NEAR and Ethereum, which makes it possible for people to work together and grow. Aurora, a Layer 2 solution on NEAR, also uses Ethereum’s technology to improve performance and lower costs. NEAR is a good choice in the current market cycle because it is scalable and has low transaction costs. It is a strong competitor in the blockchain space because of its unique approach to sharding and focus on helping developers. Conclusion Though HYPE, ADA, SEI, and NEAR show promise, XYZ’s sports memecoin aspires to unmatched growth, blending meme culture and sports in a community-driven ecosystem.

The early believers who bought Bitcoin at $0.10 and watched it soar to thousands. Today, that moment seems like a legend—something that passed you by. But what if you had a second chance? What if you could go back in time… and this time, do it right? A growing number of crypto veterans believe that moment is here again, just in a new form. It’s called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), and it’s quietly becoming one of the most serious contenders for the next generational wealth wave. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: More Than Just a Coin Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s building on its core—scarcity, decentralization, and security—but reshaping it for scalability, sustainability, and utility. Imagine Bitcoin if it was launched today, designed for mobile-first users, equipped with smart contract functionality, and cross-chain compatibility baked in from day one. With a fixed supply of 21 million tokens, BTC-S mirrors Bitcoin’s scarcity but adds layers of innovation that make it usable in today’s fast-paced DeFi world. From the upcoming Solaris Nova app, which will allow users to mine directly from mobile phones , to enterprise-ready smart contracts, BTC-S is gearing up to dominate across sectors. How Bitcoin Solaris Delivers at Lightning Speed Unlike the original Bitcoin network, which can struggle under transaction load, Bitcoin Solaris runs on a dual-layer architecture. The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) for decentralization and security. The Solaris Layer, on the other hand, uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for rapid speed and minimal energy use. Performance Highlights: Base Layer: Up to 3,000 TPS Solaris Layer: Up to 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality Smart contracts written in Rust Uses Solana’s tooling and Proof-of-History to accelerate adoption And yes—the Solaris Nova app will allow anyone with a smartphone to participate in mobile mining, creating daily income from something already in your hand. From Zero to Wealth—How BTC-S Levels the Crypto Playing Field BTC-S Tokenomics: Scarcity, Utility, and Fair Distribution Bitcoin Solaris follows a structured tokenomics model that reflects both fairness and forward-thinking strategy. 66.66% for mining rewards over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% each for development, community, staking, and marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This balanced approach ensures long-term community alignment while incentivizing adoption and growth at every stage. Presale Frenzy: The Final Hours of This Phase Today marks the last day of the current presale phase, with BTC-S still priced at just $5 . With a launch price of $20, early backers are looking at a potential 1,900% return. The presale is exploding—over 11,000 unique users have already joined, raising more than $1.8 million. Why the buzz? Because this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market, with less than 9 weeks left until launch. Momentum is building—and fast. And if you want to stay plugged in? The project is active across platforms like Telegram and X , where real-time updates and conversations are heating up. A Word on Trust and Community Validation Security is critical. That’s why Bitcoin Solaris has undergone dual smart contract audits, one by Cyberscope and another by Freshcoins . In addition, a full KYC verification has been completed, increasing investor confidence as the ecosystem grows. In addition, crypto enthusiasts are already calling this “the one they won’t miss again.” A detailed review by Crypto Volt breaks down exactly why Bitcoin Solaris is drawing attention from investors, influencers, and analysts alike. And judging by the community energy, this could be just the beginning. Conclusion: You Wished for a Do-Over—Now It’s Here Bitcoin at ten cents felt like a once-in-a-lifetime moment. But every cycle brings new chances to those who are watching closely. Bitcoin Solaris offers more than a coin—it offers a complete, scalable, and decentralized platform primed for growth. This might just be your time machine moment.

45325317,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69087,1748685617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Crypto Price Prediction Today: Will Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 10x By The End Of 2025?,https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-price-prediction-today-will-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi coin that has quietly positioned itself as one of the best crypto coins of 2025. Many analysts believe that this coin is massively underpriced and will experience a massive breakout when it goes live. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently in the presale phase, where each coin is going for $0.03. So far, over $9.4 million worth of tokens have been sold, with 11,300 unique buyers participating in the presale. The presale is in phase 5, representing an opportunity to get a 100% ROI based on the $0.06 listing price. So far, over 9% of the tokens for this phase have been sold, which is impressive considering it is barely a week old. MUTM tokens started selling at $0.01 in phase 1, and the price has since increased by 200%. The token price will grow 16.67% in the upcoming phase to $0.035. If you plan to purchase MUTM tokens in the presale, this is your last opportunity to make a 100% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Prediction The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has inspired a lot of confidence in the crypto world. Many analysts predict the price will rise 10x when the tokens go live. At the planned listing price of $0.06, a 10x increase would represent a price of $0.6. With the price still below $1, experts expect the price to rise to $2 in the coming weeks after the launch day price increases. Many analysts believe that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has enough support to reach a $1 billion total value locked due to its unique value proposition. At its current price, analysts have described it as the “best crypto investment” opportunity of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently passed its Certik audit, which opens many doors for the project. For instance, a Certik audit means that getting a listing on a top tier exchange should be easy. Coupled with the team’s dedication to delivering a beta version of the project on listing day, it is expected that top tier crypto exchanges will reach out for an opportunity to be the first to list it. All these factors combined reinforce the analysts’ opinion that the current presale price represents a massive bargain on the expected price. Once it goes public, analysts expect a massive breakout. Beyond The Hype: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that aims to be more than just about the hype. Its main value proposition is the dual-mode lending protocol. This unique DeFi protocol features a P2C mode and a P2P mode. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) mode, lenders and borrowers interact via a shared liquidity pool, governed by an audited smart contract. Lenders deposit funds, and they earn interest on those supplied funds on an annualized percentage yield basis. The interest rate a lender receives is determined by the pool’s utilization rate, which ensures maximum capital efficiency. Additionally, lenders get access to instant liquidity via mtTokens. For example, when a lender deposits $3,000 worth of BNB, they receive mtBNB tokens. These tokens can be used as collateral for new loans on the platform. The mtTokens, which are based on the ERC20 token standard, can also be freely moved to secondary marketplaces, allowing holders to take advantage of market opportunities. In the peer-to-peer (P2P) mode, users directly negotiate rates on more speculative assets like the BONK meme coin. These are assets whose volatility is often high, which causes many DeFi protocols to exclude them. The genius Mutuum Finance (MUTM) solution is to create unique smart contracts where lenders and borrowers can trade in them, without affecting the overall stability of the protocol. It ensures that holders of these tokens have a chance to actively participate in the DeFi world and accrue interest on their assets. To ensure the overall stability of the ecosystem, all loans, where P2C or P2P must be overcollateralized. The overcollateralization is monitored via a stability factor, which measures how secure the collateral backing a loan is. If the value of the collateral dips below a set level, a liquidation occurs. Liquidators then step in to buy back the debt at a discount, which helps to stabilize the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that could experience a 10x increase in value on listing day, due to its unique value proposition. For early supporters of the project, gains of up to 20x are possible at the current presale price.

According to reports, the grand jury handed up the indictment against the suspect, William Duplessie. The information was made available to the public by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, noting that the indictment will remain sealed until his arraignment on June 11. According to authorities, Duplessie is facing charges of assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and possession of a weapon, with authorities charging him alongside his co-conspirator, John Woeltz. Meanwhile, his legal representative is yet to comment on the indictment. United States court to arraign second suspect in crypto kidnapping incident According to prosecutors, William Duplessie and fellow crypto investor John Woeltz lured the victim to a posh townhouse in Manhattan’s Soho neighborhood on May 6 by threatening to kill his family members. The Italian native, whose identity has still not been revealed by authorities, said he was held captive at the apartment for 17 days. He mentioned that the two criminals took turns to torture him with electrical wires, forcing him to smoke from a crack pipe, and at a point, dangled him from a staircase of a five-story building. The victim mentioned that he decided to hand over the passwords to his device to the assailants on a Friday morning, managing to flee as his captors went to retrieve the device. The decision of the grand jury followed a brief appearance made by Duplessie on Friday morning in a Manhattan court. The judge also mentioned in court that a protective order was still in effect, though refusing to mention who it was concerning. Duplessie, who is listed as a founder at various blockchain-based firms was escorted in handcuffs and wore a prison jumpsuit. Meanwhile, according to previous reports, Woeltz was denied bail at his court hearing, with the judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in custody. His defense attorney had reportedly sought his release on a $2 million bond, noting that he has a degree in philosophy, among many other things. The 24-year-old woman Beatrice Folchi who was also initially arrested and charged alongside Woeltz has also been freed, with prosecutors announcing the dismissal of the charges against her in court, pending further investigations. New York City police commence investigations into two detectives The New York Police Department has confirmed that it is looking into two detectives in connection to the case. The NYPD mentioned to news outlets that its officers “were modified” and “the matter is under internal review.” According to the New York Post, one of the two detectives served as a security detail to Mayor Eric Adams. The police mentioned that both detectives acted as private security for Woeltz and Duplessie after they had clocked out of their shifts for the day. According to reports, one of the detectives is suspected of having driven the alleged victim, the 22-year-old Italian crypto millionaire, from the airport to the townhouse where the incident occurred. The other detective has also been accused of working with the captors in an “unauthorized capacity” during the period. The police department mentioned that both officers have since been placed on desk duties as the investigations continue. “It sounds like they just circumvented the process. Perhaps they were tempted by the allure of the salary, right? Salary comes into play,” said Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD detective and current professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He added that sometimes, the money is worth it and officers always want to take a chance if they see it. However, he added that if officers do it without authorization, it could get them suspended or fired. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, recently called it a “big step forward” in a post on X. It reflects a growing belief that the U.S. may finally be moving toward meaningful regulation for digital assets. A big step forward: the bipartisan CLARITY Act builds on momentum for comprehensive crypto rules in the U.S. Clarity shouldn’t be controversial — and this bill moves us closer to a smart, workable framework. Thank you to @RepFrenchHill , @CongressmanGT , @RepAngieCraig ,… https://t.co/po9dd9GCEk — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) May 30, 2025 This bipartisan bill could give the American crypto industry the structure it needs to thrive, while putting the U.S. back in the race for global leadership in digital finance. What Is the Clarity Act All About? The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act aims to solve one of the biggest problems in the U.S. crypto market – regulatory confusion. Introduced by Chairman French Hill and supported by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, the bill outlines a clear split of responsibilities between the SEC and the CFTC. It also proposes a national licensing framework that would make it easier for crypto businesses to comply with regulations. This could create healthy competition, attract more innovation, and include tailored rules for stablecoins to fit their unique financial role. The goal is to reduce uncertainty for crypto companies and investors and bring more clarity to how digital assets are governed. AI Transparency Takes Center Stage The bill doesn’t stop at crypto. It also introduces new rules around artificial intelligence. Specifically, it requires federal agencies to publicly disclose how they’re using AI in their regulatory processes. This includes information about what the AI does, its limitations, and how much it costs. According to Representative Bryan Steil, this type of transparency is essential to building trust to the “golden age” we are in now. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act has been introduced. It's time to bring CLARITY to the golden age of digital assets. https://t.co/UtzZySqcNS — Bryan Steil (@RepBryanSteil) May 29, 2025 Ripple’s Alderoty Backs the Move Stuart Alderoty has been a long-time advocate for smart crypto laws, and the Clarity Act lines up with his vision. In his post, he praised the lawmakers who have pushed the bill forward, including French Hill, GT Thompson, Angie Craig, Dusty Johnson, Don Davis, Bryan Steil, and Ritchie Torres. Alderoty believes this bill could bring the U.S. closer to the level of regulatory clarity already seen in other countries. He also sees it as a step toward encouraging more institutional investment and helping crypto businesses operate with greater confidence. More Crypto Laws in the Pipeline: GENIUS and STABLE Acts The GENIUS Act, passed by a 66-32 Senate vote on May 20, 2025, mandates 1:1 reserve backing allowing banks and non-banks to issue them under tiered management. Concerned by Senator Warren about weak protections, it awaits a June vote. Additionally, given consumer safety, the STABLE Act , which was presented by Representatives Hill and Steil, prohibits FDIC claims and suspends algorithmic stablecoins for two years. A Defining Moment for U.S. Crypto? With major crypto players like Ripple backing it and bipartisan support in Congress, the Clarity Act could be a turning point for crypto regulation in the United States. By encouraging innovation, protecting consumers, and creating a clearer legal framework, this legislation has the potential to finally unlock the U.S. crypto market’s full potential. The world is watching closely. If passed, this bill could help the U.S. move from playing catch-up to leading the global digital asset revolution.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|GT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 10:01:19

The Graph price is expected to go as high as $1.00 in 2025. GRT price with a potential surge could reach a maximum of $3.54 by 2030. AI may be taking center stage in today’s tech revolution, but behind every smart application lies the challenge of accessing and organizing reliable data. That’s where The Graph (GRT) steps in—an innovative indexing protocol transforming how blockchain data is queried. As interest in The Graph surges, especially after its major 2025 upgrades and the launch of substreams-powered subgraphs, the question on everyone’s mind is: Can GRT price reach $1?

In the past 6 months, the number of queries sent was 12.1 billion queries. The growing ecosystem means strength increasing on fundamental levels, which is the core element for mass adoption to come in the future. The GRT price could benefit strongly in the coming future, as many factors are aligned optimistically for the crypto. As seen on its weekly chart, its price action appears to be following previous patterns, where the $0.08 support block has played a key role in previous bullish runs. It is seen in the past that after every multi-month period of correction, the breakout is strong. This time also, the GRT price has been spending a lot of months in correction, but like historical patterns, witnessed. The price action in Q2 2025, the GRT price has reacted to the $0.08 level again, which is the same support block that has shown strong demand before. If in May 2025 GRT price succeeds in breaking a declining trendline, representing the current multi-month correction, then a humongous surge is awaiting that could lead to a parabolic rise to $1, but a $0.55 high is a must for its price to reach that level. Moreover, its transaction USD volume is consistently on the rise, and user addresses interacting with the platform in the past 30 days have become stronger, too.

ETF provider REX Shares recently filed to introduce these groundbreaking funds using unconventional regulatory structures that have attracted considerable industry attention. The staking feature has long been considered a critical missing piece in crypto ETF offerings, especially since spot Ether ETFs went live in July 2024. Several executives have argued that without staking, these ETFs remain incomplete. Now, REX Shares appears to be addressing that gap through a novel legal and regulatory setup. Rare C-Corp Structure Used to Avoid Delays Unlike most ETFs, the proposed REX Shares funds are structured as C-corporations—an uncommon format in the ETF space. ETF analyst James Seyffart described the approach as “very rare” in a May 30 post on X, noting that it allows the funds to sidestep the typical 19b-4 filing process with the SEC. “These ETFs are 40-act funds with a unique structure and do not go through the 19b-4 process,” Seyffart explained. This has enabled REX Shares to potentially fast-track approval, while other firms, such as Bitwise, continue to await SEC decisions on similar proposals . In its filing, REX Shares clarified that the fund will be taxed as a C-corporation, meaning it will incur current and deferred tax expenses. These will be reflected in the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV), a key detail for investors evaluating the fund’s long-term performance. Crypto ETF Staking Ahead? Seyffart added that the REX Shares ETFs will gain exposure to Solana and Ether through Cayman-based subsidiaries and aim to stake at least 50% of their holdings. “This is a bunch of clever legal and regulatory workarounds to get these products to market,” he said, emphasizing that while the structure has trade-offs, it seems to have found favor with regulators. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, echoed the sentiment, saying, “Looks like two crypto ETF launches are imminent,” and noting that staking is the major innovation that could make these ETFs more attractive to long-term investors. Even major firms like BlackRock have acknowledged the importance of staking . In March, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, called their Ether ETF a “tremendous success,” but admitted it was “less perfect” without staking. That may soon change if REX Shares’ approach proves successful.

45327081,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738383,1748689210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45327081.jpeg,"Japan endures $12 billion in weekly withdrawal from stocks, largest in its history",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japan-stocks-see-record-12b-weekly-outflow/,"Japanese stocks just recorded the biggest weekly outflow in history, as $11.8 billion was yanked out between last Wednesday and this week, according to data reported by Bank of America. The sell-off came as yields on long-dated government bonds exploded to all-time highs, driven by investor fears about Japan’s ballooning fiscal deficit. The cash exit from Japan didn’t happen in isolation. Globally, equity markets lost $9.5 billion over the same period — the highest for the year. US stocks lost $5.1 billion, while European equities brought in $1 billion, a rare contrast as Japan dealt with the most intense capital flight it’s ever seen. Source: TradingView Bond demand crashes as yields surge Yields on 40-year Japanese government bonds hit 3.689% on Thursday, which is also a record. They later dropped to 3.318%, still nearly 70 basis points higher than where they were at the start of the year. 30-year yields also jumped over 60 basis points to 2.914%, while 20-year yields rose over 50 basis points. That came right after demand for a new batch of 40-year debt fell to its weakest level since July 2023, based on calculations by Reuters. The collapse in demand followed a critical change in market structure. Japanese life insurance companies, usually reliable buyers of long-term bonds, have already fulfilled their regulatory quotas, according to Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager on the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments. With them out of the picture and the Bank of Japan scaling back its bond purchases, yields have nowhere to go but up. This spike in yields has massive implications outside Japan. Investors are now worried about a possible return of funds to Japan from the United States, especially if Japanese bond yields start to look more attractive than US returns. Albert Edwards, global strategist at Societe Generale, said this could trigger what he called a “global financial market Armageddon.” He pointed out that if Japanese investors move their money home, the first to get hit will be US tech stocks, which have seen huge inflows from Japan over the years. Michael Gayed, portfolio manager at Tidal Financial Group, warned that the situation is more dangerous than people think. “Japan looks like a ticking time bomb. If confidence in one of the financial market’s traditionally safe assets has cratered, confidence in the global market could go with it,” Michael said. Carry trades start to unwind as yen rises The surge in bond yields is also threatening to unwind the yen carry trade, a strategy where investors borrow in yen, which normally has low interest rates, and invest the money in higher-yielding foreign assets. That setup only works when the yen stays weak. But now, with yields surging and capital starting to return home, the yen has strengthened more than 8% since the beginning of 2025. That previous carry trade unwind happened when the Bank of Japan raised rates in August 2024, leading to a sharp yen rally and a big sell-off in global markets. Now the setup is even worse. Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, warned that “the carry trade unwinding that is about to ensue will be worse than that in August 2024.” Alicia said the stronger yen, pushed higher by capital returning and investors dumping dollars, can’t be sustained for long. But for now, it’s gaining steam, and it’s dragging global markets into deeper volatility. The stakes are high because Japan holds ¥533.05 trillion ($3.7 trillion) in net external assets, the second-largest in the world. When that kind of capital starts moving back home, it throws off global liquidity and raises borrowing costs across the board. David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy, said that tightening liquidity could push global growth down to 1% and stretch the bear market even further. He also said this is the end of the idea that the US is the default winner in global investing, a sentiment now spreading in Europe and China. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

As blockchain innovation focuses on usefulness and sustainability, this AI-powered network draws users and developers with a strong design and a presale that has already raised $3.4 million in USDT. Nexchain, which is now in stage 16 and costs $0.062, is more than another Layer 1 project. It’s a purpose-built infrastructure combines artificial intelligence and decentralized technologies to provide a smarter, quicker, and more equitable Web3 experience. The presale window provides a unique opportunity to participate in a project that is already gaining popularity before it enters the mainstream. Nexchain, the Intelligent Future of Blockchain Nexchain is reinventing what is possible in blockchain by incorporating artificial intelligence directly into its protocol. This enables real-time optimization and adaptive consensus, granting the network a significant speed advantage. Nexchain, with a transaction throughput of up to 400,000 TPS and costs as low as $0.001, provides an efficient, scalable alternative to traditional blockchains. The first outstanding feature is its AI-powered hybrid consensus, which combines Proof-of-Stake and machine learning to improve security and minimize latency. Then there’s Smart Contracts 2.0, intelligent contracts that optimize themselves based on network circumstances, bringing automation to DeFi, logistics, and IoT. Nexchain supports cross-chain interoperability, enabling smooth asset and data flows between major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain. With a DAO-first paradigm, consumers are immediately rewarded. By storing NEX in a non-custodial wallet, users earn daily payouts of 10% of the network’s gas fee revenue. These features are not future promises; they are part of Nexchain’s current and developing infrastructure. Nexchain, which was priced at $0.062 at presale stage 16, raised $3.4 million USDT, reflecting its expanding importance. Real-World Applications Nexchain’s AI-blockchain integration enables a wide range of use cases. In finance, it allows automated credit scoring and real-time fraud detection. Nexchain’s Smart Contracts 2.0 enables secure and confidential data sharing between organizations in the healthcare industry.

It’s a passive investment with genuine rewards backed by a well-audited infrastructure. Nexchain leads the Presale List of 2025 As crypto investors seek more than simply buzz, Nexchain offers a presale grounded on technology and value. Its AI-enhanced scalability, cross-chain capability, and community-first governance result in a balanced and long-lasting blockchain solution. The enthusiasm is clear with a presale price of $0.062 and stage 16 already raising $3.4 million in USDT.

Yet here we are, years later, still pulling out credit cards at coffee shops while our crypto sits unused in digital wallets. SpacePay tackles this challenge with a payment platform that features a 0.5% transaction fee, works with over 325 crypto wallets, and provides instant fiat settlements for merchants. The London-based startup has already raised over $1 million during their ongoing presale, with $SPY tokens currently priced at $0.003181. Crypto Payments Without the Technical Mess Ask any shop owner why they don’t accept Bitcoin, and they’ll mention the complicated setup or expensive equipment. SpacePay cuts through this complexity with a simple solution that works with existing Android payment terminals. No expensive hardware needed. Just a quick software update. The NFC functionality allows customers to simply tap their smartphones against payment terminals, just like contactless credit cards. This familiar gesture makes crypto payments feel natural and effortless. The system works with over 325 different cryptocurrency wallets. Whether you store crypto on a hardware wallet or keep everything on your phone, SpacePay processes the payment smoothly. This compatibility means customers can use what they already have instead of downloading another app. Protecting Merchants From Price Swings Here’s the nightmare that keeps businesses away from crypto: a customer pays with Bitcoin for a $100 purchase in the morning, but by afternoon, that payment is only worth $85 because the market crashed. SpacePay solves this with technology that protects merchants from volatility completely. When someone pays with Bitcoin, the business owner gets regular currency immediately. That $100 sale stays exactly $100 in their bank account, whether Bitcoin crashes or soars five minutes later. The system freezes the exchange rate during the transaction. If Bitcoin’s price suddenly drops, SpacePay absorbs the difference instead of passing that risk to the merchant. Store owners don’t need to become crypto traders. They just see normal payments without the crypto drama. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1925613304023511376 Slashing Payment Costs That Hurt Small Businesses Credit card processing fees take between 2.5% and 3.5% from every transaction. Consider a local bookstore doing $30,000 in monthly sales. With traditional payment systems, they’re paying roughly $900 each month in processing fees. SpacePay changes this with their 0.5% transaction fee. That same bookstore would only pay $150 monthly – keeping an extra $750 every month. Over a year, that’s $9,000 staying in the business instead of going to payment processors. These savings come from eliminating unnecessary middlemen. Traditional systems bounce your money between multiple companies before reaching the merchant days later. SpacePay creates a direct path using blockchain technology, which maintains security while cutting excessive fees. Making Crypto Practical for Daily Life The technology behind SpacePay might be sophisticated, but the user experience is refreshingly simple. Most payment systems process transactions like cars moving through a single-lane tunnel – checking one thing at a time before moving to the next step. SpacePay takes a completely different approach. Think of it like having multiple security guards checking different aspects of an ID simultaneously. SpacePay checks wallet details, crypto balances, merchant info, and exchange rates all at once. This parallel processing explains why Bitcoin payments complete in seconds rather than minutes. Nobody stands around awkwardly waiting for confirmations. The transaction happens fast enough that it feels like any other payment method. Every transaction gets permanently recorded on the blockchain. It creates tamper-proof records protected by serious encryption. This distributed approach not only speeds things up but makes the entire system more secure than traditional payment methods. The platform handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes. Customers and merchants just see a clean, simple payment experience that works reliably every time. No technical knowledge required on either side of the transaction. The really clever part is how SpacePay handles the conversion from crypto to regular money. Most systems make this feel like two separate steps – first the crypto payment, then the conversion. SpacePay makes it feel like one smooth transaction where Bitcoin goes in and dollars come out seamlessly. Visit SpacePay Presale Real-World Adoption That Actually Works SpacePay isn’t building a solution for some theoretical future. They’re addressing real problems that prevent Bitcoin from being useful today. The platform already has plans to roll out across 4.5 million Android-based payment terminals in nine countries. This ambitious expansion works because SpacePay doesn’t force businesses to replace equipment they already own. The software-update approach means widespread adoption becomes possible without massive infrastructure investments. Early merchants testing the system report positive experiences. They appreciate the lower fees, instant settlements, and the fact that accepting Bitcoin doesn’t require becoming crypto experts. Customers enjoy finally being able to spend their digital assets at regular businesses without jumping through hoops. The $SPY token powers this ecosystem with features that extend beyond simple payments. Token holders receive monthly loyalty rewards, voting rights on platform decisions, and revenue sharing from transaction fees. This community-driven approach creates incentives for everyone to want SpacePay to succeed. How to Join the SpacePay Presale For those interested in joining the SpacePay ecosystem, the ongoing presale offers an entry point.

By integrating blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, DePIN projects are offering unique advantages for both consumers and producers, catching the eye of innovators and investors alike. This article highlights the top 10 DePIN coins to watch in 2025. These tokens stand out due to their strong market capitalizations and promising price trends, making them noteworthy players in this evolving sector. The Top 10 DePIN Coins Helium (HNT) HNT, the native token of Helium, is one of the top DePIN crypto projects consistently gaining attention from traders and long-term holders. This growing interest and confidence in the asset are not only due to the quality of the crypto project but also because the token is available for grabs at a lower price. HNT with its price below the 9-week SMA (3.65), showing weakness. However, the RSI at 42.46 suggests it is approaching oversold territory, hinting at potential accumulation. Despite recent weakness, HNT appears to be forming a base around $3. With RSI nearing oversold levels and historical bounce zones aligning, 2025 could bring a strong recovery. A break above $4.50 may trigger the HNT price momentum toward $7–9 resistance. Bittensor (TAO) Bittensor (TAO) price has recently bounced from around $366, closing strong at $401.5. The RSI has rebounded from near-oversold territory to 47.77, hinting at renewed bullish momentum. The price is currently reclaiming the 9-day SMA, which if held, could confirm a continuation of the uptrend seen since April. If TAO continues forming higher lows and breaks above $440 resistance, 2025 could see it revisiting all-time highs. With positive market sentiment and growing adoption of decentralized AI, TAO may exhibit strong bullish performance through 2025, potentially surpassing previous peaks and entering price discovery. Filecoin (FIL) FIL, the native token of Filecoin , is priced at $2.692 and is currently closing below the 9-week SMA, indicating short-term bearish momentum. The RSI is at 39.80, near oversold levels, which makes it a good buy for long-term investment. Despite being below key resistance and in a downtrend, past cycles show strong rebounds from similar zones, especially after prolonged consolidation phases. If macro sentiment improves and FIL reclaims the $3 level, a 2025 rally could push prices toward the $6–8 range. Theta Network (THETA) Theta (THETA), a popular and leading DePIN crypto project, has faced challenges since the beginning of December 2024. THETA is down -16.46% to $0.774 this week, trading below the 9-week SMA. is showing signs of nearing a bottom as it approaches strong historical support near $0.70. With RSI dipping below 40, it’s entering a key accumulation zone where past rallies began. If Theta price holds this level and breaks above the 9-week SMA, momentum could shift bullish. As market sentiment improves, THETA may target $1.50–$2.00 levels in 2025. Given previous explosive moves from similar patterns, a breakout from consolidation could trigger significant upside in the next bull cycle. Internet Computer (ICP) ICP is currently trading below the 9-day SMA at $5.158, forming a strong accumulation zone around $4.50–$5.00, which historically has been a launchpad for bullish moves. The RSI is at 38.71, near oversold territory, indicating potential for a reversal. As the broader crypto market turns bullish, ICP’s strong fundamentals like scalable smart contracts and Web3 infrastructure could help the ICP price break above the $6 level before heading toward the $10 milestone. IOTA (IOTA) Following the presidential election results , IOTA has gained widespread attention from crypto enthusiasts. IOTA is currently consolidating above its historical support zone and below its 9-week SMA at $0.1972. However, the RSI is at 44.98—near neutral, suggesting consolidation rather than severe bearishness. A long-term base seems to be forming between $0.15–$0.20, historically a key accumulation zone. As the IOTA ecosystem expands with smart contract adoption and integration with IoT networks, investor confidence is likely to grow. A breakout above $0.30 could trigger IOTA price to rally toward $0.50 and beyond in 2025. With increased utility, strategic partnerships, and broader Web3 adoption, IOTA is well-positioned to outperform in the coming crypto bull cycle. Render (RENDER) Render Token is positioned at a key support zone, below the 9-week SMA at $4.198. RSI at 43.45 suggests short-term bearish pressure but not oversold. Despite recent pullbacks, RNDR remains a top contender in the AI and GPU rendering space, fueling Web3 infrastructure. With rising demand for decentralized compute power in AI and 3D rendering, Render could surge as adoption grows. A sustained breakout above $6 could trigger Render price to move to retest 2024 highs near $12. Arweave (AR) Arweave is showing signs of bottoming out around a critical support zone, with RSI near oversold levels hinting at a possible reversal. As the premier decentralized storage solution for permanent data, Arweave stands to benefit from the surging demand for immutable blockchain-based storage, particularly from AI and NFT sectors. Its historical performance proves its ability to rally explosively from consolidation zones. Arweave price recovery above the $10 mark could trigger momentum toward retesting $25 and beyond. With Web3’s expansion and increasing interest in permanent data archiving, Arweave could reclaim its former highs in 2025 as confidence and network adoption grow. Akash Network (AKT) AKT price is trading at $1.235, below its 9-day SMA of $1.446, showing recent bearish momentum. The current downtrend offers a strategic entry as RSI dips near oversold territory at 36.11, hinting at a rebound. Akash Network is positioning itself as a decentralized cloud provider in an AI-driven world increasingly reliant on scalable compute. As demand for GPU infrastructure grows, Akash’s unique decentralized marketplace for compute could see explosive adoption. With its strong fundamentals and increasing developer interest, a recovery above $2 could ignite momentum towards previous highs and beyond. AIOZ Network (AIOZ) AIOZ Network focused on decentralized content delivery, is uniquely positioned to benefit from growing Web3 media infrastructure demands. The recent price correction has brought it near technical support, with RSI indicating potential for a bullish reversal. As partnerships grow and decentralized streaming gains momentum, AIOZ could ride the next wave of adoption. If bullish sentiment returns to the broader market and AIOZ reclaims the $0.50–$0.60 zone, it could quickly revisit 2025 highs and potentially break new ground. With solid fundamentals and increasing developer traction, AIOZ could emerge as a key infrastructure token in the decentralized digital content economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Despite new gaming utility, Pi coin faces selling pressure, dropping over 9%, with analysts predicting a possible slide to $0.40 before recovery. Pi Network is entering the gaming space to boost activity and show real use for its tools. The Pi Core Team has officially launched FruityPi, a new game app built to showcase how Pi’s tools, like the Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network, can be smoothly integrated into real-world applications. The Pi Core Team sees gaming as a perfect way to mix fun with real utility. Developers can benefit from Pi’s large, active community by getting more users, signups, and attention for their games. Gaming is a strong fit for driving fun, engagement, and utility in the Pi ecosystem. The new FruityPi game app shows how integration with multiple Pi products like Pi cryptocurrency, Pi Wallet, and Pi Ad Network can benefit developers, while leveraging what the Pi community has… pic.twitter.com/8X8ULVYXEk — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) May 30, 2025 Pi Network Boosts Gaming with Real Utility Pi Network is inviting developers to build with its tools, like the Pi Wallet for in-game currencies and the Pi Ad Network for monetization. If the game becomes popular within the Pi ecosystem, then users could also apply to Pi Network Ventures. Earlier this month, PiCore launched a $100 million fund , Pi Network Ventures, to back projects building decentralized apps on Pi’s platform. Analyst Mr Spock shared a live example of real utility on the Pi Mainnet from the Fruity Pi app. He shared three key takeaways: Firstly, the mainnet utility is active, and Pi is being spent and accepted in real apps, which shows real adoption. Next, Sellers are independently setting their prices, such as 0.1 Pi for a power-up, so there are no fixed rates like the GCV (Global Consensus Value). Finally, the price is fully decentralized and controlled by developers and users, and not the Pi Core Team. He shared that this is a real example of real utility, real payment, and real decentralization at work, where the power to decide the price lies with the community. Pi Coin Drops Over 9% Pi coin is currently trading at $0.6177, and is down over 9% in the past day. Around 9.8 million tokens are set to be unlocked today, which will further add to the selling pressure. If Pi coin falls below the key level of $0.60, it could slide to April’s low of $0.40. Most technical indicators for Pi Coin show a bearish trend, with many oscillators and moving averages signaling “Sell” or “Neutral.” Overall, the charts point to a continued downward pressure on the price. Analyst Dr Altcoin has said that Pi’s price will likely drop until the end of August and then gradually recover. He says it could go down to $0.40, unless the Pi Core Team becomes more transparent. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

45328098,https://invezz.com/?p=2743114,1748689800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,MUTM could be the breakout token of 2025 after recent certik audit success,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/31/mutm-could-be-the-breakout-token-of-2025-after-recent-certik-audit-success/,"After a slow start in 2025, the altcoin season has now arrived, with breakout candidates already identified by analysts. One such project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is showing all the signs of a project on the verge of a massive surge. To further reinforce this sentiment, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project recently passed a Certik audit, making it one of the most trusted presale projects available to investors. The results of the audit have provided a massive boost in trust in the project, which has led to an acceleration in the pace of the presale. Despite being less than a week old, over 9% of the tokens reserved for the current phase have been bought. So far, over $9.4 million worth of presale tokens have been bought by over 11,300 unique buyers. The token presale is in phase 5, where each token is priced at $0.03. At this price, investors are guaranteed a 100% return on listing day, when the tokens will launch at $0.06. Those who got in at Phase 1 of the presale were lucky to get their tokens at $0.01. In the upcoming phase, the token price is set to increase by 16.67% to $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rides the utility wave One of the factors working in favor of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is timing. The project comes at a time when meme coin fatigue is setting in. Looking at social media posts on meme coins, many of them increasingly express a negative attitude towards the concept. Investors are now searching for utility-backed projects that can deliver long-term, stable growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) liquidity protocol aims to fulfill this niche. The protocol has three key participants: lenders, borrowers, and liquidators. Lenders and borrowers interact through two primary modes, which are P2P and P2C. In the P2C mode, or peer-to-contract, lenders deposit their assets in a collective pool from which they earn an annualized interest rate on their assets. The rate is determined dynamically based on the pool’s utilization rate. When many borrowers take up loans from a pool, the interest rate rises, which encourages more depositors to join the pool. In the peer-to-peer or P2P mode, lenders and borrowers interact directly and trade in high-volatility assets like the SHIB meme coin. These meme coins are kept in separate smart contracts to protect the more stable P2C contracts from undue volatility. The mode is designed to open up earning opportunities for meme coin holders, previously limited to earning through speculative trading. The other key player in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem is the liquidators. Within the protocol, all loans, whether P2P or P2C, are overcollateralized. This is a measure meant to ensure any shifts in the market do not destabilize the protocol. The rate of overcollateralization is constantly monitored via a stability factor. It checks various market signals to ensure that loans do not fall below a certain threshold of overcollateralization. If the collateral gets below the set limit, a position is automatically liquidated. The liquidators then step in and purchase the debt at a discount. By doing so, they make a small profit while also helping to keep bad debt out of the protocol. Growth through dividends The overall design of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to produce long-term value growth for all participants. One way to achieve this mission is via the use of dividends. Protocol profits are used to buy MUTM tokens at market rates. These purchases not only boost the value of the tokens but also promote the long-term health of the ecosystem by encouraging stakers. The purchased tokens are distributed to stakers as a reward for maintaining the security of the protocol. Since all purchases are on-chain and transparent, this incentivizes more stakers to sign up to get these rewards. It will ensure the long-term growth of the ecosystem as more stakers join in and deepen the protocol’s liquidity. Who can join Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does not impose restrictions like the legacy financial system. You do not need to sign long, complex documents or submit your data. The whole protocol is decentralized, and the price of admission is currently at a low $0.03. Given the promised utility and the lofty projects by analysts, joining the MUTM token presale could be one of your best crypto investment decisions of 2025.

The announcement, part of a broader strategy to attract crypto and AI firms, has triggered an immediate backlash from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and for good reason. As the country wrestles with severe energy shortages and ongoing bailout talks, the IMF is demanding urgent answers. According to Samaa , officials are now facing “stiff questions” about how legal – or even logical – this mining push really is. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” said one government official involved in the negotiations. Here’s what you should know. Pakistan’s Crypto Play Falls Flat The plan, unveiled alongside the debut of Pakistan’s first Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference, was meant to signal a pivot toward digital finance. But the optics don’t match the infrastructure. Pakistan’s power grid is notoriously unreliable, with high transmission losses and blackouts still common. Meanwhile, industrial electricity rates hover around $0.22 per kWh – nearly 10x what miners pay in Texas. At that rate, mining one Bitcoin in Pakistan would cost a staggering $132,000, compared to the global average of around $40,000-$50,000. Even with a proposed subsidized tariff of $0.09/kWh, “the model falls apart,” warns local engineer Sana Zakir. “These subsidies may not be sustainable. Pakistan’s agreements with the IMF explicitly discourage blanket energy subsidies.” A Big Bitcoin Bluff! To make matters worse, the IMF claims it wasn’t even consulted about the plan. The Fund has flagged legal ambiguities surrounding crypto in Pakistan, raising red flags over the PDAA – the newly formed Pakistan Digital Asset Authority set to oversee exchanges, DeFi platforms, and tokenization efforts. This is a fundamental red flag. All the Right Ideas, All the Wrong Execution Pakistan does have potential. At least one can argue that it does. Cheap labor, untapped solar and hydro resources, and regional demand could have positioned it well – if the groundwork were there. But right now, it’s not. This was not a strategic move. It was a chaotic attempt to ride a wave without learning how to swim in the kiddy pool. Unless Pakistan overhauls its infrastructure, energy pricing, and regulatory clarity, it risks turning a high-profile initiative into a self-inflicted crisis. It surely wouldn’t be the first time.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 11:19:38

In a filing dated May 30, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Harper has no Fourth Amendment right to shield financial records held by the exchange. The government argued that Harper had voluntarily disclosed the information to Coinbase and that the IRS had acted within the law following a court-approved summons to obtain it. The filing also cited Coinbase’s privacy policy, cautioning users that information could be disclosed to law enforcement. IRS revealed underreporting of tax on gains from digital assets Harper’s case arose from a 2016 IRS investigation of pervasive underreporting of tax on gains from cryptocurrency. The IRS noticed a big difference between the millions of Coinbase users trading Bitcoin and the small number of taxpayers who reported their crypto earnings. Following these findings, the agency issued a “John Doe” summons that required Coinbase to hand over records about customers who trade in large amounts. Harper, who dealt in Bitcoin through Coinbase in relevant years, was against the IRS’s action. He, therefore, sued the agency, alleging that the IRS’s actions constituted an unconstitutional search of his financial information. However, lower courts disagreed with Harper’s claims, concluding that Coinbase’s records are business documents and not Harper’s private papers. They then gave the IRS the go-ahead to access the records. The government argued that Supreme Court precedent is on the IRS’s side. This is because it stressed that people have no expectation of privacy over financial records maintained by third parties Coinbase. It referred to past decisions on cases like United States v. Miller. The Supreme Court has not yet announced if it will take up the case. If it chooses not to, the First Circuit’s decision supporting the IRS will remain intact. The United States v. Miller case on privacy rights Following the United States v. Miller case, the US Supreme Court stated that people have the right to feel safe in their homes, papers, and belongings from unreasonable searches and seizures. This right cannot be violated, and no search warrants can be issued unless there is good reason, backed by an oath or confirmation, that clearly describes where to search and what or who to seize. The main topic of this case was what falls under this protection. If the government wants to search for evidence of a crime against someone, it must get permission first or have special urgent reasons that make the search reasonable. However, if the item being searched for is not protected by the Fourth Amendment and the way the search is conducted within reasonable bounds, then the rules do not apply. Concerning Harper’s case, the government highlighted that the Court of Appeals rightly dismissed the arguments made by the petitioner because they were both against the Court’s past decisions and lacking in merit. Coinbase reveals a data breach incident in its operations On May 15, Coinbase announced that it had been the victim of a data breach, where attackers had bribed support workers to provide them with the firm’s customer data. Customers’ names, account balances, and transaction histories were among the data taken. Coinbase also said the breach affected about 1% of its monthly transacting users. An example of those affected was venture capitalist Roelof Botha, managing partner at Sequoia Capital. Following the incident, Coinbase faced multiple lawsuits. As of May 15 and 16, six legal complaints have been filed, with plaintiffs alleging that the exchange failed to implement adequate security measures and mishandled its response to the breach.

Today, as crypto prices show renewed strength and investors search for the best crypto to invest in, these legacy coins continue to demonstrate resilience through strong fundamentals and expanding use cases. ADA’s smart contract capabilities and XRP’s focus on cross-border payments keep them firmly among the top cryptocurrencies for both long-term and short-term portfolios. However, the spotlight is shifting to new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising new crypto coin poised to capture the attention of those hunting the next big cryptocurrency. The MUTM presale has had over 11,500 members before a token price boost to $0.035 at the start of the next stage. Investors here can make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Will MUTM replicate the explosive growth of ADA and XRP from 2017? The evolving DeFi ecosystem and presale buzz suggest it’s a possibility worth watching. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.7 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 during he next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. Certik Audit Officially Completed, Stablecoin Secures Trust and Stability Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens.

Supreme Court decision could reshape privacy rights for millions of crypto users nationwide. The U.S. government is urging the Supreme Court to dismiss a legal challenge from James Harper, a Coinbase user who claims the IRS violated his constitutional rights by accessing his crypto transaction data. The case touches on a broader debate: do Americans have a right to privacy when it comes to their crypto activity? Background: IRS Targets Crypto Tax Evasion This dispute traces back to a 2016 investigation, where the IRS suspected widespread underreporting of crypto-related income. As part of its probe, the agency issued a court-approved summons to Coinbase, requesting information on high-volume users—including Harper. The IRS has since argued that such records are crucial in enforcing tax compliance and identifying unreported gains in the fast-evolving crypto space. Harper’s Argument: A Constitutional Overreach? Harper contends that the IRS violated his Fourth Amendment rights , which protect U.S. citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. His legal team argues that obtaining detailed financial data without individual suspicion constitutes government overreach into personal digital finance. Legal analysts note that this case could become a landmark in defining digital financial privacy. “The Fourth Amendment was written before the internet, but its spirit is very much alive in cases like this,” one privacy attorney told [news source]. U.S. Government’s Response: No Privacy Over Third-Party Records In a recent filing , Solicitor General D. John Sauer responded that Harper voluntarily provided his data to Coinbase, and therefore waived any reasonable expectation of privacy . The government pointed to legal precedents like U.S. v. Miller, which held that financial data held by third parties—such as banks—do not receive the same constitutional protections. Coinbase’s user agreement, the filing argues, also clearly states that the company may cooperate with law enforcement when required. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Could Shatter Public Trust in Banks, Warns European Central Bank Official , What’s at Stake: Financial Privacy in the Age of Crypto So far, lower courts have sided with the IRS, viewing Coinbase’s records as business data rather than private papers. If the Supreme Court agrees, it could effectively give the green light for broader government access to user data stored on crypto platforms. Legal takeaway: A ruling in favor of the IRS could set a precedent that weakens digital privacy protections for millions of crypto users in the U.S., not just those suspected of wrongdoing. Final Thought While this case may seem narrow, its implications could be broad and long-lasting. At its heart is a fundamental question: does the U.S. Constitution protect crypto financial records the same way it does your personal files and papers? With the Supreme Court yet to weigh in, the future of digital privacy in crypto hangs in the balance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It has dropped by over 36% from its highest point this year. XRP ‘s price dropped for three consecutive days, reaching its lowest level since May 8 as sentiment in the crypto market waned. The ongoing XRP crash led to substantial losses, especially to leveraged traders. Hyperdash data shows that one whale has had an unrealized loss of $2.6 million as the crash accelerated. The whale opened the trade at $2.3715 and applied a 3x leverage. It will be liquidated if it drops to $1.3949, down by about 35% from the current level. Worse, the trader has other long positions on coins like Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), Cardano ( ADA ), and Cosmos ( ATOM ).

The seven-year bonds, featuring a 20% conversion premium , signal CEO Pavel Durov’s long-term vision for Telegram’s evolution from a chat platform into a blockchain-powered super-app and possibly a future IPO. Why Convertible Bonds? Legal Lessons From the SEC This move is a strategic pivot from Telegram’s infamous 2020 Gram token ICO, which ended in a bruising SEC lawsuit and a $1.2 billion refund to investors. Legal experts say the bond structure allows Telegram to sidestep regulatory landmines while keeping equity options open for the future. The bonds, priced at a 20% premium to Telegram’s eventual IPO share price, offer investors a lucrative upside while giving Telegram immediate liquidity and flexibility. If the bonds aren’t converted, they mature in 2032 with a fixed interest rate rumored to be between 5–7%. “After the SEC shut down their ICO, convertible debt was the smart play. It’s a nod to compliance without diluting equity ahead of a potential IPO.” — @CryptoLawyer, May 29, 2025 TON Ecosystem Expansion: The Real Prize The capital injection is earmarked for Telegram’s Open Network (TON), a blockchain platform that’s become the backbone of in-app payments, decentralized apps (dApps), and ad revenue sharing. Since integrating TON in 2023, Telegram has onboarded over 30 million crypto wallets, with TON’s market cap surging to $45 billion. The company’s goal is to leverage this user base to create a seamless ecosystem where users can send money, play games, and access DeFi tools — all without leaving the app. Key areas for growth include expanding the ad platform to reward users and channel owners with TON tokens, scaling gaming and NFT projects within Telegram, and building global payment rails to compete with tech titans like WhatsApp and WeChat. “Telegram’s bond raise isn’t just about survival — it’s about dominating the blockchain messaging wars.” — @BlockchainMatt, May 29, 2025 IPO Runway: How Long Will $1.7B Last? Analysts estimate Telegram’s annual burn rate at $400–$500 million, primarily for server costs, TON development, and regulatory compliance. The $1.7B raise buys 3–4 years of runway , aligning with speculation that Telegram could go public as soon as 2028. This war chest allows Durov and his team to focus on scaling the TON ecosystem and monetizing Telegram’s vast user base through premium subscriptions, business tools, and crypto-powered features. But the path to IPO is not without challenges. Telegram must prove that TON can generate sustainable revenue and withstand competition from established blockchain giants like Ethereum and Solana. Investors will also watch closely to see if Telegram can balance growth with regulatory compliance, especially after its high-profile run-in with the SEC. What’s Next? The bond raise positions Telegram as a crypto-finance hybrid, blending private growth with public market ambitions. If TON gains traction, Telegram could disrupt social media monetization or become a cautionary tale of overreach. The next few years will be crucial as the company races toward profitability and a potential blockbuster IPO.",News|Events,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TON,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-31 11:26:54

With Solana (SOL) still basking in its Layer-1 success, many investors are now shifting focus toward undervalued gems with higher upside. One such cheap altcoin, Mutuum Finance is gaining traction fast, with analysts projecting up to 10,000% gains as early backers pile in before the broader market takes notice. The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.4 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,500 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. While SOL continues to dominate headlines, particularly for its lightning-fast network and growing DeFi presence, it’s clear that some of the best cryptos to buy now may be found in lesser-known, low-cap plays gearing up for breakout runs. That’s why emerging contenders like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are starting to rival even the top Layer-1s in investor excitement heading into 2025. Solana Price Outlook: Strength Holds at $174 as 2025 Targets $275 Solana (SOL) is priced at $174, reflecting steady momentum in the face of recent fluctuations triggered by institution sell-offs. The network continues to lead high-performance blockchains with blazing speeds and low costs, making it among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this cycle. While short-term technicals advise caution, long-term projections are optimistic, with some analysts calling for an increase to $275 by the end of 2025, driven by institutional growth and demand from developers. Even so, as SOL becomes increasingly mature, some investors are considering early-stage projects with more ROI potential, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows A two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. That more than 11,500 investors have invested $9.4 million in the presale is a testament to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $6 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Solana (SOL) is a strong long-term play, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers far greater upside. At just $0.03, with a launch price of $0.06 and targets as high as $6, MUTM could deliver up to 10,000% gains. With over $9.4 million raised, 11,500+ investors, a completed Certik audit, and a unique DeFi model, it’s one of the hottest altcoins this cycle. Join the presale now.

The token dropped from $2.20 to $2.14 as the broader crypto market shed 3.81% of its value, settling at a total market cap of $3.3 trillion. The volatility comes in the wake of the U.S. Court of International Trade’s decision to overturn Trump’s trade tariffs, reigniting trade policy concerns and sending ripples across risk assets. XRP wasn’t immune, with over $29.68 million in long positions liquidated as traders scrambled to adjust their exposure. News Background China-based Webus International said Friday it plans to raise up to $300 million through non-equity financing to support its global chauffeur payment network with an XRP reserve. The initiative aims to integrate XRP’s cross-border settlement capabilities into Webus’ ecosystem, including on-chain booking records and a Web3-based loyalty program. Webus is renewing its partnership with Tongcheng Travel Holdings to use the XRP Ledger for settling cross-border rides and driver payouts. Bitget listed Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin late Thusday. Ripple published a cross-border payments report on Friday. Cross-border payments underpin the $31.6 trillion B2B market, projected to hit $50 trn by 2032. Traditional multi-intermediary rails are slow, costly and opaque, facing regulatory and transparency hurdles. Blockchain-based solutions like Ripple’s stablecoin network promise near-instant, cheaper, visible settlement, enhancing liquidity, global expansion, talent payments and customer trust, while reducing failed transfers, the report said. Price-Action Technically, XRP found strong selling pressure at the $2.21 resistance level, failing to mount a sustained recovery. A notable support zone emerged near $2.11, with high-volume buying during the 03:00 hour preventing further downside. Recent consolidation between $2.13 and $2.14 suggests potential stabilization — though the pattern of lower highs indicates sellers remain in control. In the final trading hour, XRP formed a higher-low pattern around $2.135, signaling potential short-term support. However, the token also faced resistance at $2.144-$2.145, forming a tight range that traders will be watching closely for the next breakout or breakdown. Technical Analysis Recap XRP dropped 5.7% from $2.20 to $2.14 over the past 24 hours. A price range of $0.13 (5.9%) was observed between a high of $2.22 and a low of $2.09. Significant resistance formed at $2.21 during the 16:00 and 22:00 hours, triggering heavy selling. Strong buying at $2.11 during the 03:00 hour prevented further downside. Recent consolidation between $2.13 and $2.14 suggests potential stabilization, though lower highs persist. A higher low at $2.135 formed in the last hour, with resistance at $2.144-$2.145 capping any rebound. XRP closed the session at $2.137, indicating consolidation after a volatile day.

Some market watchers see this dip as a pause before a major move. According to their charts, Bitcoin could be gearing up for another steep gain. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ Historical Patterns Point To Rebound Based on reports from the analyst known as “Mister Crypto,” rounded-bottom formations and ascending triangles have marked every big Bitcoin rally. In 2013, when Bitcoin was trading under $10, it spent months in a smooth, curved base before breaking out and climbing past $1,000. A similar pattern showed up in 2017. After nearly three years of sideways action, the price finally exploded toward $20,000. The last cycle in 2021 also followed the same playbook, with almost four years of building a wide base before shooting up to nearly $70,000. Bitcoin will go parabolic. This time won’t be different! pic.twitter.com/0fEMMMclbD — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) May 29, 2025 Mister Crypto’s chart suggests that the period after 2021 has formed another base. If history plays out the same way, his forecast points to a breakout in 2025 that could send Bitcoin as high as $900,000—a 760% rise from today’s level. Analyst Charts Re-Accumulation According to charts shared by another analyst, Bitcoin often moves in stages. First, there’s an initial “leg up” that signals the shift from deep accumulation into a growing bull trend. Then, the price settles into a sideways “re-accumulation” phase before the final run. From 2019 through 2021, Bitcoin followed this path closely. Analysts note that from late 2023 into mid-2025, Bitcoin looks to be in that same re-accumulation phase. If this unfolds as in past cycles, the next big upswing could push Bitcoin into the $270,000–$350,000 range before any parabolic spike comes into view. Long-Term Holders Keep Adding Coins On-chain data shows long-term holders (addresses that haven’t moved their coins in over 155 days) are still piling on. Between March 3 and May 25, 2025, these holders increased their overall supply by nearly 1.40 million BTC. That pushed long-term holdings from 14,354,000 BTC to 15,739,400 BTC. In previous bull markets—like those in 2013, 2017, and 2021—long-term holders often sold during the rallies to lock in profit.

If large pockets of Bitcoin remain off exchanges, fewer coins are available for new buyers. That could tighten supply and make sharp moves more likely once demand picks up. Looking Ahead In Uncertain Market Bitcoin has lost momentum recently, but many analysts feel these dips won’t last. At $105K region, the price sits below last week’s levels. Based on reports, some see that as healthy consolidation before a bigger run. Others warn that global interest rates, regulation, and macro factors could slow things down.

Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Key Levels and Rebound Signs On the technical front, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bearish, as BTC has violated the upward trendline. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has broken below a rising trendline and is forming a descending triangle. This classic pattern, where lower highs converge to horizontal support, indicates more bearish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-period EMA is a ceiling at $106,932. The MACD is confirming this with a bearish crossover and red histogram bars. Key levels to watch: Support: $102,141 – if this breaks, we could see $100,799 or $99,356 Resistance: $106,409 – potential reversal point if patterns emerge* Reversal Watch: Bullish candlesticks (Morning Star, Bullish Engulfing) at support, MACD divergence, 50-EMA reclamation as reversal signs The short term is bearish, but a significant reversal with strong buying at support could take us back to $104K and beyond.

The comment came during her appearance on Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street on Fox Business, where she was talking about the 2.1% rise in April’s personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. It was the slowest annual increase in four years. “That’s good relief for American consumers,” Mary said , but she also warned that this number doesn’t tell the whole story. “It’s an incomplete picture of what we have to look at as policymakers,” she said. She added that looking ahead, inflation still carries risks, and the Fed isn’t ready to make any sudden moves. Mary made it clear she still thinks monetary policy is in a good place, and she’s okay with two rate cuts in 2025, if inflation keeps cooling and the economy stays steady. “We can actually move one way or another as the data unfolds,” she said. But she also added, “You want to keep the policy rate modestly restrictive for now until we are sure that inflation is going to get to that 2%.” Trump met Fed’s Powell at the White House to demand lower rates The day before Mary gave her TV interview, President Donald Trump met with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the White House. This came after weeks of Trump pressuring the Fed to cut rates, both online and behind closed doors. Trump invited Powell to discuss “economic developments including for growth, employment, and inflation,” according to Reuters. The Fed later confirmed the meeting happened, but said Powell didn’t give any policy guidance. He only repeated that any future changes to interest rates would depend entirely on economic data. The statement stressed that Powell and the rest of the central bank will continue to base decisions on “careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” But Trump is clearly not buying that. He’s been slamming Powell for weeks on his Truth Social account, accusing the Fed of holding back growth by keeping interest rates too high. On May 17, he posted, “THE CONSENSUS OF ALMOST EVERYBODY IS THAT, ‘THE FED SHOULD CUT RATES SOONER, RATHER THAN LATER.’ Too Late Powell, a man legendary for being Too Late, will probably blow it again – But who knows???” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump didn’t hold back in private either. “The president did say that he believes the Fed chair is making a mistake by not lowering interest rates,” Karoline told reporters. “It’s putting us at an economic disadvantage to China and other countries.” The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hasn’t cut rates since December, just before Trump returned for his second nonconsecutive term. Meanwhile, Trump is rolling out new tariffs that could increase inflation, complicating things for a Fed trying to manage prices while keeping the economy afloat. So far, the central bank is standing firm. Mary’s comments show that officials are in no rush to change course. The April PCE report may have been good news, but the Fed is still watching the road ahead — and they’re not done steering yet.

Livepeer (LPT) is now trading near $11.77, up more than 110% in less than 48 hours. With such a rapid rise, traders are asking: Why is LPT price going up, and is this rally sustainable into June? What’s Happening With LPT’s Price? Livepeer price forecast (Source: TradingView) The LPT price action over the past 48 hours reflects a clear breakout from a multi-week symmetrical triangle visible on both 4-hour and daily charts. The breakout above the $6.50–$7.00 resistance zone coincided with high volume, triggering a vertical move that touched an intraday high of $14.32 before pulling back slightly. Current price levels are consolidating just under $12.00, suggesting that profit-taking is underway after the parabolic move. However, the underlying structure remains bullish as long as LPT holds above the $10.00 psychological mark. Short-term support is now established at $10.40, while immediate resistance lies at $13.70 and the major resistance at $16.00.

However, instead of BTC, the company is looking to use it to acquire Ethereum (ETH). According to the S-5 prospectus filed on May 29, Sharplink will use a substantial amount of proceeds from the offering to purchase Ethereum. The offering, which will involve the sale of up to 72,051,288 shares of common stock, is estimated to raise $1 billion in gross proceeds based on the assumed sale of 12,624,668 shares at current prices. Sharplink plans to use proceeds from its offering to purchase Ethereum. Source: SEC Aside from its ETH purchases, Sharplink will also use part of the proceeds for general business purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and expanding its core affiliate marketing operations. The stock sale will be executed via an “at-the-market offering” structure, which will allow Sharplink to issue shares periodically through a sales agent or principal. Such a structure enables the company the flexibility to respond to market conditions without compromising its crypto acquisition and operational goals. Sharplink plans to accumulate Ethereum in reserves The announcement of Sharplink’s plans to raise $1 billion from its stock offering comes days after it raked in $425 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, offering to establish an Ethereum treasury. The $425 million raise was led by blockchain technology firm Consensys, with participation from Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital, Ondo, and Pantera Capital, among other investors, SharpLink Gaming revealed Tuesday in a statement. The group reportedly bought 69,100,313 of the firm’s shares at $6.15 each. The newly raised funds will go toward acquiring Ethereum, which will serve as the company’s primary treasury asset. Sharplink Gaming’s private equity deal is expected to close on May 29. Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin will serve as chairman of Sharplink Gaming’s board of directors. Rob Phythian, founder and CEO, called the achievement “a significant milestone in Sharplink’s journey,” which marks an expansion beyond its core business. “On closing, we look forward to working with Consensys and welcoming Joseph to the Board,” he added. The announcement of the initial $425 million raise caused Sharplink’s stock to surge over 400%, peaking at $52 and closing at $35.80 on May 27, though it later dropped 8% after the $1 billion filing, reflecting market volatility. Strategy has become the standard Sharplink is taking a page out of Strategy’s crypto-focused playbook with a bias for Ethereum rather than BTC. This is an interesting detail as the company’s interest in stacking Ethereum coincides with positive momentum in the ETH community. Much of that momentum comes from the Pectra upgrade as well as new leadership at the Ethereum Foundation, which has gradually helped the token recover from the sub-$2,000 region. Other publicly traded companies have also employed the Strategy playbook over the past couple of years. Good examples include medical device company Semler Scientific and the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, who began employing aggressive Bitcoin-based strategies in 2024. Those not using the playbook to acquire BTC aggressively have tweaked it to focus on other altcoins. While Sharplink will focus on purchasing ETH, companies like Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. (formerly Janover) are dedicating millions of dollars to acquiring Solana for their respective corporate treasuries.

In a new report, UBS says that the US government may be forced to make its growing debt burden more manageable by turning to additional financial repression measures that would artificially lower the yield on government bonds. “We expect that, over the longer term, the US government may pursue both fiscal consolidation and financial repression – a phenomenon that already exists in some form in the US and many other countries – to contain yields and keep the high debt burden manageable.” One potential financial repression measure may be to reform the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) for US banks, according to UBS. “Presently, large US banks must hold equity capital against all assets, including high-quality ones like Treasuries. Loosening the SLR could be justified as supporting bank lending, but excluding Treasuries from capital requirements would incentivize banks to hold more Treasuries, potentially enhancing market liquidity.” UBS says the US is well-positioned to successfully implement financial repression measures, as long as they are put in place on a temporary basis. “For a country as large and wealthy as the US, widespread financial repression seems feasible and could enable the government to continue financing a growing debt burden without materially increasing its risk of default. Financial repression policies could be deployed temporarily to provide fiscal breathing room, allowing for budget consolidation and improvement, followed by a phase-out and a return to more conventional policy settings. In such a scenario, economic distortions should remain temporary and manageable.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the biggest meme coin in Ethereum’s ( ETH ) chain, dropped for four consecutive days, reaching a low of $0.00001238, its lowest level since April 22. It has moved into a technical bear market, falling by almost 30% from its highest point in May. Shiba Inu’s decline is mostly because of the ongoing crypto sell-off that has affected all types of coins. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has dropped from an all-time high of $111,900 last week to $103,000. SHIB has also crashed as its network faces substantial challenges. First, data shows that SHIB whales have been in a selling spree this year. Supply held by these investors started the year at 743 trillion and has now dropped to 723 trillion. Whale selling is a sign that they expect its price to keep falling. Shiba Inu whales are selling | Source: Santiment Second, Shibarium, its layer-2 network, is not doing well as its total value locked stands at just $2.92 million. In contrast, Unichain , which Uniswap ( UNI ) launched earlier this year, has a TVL of over $600 million. Further, Shiba Inu’s token burn rate has lost momentum in the past few weeks. The single biggest burn this week was an 18 million transaction that happened on Wednesday. It was common for SHIB to have over 1 billion burns a few months ago. Shiba Inu price analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price peaked at $0.00001755 on May 12 as cryptocurrencies rallied. It then embarked on a strong downtrend, reaching a low of $0.00001235, its lowest point since April 22. It has moved below the 50-day moving average and the lower side of the rising wedge pattern. A rising wedge is a bearish pattern comprising of two ascending and converging trendlines. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling, with the next target being the year-to-date low of $0.00001033, down by 16% from the current level.

Here’s Why this Changes Everything for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-just-gave-wall-street-its-xrp-backdoor-heres-why-this-changes-everything-for-xrp/,"A recent post by investigative journalist Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp) has brought attention to a quite significant move by Ripple that could change the landscape for institutional adoption of XRP. Sharing a screenshot of a recent article, Jungle Inc pointed out that Hidden Road, the prime broker that Ripple recently acquired , has launched over-the-counter (OTC) crypto swaps for U.S. institutions. The importance of this move lies in the type of financial exposure it offers. According to Jungle Inc, these are cash-settled swaps, meaning there is no on-chain movement of cryptocurrency. This structure helps institutions to gain exposure to digital assets without holding or transferring them directly, a format more aligned with traditional financial practices. Ripple Just Gave Wall Street Its XRP Backdoor Hidden Road — Ripple’s $1.25B acquisition — has launched OTC crypto swaps for U.S. institutions. Quiet accumulation is now possible… without moving the charts. Why this changes everything for XRP: 1.These swaps are cash-settled… pic.twitter.com/tdjUIdzayu — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) May 30, 2025 Strategic Licensing and U.S. Access Hidden Road operates through a UK-regulated entity, allowing it to engage U.S. institutional clients without falling directly under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. This regulatory path, paired with Ripple’s existing MiCA license in Europe and its FINRA-licensed U.S. operations , reflects a deliberate infrastructure strategy aimed at building a full-stack financial network across jurisdictions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This regulatory design allows Ripple to onboard U.S. capital in a way that minimizes friction, potentially opening the door for XRP to become a featured asset within these OTC offerings. While no assets have been officially named, Jungle Inc noted that Ripple owns the broker and “XRP is next.” The Role of Infrastructure in Market Dynamics The rollout of OTC swaps is not just a trading option but a mechanism that allows for institutional accumulation without affecting spot market prices. As Jungle Inc emphasized, quiet accumulation is now possible without moving the charts. This is particularly relevant for digital assets like XRP, where liquidity events often precede major price volatility. Due to the nature of these cash-settled instruments, positions can be built quietly, well in advance of any public announcements or retail visibility. This front-loaded approach to exposure means that any eventual listing or use of XRP within this swap framework could already be priced in by the time the broader market reacts. Implications for XRP’s Market Position This development positions XRP favorably in the eyes of institutions. Ripple’s strategy, centered on regulatory licensing and silent infrastructure rollout, provides the necessary tools for serious capital engagement. If the XRP is indeed added to the list of supported assets, it could mark the return of large-scale institutional adoption of the token. Retail investors may not see immediate effects, but the groundwork is being laid. As Jungle Inc concluded, “Retail trades trends. Institutions trade access. And Ripple just handed them the keys.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

SharpLink will offer 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each ETH buy-in will bring fresh institutional demand Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin is SharpLink’s new board chair SharpLink’s stock skyrocketed 400% after the announcement, despite regulatory risks, including the possibility of ETH being classified as a security and uncertainties surrounding CBDCs. Market Buzz Builds as ETF Hopes and SharpLink Strategy Align Crypto enthusiasts are calling SharpLink Ethereum’s Saylor, with social media posts labeling it the “Michael Saylor of Ethereum”. This bullish sentiment is further fueled by REX Shares filing for Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs. Analysts say these ETFs could launch in weeks, providing U.S. investors with a way to gain exposure to Ethereum’s staking ecosystem – something that has previously eluded attempts at ETFs. While the SEC filing and ETF buzz mean more institutional support for Ethereum, broader market forces are at play. Global macroeconomic concerns, including interest rate hikes and regulatory headwinds, are weighing on digital assets. Ethereum Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Amid Breakout Tension Despite bullish fundamentals, Ethereum price prediction is showing technical cracks. On the 4-hour chart, ETH has broken below the ascending channel, with the 50-period EMA at $2,592 now acting as resistance. The MACD is deepening bearish momentum, and a Three Black Crows pattern near $2,594 adds to the downside risk. Key support and resistance levels to watch: Support: $2,466 and $2,385 – break here could lead to $2,298 or $2,250 Resistance: $2,594 and $2,689 – reversal above here could mean recovery Candlestick Watch: Look for Bullish Engulfing or Hammer patterns near support. SharpLink and ETFs are medium-term bullish, but be cautious in the short term. No reversal signals have been seen yet, so consolidation or a down move is the likely path.

A recent tweet exchange between Sun and Blue Origin has sparked excitement, hinting that his suborbital flight on the New Shepard rocket is coming soon. Hello @justinsuntron We look forward to seeing you in West Texas on a future New Shepard flight soon! https://t.co/jnBbcjHBAn — Blue Origin (@blueorigin) May 30, 2025 If this happens, Sun will be the first person from the crypto world to travel to space, showing how blockchain and space exploration can come together. A $28 Million Ticket to Space In 2021, Justin Sun won a charity auction by bidding $28 million for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard flight. The money went to Blue Origin’s Club for the Future, a foundation that supports 19 space-related charities focused on inspiring future generations in STEM fields. Though the flight was originally planned for 2022, it was delayed. But on May 29, 2025, Sun posted a tweet from inside a spacecraft simulator, suggesting the trip is back on. The flight might take place in July 2025, according to recent announcements, and Sun will fly with five other crewmates, including someone who won their seat with a $6 million ticket. Flying with a Star-Studded Crew Justin Sun won’t be traveling alone. He’ll be joined by five others, making this an exciting mission that combines the worlds of space and crypto. This group will mark a new chapter in how cryptocurrency interacts with space technology. Justin Sun in the Spotlight Sun has a history of making big headlines. In 2019, he paid $4.5 million to have a charity lunch with famous investor Warren Buffett. At that lunch, Sun brought top crypto figures like Litecoin’s Charlie Lee and eToro’s CEO Yonni Assia. Even though Buffett remains skeptical about Bitcoin, the meeting sparked important discussions about cryptocurrency. In 2025, Sun continued his high-profile appearances by attending a dinner with Donald Trump for top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin. He also met crypto leaders like Michael Saylor and the Winklevoss twins at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. These actions highlight Sun’s efforts to raise TRON’s profile and influence in the crypto space. How Does The Crypto Community See This? The crypto community on X has been buzzing about Sun’s space plans. Influencer Wendy O said, “Justin is taking us to the moon,” celebrating this milestone. Others believe this trip could boost TRON’s visibility and push the crypto industry toward exciting new innovations. This mission may increase TRON’s visibility and inspire blockchain leaders to think bigger as the crypto world gets ready to reach new heights.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 11:51:40

Daily indicators suggest it is entering oversold conditions, while the 4-hour momentum and volume remain heavily bearish. Unless strong buying interest emerges, the decline may continue. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong community and meme buzz, which can drive short-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 80x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

The move, issued in a statement titled “Providing Security is not a ‘Security’,” alleviates legal uncertainty that had long stifled innovation and discouraged American participation in network staking. While the clarification is not a binding rule, it signals a more open regulatory posture under the current administration. It could also unlock significant growth in staking-related infrastructure, which is increasingly central to the operation and decentralization of modern blockchain networks. The SEC’s statement Hester Peirce, the Division of Corporation Finance and Commissioner, essentially captured the essence of the SEC’s approach by explaining that “certain proof-of-stake blockchain protocol ‘staking’ activities are not securities transactions within the scope of the federal securities laws.” Pierse clarifies that staking is a voluntary effort by users to secure a network, but the previous regulatory uncertainty has been discouraging for Americans. This “artificial constraint” harmed decentralization, censorship resistance, and, therefore, the credible neutrality of proof-of-stake-based blockchains. According to the Division of Corporation Finance, the statement applies to various groups of individuals and services, including those who stake assets individually or via the delegated-proof-of-stake platform, as well as staking-as-service providers, both custodial and non-custodial. Furthermore, the commission outlines in the statement that ancillary services associated with staking are not considered a securities offering. As an example of such ancillary services, the commission cites the provision of slashing coverage that returns staked crypto assets before the unbinding period ends, allowing the reward to be recalculated while maintaining the minimum amount of staked assets required for normal network operation. The statement follows the previously issued clarification noting that the SEC doesn’t apply securities offering laws to the mining of cryptocurrency. Generally, the clarification follows the logic of the commission’s other actions and statements made in the post-Gensler era, which began in 2025 when President Donald Trump directed his administration to loosen crypto sector regulation. Read more: Gary Gensler’s political testament. Digesting the SEC chairman’s exit interview One of the most notable differences was the abandonment of Gensler’s approach of labeling most cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities, a status that led to legal battles and, therefore, slower development in the sector. A yet unnoticed victory Crypto Council for Innovation was one of the first to emphasize the importance of the change in the staking status. In a series of X posts, the organization pointed out that the new legal status outlines staking “as a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract.” Alison Mangiero, head of staking policy, thanked the SEC for recognizing staking’s real purpose as a tool that provides network security without being a security itself. 1/ Huge win for staking and the wider crypto community. @SECGov now recognizes staking as a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract. 👏 @AMangiero @TeamPOSA pic.twitter.com/jTfPq4ihjX — Crypto Council for Innovation (@crypto_council) May 30, 2025 The shift in attention from wealth accumulation to the structural role of staking in PoS-based networks suggests that U.S. regulators are becoming more open-minded about the cryptocurrency sector. Interestingly, the clarification of staking status news was met with perplexity by many. In the comment sections of the news accounts, people asked if the news was bullish and, if so, why the prices weren’t going up. Some tried to deploy Grok AI to get the answers. One possible reason for such confusion is that Bitcoin and stablecoins largely dominated the 2025 crypto narrative, while proof-of-stake platforms were pushed out of the spotlight in crypto discussions. Ethereum, one of the leading proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems, has been under fire as the Ether price declined throughout the year. “Bitcoin, not crypto,” became a popular motto among many influencers on crypto X. However, staking hasn’t gone anywhere. The staking ratio (a percentage of the supply of the staked crypto to the rest of the circulating supply) continues to grow across various blockchains. The Block indicates that as of Dec. 31, 2024, Ethereum’s staking ratio reached 28%, while other key PoS-based blockchains (i.e., Solana, Cosmos, and Polkadot) saw staking ratios over 50%. It signifies a growing investor involvement in staking. Furthermore, the staking sector is undergoing a series of innovations. Mostly, they aim to provide stakers with more flexibility or unlocking liquidity while staking. It makes staking less demanding. Previously, it involved locking up crypto assets for a specified period, which could be unprofitable. The modern-day features help validators avoid missing out on profits while securing the network. The SEC’s clarification on staking may not carry the weight of formal legislation, but it represents a meaningful step toward deregulating the U.S. crypto landscape. While the news has yet to spark a surge in token prices or mainstream attention, it lays critical groundwork for future innovation. As staking continues to evolve—becoming more liquid, accessible, and central to blockchain infrastructure—the ability of U.S.-based users, developers, and service providers to participate without fear of legal ambiguity could catalyze a new wave of decentralization and growth. In short, the stakes have changed.

Ethereum (ETH) is catching attention with a new breakout setup and a price target pushing toward $7,500. At the same time, XRP whales are loading up, backing Ripple as ETF hopes grow. But while the big names lead the news, a low-cost presale is building real momentum behind the scenes. Unstaked, a project focused on AI and automation, has raised more than $8.3 million during its presale. Still priced at around a penny, it’s gaining traction quickly. With smart tools and upcoming AI agents designed to help users across digital platforms, Unstaked is starting to look like the best crypto to invest in now. While ETH and XRP dominate headlines, early backers are locking in their spots before the next big wave. Ethereum Target Climbs as Analysts Watch for Breakout Ethereum (ETH) is holding above $2,600 and forming an ascending triangle that points to bullish movement. Analysts are now raising short-term targets above $3,250, with some seeing a run toward $7,500. This is supported by talk of spot ETF approvals and growing interest from big institutions. Even with just a 2% gain this week, ETH is up 48% this month. Its market cap is close to $321 billion. Strong trading volume and technical patterns are adding to the breakout talk. Bitcoin might be stealing headlines with its rally past $111,000, but Ethereum target levels are climbing too, showing signs of building its own momentum. XRP Whales and ETF Buzz Build Quiet Strength XRP is steady at $2.30, not fully riding the recent market wave. But whale activity shows a deeper trend. Santiment reports that wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have added 3.9 billion coins in a year, bringing their total to 6.05 billion. Those holding 10 million to 100 million now control 7.76 billion, up from 6.5 billion. This steady growth lines up with growing hopes around XRP ETF approvals. The new XXRP ETF has already hit $112 million in assets, beating many other altcoin funds quickly. Ripple is also in talks to buy Circle, and its XRP Ledger is expanding through Hidden Road. These XRP whale moves show that big players see long-term value. But for retail buyers, the upside may be limited at current prices. That’s why attention is turning toward newer projects with useful features and early-stage gains. Unstaked Presale Gains Steam with $8.3M Raised & $1M Giveaway While Ethereum and XRP dominate market news, Unstaked is picking up momentum where it matters most: strong presale numbers, growing user interest, and a clear plan for real-world use. Now in stage 17, Unstaked has already collected over $8.3 million, and the price is still just $0.01043. That makes it one of the most undervalued but highly promising entries in today’s crypto space. The project centers on AI-driven social agents. These are smart bots that will soon connect with platforms like Telegram, Twitter, and Discord. They help users manage online communities, keep up with conversations, check sentiment, and even help with moderation, all without switching apps. This is powered by the Proof of Intelligence system, which tracks helpful AI actions and gives rewards in return. Unstaked is also launching a $1 million Gleam giveaway. Twenty winners will each get $50,000 worth of $UNSD. To join, users must finish a few simple tasks, invite others, and buy at least $100 worth of tokens. The giveaway runs for five months, keeping users involved and offering serious rewards. With the listing price expected to reach $0.1819, even those buying now could see a big return. Early buyers might get up to 27x gains. For anyone asking what’s the best crypto to invest in now, Unstaked checks the boxes with AI tools, fast growth, and strong reward features. The Bottom Line Ethereum is aiming for $7,500, and XRP is moving on new ETF buzz. These signals show big money is back in the market. But for smaller investors, these coins may already be past their biggest growth. While ETH targets and XRP whale moves sound great, the biggest profits may have already been taken. That’s why Unstaked is standing out. It’s built on AI ideas, gives rewards through smart features, and has already raised over $8.3 million before even launching. And the price? Still at around one cent. With a major $1 million giveaway live, working tech in the pipeline, and a model that rewards real use, Unstaked is shaping up as something more than a short-term story. As bigger coins aim for higher ground, the best crypto to invest in now might be the one that’s just getting started. Unstaked is showing signs that it could be that coin.

This follows broader market volatility after a U.S. appeals Court reinstated Trump-era tariffs .

The daily chart looks nasty: a series of red candles and a Three Black Crows pattern. The 50-day EMA at $159.60 has flipped from support to resistance, and the MACD momentum indicators are showing widening gaps and deepening red histograms – all bearish. Support levels: $141.60, $125.95, $112.04 Resistance zone: $176-$188 with strong rejection Momentum indicators: MACD bearish, RSI 46 Derivatives Liquidations and ETF Delays Fuel Bearish Sentiment The data shows a shift in sentiment around Solana. According to Coinglass, futures open interest fell 3.23% to $7.11 billion, and long liquidations were $18.98 million on Friday, while short liquidations were just $464,750. This represents a significant unwinding of leveraged long positions. Meanwhile, the delays in US spot Solana ETFs, despite six applications from Fidelity and VanEck, are capping the optimism. Polymarket has the approval odds at 82%, and some analysts, including VirtualBacon, are calling for post-approval targets of $440-$600, similar to Bitcoin’s post-ETF rally. However, until the SEC gives the green light, regaining $200 looks challenging. Institutional Growth and Network Expansion Offer Long-Term Promise; Solana Supported?

Look for support at $141.60; however, unless Solana forms a strong reversal pattern, such as a Hammer or Morning Star with MACD convergence and a retest of the 50 EMA, the path of least resistance remains down. Newbies should wait for clear reversal signals to enter, while experienced traders can look for volume confirmation on a breakdown or reversal. Without bullish momentum, Solana may not retest $200 anytime soon. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.67M Mark as 62% APY Staking Draws Interest With SOL/USD dipping below $1560, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $ 50,000 BTC increase, reducing the supply. The current token price is at $0.00254 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,632,712/ $7,676,876 Token price : $0.00254 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~62% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield, with full liquidity.

This prediction follows the Bitcoin price breaking the $111,000 resistance as it continues to build momentum towards a new all-time high. With the Bitcoin price acting as the launchpad for renewed crypto market excitement, investors are shifting their attention to FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a surprisingly well-structured meme token that’s gaining momentum fast. Analysts Call $111,000 The Launchpad For A Bitcoin Price Explosion Toward $185,000 By Q3 Analysts have said the $111,000 mark could serve as the next major launchpad for the Bitcoin price upward trajectory. They believe this level may act as a consolidation zone before the Bitcoin price’s next explosive move. In addition, the founder of 10T Holdings has also issued a bold forecast , stating that the Bitcoin price could surge to a range of $180,000 to $185,000 by Q3 2025. The investor’s prediction further reinforces the idea that institutional capital remains confident in the Bitcoin price’s long-term upside, especially as crypto adoption continues to grow. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Combines Intelligence, Influence, and Explosive Potential FloppyPepe (FPPE) challenges the traditional meme coin narrative by merging internet culture with practical applications, AI advancements, and a vision focused on community-led development. With the token currently priced affordably at $0.00000035, the project is attracting attention from early investors seeking the next major breakout. This emerging presale holds significant potential for transforming investments into considerable profits thanks to its exceptionally low presale price. Investors are rapidly joining in, driven by fear of missing out on anticipated substantial returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Smashes Milestone With Over $2 Million Raised The FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale has recently surpassed a landmark of $2 million in revenues, reflecting strong confidence among investors. This token employs a tiered pricing method, distinguishing it from the standard pricing strategies commonly used by larger ICOs. Currently, the token is priced at just $0.00000035, offering a cheap entry point.

FloppyPepe (FPPE) has established a soft cap of $20 million and a hard cap of $45 million, which is ambitious yet achievable given the current appetite in today’s meme-influenced market.

Find out what this does for crypto trade—and why Bitcoin poker is now hot. The arrival of institutional funds is driving excitement in the world of Bitcoin. It’s amazing that more than $900 million ( 500x increase over the average daily inflow for 2025 so far) was traded in one day, compared to the low daily averages we had this year. This is not a temporary measure—it is clearly a notable indicator. Amidst economic, workforce, and political confusion, the crypto domain is doing very well. Bitcoin did achieve a new high (all-time high) of $112,000 before subsequently falling back to about $108,700—not much decline, but of no consequence in these markets. The technical indicators are overall reflecting a strong return of bullish momentum above $100,000 and the new ultra-high levels of institutional interest that have contributed to the excitement. Institutional Confidence Returns Many institutions have shown a lot more interest in Bitcoin ETFs, proving there is a strong, ongoing trust in this market. After the initial rally at the start of the year, analysts started to rely on ETF inflows to gauge new changes in people’s feelings toward the market. Because of the new injection of funds, Bitcoin’s market cap is now above $2.17 trillion. Currently, Bitcoin does much more than lead the crypto world—it is showing that it is a true competitor for value, like gold and other major assets. Price Volatility Remains The recent rally has had a few hiccups. Bitcoin dipped by 2.5% on the 23rd of May after the surprising announcement from President Donald Trump that he is proposing new tariffs on foreign imports (whether or not this is related is not known officially). His statement shook both the crypto markets and regular markets, but it was short-lived – the buyers entered the markets, and prices stabilized. Experienced crypto holders have seen volatility, but this is still shocking for later holders (particularly those entering via ETFs). 7-day BTC price chart by Coinbase Crypto Infiltrates Other Industries Bitcoin in traditional finance is altering the landscape for complementary industries. Gaming is the sector leading this change. The creation of online gaming focused on blockchain technology and decentralized gambling experiences is a disruption for the industry, especially crypto poker sites , allowing online users to play poker with the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. The advantages for users of these poker sites are apparent: provably fair algorithms, low transaction fees, a payout time of minutes instead of weeks, and user anonymity, an important component for those who are privacy-conscious. Where regular online casinos manage the online gambling market, we have seen crypto poker sites pop up, and the rules that oversee this online gambling vary significantly across countries. Being decentralized and having access to users’ crypto wallets allows these crypto poker platforms to let people play online poker without the usual banking limits, starting new trends in online gaming. The convergence of gaming and finance is indicative that Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are becoming more important. The convergence of DeFi with digital entertainment is clear that cryptocurrency is not limited to earlier adopters and an interested niche, it is becoming broadly accepted. Outlook for the Rest of 2025 Bitcoin continues to cause a stir, and the projections get bolder and bolder. Some analysts are now putting targets around $160,000 for Q4, contingent on regulations being leveled out and inflation continuing to be in check. But honestly, this hype still hinges on larger economic dynamics and the Federal Reserve’s next moves. Institutional exposure looks solid, however, it is not a guarantee for success. ETFs basically have become the measuring stick for Bitcoin’s acceptance in mainstream finance. Right now, their actions are being closely examined. There are already Ethereum ETFs, and interest in similar products for Solana and other main cryptos is rising, causing more institutions to enter the crypto world. Prices in Bitcoin and crypto markets are still bouncing around wildly. Even so, large investors are now acknowledging Bitcoin’s role as a true asset class. This development might influence the industry as the years progress.

While the HBAR coin shows strength and potential to continue its upward movement, Unilabs (UNIL) catches the eyes of analysts searching for the next billion-dollar crypto startup. Let’s explore why prominent crypto analysts are backing early-stage ICO Unilabs to outperform the Hedera price this summer. Unilabs (UNIL): DeFi’s Dark Horse Aims For $1 Billion Capitalization Unilabs offers curated investment solutions through its AI-powered investment platform. The key component of Unilabs’ ecosystem is the AI asset manager, which uses real-time market data to pinpoint emerging crypto projects and ICOs with unbounded upside potential. The selection of projects is updated continuously to expose users to the best-performing assets at all times. Unilabs users can also invest directly into its proprietary fund baskets—BTC, AI, RWA, and Mining—to get exposure to emerging projects in these sectors without active market participation. The AI analyzes price movements, trading volume, and on-chain metrics to rebalance over $30 million in AUM between these funds in real time. By holding the UNIL token, users can gain governance rights and vote on important platform development decisions. UNIL holders can also stake their tokens in rewarding staking pools, which offer up to 122% annual yields as staking rewards. Additionally, the platform accumulates 30% of all revenue generated in a transparent profit-sharing pool and distributes it as rewards to UNIL token holders. The UNIL token is currently valued at $0.0051 in stage two of the presale and has so far raised over $1.5 million. The token’s value will surge periodically as the presale progresses. The demand for Unilabs’ investment solution has led to top analysts expecting it to capture a significant share of the crypto AI market. According to Coingecko, the total market cap of artificial intelligence tokens is $31 billion, and if UNIL can seize even 3-5% of this in 2025 with its much-needed utility, it can easily reach a $1 billion market cap. BlackRock MMF Tokenization Boosts HBAR Coin’s Legitimacy Archax, a UK-based digital asset exchange, announced that it is expanding its tokenized fund share options by adding BlackRock’s US Treasury Money Market Fund (MMF) in collaboration with HBAR coin. Since this addition highlights a significant step towards the institutional legitimacy of the HBAR coin, it sparked unwarranted excitement in the community, resulting in a whopping 70% intraday move in the Hedera price. How High Can The Hedera Price Reach? In addition to the BlackRock push, the Hedera price has seen significant growth, with the recent integration of Circle's USDC. Increased attention from this collaboration could be an essential catalyst for the HBAR coin’s growth. USDC's success on Hedera could enhance the network’s market value, upgrading HBAR coin’s status in the crypto sector through improved liquidity. Image Courtesy: TradingView Currently trading at $0.1901, the Hedera price is up 35% from the April lows and is taking support from the lower trendline of its two-month-long uptrending channel. Although HBAR coin has seen weak action over the past two weeks, the price action remains strong in the longer term. Today, it bounced from the 50-day SMA, signaling a potential local bottom and continuation of the uptrend. If bullish pressure resumes, the Hedera price could ascend to higher levels, aiming for psychological milestones such as $0.4 and even $0.5. How Unilabs Can Outpace The Hedera Price HBAR coin is gaining traction with the BlackRock pump and strategic partnership with Circle, but analysts are favoring Unilabs (UNIL), which has proved its explosive potential with early presale demand. Unilabs aims to unlock investment opportunities for retail investors and allow them to replicate institutional-grade gains in their portfolios. Due to this practical use case and an attractive passive income model, investors are rushing to the UNIL presale , and analysts are calling it the next billion-dollar coin in 2025.

He wants to discuss the legal and regulatory aspects of the assets. This development comes after members and major stakeholders under his portfolio insisted that digital assets are still banned in the country. The Ministry of Finance released a statement regarding the meeting, noting that it will serve as a “strategic forum to deliberate on the evolving regulatory and legal framework surrounding digital currency and the broader crypto landscape in Pakistan.” Aurangzeb, who is also the chairman of the PCC, is expected to preside over the meeting, with Bilal Bin Saqib, his special assistant on blockchain and crypto also in attendance as the CEO of the council. Pakistan Crypto Council wants to address the legal status of digital assets According to the report, other members of the council will also be in attendance on Monday, including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), secretary of the Law and Justice Division, and secretary of the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication. The council is expected to review several items, which include the development of a regulatory framework to govern digital assets in Pakistan, aligning it with global standards and technological advancements. The main point of the meeting will be to discuss the groundwork to establish the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA), a proposed autonomous body to oversee the digital finance and cryptocurrency ecosystem in the country. The Pakistan Crypto Council wants to lay a foundation for a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment. It also wants to look into the promotion and adoption of responsible blockchain technology, with a view to protect investors and enhance financial inclusion. “The upcoming meeting underscores the government’s commitment to shaping a future-ready financial infrastructure while ensuring stability and compliance in the emerging digital economy,” it added. Internal criticisms fuel the need for clarification The meeting was convened after conflicting signals from several figures within the government. Days ago, the SBP and the Financial Division informed the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance that digital assets were banned in the country. It meant that all transactions and ownership of the assets were illegal under certain conditions. Although the SBP has walked back its stance on the assets, some stakeholders are still not sold. Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal mentioned that the PCC was formed to look into the crypto policy, noting that the council was formed via an executive order without any legislative backing. He added that under the current SBP and SECP regulations, digital assets are banned in the country. “There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan,” he said. The executive director of the SBP, Sohail Jawad, also mentioned that the central bank had issued a directive on the legal status of digital assets, noting that its stance that it is illegal remains intact. He also mentioned that the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is still recommending crypto-related cases to law enforcement for further action. However, he mentioned that a national working group on digital assets has been formed, and their suggestions will be communicated to the PCC. The parliamentary debate also coincided with the unveiling of the country’s government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the CEO of the PCC, Mr Saqib. According to the official statement from the Ministry of Finance, the unveiling was done in Las Vegas, United States, at this year’s Bitcoin Conference, with United States VP J.D. Vance in attendance. The Pakistan Crypto Council was launched in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.

45329648,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-top-football-club-psg-embraces-crypto,1748695357,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/45329648.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now As Top Football Club PSG Embraces Crypto,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-top-football-club-psg-embraces-crypto,"Paris Saint-Germain F.C. has confirmed its adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy, making it the first major football club to officially add BTC to its financial books. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Pär Helgosson, head of PSG Labs, revealed that the club began accumulating Bitcoin in 2024 and still holds it as part of its reserves. This announcement arrives just as PSG prepares for the Champions League final, bringing both the sporting and financial spotlight onto the club. PSG also shared plans to support Bitcoin ventures and founders, signaling a deeper commitment beyond holding assets. PSG’s Bitcoin Strategy May Influence Sports and Crypto Alike Paris Saint-Germain isn’t new to experimenting with crypto—its fan tokens and Web3 initiatives go back years. But converting fiat reserves into Bitcoin and holding them long-term is an entirely different commitment. This isn’t a marketing gimmick or a temporary flirtation with blockchain. This is treasury allocation—something previously seen in corporate circles, now adopted by a leading sports brand. What’s striking is not just the move itself but the context around it. PSG’s fanbase is largely under 34, a demographic already entrenched in digital assets. The club’s decision to pivot towards Bitcoin reflects an understanding of its own audience and a belief that future value will be driven by crypto-native systems. JUST IN: European soccer giant Paris Saint Germain announces they adopted a #Bitcoin treasury reserve 🇫🇷 pic.twitter.com/nGeq7bUyBJ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 29, 2025 Through PSG Labs, the club is not only holding BTC but actively seeking to invest in and accelerate crypto projects, startups, and builders. This approach could spark a new playbook for other top-tier clubs and sports leagues. If PSG’s venture into Bitcoin pays off—not just financially, but reputationally—it’s likely that others in the sports and entertainment space will follow. Crypto could evolve from niche sponsorships and collectibles into a structural pillar of how major teams manage wealth, foster innovation, and engage their fanbases. For the crypto ecosystem, this signals the return of a serious wave of institutional curiosity—one that could prove longer lasting than the last cycle. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Crypto Adoption Spikes Across Industries SUBBD PSG’s treasury announcement has a major cultural impact on the crypto space and among most sports enthusiasts. And if there’s any other space currently undergoing a cultural reset, it’s the creator economy. SUBBD enters this scene with a purpose that goes far deeper than tipping tools or platform gimmicks. It’s a decentralized infrastructure built to shift control back into the hands of creators, where the value generated by communities isn’t skimmed by middlemen but retained and grown collectively. SUBBD's native token acts as a currency within a fully integrated ecosystem, supporting creator tokens, community rewards, and governance participation. What elevates this from just another creator token is its commitment to long-term sustainability through a dual-burn and staking protocol, where both creators and fans can lock tokens to influence project direction and receive incentives. In a world where institutions like PSG are leveraging blockchain to connect directly with their audiences, SUBBD’s relevance only increases. Just as PSG is using Bitcoin to realign its financial model with its youthful fanbase, SUBBD is giving online creators a similar mechanism to build loyalty, reward participation, and remain self-sufficient without relying on third-party platforms. This fact was highlighted by top crypto content creator ClayBro in one of his dedicated videos about SUBBD and its potential. If tokenized loyalty is the future of audience engagement, then SUBBD is already building the roads. It doesn’t just fit into a world shifting toward crypto—it builds a necessary bridge between creative energy and economic value. BTC Bull The timing of PSG’s announcement is no coincidence, as it arrives at a moment when Bitcoin has moved from speculative asset to strategic reserve for both companies and now, apparently, elite football clubs. BTC Bull operates on this very principle: that Bitcoin’s importance is no longer theoretical. It’s a financial axis. BTC Bull is a meme-forward project, but beneath its tongue-in-cheek branding lies a calculated reward model. It ties token airdrops and supply burns directly to Bitcoin’s price milestones. The higher BTC climbs, the more it unlocks value for BTC Bull holders. This setup isn’t just fun—it’s incentive engineering based on the most proven crypto asset on the planet. There’s no staking here, no confusing DeFi mazes. BTC Bull thrives on simplicity and strategy. The project doesn’t just comment on Bitcoin’s trajectory—it’s structurally tied to it. With PSG now declaring that BTC is part of its own treasury, Bitcoin-based narratives are gaining cultural gravity. BTC Bull rides that gravity without needing to chase headlines—it lets the market’s natural movements steer its mechanics. What makes BTC Bull relevant now is precisely what made PSG’s move newsworthy. Both rely on Bitcoin not just for storage, but for signaling. As BTC inches toward mainstream institutional acceptance, projects like BTC Bull that embrace its rhythm, rather than mimic unrelated trends, could find their value rise not from hype—but alignment. Snorter As PSG leans into Bitcoin to remain relevant to a digitally fluent fanbase, it makes sense to highlight tools that mirror that efficiency and reach. Snorter is built around that same principle: get closer to users, eliminate friction, and prioritize speed. Snorter is a Solana-based Telegram trading bot that doesn’t just notify—it executes. It was created to solve a very real problem: the delay and fragmentation in how people discover and snipe new tokens. While most traders are stuck switching between listings, wallets, and charts, Snorter keeps everything in one flow inside Telegram, with lightning-fast execution and a clear interface. What makes Snorter particularly potent in this moment is its alignment with changing user behavior. The crypto community, especially the under-30 crowd—the same demographic PSG is actively targeting—is already platform-native. They prefer lightweight, immediate tools over bloated exchanges. Snorter understands that, and delivers. The platform also includes token screening features and curated alerts, making it more than a snipe tool—it’s a mobile-first trading companion. And in an age where legacy brands are integrating blockchain to keep pace with their digital audiences, tools like Snorter represent the infrastructure that makes that connection possible. It’s fast, context-aware, and tuned to the language of the next-gen trader. MIND of Pepe Paris Saint-Germain didn’t just move capital—it made a calculated attempt to connect with a younger, digitally native audience. That same instinct sits at the center of MIND of Pepe , a meme-driven project that’s more than just a nod to internet culture. It’s an AI-powered sentiment engine, constantly plugged into the social web to gauge mood, spot viral energy, and provide real-time market cues to its community. MIND of Pepe operates like a brain for traders in the meme coin space. Instead of relying on slow-moving analytics or gut instinct, the platform’s AI scans posts, discussions, and meme signals across social media to evaluate crowd psychology. It then translates those insights into data traders can act on—often before the market catches on. In a world where branding and timing can create more value than utility alone, MIND of Pepe serves as a toolkit for navigating volatility. It doesn’t just track what’s trending—it tries to understand why it’s trending. That matters in today’s crypto space, where signals move faster than price charts. Presale is over. 👁 $MIND can now be purchased at listing price until launch. https://t.co/YQZ9DDOMKJ pic.twitter.com/zZ9e3LMIH5 — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) May 31, 2025 At the time of writing, the project has completed its presale having raised upwards of $11.9 million, set to hit top exchanges very shortly, with several developmental updates also set to drop in the coming months. PSG’s embrace of innovation through Bitcoin and Web3 ventures validates the need for tools that bridge behavior and technology. MIND of Pepe is building that bridge in the meme coin sector, proving that data-driven intuition and humor aren’t mutually exclusive. If the next bull market is driven as much by narratives as by numbers, MIND of Pepe could become a must-have lens through which many interpret the madness. Solaxy The crypto space is increasingly bifurcated—Ethereum with its institutional adoption and Solana with its performance and accessibility. Solaxy sees this not as a divide to pick sides in, but a rift to bridge. As a Layer 2 solution, it enables fluid interaction between both chains, giving users the speed of Solana and the security of Ethereum without compromising on either. Solaxy doesn’t pitch itself as yet another scaling solution—it positions itself as infrastructure for a future where chains are interoperable and utility is chain-agnostic. On top of its technical foundation, the project also offers high-yield staking via SOLX, its native token, which supports users who want to contribute to network stability while earning passive income. PSG’s entry into Bitcoin investment territory is a reminder that performance and future-proofing go hand in hand. It’s not enough to adopt crypto—you need to make it usable, relevant, and fluid for your audience. Solaxy’s mission reflects that thinking. It doesn’t just offer access to blockchains—it simplifies that access, making it frictionless for developers and investors alike. As more institutions look for entry points into DeFi, and more users demand smooth multichain experiences, Solaxy could play a foundational role. It isn’t waiting for demand to arrive—it’s building the road in anticipation. Best Wallet Token PSG’s Bitcoin treasury isn’t a tech stunt, but rather it’s part of a larger realignment toward digital-first value management. That realignment doesn’t just need assets. It needs tools. Best Wallet Token’s product is one such tool—built not for hype, but for utility that adapts as users evolve. It’s a decentralized, non-custodial wallet that supports transactions across over 60 blockchains. But what separates it from the noise is the depth of its ecosystem. Within the wallet, users can stake, access market insights, browse presales early via the Upcoming Tokens feature, and even manage their entire portfolio—all from one interface. The BEST token serves as more than just a currency within the platform. It provides access to perks, reduced fees, and early access advantages. As crypto adoption spreads from corporations to sports clubs to everyday users, having an intuitive, comprehensive platform matters more than ever. Best Wallet isn’t a niche tool—it’s a hub for navigating crypto without hopping between 10 tabs. Just as PSG restructured its reserves to reflect what the future might look like, Best Wallet gives everyday users a similar recalibration opportunity. It’s not about chasing the next trend—it’s about equipping yourself for everything that comes after. Conclusion We’re no longer in the phase where crypto is just circling the edges of culture. When billion-dollar clubs start locking Bitcoin into their reserves, it’s a cue that the game is changing. The projects above aren’t clinging to old mechanics—they’re building for where things are going next. In times like these, the difference between noise and signal is utility; and these ones speak clearly. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Experts Doubt It,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/can-pakistans-bitcoin-mining-move-impact-btc-price-experts-doubt-it/,"The post Can Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Move Impact BTC Price? Experts Doubt It appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Pakistan plans to allocate 2,000 MW for Bitcoin mining and create a national Bitcoin reserve amid political and economic instability. IMF raises concerns over the project’s viability and energy use, questioning its feasibility amid Pakistan’s high energy costs and weak grid. This week Pakistan’s recent announcement to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining was a remarkable move. Later this week they also said that Pakistan has plans to establish a government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , this update joined amid ongoing political tensions, financial distress, and border issues. While a normal impression might be optimistic, compared with countries like El Salvador , but it’s not very optimistic. While this initiative signals a potential policy shift in the country, but its direct and immediate impact on the Bitcoin price is anticipated to be very minimal, largely due to a confluence of significant domestic challenges and international scrutiny. Adding to the challenges, the IMF has questioned Pakistan and raised red flags about the move. Keep reading to know more. Economic Viability and Infrastructure Concerns The ambitious mining plan of Pakistan faces tremendous economic viability issues, and power generation is less of an issue than its per kWh charges. The country has commercial electricity rates which are hovering somewhere around $0.20- $0.22/kWh, and are considerably higher than those in competitive mining hubs like Iran, Kuwait and other countries. Moreover, an electrical engineer based in Pakistan highlighted that even with a proposed subsidized tariff of $0.09/kWh, the cost remains barely competitive for large-scale operations compared to other countries in the global Bitcoin mining. The pricing was a major issue, but beyond pricing, the nation’s power infrastructure presents further obstacles. As Pakistan’s grid suffers from inconsistent service, distribution and transmission losses. These are major risks for energy-intensive mining facilities. IMF Scrutiny and Regulatory Roadblocks Adding to these internal challenges, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has added red flags and asked several questions, as they said this announcement was done without IMF consultation. They voiced serious concerns regarding Pakistan’s plan like the rationale behind allocating such a substantial amount of electricity, especially given the country’s ongoing chronic energy shortages and declining countries fiscal conditions. Moreover, this external oversight clearly indicates the complexities involved in moving from a conceptual plan to a fully operational one. This creates an uncertain situation for Pakistan’s dreams related to Bitcoin crypto’s. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Appoints Special Assistant for Blockchain and Crypto in PM’s Cabinet , Limited Short-to-Medium Term Impact on Bitcoin Price While the move was strategic or chaotic still remains a question. But, if in case it does establish a Bitcoin mining facility in Pakistan. It wouldn’t send the BTC price to hit mars or jupiter, from one financially weakend country’s action. Its effort could incrementally contribute to the network’s security and global demand for Bitcoin in the long run, but no major outcome seems likely in the future. Moreover, the current viability challenges and the critical intervention from the foreign organization clearly hints that its direct influence on global Bitcoin price will likely remain limited in the short to medium term, only if they successfully set up their plan in motion. However, the long-run outlook totally depends on the broader market forces, global adoption trends, and major regulatory developments. These are the combined factors that are expected to continue to be the primary drivers of the future Bitcoin price movements. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

45330667,https://invezz.com/?p=2743304,1748695800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as major contender for DeFi throne,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/31/mutuum-finance-mutm-emerges-as-major-contender-for-defi-throne/,"Since Solana (SOL) crossed the $100 mark in 2024, interest in SOL has seen a dramatic increase. However, in 2025, SOL has many investors disappointed as the price has stagnated around the $170 mark. With investors looking to make massive gains, they have turned to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which makes crypto observers describe the next “king of DeFi.” Looking at the ongoing presale, this sentiment is justified. So far, over $9.4 million worth of presale tokens have been sold. The presale is currently in phase 5, with each token selling for $0.03. In the previous phase, the token price was $0.025 and has since increased by 20%. The current phase of the presale represents the last chance to make a guaranteed 100% ROI based on the listing price of $0.06. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will increase by 16,67% to $0.035, while the guaranteed ROI will dip to 71.43%. So far, over 11,300 unique buyers have taken part in the presale, and over 9% of the phase 5 presale tokens have been sold. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fundamentals At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to interact as liquidators, borrowers, or lenders. Lenders supply the liquidity, which borrowers can access via overcollateralized loans. Meanwhile, liquidators help to maintain the overall health of the ecosystem, which is governed by the stability factor. The role of lenders Lenders’ primary role is to supply liquidity either through P2P or P2C. The peer-to-contract (P2C) is the primary means by which lenders and borrowers interact. Funds contributed by lenders can be accessed using collateral in the same contract, without the need for individual loan matching. Once lenders deposit funds in a pool, they receive an annualized percentage interest yield on their assets. The pool’s utilization rate determines the rate; as more borrowers access the pool, it causes the yield to rise, which encourages more lenders to deposit their assets. Lenders can also use the P2P to earn interest. In these pools, which are governed in separate smart contracts, lenders and borrowers engage in discussions about their terms. They can agree on the interest rate, the loan period, and many other factors. The mode is reserved for highly volatile assets with low liquidity, like the FLOKI meme coin. It is kept separate from the P2C pools to ensure that the high volatility of assets in this mode does not stabilize the overall protocol. The role of borrowers Borrowers provide collateral that is needed for loans in the ecosystem. The interest rate that borrowers pay is governed by supply and demand dynamics. Borrowers have the option to choose between stable or variable rates. With stable rates, they have a better understanding of their repayments. Once they repay a loan, the borrowed tokens return to the pool, and accrued interest flows into the revenue mechanism. Borrowers can also use collateral to mint stablecoins on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The stablecoin’s value will algorithmically be maintained at the value of the USD. The stablecoin will open up earning opportunities for its holders through arbitration to maintain this value. The role of liquidators Liquidators are another role within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) where participants can make a stable income. The entire ecosystem is maintained through a stability factor, which monitors the current collateralization of a loan against its value. If the collateral’s value falls below a certain threshold, the position is liquidated. Liquidators in the protocol can then purchase the debt at a discount and make a small profit in the process. At the same time, their actions help to keep bad debt out of the ecosystem. Incentives to stake on Mutuum Finance From the above, all participants stand to benefit from the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem. There are also numerous incentives in the ecosystem, including a profit-sharing mechanism. In the mechanism, profits from the protocol will be used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, which will be redistributed to stakers as rewards for maintaining the protocol’s security. With a robust lending protocol, coupled with a robust profit-sharing mechanism, Mutuum Finance is well-positioned to claim the DeFi throne. Recently, it passed a Certik security audit, which has boosted trust in the project and is poised to accelerate the pace of the ongoing presale. At the current price of $0.03 per token, this could be your best opportunity to join this DeFi project.

The surge, catalyzed by a sudden bullish breakout following the White House’s decision to delay 50% tariffs on EU goods, has since been tempered by geopolitical uncertainty and clear signs of market overexuberance. Social Chatter on Bitcoin Santiment’s data shows a sharp uptick in crowd optimism precisely as Bitcoin peaked, which led to an immediate correction. This is a reminder that extreme greed often precedes market pullbacks. Positive sentiment across platforms like X, Reddit, and Telegram hit its highest point this year on May 22, only to be swiftly reversed when President Trump’s tariff threat caused market jitters. Although the federal court ruling on May 28 deemed the “Liberation Day” tariffs unconstitutional, offering temporary relief, Santiment warned that recurring tariff-related discussions are now a key driver of volatility. Mentions of “tariff” and “trade war” spiked on social media in the final days of May, mirroring patterns observed during the April correction. Despite the cooling, the crowd remains bullish. The most popular Bitcoin options call is now for $300K. This sentiment depicted rising long-term expectations despite near-term instability. Santiment’s report also explained the reliability of crowd sentiment as a counter-indicator, with extreme fear on May 25 coinciding with Bitcoin’s rebound to $106K. Meanwhile, blockchain fundamentals continue to show strength. Over 147,000 BTC have exited exchanges in 2025, which reduced immediate sell pressure and suggested continued confidence among holders. The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) has declined steadily since mid-April, indicating that older coins are being reactivated. Such a trend is typically a bullish signal associated with ongoing price expansions. Santiment noted that these shifts suggest the rally is driven not solely by speculative frenzy. BTC’s Path Ahead BTC whales continue to shape market tops. On the day of Bitcoin’s ATH, there were 18,782 transactions of over $100,000. Interestingly, this was the highest since Trump’s inauguration in January, suggesting significant profit-taking by institutional players. In fact, one whale held a 40x leveraged position now worth $1.2 billion. As such, the report warns that a liquidation event below $104,810 could trigger a cascade of long positions unwinding. As Bitcoin enters a new phase of price discovery, data shows that emotional extremes and external shocks continue to dictate short-term moves, even as exchange flows and coin age metrics point toward deeper bullish foundations. The road to $300K may be steep, but investor expectations, like Bitcoin’s price, have never been higher.

Santiment analysts based the list on code changes on public Github pages of open-source cryptocurrency projects. The company also says it uses a system to prevent fake changes from creating the perception of high developer activity. Compared to the previous list, there are significant changes in the list. Chainlink (LINK), which ranked high in almost all developer activity scores, has returned to the first position in the new list, significantly widening the gap with the second-placed altcoin. However, it is also noteworthy that DeFiChain (DFI), which is known for its price drops and is the smallest altcoin on the list with a total market value of only $5.4 million, is at the top of the list.

The recent rejection highlights a key resistance zone that bulls have been unable to overcome. As global markets experience increased volatility due to rising geopolitical tensions and ongoing trade disputes between major economies like the US and China, risk assets—including crypto—are consolidating or retracing. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support Despite the pullback, top analyst Ali Martinez believes Solana could still be poised for a rebound. In a recent analysis, Martinez pointed out that as long as SOL holds above the $159 support level, the asset maintains a structurally bullish outlook. This zone now serves as a key threshold for the bulls to defend in the short term. If Solana finds enough demand at these levels, it could set the stage for a sharp recovery and renewed attempts at breaking above $180. For now, the market remains tense, with traders watching both macroeconomic developments and technical levels closely. SOL’s ability to hold critical support may determine whether it joins the next leg of a potential altcoin rally or slides into a deeper correction. Solana Consolidates Quietly While much of the market’s attention remains locked on Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana has been quietly consolidating in a tight range below the $180 resistance. The lack of volatility in recent days may seem uneventful, but analysts warn that this calm could be the precursor to a sharp breakout. As the broader market digests macroeconomic uncertainty and prepares for a potential altseason, Solana’s technical setup suggests it may be one of the first major altcoins to move. Martinez recently shared an optimistic outlook for Solana, highlighting the importance of the $159 support level. As long as SOL holds this zone, the structure remains bullish. Martinez also noted that the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the chart, typically seen during the final stages of a retracement before a new impulse begins. This aligns with the current low-volume, sideways environment that often precedes large price expansions. If Solana breaks above the $180 resistance with strong momentum, the move could spark an aggressive rally toward previous highs. Given its strong fundamentals, vibrant ecosystem, and historical leadership during bullish phases, Solana is well-positioned to lead if the market transitions into a full-fledged altseason. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Gas Usage Hits New Highs – Real Demand Powers ETH Growth Solana Tests Support As Market Corrects Solana (SOL) is currently trading around $153.49 after failing to reclaim the $180 resistance zone. The daily chart shows a sharp decline over the past few sessions, with price breaking below the 34-day EMA at $163.20. This move highlights growing bearish momentum and places the spotlight on the $150–$156 support range, where the 50-day and 100-day SMAs converge. Volume has ticked higher during this drop, suggesting stronger selling pressure as traders de-risk amid broader market uncertainty. The failure to hold above key moving averages weakens the short-term bullish outlook, though the structure hasn’t fully broken down yet. If SOL manages to stabilize above $150, this zone could act as a base for a rebound. However, continued weakness below this level may lead to a retest of lower support zones around $144 and $135. That said, RSI levels suggest Solana is approaching oversold territory on lower time frames, hinting that buyers could step in soon. Related Reading: Altseason Loading?

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031.

Short-term indicators suggest recovery. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP shows early signs of recovery As of May 31, OP/USDT is trading at $0.644, up 3.70% after a sharp drop. The price is holding above support at $0.626, with stronger support near $0.60. Resistance sits around $0.747. The MACD remains bearish, while OBV shows slight buying interest. Unless OP breaks above $0.747 with volume, this bounce may be short-lived. A drop below $0.626 could lead to further downside. OP is up 3.70% after a sharp drop The MACD remains bearish, while OBV shows slight buying interest. Unless OP breaks above $0.747 with volume, this bounce may be short-lived. A drop below $0.626 could lead to further downside. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP is gaining momentum in the short term On the 4-hour chart, OP/USDT is also up 2.71%, showing signs of a short-term recovery. The Alligator indicator still points downward, with resistance ahead at $0.662, $0.686, and $0.709. However, momentum is improving: the Balance of Power is strong at 0.89, indicating buyers are gaining control, and the CMF is trending upward, suggesting buying pressure is starting to build.

Optimism (OP) shows a short-term bounce, but the overall trend is still bearish. On the daily chart, it remains below key resistance at $0.747 with bearish MACD momentum. The 4-hour chart shows growing buying strength, but OP faces resistance at $0.662. OP may continue to recover in the short term, but unless it breaks above $0.709 with strong volume, this is likely just a relief rally, not a full reversal. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history | Source: Coinmarketcap OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

Bennett tells his 115,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has a “confirmed break” after falling below a support level at around $106,000. According to Bennett, Bitcoin could fall by up to around 13% from the current level to a price of about $91,790 if BTC loses support levels that are around $100,730 and then $97,762. “Those downside targets are in play as long as $106,000 holds as new resistance on the daily time frame.” Source: Justin Bennett/X The analyst and trader further says that Bitcoin, as well as Ethereum ( ETH ), could turn bearish as USDT dominance, the percentage of USDT’s market cap relative to the total crypto market cap, rises. “This is the same Tether dominance outlook as eight days ago, and now we have a confirmed breakout. There are no guarantees, but you have to respect what’s on the chart, not what you hope will happen. If it holds, BTC and ETH pull back. Keep it simple.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Turning to Ethereum, Bennett says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap is leaning bearish after breaking below an ascending trendline on the four-hour chart. “A little speculative right now, but I’d be willing to bet that ETH breaking this trend line opens up $2,460 and $2,360. Today’s fakeout above range highs gives Ethereum a bearish tilt. That said, markets could chop around while some of these supports hold.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading at $105,365 at time of writing, while Ethereum is trading at $2,605.

Creditors will receive up to 72% payouts, with payments processed via Kraken and BitGo. Distributions could trigger short-term crypto market volatility as recovered funds enter circulation. The FTX Recovery Trust has launched a second wave of payments to creditors, marking a major milestone in the collapsed exchange’s ongoing reimbursement process. On May 30, the Trust began distributing $5 billion to eligible creditors who completed pre-distribution requirements, targeting both the Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes. The move follows a May 28 announcement detailing how the funds would be allocated across various claim types. FTX Creditors Set to Receive Up to 72% Payout in Latest Round Under the plan, Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims are set to receive a 72% distribution, while US Customer Entitlement Claims will see a 54% payout. Convenience Claims will receive a full 120% reimbursement. General Unsecured Claims and Digital Asset Loan Claims are scheduled for a 61% distribution. Payments are being processed through official distribution partners Kraken and BitGo, with recipients expected to receive funds within one to two business days. The FTX reimbursements are being closely watched by crypto investors, as large liquidity injections from these payouts could impact digital asset markets. Analysts warn that if recipients choose to offload or swap their recovered funds on retail exchanges, it could introduce short-term price volatility. This is the second major disbursement since FTX’s collapse. The first round of payments, totaling $1.2 billion, was distributed on February 18 to claimants with less than $50,000 in approved claims. The reimbursement process has not been without controversy. In September 2024, FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri highlighted that claim values were being calculated based on prices at the time of the bankruptcy filing — during the depths of the crypto winter — rather than current market values. As a result, many creditors are recovering just 10% to 25% of their crypto holdings’ actual value.

Sam Bankman-Fried’s Release Date Set for 2044 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now projected to be released from federal prison on December 14, 2044 , after serving less than 21 years of his 25-year sentence for fraud tied to the FTX collapse. He was also fined over $11 billion. Federal records confirm that Bankman-Fried has been moved from New York to a transfer facility in Oklahoma following nearly two years behind bars. The move comes after Bankman-Fried was reportedly placed in solitary confinement earlier this month for giving an unauthorized interview to Tucker Carlson.

Ethereum ( ETH ) has declined for three consecutive days, hitting a low of $2,500. That’s a 9.8% drop from its monthly high. Despite the pullback, it has outperformed most altcoins, many of which have fallen more than 15% from their highs this month. ETH retreated ahead of June, which is usually its worst month, because of the start of summer. CoinGlass data shows that the average monthly performance in June since 2016 is minus 7.4%. Its median monthly return in June is minus 8.68%. ETH monthly returns | Source: CoinGlass June is also Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) second-worst-performing month after September, with an average return of minus 0.35%. Seasonality does not always work out. For example, ETH dropped by 18% in March, bucking a four-year trend of gains. It also dropped by 31% in February, after recording positive gains in the last six consecutive years.

First, there are signs that the coin is cheap, as the closely-watched MVRV ratio has moved to minus 0.074. The MVRV ratio compares the market value and the realized value, with a reading of less than 1 signaling that an asset is undervalued. There are also signs that Ethereum whales are buying the dip. They hold 103.5 million ETH coins, up from this week’s low of 103.45 million. Whale purchases is a highly bullish sign.

It’s currently trading in a tight zone between $2.75K and $2.4K ever since May 10. It’s worth noting that even after the recent 9% decline in $ETH’s prices, the annualized premium stands at 6%. This means that $ETH futures are currently at a 6% premium compared to spot. In simple words, traders are willing to pay more for $ETH than its spot price, indicating an overall neutral-to-bullish sentiment. Read on as we discuss the ongoing market sentiments around Ethereum. We’ll also suggest the best crypto to buy now to ride the upcoming $ETH-fueled crypto rally. Ethereum’s Positive Market Data A possible reason for the decline in $ETH’s price might be investors losing interest in dApps across the blockchain. The total value locked (TVL) of the crypto industry is currently at $122B. This is 43% less than its all-time high in December 2021. Even then, Ethereum dominates the TVL with a 54.2% market share. Out of this, 6.3% is added by Layer 2 on Ethereum. For comparison, Ethereum’s TVL is four times more than Solana and BNB Chain combined. All in all, while there has been a drop in the overall industry’s TVL, Ethereum has managed to emerge as a dominant player. Now, let’s compare the fees collected by Solana and Ethereum protocols. The top four dApps on Solana collected $356.3M in user fees in the last 30 days. Out of this, only $48.5M (13.6%) was collected as protocol fees. On the other hand, the top four dApps on Ethereum collected $169M in the last 30 days. 52% less than Solana. Out of this, $38.3M (22%) was collected as protocol fees. This is primarily because many dApps on Ethereum run on the Layer 2 solution, which settles back to the Ethereum mainnet and shares revenue with validators, creating demand for $ETH. So, while the prices may seem stagnant as of now, $ETH has still increased around 75% since mid-April. A solid consolidation is important for a sustained long-term price rally. A break above the $2.75K resistance can propel $ETH towards its all-time high at $4K. If you want to prepare yourself for this opportunity in the best manner possible, here are some top altcoins you can invest in. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Crypto to Buy Now to Identify Explode-Worthy Tokens If you’ve been at sea trying to pick the next big crypto coin and want to supercharge your crypto investing career, MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is easily the #1 crypto you should buy. $MIND is a cutting-edge AI agent that: Interacts with the crypto community – in a context-aware tone using relevant crypto and meme lingo – on online platforms like X Acknowledges their opinions and insights on specific meme coins Combines online chatter with on-chain activity data, like volume spikes, early investor funding, etc., to identify the next cryptos to explode . As a $MIND token holder, you’ll enjoy exclusive access to the AI agent’s real-time actionable crypto investment advice. Additionally, MIND of Pepe is set to ultimately reach a stage where it can create tokens from scratch. Early-bird access to these high-potential new cryptos is also a huge benefit of HODLing $MIND.

However, make sure you move fast because the $MIND presale is ending in around 2 days from now. Here’s our guide on how to buy MIND of Pepe . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana L2 with $40M in Presale Funding Solaxy ($SOLX) could be right at the center of the next surge in DeFi, seeing as it aims to revolutionize the Solana blockchain and restore its glory days. Solana, in case you’re out of the loop, has been facing congestion and scalability issues thanks to $TRUMP’s success, which brought hundreds of thousands of new investors to Solana. During peak activity hours, Solana is unable to process transactions, often resulting in failed transaction requests. Enter Solaxy. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, which will offload a lot of Solana’s transactions onto a sidechain, thereby reducing the burden on the mainnet. Additionally, $SOLX will process transactions in batches rather than one by one. As is the case in conventional banking, batch processing will reduce the cost required per transaction, meaning Solana will become even more affordable than it is currently. With over $42.7M in early investor funding, the Solaxy presale has proven that investors are really looking forward to ‘Solana’s lifesaver’ going live. If you want to join the tribe, buy $SOLX now for just $0.00174 each. Hurry up, though, because the presale is in its last stage and will close out in a couple of weeks. 3. Comedian ($BAN) – Controversial Artwork Gets Its Very Own Meme Coin Comedian ($BAN) is a low-cap coin based on the infamous artwork of the Italian virtual artist Maurizio Cattelan. The artwork, which you might have definitely seen floating around on social media, features a banana taped to a wall. Yep, that’s it! Needless to say, this rather ‘bold’ display of artistic caliber drew in a lot of negative comments, especially from lovers of contemporary, old-school art that involved a lot of thought, skill, and, oh, brushstrokes. Permissible or not, the mere controversy surrounding the art was enough for crypto degens to push the $BAN token to mainstream popularity. With lifetime gains of over 100,000%, $BAN is currently one of the top trending cryptos . It has jumped more than 30% over the past month , and you can get one $BAN for just $0.06572 right now. Sweet Gains, But Spicy Market Utility-backed presale cryptos like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and Solaxy ($SOLX) can indeed offer you once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to become crypto millionaires. However, the fact remains that the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. No returns are guaranteed! So, always jump in with a small amount and do your own research before investing.

Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto , briefly climbed higher than Bill Gates on the global wealth chart. But as quickly as it happened, a Bitcoin price drop pulled Nakamoto back down. Still, the moment sparked a fresh wave of interest in crypto’s most famous ghost and the fortune they’re quietly sitting on. Bitcoin Rally Pushed Nakamoto Ahead of Gates Nakamoto’s wallet, believed to hold 1.1 million BTC – around 5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply – recently reached a massive $113.8 billion , according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham . That briefly put him ahead of Bill Gates , whose fortune stood at $112.9 billion , based on Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires list . It was enough to make Nakamoto the 12th richest person in the world , if only for a moment. The surge was driven by optimism around a potential U.S.–China trade deal , which helped push Bitcoin’s price higher. But the Lead Didn’t Last Long The crypto market, as always, had other plans. Bitcoin’s price slipped again, bringing Nakamoto’s estimated net worth back to around $114 billion as of May 31, 2025 . Meanwhile, Gates’ net worth has risen to $166.3 billion , putting a wide gap back between the two. Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto, Anyway? Nakamoto’s true identity remains one of crypto’s biggest unanswered questions. Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, people have speculated that it could be Nick Szabo , Len Sassaman , or Peter Todd . In 2024, a documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery pointed the finger at Peter Todd but he quickly denied any connection. That only added to the legend of Satoshi: a billionaire who might not even know they’re currently one of the wealthiest people alive. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges as Public Companies Outpace ETFs in BTC Accumulation , Could Nakamoto Catch Up to Elon Musk? Topping Elon Musk , who currently has a net worth of $422.7 billion , would be a much bigger jump. For Nakamoto to match Musk, Bitcoin would need to skyrocket to $406,000 per coin. It sounds far-fetched, but in crypto, strange things happen all the time and this recent Gates moment proved that anything’s possible. Crypto’s Wealth Race: Who’s Next? This back-and-forth between Nakamoto and Gates shows just how unpredictable crypto can be. If Bitcoin rallies again, Nakamoto could easily reclaim the edge especially with Gates’ wealth holding steady. As the market keeps moving, the crypto world is watching closely – because in this game, one price spike could change everything. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ISO 20022: The Global Messaging Standard ISO 20022 is not just another regulatory buzzword; it represents a sweeping global standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. Designed to harmonize payment messaging across borders, ISO 20022 replaces fragmented legacy systems with a unified language that enhances interoperability, transparency, and data richness. As the world’s financial system shifts into a future of real-time payments and digital assets, ISO 20022 stands as the backbone of this evolution. DIRECTLY FROM SWIFT: “WE NOW SEE BLOCKCHAINS BASED ON THE ISO 20022 DATA DICTIONARY.” ISO 20022 Blockchain Listen closely. pic.twitter.com/haUFUGk0mI — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 31, 2025 SWIFT, the cooperative behind trillions of dollars in cross-border transactions, is leading the ISO 20022 migration effort, guiding banks and financial networks through a seamless transition. Until recently, this migration was largely viewed through the lens of traditional financial institutions, but the latest acknowledgment from SWIFT signals something bigger: the convergence of ISO 20022 standards with blockchain ecosystems. Ripple and the ISO 20022-Blockchain Convergence For years, Ripple has positioned XRP and its blockchain solutions as financial-grade technologies that can integrate seamlessly with existing payment infrastructures. RippleNet, Ripple’s global payment network, was designed from inception to support ISO 20022 messaging, making Ripple one of the earliest blockchain companies to align with these standards. SWIFT’s recent confirmation that it now recognizes blockchains based on the ISO 20022 data dictionary bolsters Ripple’s strategic narrative. This suggests that blockchains, particularly those built for institutional-grade finance, are no longer outsiders or disruptors but are being absorbed into the fabric of global financial standards. For XRP, this development sharpens its identity not merely as a speculative crypto asset but as a utility token built to thrive within a harmonized, standards-driven global payments landscape. Why This Matters for XRP’s Future Ripple’s commitment to ISO 20022 has always been more than technical compliance; it’s a signal to banks, central banks, and financial institutions that Ripple’s solutions are enterprise-ready. With SWIFT’s acknowledgment, blockchain systems like RippleNet gain additional legitimacy in the eyes of conservative financial players who demand rigorous adherence to international standards. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, as financial institutions increasingly migrate to ISO 20022-based systems, they will naturally seek blockchain solutions that can seamlessly integrate into this architecture. Ripple, with its head start in this domain, stands poised to capture significant institutional demand. XRP, as the native asset facilitating liquidity within Ripple’s ecosystem, could thus see a surge in utility-driven adoption, not simply as a bridge currency, but as a core component of ISO 20022-aligned settlement flows. The Broader Implication: Blockchain’s Institutional Embrace SMQKE’s highlighting of SWIFT’s statement serves as a milestone marker in the blockchain’s journey from a fringe technology to an institutional mainstay. While many blockchains and crypto projects have pursued innovation outside regulatory frameworks, Ripple has consistently emphasized compliance, interoperability, and integration. The recognition that blockchains can operate on the ISO 20022 data dictionary is not just a technical nod; it is a profound endorsement of the maturation of blockchain solutions, and Ripple’s XRP is right at the center of that evolution. This development also sends ripples across the regulatory landscape. As blockchains align more tightly with global standards, it becomes increasingly difficult for regulators to dismiss them as rogue or untested. Instead, they become part of the solution, helping modernize and streamline global finance in a way that meets both institutional needs and compliance requirements.

The BTC slide triggered a massive $687 million in trader liquidations, the biggest wipeout seen since February. The cumulative crypto market cap dropped by over 2% to stand at $3.24 trillion. The sell-off got triggered by US President Donald Trump’s reignition of trade war fears by doubling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum to 50%. He accused Beijing of breaking a key May agreement. Trump’s aggressive stance sent shockwaves through global markets, raising concerns over economic fallout. Bitcoin bears eye $102K next Data shows that Bitcoin is stuck below $104K after facing rejection from $106K due to increased selling pressure. It will be crucial to see if bulls can defend this level. Bitcoin futures saw over $153 million being liquidated. 93% of these liquidated positions ($137 million) turned out to be long bets set in BTC price action. It was followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $122 million, Solana (SOL) at $33 million, XRP at $30 million, and Dogecoin at over $22 million. As per IT tech, a cryptoquant analyst, the Bitcoin price trend of printing lower highs and lower lows confirms bearish momentum. The “sell” signal got confirmed at $106k, which shifted down the trend and is still expanding downward. Bitcoin is still stuck below $104K after rejection from $106K Price just wicked into $103K territory with visible pressure from sellers.

Volume profile depicts that there is a heavy interest around $103K, and the breakdown below this level will signal a deeper move towards the $102K zone. Bears are pressing the market lower, and the $103K zone remains a critical short-term support. However, if BTC surges past $104.8K would be the first sign for bulls to regain momentum. Big whales flip to selling mode Bitcoin price dropped by more than 5% over the past 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $103,528 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume dipped by 20% to stand at $50.73 billion. On-chain data reveals that while open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged 51% since April and options have skyrocketed 126%. Big players like whales holding over 10,000 BTC have quietly flipped from accumulation to net selling. This has pushed coins back onto exchanges in a classic profit-taking scenario. Bitcoin-linked ETFs depict the position. May 30 saw a total net outflow of $616 million from US BTC ETFs, with none of the twelve ETFs recording a net inflow. On the other hand, Ethereum ETFs posted a net inflow of over $70 million, hitting 10 consecutive days of inflows. The Fear and Greed index has turned back to the “Neutral” zone after flashing greed for a couple of weeks. With Ether and XRP down by nearly 4%, and Solana off by 6%, traders are now watching for a potential reversal or bracing for more turbulence.

It's a common scam vector. Still, someone tried it on me. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Account compromise The narrative Last weekend, an unknown California number called me. A helpful gentleman informed me that my Coinbase account had been compromised during its recent data breach and he was there to assist me in not losing my assets. Oh no, the horror! Why it matters All right, so obviously this is a scam. Right after hanging up with this supposed help desk agent, I texted a Coinbase spokesperson to verify that at no point would the exchange call a customer to tell them their account was compromised. It's scam 101 — if you're getting a phone call informing you that your account's been compromised , whether at a crypto exchange, a bank, the IRS, whatever, it's a scam . Do not share your personal details and do not provide any passwords if you get a call like this. There were a few flaws in the attempt to get me to, presumably, move my funds from my supposedly compromised Coinbase account to another address. But I'm hopeful that this can be a useful teaching moment for the nearly 70,000 people who have been affected by Coinbase's recent breach disclosure, as well as anyone else who receives a phone call claiming their information has been compromised. Here's how this went down. Breaking it down Let's start from the beginning. On Saturday, May 24, I received a call from a number I didn't recognize to my personal phone, not my public-facing work number. It being a weekend, one where I was actually visiting family in another state, I didn't pick up. Then the same number called back and I still didn't pick up (yes I know, riveting, but it's 2025 and you can leave a voicemail or text). Ten minutes later, I received a third call from a different number, which I did pick up because at that point I was curious. A fast-talking gentleman who called himself Riccardo told me he was part of Coinbase's Actions and Protections Department and that he was reaching out because my Coinbase account information had been compromised and a new email had just been added to my account. I was pretty confused, for reasons I'll get into below. But I was also intrigued because there were immediately four red flags. For simplicity's sake, I'll refer to the caller as ""the agent"" from here on out, but to be absolutely clear, I doubt he is an actual customer service agent, representative or other employee of Coinbase, and he certainly was not reaching out to me as an authorized representative of the exchange. First off, the phone call itself is a big red flag. Coinbase will never call a customer about a breach, but rather will contact customers via email, it previously said in a tweet . This is actually standard. The Federal Trade Commission website notes there is a vast range of scams wherein someone will call you, and numerous other companies have warnings that their employees will never proactively call a customer about account issues. The agent I spoke to said they would freeze my account for 24 hours to ensure no funds could be stolen (thanks, I guess?) and that a supervisor would reach out to me (I continue to wait for this supervisor to call). This supposed freeze on my account can be extended to three months if there are multiple failed login attempts. To wrap up the call, he said he'd send me an email summarizing all the details we'd discussed. On Saturday night, I received an email with the subject line ""your case is under review."" The follow-up email this very helpful customer service representative sent was extremely informative. For one thing, the email address they had associated with my account is a public-facing address, but is not the email address attached to my actual Coinbase account (in fairness, I forgot that part until I tried to find my login information a few days later). Gmail initially (correctly) flagged this email as spam. I moved it to my inbox, where Gmail then showed me that the sender ( help@info-coinbase.com ) was not the actual sender — the email arrived via learnindonesian.online. Even the info-coinbase.com part is sketchy — for one thing, Coinbase's website is coinbase.com , though it does send emails from info@info.coinbase.com — still, you wouldn't expect a hyphen in a support email domain. For another, the info-coinbase domain was first created in November 2024 (according to an ICANN lookup ) and isn't a real website. The email headers were also not super helpful in terms of providing any sort of identifying information, but they did confirm that the sender appeared to have tried to obfuscate their information. Curiously, the ""Visit Coinbase"" link at the bottom appeared to link to the actual Coinbase website and there do not appear to be any hidden embedded images or other attached files in the email at all. I'm not totally sure what's going on there. A real scammer could have embedded a virus of some sort into the email or even a tracking pixel. Another common tool scammers might use is putting in a phishing link in place of a legitimate one in an email, tricking the user into going to a website intended to steal their login information (this is not legal, technical or any other sort of advice; if you decide to try and scam somebody using information you gleaned from this newsletter, stop it). While scammers might sometimes know how much their intended victims have in a wallet or account, the person who called me did not appear to have that information (as I have zero crypto in my Coinbase account). I called the number back on Friday to see what might happen. No one picked up. I guess my account must be secure now.

With over $9.70 million raised in its presale and more than 11,650 holders already on board, the project is breaking through the noise. Combined with a fully completed CertiK audit and a powerful utility model, it’s clear why the crypto community is starting to treat Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as more than just a trending name — it’s becoming a real contender in the DeFi space. Numbers that signal real trust In a market still recovering from countless rug pulls and broken promises, numbers matter. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already pulled in $9.70 million during its presale phase, and it’s not even live yet. Over 11,650 investors have committed, and this isn’t speculative hype — it’s capital and user growth backed by development progress and third-party validation. That validation came from one of the industry’s most trusted names, CertiK. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) underwent a full audit including static analysis and manual review. The result was a Token Scan Score of 70.00, issued after a revision in May 2025. For many serious traders, a CertiK audit isn’t just a checkbox — it’s a signal that a project has nothing to hide and everything to build. Where the capital is going The $9.70 million raised so far isn’t just sitting idle. This capital is being directed toward launching Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s core infrastructure. The team is already developing its decentralized lending protocol, which includes both P2P and P2C functionality. The P2P system allows users to lend and borrow a wide range of tokens, including ones that are usually excluded from traditional lending platforms. That includes memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Meanwhile, the P2C model focuses on stable, high-liquidity assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and DAI, creating structured lending pools for users looking to earn reliable passive income. The team has already confirmed that a fully functional beta version of the platform will launch by the time the token goes live — a major delivery milestone that most presale projects struggle to meet. Passive income you can count on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just for traders. Long-term holders and passive income seekers also have a reason to get excited. By depositing assets like ETH or DAI into Mutuum’s P2C lending pools, users can earn annual returns between 7% and 18%, depending on pool utilization. This isn’t theoretical. For example, putting $5,000 worth of DAI into the protocol can generate annual returns of up to $900. Unlike staking in volatile platforms, these rewards are directly tied to lending demand, creating a sustainable income model for conservative investors. Community growth points to viral spread Beyond the capital and token mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is witnessing explosive community growth. Telegram groups are expanding fast, daily engagement is surging, and influencers on X (formerly Twitter) have begun spotlighting the project for its rapid traction and promising fundamentals. The $100K giveaway currently running has only added to the buzz, pulling in thousands of new eyes and wallets. But giveaways are just an entry point — the real retention comes from what the project delivers next. And Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering across the board. CertiK seal builds post-rug confidence In a time when investor trust is hard to win, a CertiK audit is a huge credibility booster. With so many projects collapsing due to unchecked contracts or malicious devs, seeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) score a 70.00 on Token Scan gives serious confidence to risk-aware traders. It means the code has been reviewed, the logic verified, and the risk exposure minimized. This added transparency plays a major role in onboarding new capital — both retail and institutional — and is one of the strongest reasons why the project is being taken seriously at this stage. This is what early traction looks like It’s rare to find a project that checks all the boxes — rising capital, growing user base, certified security, working product, and clear utility. But Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does. With a current price of just $0.03, there’s a closing window to get in before the next phase pushes prices higher and profit margins lower. The next phases will bring higher entry costs, more competition for tokens, and less room for explosive gains. The smartest move? Enter now, not later. Because once it hits exchanges and trading begins, the chance to get MUTM at a floor price will be gone for good. This isn’t a project to watch. It’s a project to join.

According to the firm, it plans to raise 450 million reais (about $78 million) to purchase the leading digital asset, a move that has caused its shares to tumble over 8%. Méliuz, which trades in the cashback and coupon business, trades on the B3 exchange in Brazil under the ticker CASH3. The company initially plans to offer about 17 million common shares to raise around 150 million reais (approximately $26.2 million). The company also left enough space to expand the offering by up to 200%, which could see it triple the amount if demand goes as planned. Méliuz embraces Bitcoin amid its transformation The latest announcement marks a new chapter in the company’s transformation, moving from a traditional fintech to what can be described as the first Bitcoin treasury company in Brazil. Since March, when the company made a $4.13 million Bitcoin purchase, Méliuz has accumulated around 320.2 BTC, currently worth $33.55 million. It also became one of the first fintech companies in Brazil to offer crypto exposure to its clients, with this new step a way to increase its involvement in the industry. “Rather than just allocating part of its cash to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, the company has repositioned its purpose to act by maximizing the amount of Bitcoin per share,” the company said in a previous statement about its strategy shift. Markets appear to have priced in the news, with the company’s stock swinging wildly over the past year. The stock is up 217% since the beginning of 2025 at around 2.53 reais per share, climbing to a high of around 11 reais. The recent drop saw the price hit 8.13 reais, with trading volume hitting 6.51 million shares. According to Ray Nasser, the head of the Latin America branch of trading firm BlockFills, Méliuz has been adopting the same strategy as Michael Saylor-owned Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). He mentioned that the move has been able to help its shareholders get better value for their money. “The company lost its relevance over the years, and its stock price went down,” he said. “Although it made a turnaround in 2024, it’s doing what Strategy is doing now, it’s riding the hype.” Comparison to Strategy and Bitcoin adoption The firm has earned the compliment of being compared to United States firm, Strategy over the last few years. Strategy kickstarted the big-scale Bitcoin adoption in the United States, with the firm now holding about 580,250 Bitcoins, worth over $60 billion, using several capital raises. During the bull run, the company’s stock outperformed Bitcoin itself, creating what some analysts called a “Bitcoin proxy” for investors. But Méliuz carries out its operation differently, with the company’s market cap hovering around 305 million reais ($53.8 million), a fraction of its 9 billion reais peak after it went public in 2020. Meanwhile, the company has set its pricing for June 12, with trading of the new shares beginning on June 16. The company has scheduled two priority subscription periods for existing shareholders, with the first expected to start on June 4 after a June 3 cutoff date, and the second expected to end on June 10, after a June 9 cutoff date, allowing them to own the new shares first. The company was founded in 2011 and has built its business on cashback rewards and discount coupons, partnering with over 1,000 brands and accumulating 35 million registered users. Méliuz started offering Bitcoin exposure to clients back in 2022 when PayPal and other companies showed positive results experimenting with crypto purchases.

Particularly impressed by the clear go to market plans and awareness of incoming and existing xrpl features e.g smart escrows and payment channels. Good stuff folks! pic.twitter.com/075vuiXRJO — Vet (@Vet_X0) May 30, 2025 What makes the XRPL stand out in the broader blockchain landscape is its combination of speed, scalability, and low transaction costs, attributes that many of the pitching teams are strategically harnessing. Vet’s insights emphasize that these teams not only have innovative ideas but are also well-prepared for market integration, with concrete execution plans that leverage the ledger’s growing capabilities. Leveraging Smart Escrows and Payment Channels One of the standout features gaining attention among the projects at XRP Las Vegas is the use of smart escrows. This enables automatic execution of conditional payments when predefined criteria are met, which is particularly useful for applications such as automated payouts, decentralized insurance, and escrow services. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another critical innovation is the XRPL’s payment channels, which enable near-instant microtransactions off-chain while ultimately settling on-chain, a vital tool for scaling high-volume payment applications. Several projects pitched at the event showcased sophisticated plans to integrate these features, signaling their understanding not just of the technical layer but also of how to translate these tools into competitive advantages in the real world. A Community Ready for the Next Phase The atmosphere at XRP Las Vegas reflects more than just technical experimentation; it reveals a community poised for growth. Over the past year, the XRPL ecosystem has seen the rollout of sidechain developments, the rise of the EVM-compatible sidechain to attract Ethereum developers, and an increase in institutional interest. The projects pitching this year are leveraging the momentum, transitioning from theoretical phases to practical applications ready for the market. Moreover, the energy from the event is bolstered by a maturing regulatory landscape. With partial legal clarity and Ripple’s ongoing global partnerships, the XRP Ledger is positioning itself as a viable backbone for international finance and cross-border transactions. This environment gives builders confidence, a fact made clear by the polished, investor-ready pitches seen at the Las Vegas gathering.

According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P indices, those retirement plans are often invested in funds that track the S&P 500, and the AAPL (Apple stock) accounts for 6% of the S&P 500’s value. Apple stock has tumbled 20% this year and 3% earlier this month when Trump demanded that the company move all its production operations to the United States. Apple is currently the third-largest U.S. company by market value, influencing the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. The company has lost nearly $1 trillion in market value this year, currently at $3 trillion after topping $3.9 trillion in December. 401(k) plans take a hit from Apple stock falling Apple has been dropping since the beginning of the year, along with many other stocks, due to Trump’s trade war uncertainty. Companies like Amazon , Google, and Tesla, which are tracked by the S&P 500, are in the same boat as Apple. Amazon has tumbled by 6%, Google 9%, and Tesla 14% this year, which could add to 401(k)s stalling. Nvidia and Microsoft have helped keep the S&P 500 afloat with gains of 0.6% and 9% this year, respectively. However, the S&P 500 index is down by 0.01% today. Scott Ladner, Chief Investment Officer at Horizon Investments, revealed that if the market uncertainty continues, some economic consequences will eventually be experienced. By December last year, American retirement plans held $44.1 trillion, with $8.9 trillion in 401(k)s. The Dow Jones fell by 0.58%, and the Nasdaq dropped by 1.61% today. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 companies experienced principal stock value drops after the reinstatement of Trump’s tariffs on China, with the energy and information sectors suffering the most. Trump revealed that China had breached an agreement with the U.S. to put back tariffs on essential minerals. He did not specify how China had violated the deal and did not offer a permanent solution to the trade war. Investors diversify their portfolios to shield their finances against market uncertainty Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird Private Wealth Management, urged Americans to find out where their retirement savings are invested to ensure they are well diversified. He added that although funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 are relatively well diversified, different 401(k) plans may offer different exposures to areas of the market. Steffen revealed that Americans must know how much of their finances have been invested in big companies like Apple to better understand how policies affect their portfolios directly during periods of volatility. According to Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and technology analyst at CFRA Research, Apple is significantly exposed to tariff uncertainty, and the stock may continue to fall in the coming months. He urged investors to wait to see the stock price’s outcome. The ongoing antitrust concerns against Apple and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, signal more challenges ahead, according to Zino. In August, a federal judge ruled that Google had an illegal monopoly on the search engine. Zino said this could continue to affect Apple stock and, in turn, negatively influence the S&P 500. Trump’s tariffs eliminated a tax exemption on goods of $800 or less, leading Americans to pay more for imported goods. Consumers are prompted to turn to Amazon and Etsy, which emphasize low prices. Amazon recently introduced a beta tool called Amazon Haul, a service that allows Americans to pay $20 less for imported items. Analysts said this gives the company a competitive advantage during uncertainty.

If you’re wondering what crypto to buy now with serious upside, meme coin veterans like PEPE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are showing renewed strength, supported by rising social sentiment and whale accumulation. These coins may have playful origins, but they continue to dominate trading volumes and remain among the best cryptos to invest in for those chasing exponential gains. Alongside these household names, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting attention from early adopters seeking the next big cryptocurrency to explode, and potentially turn modest stakes into six-figure windfalls. Meme Coin Momentum: PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE Show Signs of Life in 2025 PEPE is trading at $0.000014, experiencing a drop of 1.3% over the past 24 hours. The token has been relatively strong despite market volatility, continuing to be among the popular meme tokens. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000016, with a slight drop of 0.0138% from the previous day. The meme coin remains in the consolidation phase, as the analysts notice a symmetrical triangle formation that is likely indicative of an imminent breakout. Dogecoin (DOGE) is at $0.222988 and has lost 0.0123% over the last 24 hours. Despite this slight drop, DOGE continues to attract attention, with speculations over a potential rally supported by recurring bullish patterns on higher timeframes. While these well-established meme coins take advantage of the dominant market conditions, such nascent projects as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining investment interest for their potential to generate high returns. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The Mutuum Finance presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06. Early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns when MUTM goes live. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.4 million raised and attracting more than 11,500 investors. The token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency Delivered: Stablecoin and Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance is not only innovating, it is establishing trust. The platform’s open-source smart contracts have undergone a rigorous, officially completed audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin that is engineered to steer clear of pitfalls that have toppled algorithmic stablecoins. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the stablecoin is a keystone of the Mutuum Finance roadmap. Security and transparency are always primary pillars of the ecosystem. 2025 presents a prime chance to turn $5,000 into $500,000 by investing in top meme coins like PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE, alongside rising stars like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM’s presale has raised over $9.4 million with 11,500+ investors, currently priced at $0.03 and set to list at $0.06, offering early investors up to 100% gains. Its unique dual lending model and completed Certik audit add strong credibility. Don’t miss out.

As Dogecoin remains a household name in the crypto community, analysts suggest that Ruvi AI’s combination of real-world applications and massive growth potential could soon make it a viable competitor. Here’s how Ruvi AI is making waves and why market analysts are taking note. Building Credibility Through Partnerships One of the standout moves securing Ruvi AI’s place in the competitive crypto market is its high-profile partnership with the WEEX Exchange . By aligning with WEEX, Ruvi AI has gained essential visibility, offering token holders unparalleled accessibility and liquidity. This collaboration ensures that Ruvi AI tokens are available for trading on a trusted, user-friendly platform, which is vital for long-term investor confidence. Apart from WEEX, Ruvi AI continues to explore partnerships aimed at driving adoption and extending its utility across various industries. These partnerships not only strengthen its position but also showcase the innovation that sets Ruvi AI apart from the crowded crypto landscape. Record-Breaking Presale Success Ruvi AI’s recent presale results underscore its market appeal. Having already sold over 130 million tokens and raised almost $1.5 million , the project is turning heads among both retail and institutional investors. With an entry price of just $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI provides early backers with a unique opportunity for exponential growth. What’s even more exciting is the projected trajectory of the token. Analysts estimate that Ruvi AI could reach $1 by Q4 2025 , delivering a stunning 12,800% ROI . For investors who may have missed out on crypto sensations like Dogecoin or Ethereum in their early stages, Ruvi AI promises to be the next big mover. Real-World Applications That Demand Attention What sets Ruvi AI apart from speculative meme coins like Dogecoin is its focus on real-world utility. Unlike Dogecoin, which lacks functional applications, Ruvi AI addresses pain points across industries using a blend of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Here are its key areas of impact: Healthcare: By using AI to enhance diagnostic accuracy and streamline patient outcomes, Ruvi AI brings efficiency to a critical field. Logistics: Ruvi AI improves supply chain performance, cutting costs and ensuring reliability for businesses worldwide. Finance: Driving advancements in fraud detection and payment security, Ruvi AI supports the increasingly digital financial sector. This focus on usability ensures Ruvi AI isn’t just a speculative asset; it’s a solution-oriented platform poised for long-term adoption. VIP Investment Options For early investors looking to maximize returns, Ruvi AI’s VIP investment program offers incredible incentives. These investment tiers allow participants to take larger positions with bonuses that significantly enhance their token allocations. Here’s a breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000.

These tiers reflect Ruvi AI’s commitment to rewarding its early backers, ensuring they enjoy compounded growth as the project evolves. Could Ruvi AI Challenge Dogecoin? Dogecoin has long enjoyed its position as a playful yet popular cryptocurrency, but its lack of real-world applications makes it vulnerable to competition. Analysts believe Ruvi AI could become a serious challenger to Dogecoin’s prominence, thanks to its scalability, strategic partnerships, and practical utility. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies heavily on community-driven momentum, Ruvi AI gets its value from solving real problems across essential industries. Its forward-looking technology, coupled with the growing adoption of blockchain and AI, positions it as a leader in the emerging era of utility-driven crypto projects. Final Thoughts Ruvi AI has all the indicators of a breakout cryptocurrency project. With over 130 million tokens sold, almost $1.5 million raised, strategic partnerships like its collaboration with WEEX Exchange, and a roadmap focused on real-world applications, Ruvi AI is well on its way to defining itself as more than just another crypto contender. For investors navigating the market for projects with both potential and substance, Ruvi AI provides an exciting alternative to meme coins like Dogecoin. Its combination of innovation, scalability, and massive ROI potential makes it a project that simply can’t be ignored.

The project has crossed $278 million in presale funds and relaunched its most rewarding feature: the ‘Double Your BDAG’ offer. Those who’ve already contributed $200 or more can now boost their BDAG balance by topping up 50% of their earlier amount. This move effectively halves their total price of entry. With BDAG’s price frozen at $0.0018 until June 13 and Batch 28 priced at $0.0262, buyers are rushing to make as much out of this opportunity. Add the Double BDAG offer, and the potential return, and it becomes clear why this presale is the largest in crypto history. Once Batch 45 sells out, the presale will end, and no more bonuses or entry offers will follow. The GO LIVE reveal on June 13 will also confirm BlockDAG’s listing on over 20 centralized exchanges. Confirmed names so far include MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank. On the tech side, the X1 miner app has crossed one million users, with more than 17,750 miners already shipped. With its EVM compatibility and hybrid PoW+DAG model, BlockDAG supports faster speeds and cost-efficient smart contracts. Among top bullish altcoins gaining traction, BlockDAG stands out with its strong ecosystem and numbers backing its rise. With the $0.0018 price active only until June 13, and the GO LIVE reveal coming up, this may be the final chance for early entry. Ethereum Price Chart Eyes Breakout Past $2,800 Ethereum (ETH) is climbing again, now above $2,700 for the first time since February. It rose 5% in 24 hours and over 53% across the last month. This run is backed by major ETF activity. Over $402 million has flowed into ETH spot ETFs this month alone, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust adding $53 million in just one day, pushing its total to $4.3 billion. Technicals are bullish. The ETH price chart is showing strength across moving averages, with RSI near 71.5. This suggests momentum remains strong. A clean break over $2,800 could see ETH move toward $2,900 or even $3,000. If prices fall, key support levels are $2,650 and the 20-day moving average at $2,573. Traders are watching closely for either outcome. XRP Price Forecast Jumps with $21 Target on Bullish Flag XRP is showing signs of a major breakout. The latest charts indicate a bull flag forming on the monthly timeframe, prompting analysts to place the XRP price target anywhere from $5 to $21. Egrag Crypto says the current setup resembles the 2017 run that ended in XRP’s previous all-time high at $3.84. His analysis points to a possible $18 high using the logarithmic model, and $5.50 on a linear chart. This gives a wide range between $6.60 and $21.70, depending on how momentum plays out. But this isn’t just about chart signals. XRP’s utility is expanding fast. It’s now used in cross-border payments, real-world asset tokenization, and DePIN systems. Some analysts are comparing its setup to Bitcoin’s historical patterns. If demand keeps building, XRP could become one of the top bullish altcoins of 2025. In Summary Ethereum is making a serious push toward $3,000, thanks to ETF inflows and a bullish chart pattern. XRP also looks strong, with some analysts forecasting a price target of up to $21 based on growing real-world use and technical signals. But there’s one more project making big strides. BlockDAG has reopened its ‘Double Your BDAG’ offer, giving qualifying users a way to double their BDAG holdings for just 50% of the cost. With more than $278 million already raised, over 21.7 billion coins sold, and a GO LIVE reveal scheduled for June 13 across 20+ exchanges, the window is narrow. BDAG is priced at $0.0018 until then, creating a huge upside before the $0.05 launch. Among the top bullish altcoins this year, BlockDAG may be one of the best plays left before the presale closes at Batch 45.

Analyst Presents Bullish Chart,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-targets-rocket-rally-to-1-5-analyst-presents-bullish-chart/,"Cardano (ADA) has captured fresh market attention following a compelling forecast shared by well-known crypto analyst Crypto Beast. In a recent X post, Crypto Beast boldly predicted a rocket rally for ADA, eyeing an ambitious price target of $1.5. The post, accompanied by a bullish technical chart, has stirred excitement across the Cardano community and beyond, fueling optimism that ADA could soon reclaim price levels not seen since the last major crypto bull run. Crypto Beast’s Bullish Call and Chart Analysis Crypto Beast has built a reputation for delivering timely technical insights, and his latest ADA analysis is no exception. The shared chart highlights a series of key bullish signals. According to Crypto Beast, this setup indicates significant upside potential, with the $1.5 mark emerging as the next major target zone. $ADA target $1.5 pic.twitter.com/uN9lL2j5WM — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) May 30, 2025 The timing of this call is particularly significant. ADA has been steadily recovering over recent weeks, bouncing from local lows and showing resilience amid broader market fluctuations. Crypto Beast’s analysis suggests that this recovery is not just a short-term rebound but part of a larger structural shift toward sustained bullish momentum. Cardano’s Strong Fundamental Backdrop While technical patterns can generate short-term trading opportunities, the broader narrative around Cardano offers further support to the bullish case. Cardano has long been positioned as one of the most academically rigorous blockchain projects, emphasizing peer-reviewed research, formal methods, and scalable proof-of-stake consensus. Over the past year, the Cardano ecosystem has displayed a notable surge in decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, and developer engagement. Recent network data shows that Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) has reached new highs, reflecting growing confidence in the platform’s smart contract capabilities. Additionally, the ongoing rollout of the Voltaire era, the governance phase of Cardano’s development roadmap, is set to further decentralize the network by handing governance control directly to the community. This positions Cardano as a uniquely robust and resilient ecosystem in the evolving Web3 landscape, providing strong fundamental tailwinds for ADA’s valuation. Market Sentiment and Whale Activity Another crucial layer to this unfolding narrative is market sentiment, particularly among large holders, often referred to as “whales.” Timestabloid reported that significant ADA accumulation has been underway over the past several weeks, with large addresses steadily increasing their holdings. Such whale accumulation is often viewed as a vote of confidence in an asset’s near-term price prospects, as these players typically operate with a longer-term perspective and access to sophisticated market insights. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the same time, social sentiment around ADA has been steadily improving. Mentions of Cardano across crypto forums, social media platforms, and influencer channels have climbed notably, reflecting renewed interest from both retail investors and institutional players. With momentum building both on-chain and off-chain, ADA’s market environment appears increasingly primed for a substantial rally. Historical Patterns and Psychological Levels Cardano’s price history also lends weight to Crypto Beast’s $1.5 target. ADA has previously demonstrated a tendency to move in sharp, impulsive waves following periods of consolidation. The $1.5 level itself holds psychological significance, representing not only a major round-number milestone but also a key historical resistance zone from past market cycles. A successful break above this level could open the door to even higher price targets, as momentum traders and sidelined investors re-enter the market in force. Psychologically, the $1.5 threshold serves as a marker of Cardano’s resurgence, signaling a return to levels associated with bullish market conditions. Achieving this target could reignite broader confidence in ADA’s long-term potential, catalyzing further adoption and capital inflows. As always, crypto investors should approach such predictions with a blend of optimism and caution, recognizing both the opportunities and the inherent volatility of digital asset markets. Nevertheless, all eyes are now on ADA’s next moves, as the stage appears set for Cardano to reclaim its position as a leading force in the crypto space. Whether Crypto Beast’s $1.5 target materializes in the near term or takes a longer runway, one thing is clear: Cardano’s momentum is once again surging, and the market is paying attention.

Researcher g0njxa revealed that Dark Partners is a group engaged in large-scale digital asset theft. The hackers operate multiple sites distributing stealers disguised as AI services, VPNs, and cryptocurrency software, including fake versions of TradingView, MetaTrader 5, Ledger, Exodus, Koinly, AAVE, and Unusual Whales apps. An ongoing malware campaign has been delivering ”PayDay Loader” to Windows users and ”Poseidon Stealer” to macOS users via fake AI and software websites.

The hackers also collect host information, credentials, private keys, and cookies for resale. g0njxa suggested that Dark Partners is using acquired code signing certificates to build Windows malware. Trickbot Leader Unmasked in Germany The German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has identified the leader of the Trickbot and Conti hacker groups, known as Stern, as 36-year-old Russian Vitaly Kovalev. He has been declared wanted on charges of forming a criminal organization and is presumed to be hiding in the Russian Federation. In February 2023, Kovalev was one of seven people sanctioned by the US for ties to Trickbot and Conti. At the time, he was named a high-ranking figure in these groups. According to the BKA, Trickbot had over 100 members and is responsible for infecting hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. AI Tool Demands $50,000 in Monero Cisco Talos experts discovered malware spreading as legitimate AI tool installers, including the CyberLock and Lucky_Gh0$t ransomware viruses, as well as the Numero viper. CyberLock operators intimidate victims by claiming to have gained full access to confidential business documents, personal files, and databases. They demand $50,000 in Monero for the decryption key, promising to send the money as humanitarian aid to various countries. The hackers threaten to publish the data if payment is not received within three days; however, experts found no evidence of data exfiltration functionality in the ransomware’s code. Lucky_Gh0$t operates similarly. Numero, on the other hand, manipulates GUI components by rewriting the contents of windows and buttons with numeric sequences, rendering the operating system unusable. AVCheck Admins Linked to Crypto Services in the Netherlands Police in the Netherlands, assisted by US counterparts, blocked the AVCheck service used by cybercriminals to test their malware against commercial antivirus solutions. Investigators also linked the site’s administrators to crypto services Cryptor.biz and Crypt.guru. The domain of the former has been seized, while the latter is offline. Encryption services help malware operators hide their data, making them part of the same ecosystem. Undercover agents posing as customers helped shut down these services. New Service Claims to Locate YouTube Commenters A new service called YouTube-Tools has appeared online, claiming it can find all comments made by a YouTube user and, with the help of AI, create a profile indicating their presumed place of residence, language skills, interests, and political views, according to 404 Media. The service was originally created to study League of Legends usernames, but with the transition to a modified LLM from Mistral, its capabilities have expanded. According to the developer, YouTube-Tools is intended for law enforcement agencies. However, after registration and for about $20 per month, it is available to anyone. Experts warn that the tool could pose a serious privacy threat. UK Announces Modernization of Cyber Military British Defense Secretary John Healey has revealed government plans to create a cyber command responsible for defending the country from hacker attacks and supporting military cyber operations. The new structure will modernize the guidance and coordination systems of army units using AI technology at a cost of £1 billion ($1.3 billion). Cyber Command will also play a leading role in electronic warfare, intercepting enemy communications and jamming drones. Over the past two years, British authorities have faced an estimated 90,000 cyberattacks from foreign intelligence agencies, mostly from Russia and China.",News|Security,EN,0,0,AAVE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET|XMR,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-31 15:09:15

Strategy led the list of corporate BTC accumulators, but more public companies followed the same playbook at smaller scales. A Bitwise report revealed that publicly traded companies held roughly 688K BTC by the end of March, representing a 16.1% quarter-on-quarter surge. Total corporate BTC holdings represented a 2.15% increase in total value from the previous quarter and 3.28% of the 21M BTC supply. The increase in holdings pushed the total value of Bitcoin held by public firms to approximately $56.7B, based on an average BTC price of $82,445. The report also revealed that 12 new companies added Bitcoin to their treasuries for the first time during Q1 2025, increasing the total number of publicly traded firms accumulating BTC to 79. Hong Kong-based Ming Shing was the largest new buyer. Its subsidiary, Lead Benefit, acquired 833 BTC in two separate purchases in January and February. Strategy leads public firms in BTC acquisition during Q1 2025 CryptoQuant data revealed that Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) added 81,785 BTC in Q1 2025, spending slightly above $8 billion. It also spent $1.4 billion to acquire 15,355 Bitcoin from April 21 to April 28, bringing its total holdings to 553,555 BTC worth over $52 billion based on BTC’s price of over $95K at the time. Strategy bought 1,895 more BTC during the week of April 28 to May 4, 2025, at an average price of $95,167, bringing its total holdings to 555,450 BTCs valued at around $57.7 billion based on BTC price at the time. Rumble made headlines with a 188 BTC buy in March, while another unexpected entrant, HK Asia Holdings Limited, bought just one Bitcoin in February, which doubled its share price in a single trading day. Japan’s Metaplanet also disclosed on April 14 that it had purchased an additional 319 BTC at an average price of about $82,770, bringing its total holdings to 4,525 BTC valued at around $383.2 million. Metaplanet’s $406 million BTC investment positioned it among the top corporate holders globally — currently ranked tenth, just behind Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc. According to Arkham data, cryptoQuant data also showed that Tether added 8,888 BTC to its reserves in Q1 2025, pushing its holdings to over 100,000 BTC. Other notable companies that bought Bitcoin include the Blockchain Company, which added 605 BTC to its balance sheet, and Semler Scientific, which bought 1,108 BTC. $660 billion Susquehanna bought nearly $300 million more Bitcoin in Q1 and now owns $1.3 billion worth of BTC.

The Bitcoin mining firm already held 48,237 BTC as of April 30th. Additionally, GameStop also plans to raise $1.3 billion via a 0.00% convertible note maturing in 2030. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen considered Bitcoin a tool for hedging against currency depreciation, adding that its growth potential could be even greater than expected. Meanwhile, the company is holding $1.5 billion in newly raised funds under the codename Project Rocket to invest in Bitcoin, adding to its $4.75 billion cash reserves. Brazilian public company Meliuz filed to raise $26.45 million to buy Bitcoin, while Sharplink Gaming is set to raise $1 billion to buy BTC. French company The Blockchain Group is also gearing up to raise €12.1 million to buy more Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Econometrics also observed that public companies were starting to outpace ETFs in Bitcoin accumulation. According to his analysis, these companies added more BTC to their balance sheets than the spot ETFs over the past three quarters (including Q1 2025). Metaplanet announced plans to acquire 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.

Solana’s native token, SOL , has dropped for four straight days—falling nearly 18% from its May highs—as meme coin valuations across its ecosystem collapse. Once riding high with a combined market cap north of $15 billion, Solana’s meme assets like Dogwifhat ( WIF ), SPX6900 (SPX), and Popcat ( POPCAT ) have shed billions in value in just days. The broader sell-off mirrors a risk-off shift in the crypto market, amplified by geopolitical tensions and technical breakdowns, casting doubt on how much steam is left in Solana’s meme-fueled momentum. Solana’s correction deepens Solana fell to a low of $153.90, down 17.6% from its highest level in May. If the sell-off continues, it may move into a technical correction. Solana meme coins have been some of the worst-affected as their market capitalization fell from over $15 billion mid-month to $10 billion. Dogwifhat price tumbled by 20% in the last 24 hours, while SPX6900 (SPX) fell by 18%, as we predicted . Other top Solana meme coins like Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Pudgy Penguins, and Popcat have tumbled by over 20% in the same period. Solana meme coins chart | Source: CoinGecko The ongoing Solana meme coin sell-off has also affected its ecosystem. For example, the volume handled by protocols in its DEX ecosystem has tumbled in the past few days. The volume stood at $2.4 billion in the last 24 hours, lower than Ethereum and BSC $2.98 billion and $12.1 billion. Solana and meme coins in its ecosystem have tumbled because of profit-taking, as most of them were up by over 100% from their lowest levels in April. SOL price technical analysis The daily chart below shows that Solana has dropped sharply in the past few days, moving from $185 on May 23 to $154. It has moved below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Solana price chart | Source: crypto.news The coin has also crashed below support at $159.45 and the neckline of the double-top pattern at $184.25. A double-top is one of the riskiest chart patterns in technical analysis. Solana has dropped below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have all pointed downwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling. The initial target is the 23.6% retracement point at $140, down 8.50% from the current level. If the coin rises above the double-top point at $185, more upside, potentially to $200, will be invalidated.

Bitcoin dropped to $103,000, while the market cap of all coins fell by double digits. Let’s explore some of the top movers in the cryptocurrency market today. Why the crypto market is falling today Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies continued its strong downward tend as concerns about trade rose. Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all imported steel and aluminium. He said this at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where he made the case for his approval of the Nippon and US Steel purchase. Details of that transaction are still thin, though the US is expected to maintain a golden share in the company. The statement came on the same day that he accused China of not living to its deal in Switzerland. Also, Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, warned that talks between the two countries had moved into a stalemate. These risks have led to a sense of fear among market participants, which explains why the stock market has also pulled back. The crypto market crashed as investors positioned themselves for June, a month that s historically bearish for Bitcoin and other altcoins. Read more: Crypto market crash: is this the end of the bull run? Cronos price jumped as ETF hopes rose The Cronos token hit a high of $0.1070 on Saturday, its highest level since April 2, and 57% above its lowest point this year. CRO price jumped after Canary filed for a spot CRO ETF with staking feature. This fund will give investors access to the staking fee that users get. The daily chart shows that the CRO price bottomed at $0.067 in March and then bounced back to a high of $0.1070 today. It has moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since February. Therefore, the coin will likely keep rising as bulls target the 50% retracement level at $0.1500, which is about 40% above the current level. Livepeer price crashes Livepeer price chart | Source: TradingView LPT token surged to $14.23, its highest level since January 18, and up by 342% from its lowest level in April. It jumped sharply after it was listed by Upbit, the biggest crypto exchange in South Korea. Tokens often surge after being listed by Upbit and other major exchanges. These gains, however, are usually short-lived, which explains why the Livepeer price has dropped sharply on Saturday. Technicals suggest that the token has more downside to go, with the next price to watch being at $6.65. A move above the resistance at $14.23 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

It has moved slightly below the 50-day moving average and formed a small double-top pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have all pointed downwards, a sign that the downtrend is gaining momentum.

These crypto coins are catching the eye of investors and market analysts alike. The critical question arises: Are ENA, PENDLE, and CRO primed to hit new highs between June and July? This article delves into the potential growth and market trends surrounding these promising cryptocurrencies. Ethena Price Snapshot: Key Levels and Market Behavior Ethena experienced a steady decline recently with the price dropping around 6.42% over the past month and a significant fall of about 63.77% during the last six months. The coin has shown a persistent downward trend, with notable selling pressure over this period. Its performance indicates that momentum has been weak and the overall trend bearish, with the drop becoming more pronounced. Volatility reflects the challenges faced by the coin in regaining sustained buyer interest. The current price of Ethena ranges between $0.25 and $0.39, with key resistance near $0.45 and backup resistance around $0.59. Support holds near $0.18, with further backing down at $0.05. The market shows signs of bearish dominance, with the momentum indicator declining and the Relative Strength Index at 39.28. Buyers might look for rebounds around 18 cents, while sellers could consider short positions near $0.45. Caution is advised due to the absence of a clear bullish trend. Pendle Market Analysis: Short-Term Recovery, Long-Term Decline, and Key Levels Over the past month, Pendle experienced a 13.34% uptick, suggesting a brief recovery driven by renewed interest. In contrast, the last six months revealed a significant decline of 33.29%, highlighting its vulnerability under sustained sell pressure. Price movement during these periods indicates a mixed sentiment among traders, as immediate gains are sharply contrasted with longer-term volatility. The market remains uncertain about its direction and struggles to achieve consistent momentum. Pendle currently trades between approximately $2.62 and $4.01, with resistance near $4.59 and primary support around $1.80. An additional barrier exists at $5.98, while lower support is near $0.40. Bulls are attempting to push prices upward, though indicators suggest selling pressure is present. The Awesome Oscillator shows a modest positive value, while the negative momentum and RSI indicate caution. Traders should watch the range closely for potential bounces from support levels for long opportunities. Conversely, a break below support may warrant short positions. Current market sentiment lacks a clear trend, suggesting cautious experimentation within the price boundaries. Cronos: Recent Rally Amid Long-Term Volatility and Key Technical Levels Cronos showed significant short-term gains with a 21.23% rise over the last month and a 12.66% increase in the past week, indicating a shift in trader sentiment. However, the longer-term trend reveals a stark 44.17% decline over the previous six months, characterized by a volatile market. These contrasting performances highlight the coin's fluctuating nature, marked by temporary rallies amid underlying weakness. Currently, Cronos is trading between $0.0713 and $0.1069, presenting an area of interest for traders. The nearest support level is at $0.05, while the first resistance level is around $0.13. Despite a recent bullish momentum, indicated by values from momentum indicators, caution remains necessary due to the significant drop seen over six months. Bulls are in control for now, yet bears are poised to respond if support fails. Close attention to price movements around key levels will be vital, and strategies like scalping might be beneficial in this fluctuating environment. Conclusion The uptrend seen in ENA , PENDLE , and CRO suggests strong performance potential for June and July. Each of these coins has shown promising signs, indicating a likelihood of reaching new price highs. Continuous monitoring of market conditions will be key to assessing their progress. As momentum builds, these coins may provide valuable opportunities for those participating in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, while the statement addressed crypto staking, it noted that it was not a binding guidance. SEC Issues Statement On Crypto Staking The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued new guidance on staking, with its Division of Corporation Finance stating that “Protocol Staking Activities” like cryptocurrencies staked in a Proof-of-Stake blockchain don’t need to register with the commission transactions under the Securities Act. The agency stated, “Accordingly, it is the Division's view that participants in Protocol Staking Activities do not need to register with the Commission transactions under the Securities Act.” The new guidance marks a significant step forward for the US crypto industry, with Alison Mangiero, Head of Staking Policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, stating, “The SEC has now recognized what we’ve long argued: Staking is a core part of how modern blockchains operate, not an investment contract. That clarity is critical.” The division stated that its view applies to staking “covered crypto assets” on Proof-of-Stake networks, activities of third-party service providers such as custodians and node operators, and ancillary services. “Ancillary services encompass self-staking, self-custodial staking with a third party, and custodial arrangements where custodians stake on behalf of asset owners. Clarity For Staking And Staking Service Providers According to the SEC’s division, its latest views on staking came as a result of evaluation using the Howey Test. SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce stated, “Today's statement provides welcome clarity for stakers and 'staking-as-a-service' providers in the United States.” According to Rebecca Rettig, the Chief Legal Officer at Jito Labs, the SEC’s decision clears the path for crypto-exchange-traded funds to include staking in their products. The SEC has been making efforts to offer more clarity on crypto regulation since the departure of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The SEC clarified back in March that Proof-of-Work mining activities are not considered securities activities. The crypto industry has been advocating for clearer guidelines on staking. In April, the Proof-of-Stake Alliance project led a coalition of almost 30 organizations to submit a letter to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, clarifying that non-custodial or custodial staking service providers are distinct from investment contracts. Mangiero added, “The SEC has opened the door to more sensible regulation. This is a win for stakers and the broader crypto community.” A Notable Shift The SEC’s latest guidance is a notable shift from its previous enforcement-heavy approach. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and chief operations officer at RedStone, stated, “This represents genuine progress toward regulatory clarity, but it’s evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The foundation is being laid for more comprehensive crypto regulation, with staking ETF approval becoming increasingly plausible by late 2025.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

REX Shares, a well-known provider of exchange-traded products, has taken a significant step towards bringing innovative crypto investment options to the United States market. They’ve officially filed an effective prospectus for proposed Solana staking ETF and Ethereum staking ETF products. What Does This Filing Mean for the US Crypto Market? This development, highlighted by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on social media, signals REX Shares’ intent to launch exchange-traded funds that not only hold Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) but also participate in the networks’ staking mechanisms. While an exact launch date hasn’t been announced, Seyffart anticipates these funds could become available to investors within the next few weeks. A key aspect of these proposed staking ETFs is their structure. They are being filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 40-Act), which is the standard regulatory framework for mutual funds and many traditional ETFs in the U.S. This structure is significant because it bypasses the need for a separate 19b-4 exchange rule filing process, which was a major hurdle for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Essentially, operating under the 40-Act allows REX Shares to potentially bring these products to market more quickly once the prospectus is deemed effective by the SEC. Exploring the REX Shares ETF Proposals The filings specifically detail plans for separate ETFs focused on Solana and Ethereum. Here’s a breakdown of what these funds aim to offer: Solana Staking ETF: This fund would hold Solana (SOL) and participate in the Solana network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism by staking the held SOL. The goal is to potentially generate yield from staking rewards in addition to any price appreciation of the underlying asset. Ethereum Staking ETF: Similarly, this fund would hold Ethereum (ETH) and engage in staking on the Ethereum network. Like the Solana fund, it seeks to provide investors with exposure to ETH’s price movements plus potential staking yield. These proposals represent a progression in the types of crypto investment products being considered in the U.S., moving beyond just simple asset exposure to incorporating yield-generating strategies available natively within the blockchain protocols. Why Are Staking ETFs a Big Deal? The introduction of staking ETFs in the U.S. could have several notable impacts: Increased Accessibility: These ETFs would provide traditional investors with an easy way to gain exposure to Solana and Ethereum and participate in staking without the technical complexities of setting up wallets, choosing validators, or managing the staking process themselves. Potential for Yield: Unlike standard spot crypto ETFs (if they were approved), staking ETFs offer the potential for generating additional returns through staking rewards, which can be a significant component of the overall investment performance, especially in certain market conditions. Regulatory Clarity (via 40-Act): The use of the 40-Act structure suggests a path that aligns more closely with existing regulatory frameworks for investment funds, potentially easing the approval process compared to products requiring new exchange rule changes. Diversification Options: For investors looking to diversify their portfolios with crypto exposure, these funds offer a structured, regulated product that includes a yield component. This move by REX Shares highlights the growing institutional interest in offering diverse avenues for accessing the crypto market within established financial structures. Potential Benefits of Investing in a Staking ETF Investing in a REX Shares ETF that incorporates staking could offer several advantages over direct staking or holding non-staking crypto assets: Ease of Investment: Tradeable on traditional stock exchanges. No need to manage private keys or blockchain wallets. Simplified tax reporting compared to managing individual staking rewards. Potential for Enhanced Returns: Income generated from staking rewards on the underlying SOL or ETH. Potential for compounding returns if rewards are reinvested. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Avoids the potential unbonding periods associated with direct staking. Professional Management: The fund is managed by professionals who handle the staking process, security, and administrative tasks. These benefits aim to make participating in the growth and yield of proof-of-stake networks like Solana and Ethereum accessible to a broader audience. Are There Challenges or Risks? While promising, these US crypto ETF proposals also come with considerations and risks inherent to both ETFs and crypto staking: Market Volatility: The value of the ETF shares will primarily track the price of the underlying SOL or ETH, which can be extremely volatile. Staking Risks: While the fund manager handles staking, risks like slashing (penalties for validator errors) or protocol-level issues still exist and could impact the fund’s performance. Yield Variability: Staking yields can fluctuate based on network participation and other factors, meaning the income generated is not guaranteed or fixed. Regulatory Environment: Although the 40-Act structure might smooth the path, the broader regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S. remains complex and subject to change. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which will reduce the overall return compared to direct staking (though direct staking has its own costs and complexities). Investors considering these funds should carefully weigh these risks against the potential benefits. What’s Next for These Staking ETFs? Following the effective prospectus filing, the next step is typically for REX Shares to decide on a launch date. As James Seyffart suggested, this could happen relatively soon, possibly within weeks. The market will be watching closely to see how these funds are received and whether they pave the way for more diverse crypto-linked ETPs in the U.S. The successful launch and performance of a Solana staking ETF and an Ethereum staking ETF could provide valuable insights into investor demand for yield-generating crypto products within a regulated ETF wrapper. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investing in the US? REX Shares’ filing for Solana and Ethereum staking ETFs marks a significant moment in the evolution of crypto investment products available to U.S. investors. By leveraging the familiar 40-Act structure, these proposed funds aim to offer a more accessible and potentially yield-enhancing way to gain exposure to two major proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. While challenges and risks remain, the potential launch of these staking ETFs could open up new avenues for both traditional and crypto-native investors, further bridging the gap between conventional finance and the burgeoning digital asset ecosystem. This development is a testament to the ongoing innovation and increasing maturity of the crypto market.

Buyers are showing signs of fatigue after multiple failed attempts to push the price towards $115,000, leading to a substantial increase in bearish sentiment around the flagship cryptocurrency. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $103,527. Meta Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Proposal Meta shareholders have overwhelmingly voted against a proposal to assess adding Bitcoin to the company’s treasury. The results, shared by PhoenixNews, showed that 8.9 million shares were abstentions, and nearly 205 million shares were broker non-votes. The proposal, submitted by investor Ethan Peck, asked Meta to evaluate if converting a portion of its cash and bond holdings into Bitcoin would be better to preserve shareholder value. Meta had $72 billion in cash, cash reserves, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024. The proposal claims these are being eroded by inflation and low returns and presents Bitcoin as a more reliable long-term store of value. The proposal also highlighted growing institutional interest in Bitcoin adoption, presenting Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy as an example. It also mentioned BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation and speculation about potential US federal and state-level Bitcoin reserves. However, Meta’s board of directors dismissed the proposal, calling it unnecessary. The board added that Meta has a robust treasury management process that prioritizes capital preservation and liquidity to support operations. The board of directors released a statement, stating, “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury.” Bitcoin Supply Shock Could Amplify Prices: Sygnum Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at digital asset banking group Sygnum, believes a Bitcoin supply shock could have significant price implications compared to previous cycles. “Large demand will have a strong multiplier effect, meaning every $1 of demand leads to, say, $20-30 additional market capitalization. We have already seen this multiplier effect after the launch of the Bitcoin spot ETFs or around the US elections.” Tischhauser highlighted the limited supply of the flagship cryptocurrency relative to institutional capital on the demand side as a reason for a possible spike in the Bitcoin price over the next few months. “This liquid supply has been falling steadily over the past 1.5 years, not least because of the proliferation of Bitcoin acquisition vehicles such as Strategy, Twenty-One Capital, and others.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) could dip to $100,000 over the next few days if bearish sentiment persists. However, on-chain data suggests prolonged trading below this level could be limited. The flagship cryptocurrency encountered substantial selling pressure this week as it struggled to build momentum after surging to a new all-time high on May 22. A CryptoQuant analysis showed the Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) chart, which tracks profits and losses from Bitcoin transactions, indicated moderate profit-taking at current levels. Another metric supporting a quick rebound if BTC slips below $100,000 is the short-term realized price, which sits at $96,000. If the price falls below $100,000, the $96,000 could act as a floor, attracting buyers and limiting downside. According to crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa, current market conditions are ideal for a price recovery in the coming days. “still not rushing into any positions personally. Lost some $ yesterday by overstaying my welcome and roundtripping w. that Trump tweet, is what it is. Overall, I still think it's a scalping environment. I do think $BTC bounces relatively soon, though.” Let’s look at BTC’s price action over the past two weeks. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping to an intraday low of $102,135 before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,589. However, market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, and BTC fell nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week with a marginal increase but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% to $107,835. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged below the 20-day SMA and settled at $105,662 after a drop of over 2%. BTC continued to drop on Friday, registering a fall of 1.51% and settling at $104,067. The current session sees BTC marginally down, with analysts predicting a drop to $100,000 if current sentiment persists. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Brazilian fintech company Méliuz is making a bold move into the world of cryptocurrency. They’ve announced plans for a significant primary share offering, aiming to raise substantial capital specifically to bolster their Bitcoin holdings. This development highlights the growing trend of corporate adoption of digital assets, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil . Why is Méliuz Planning a Share Offering for Bitcoin? According to reports, Méliuz intends to raise up to 450 million reais, which translates to approximately $78.6 million based on current exchange rates. The primary stated purpose for this capital raise is to purchase additional Bitcoin for the company’s corporate BTC Treasury . This isn’t Méliuz’s first foray into the crypto space; they already hold 320.25 BTC, valued at around $33.55 million at the time of the announcement. Companies decide to add Bitcoin to their treasury for various reasons. Here are a few common motivations: Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, especially in economies experiencing currency devaluation. Store of Value: The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ appeals to companies looking for a long-term store of value outside traditional financial assets. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s balance sheet. Attracting Investors: Holding Bitcoin can signal innovation and attract investors interested in the crypto market. Future Potential: Belief in the long-term growth and adoption of decentralized technologies and cryptocurrencies. For Méliuz, a fintech operating in Brazil, the decision could be influenced by a combination of these factors, potentially including the economic landscape in Brazil and the increasing interest in crypto within the region. Understanding the Share Offering Mechanism A primary Share Offering , also known as a public offering or equity offering, is when a company sells new shares of its stock to the public for the first time (IPO) or sells additional new shares after it’s already public (secondary offering). In this case, it appears to be a secondary offering since Méliuz is already a publicly traded company. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Méliuz announces its intention to sell new shares. The company works with investment banks to price and market the shares. Investors (institutional and retail) purchase the new shares. The capital raised from the sale goes directly to Méliuz. Méliuz plans to use a significant portion of these funds to acquire more Bitcoin . This method allows Méliuz to raise a substantial amount of cash relatively quickly, leveraging investor interest in their company to fund their strategic decision to expand their BTC Treasury . What Does This Mean for Méliuz and Bitcoin? For Méliuz , this move could be seen as a strategic play to align the company with the burgeoning digital asset economy. By significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings, they are making a clear statement about their confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future value. This could potentially attract a new segment of investors who are bullish on both fintech and crypto. For Bitcoin , corporate treasury adoption from publicly traded companies, especially those outside the traditional tech or finance hubs, is a positive signal. It demonstrates increasing mainstream acceptance and utility beyond speculative trading. While $78.6 million might seem modest compared to Bitcoin’s overall market cap, it represents a significant commitment from a company like Méliuz and contributes to the overall demand for BTC. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the move is strategic, it’s not without potential challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A significant drop in BTC’s price could negatively impact Méliuz’s balance sheet and stock performance. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, particularly in countries like Brazil . Changes could affect the holding or use of Bitcoin. Execution Risk: Successfully completing a large Share Offering depends on market conditions and investor demand. Investor Perception: While some investors will be excited, others might be wary of the risks associated with holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin on the corporate balance sheet. Méliuz will need to navigate these factors carefully as they proceed with the offering and subsequent Bitcoin purchases. The Growing Trend of Corporate BTC Treasury Holdings Méliuz joins a growing list of companies worldwide that have allocated a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have been vocal advocates and large-scale accumulators of BTC. Other companies, including Tesla (though they have also sold some holdings), Square (now Block, Inc.), and various smaller firms, have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend suggests a shift in how some corporations view treasury management and asset allocation in the digital age. Méliuz’s decision highlights that this trend is not confined to Silicon Valley or North America but is gaining traction globally, with companies in regions like Brazil recognizing the potential of Bitcoin . In Conclusion: A Bold Step for Méliuz and Brazil Méliuz’s plan to raise $78.6 million through a Share Offering primarily to boost its BTC Treasury is a significant development. It underscores the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin and the willingness of companies, particularly in dynamic markets like Brazil , to integrate digital assets into their financial strategies. While risks exist, the move signals Méliuz’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin ‘s long-term value and its potential role in corporate finance. It will be interesting to watch how this strategy unfolds and if other Brazilian or Latin American companies follow suit.

The protocol asserted that the successful asset transfer marks a vital step in their recovery phase. In an X post on Saturday, it shared: With the funds secured, Cetus has officially entered the next phase of the recovery process. Our team is fully mobilized and working around the clock to execute the roadmap we shared earlier — from contract upgrades and liquidity restoration to preparations for relaunch. – Cetus protocol Cetus plans to host a Public Twitter Space in June Cetus moved the funds to a jointly controlled wallet overseen by itself, the Sui Foundation, and OtterSec. Reportedly, the protocol’s recovery plan received much support from the community, and thus, they could transfer the funds successfully and quickly. According to the Sui Foundation, over 90% of validators supported the proposal, prompting an early conclusion to the vote after just four days. Currently, transaction details are available to the public and can be independently verified on SuiVision. Additionally, the liquidity protocol has planned for a Public Twitter Space with the Sui community on June 2, saying it wants to ensure its clients are involved and properly informed. The meeting will touch on the protocol’s hacking incident and recovery trajectory and include a question and answer session. In its X post, the protocol also assured users that they are working on a safe and complete recovery to ensure they fully restore protocol operations. Nonetheless, the protocol hopes to attain full recovery and restart operations within a week. It is still working on a compensation contract, which is set to be reviewed before release. Once the protocol restarts, all affected liquidity providers will earn back their recovered liquidity, while outstanding losses can be claimed through the compensation contract. Cetus froze over $160 million of recovered assets Last week, a hacker stole over $220 million in crypto from Cetus. Shortly after the attack, the protocol offered the hacker a $6 million bounty, hoping to get back about $56 million of stolen ETH. The protocol detailed that it contacted the hacker with an offer to return 20,920 ETH and the frozen Sui wallet funds, allowing them to keep 2,324 ETH, roughly worth $6 million. If the hacker accepted the deal, the protocol claimed they would not pursue legal action. However, any attempt to move or obfuscate the stolen assets would start legal proceedings. Lookonchain later identified the hacker’s wallet address as “0xe28b50”, with nearly 13 million SUI holdings worth about $54 million. It further revealed that the attacker used to launder stolen funds by converting them to USDC and moving them to the Ethereum blockchain, where he swapped them for ETH. In their post-mortem report on the attack, the Dedaub security firm also revealed that the hacker exploited a weakness in the MSB check mechanism, allowing him to establish oversized positions and manipulate liquidity parameters easily. Moreover, the firm stated that Cetus and the Sui Foundation managed to freeze most of the stolen funds, about $162 million. However, their move to freeze the recovered assets sparked a massive debate among crypto community members. Decentralization advocates felt like the blockchain’s validators were overstepping their role in trying to control the chain. One user even claimed Sui was “censoring transactions” across the blockchain. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Each project brings distinct technologies and recent developments that may influence investor interest and market dynamics over the coming months. Toncoin Gains Momentum Following Telegram-xAI Partnership Toncoin (TON), the native token of The Open Network blockchain, has witnessed a notable price increase, rising over 22% within 24 hours to reach 3.668 USDT. The price movement follows the announcement of a strategic one-year collaboration between Telegram and xAI, involving a $300 million deal in both cash and equity. Originally developed by Telegram under the name Telegram Open Network, TON has continued development under the independent TON Foundation. The network is designed as a layer-1 blockchain solution, focusing on scalability and decentralization. The open-source protocol has attracted a growing community and institutional support, with recent partnerships contributing to its upward trajectory in trading volumes and investor interest. The new partnership is expected to increase user activity and demand for TON’s native token, enhancing its utility across Telegram-integrated decentralized applications. With increased exposure and infrastructure integration, TON remains a cryptocurrency to observe closely in June. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin XRP Ledger Shows Stability Despite Market Uncertainty XRP, the native asset of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has maintained a relatively stable trading range between $2.65 and $2.27. As of Wednesday, XRP is valued at $2.28, showing minimal deviation amid broader market fluctuations. Analysts are watching the $2.07 support level as a key area for potential liquidity and market re-engagement. The XRP Ledger continues to stand out for its transaction speed, low cost, and scalability, with features such as an integrated decentralized exchange and custom tokenization. These technical capabilities contribute to its persistent utility across cross-border payment use cases and enterprise solutions. Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators such as the Federal Reserve’s May meeting minutes and the upcoming PCE inflation data, which could affect investor sentiment in the short term. Despite limited movement, XRP remains a consistent presence in the digital asset sector due to its established infrastructure and real-world adoption. Ozak AI Advances with AI-Blockchain Integration and Presale Growth Predictive artificial intelligence and decentralized infrastructure combine to create a utility coin, $OZ, positioned as a cryptocurrency for serving its utility purpose only. Having made some waves early on with backers, the project has surpassed the $1 million figure in its presale and is live in presale stage 3 at $0.003. The next stage will see a price surge nearly 400% to $0.005 from its initial price of $0.001. Even so, the $OZ token aims to reach $1 per token in 2025 with a strong community and its planned listing price of $0.05. The $OZ token is the key asset for platform functionality: for payments, governance, and premium services. Similarly, Ozak AI uses Ozak Stream Network for real-time data processing, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) for data storage, and customizable Prediction Agents for an analytics application. These use cases are finance, logistics, and enterprise data management. The crypto community and the enterprise have both taken notice of Ozak AI at its focus on decentralized data handling and AI driven insights. Its outcome in the presale, expanding ecosystem and relevance in the rapidly changing space of convergence between the AI and blockchain worlds suggest that it could be relevant in the future. Conclusion While it’s entering June 2025, the digital asset market seems to possess some features that could tilt their future. Toncoin, XRP and Ozak AI are the lucky few. Market participants should watch these projects closely, as recent news and the underlying technology has resonated to help interest across various parts of the blockchain sector.

45334136,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164788,1748706015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45334136.jpeg,"Trump Memecoin Faces Stark Reality: SEC Offers No Protection, Warns Hester Peirce",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-memecoin-sec-protection/,"BitcoinWorld Trump Memecoin Faces Stark Reality: SEC Offers No Protection, Warns Hester Peirce In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, speculative assets like memecoins often grab headlines. Recently, the spotlight turned to the Trump memecoin , a token launched by U.S. President Donald Trump. However, a significant statement from a key regulatory figure has cast a shadow over the idea of these tokens having a safety net. According to reports, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce , often dubbed the ‘Crypto Mom’ for her generally more favorable stance towards crypto innovation compared to some peers, has indicated that the SEC will not be stepping in to protect investors in such highly speculative assets, including the token associated with Donald Trump. This declaration, reported by unfolded on X, underscores a critical reality for anyone venturing into the memecoin space. What Did Hester Peirce Say About Memecoins and the SEC? Commissioner Hester Peirce ‘s comments highlight a fundamental point about the regulatory approach to certain digital assets. While the SEC is tasked with protecting investors, its focus is primarily on securities. Memecoins, by their nature, are often created purely for speculation or community fun, lacking underlying fundamentals or clear use cases that would typically define a traditional security or commodity. Peirce’s statement suggests that the agency views these tokens through a lens that implies investors are largely on their own if things go south. Her position isn’t entirely new; she has consistently advocated for clearer regulatory frameworks that acknowledge the unique nature of cryptocurrencies while also warning investors about the inherent risks. However, specifically mentioning a token linked to a prominent political figure like the Trump memecoin brings this general stance into sharp, public focus. It sends a clear message: don’t assume regulatory oversight provides a safety net for every digital token, especially those driven purely by hype. Understanding the Risks: Why the SEC May Not ‘Protect’ Your Memecoin Investment Investing in memecoins carries significant risks, and Commissioner Peirce’s statement underscores why the SEC ‘s traditional investor protection mechanisms might not apply. Here are some key reasons: Highly Speculative Nature: Memecoins often derive value solely from social media trends, community hype, or association with a personality or meme, rather than underlying technology or business models. This makes them extremely volatile and susceptible to sudden crashes. Lack of Fundamentals: Unlike projects building decentralized applications or offering utility, many memecoins have no intrinsic value or long-term development plan. Their existence is often fleeting. Potential for Manipulation: Low liquidity and concentration of tokens among a few holders can make memecoins easy targets for pump-and-dump schemes. Unclear Regulatory Status: Many memecoins exist in a gray area. If they are deemed securities, they could face regulatory action, but if they are not, they might fall outside the scope of typical securities law protections. The Trump memecoin , like others, fits this uncertain profile. No Central Authority: Unlike traditional financial products issued by regulated entities, memecoins are decentralized (or pseudo-decentralized), meaning there’s no company or issuer the SEC can easily hold accountable in case of fraud or failure. This lack of clear regulatory status and inherent risk is precisely why figures like Hester Peirce caution investors against assuming the SEC will intervene if they lose money on such volatile assets. The responsibility for due diligence falls squarely on the investor. The Broader Context: Crypto Regulation in the U.S. Commissioner Peirce’s comments on the Trump memecoin are part of a larger conversation about crypto regulation in the United States. The SEC, under Chairman Gary Gensler, has taken an enforcement-first approach, often classifying many tokens as unregistered securities and pursuing legal action against platforms and issuers. However, the regulatory landscape remains complex and, in the view of many in the crypto industry (including Commissioner Peirce), lacks clarity. Different agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), also have potential jurisdiction over certain digital assets. This fractured approach makes it difficult for both projects and investors to navigate the space confidently. The discussion around crypto regulation is ongoing, with calls for clearer rules from lawmakers and industry participants. While progress is being made on some fronts, assets like memecoins, due to their unique characteristics, often remain on the fringes of this regulatory debate, further emphasizing the high level of memecoin risk . Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Memecoin Enthusiasts Given the warnings from regulators like Hester Peirce and the inherent memecoin risk , what should investors consider before diving in? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand exactly what you’re investing in. Look beyond the hype. What is the token’s purpose? Who is behind it? (Often, with memecoins, this information is minimal or anonymous). Understand the Risks: Be acutely aware that you could lose your entire investment. Treat memecoins as lottery tickets, not stable investments. Invest Only What You Can Afford to Lose: This is perhaps the most crucial rule for any speculative asset, especially memecoins. Don’t Expect a Bailout: As Commissioner Peirce indicates regarding the Trump memecoin and similar tokens, the SEC’s primary focus is on securities fraud and market manipulation, not guaranteeing returns on highly speculative assets. Don’t rely on regulators to recover your losses. Be Wary of Hype and Social Media Trends: Memecoins are driven by sentiment. Be critical of information found on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or Reddit. The lack of explicit regulatory protection for assets like the Trump memecoin should serve as a strong reminder of the need for extreme caution. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Memecoin Investors Commissioner Hester Peirce ‘s statement about the Trump memecoin and the lack of SEC protection serves as a stark reminder of the realities of the memecoin market. These assets, while potentially offering explosive short-term gains driven by viral trends or political associations, come with immense memecoin risk . The current landscape of crypto regulation in the U.S. means that investors in such tokens should not expect the SEC to act as an insurer against losses. The responsibility for understanding the risks and making informed decisions rests solely with the individual investor. As the crypto market matures, clarity in crypto regulation is hoped for, but for now, especially in the memecoin space, caveat emptor – buyer beware – remains the guiding principle.

Market analysts speculate that breaking key resistance levels could propel ARB to $3 and OP to $4.5. This article explores the conditions and factors that could drive these tokens to outperform in the coming weeks. Upbeat Altcoin Outlook Amid Mixed Arbitrum Performance ARB price movement over the past month showed modest strength with a slight increase of 0.87%, but the half-year perspective tells a different story with a significant drop of 66.09%. The weekly decline of 15.90% reflects persistent downward pressure. Market activity has fluctuated widely, marked by periods of sell-offs and minor recoveries, alongside cautious investor sentiment and retesting of previous price areas. Current pricing action finds Arbitrum trading between $0.26 and $0.38, with resistance at $0.43 and a hurdle around $0.55. Immediate support stands at $0.19 and a lower level at $0.07. Technical indicators lean bearish, shown by negative momentum at -0.082 and a slightly oversold RSI of 38.44. Bears dominate as prices test lower levels, yet there is potential for bulls to gain ground if prices bounce off immediate support. Trading ideas include watching for a bounce near $0.19 and a cautious approach to breaks above $0.43, focusing on volume spikes and momentum shifts as clues for potential trend changes. Optimism Faces Steep Dips and Key Resistance Challenges OP price behavior over the recent month shows a decline of around 15.36%, while the half-year drop of almost 74.95% highlights a significant downward move. Weekly figures also point to a decrease of 16.73%, indicating troubled momentum. A steady contraction in price has seen ranges from approximately 0.57 to 0.87, reflecting weakening sentiment among market participants. The past performance is marked by persistent declines over short and intermediate timeframes, pointing to a phase of caution rather than growth. Current market conditions feature clearly visible technical markers that guide trading ideas. A resistance level exists at $1.02, while a firm support holds near $0.41. An alternative resistance appears at $1.32, with a secondary support around $0.10. Oscillator indicators display slightly bearish tendencies, and the RSI stands near 37.86, hinting that the coin may be oversold. Bulls face challenges as bears exert pressure with little sign of a sustained upward move. Traders might consider testing support zones for potential bounce opportunities while being alert to the possibility of further declines. Conclusion Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) show strong potential for growth this month. Breaking key resistance levels could drive ARB to $3 and OP to $4.5. Positive market trends and increasing interest may contribute to these gains. The performance of these coins will be closely monitored by investors looking for promising opportunities.

This was a highly publicized event where crypto moguls had to spend millions of dollars for a seat at the table. Among those in attendance was Justin Sun , the billionaire founder of Tron, who had poured $18.5 million into Trump’s coin to secure his spot as the #1 holder. He was treated with a gold, Trump-branded watch and thanked the President for his “unwavering support” of crypto. Sun faced U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges for alleged market manipulation on his blockchain platform, Tron (TRX). SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated in a report : “Sun and his companies not only targeted U.S. investors in their unregistered offers and sales, generating millions in illegal proceeds at the expense of investors, but they also coordinated wash trading on an unregistered trading platform to create the misleading appearance of active trading in TRX.” Despite facing serious charges, Sun’s substantial financial backing of Trump’s crypto ventures appears to have shifted the focus of U.S. authorities toward negotiating a settlement. The situation raises concerns about the appearance of preferential treatment and suggests a troubling alignment between financial influence and political access, potentially amounting to a pay-to-play dynamic at the highest levels of government. Blockchain technology was originally meant to democratize finance with open, transparent networks. In practice, however, this memecoin saga shows it can be used as a tool for backroom influence. Protesters outside the gala event held signs reading “America is not for sale” and “stop crypto corruption,” a telling indication of the public’s skepticism and a sign that more needs to be done to protect the industry from those willing to corrupt it for personal gain and profit. The event caught the attention of builders across the crypto space who are focused on restoring trust, reputation, and reliability in blockchain. For projects working to make crypto less vulnerable to personalities, influence, and unchecked money flows, one of which is Graphite Network , the dinner was a clear signal of what’s broken. “When seats at the table are sold for millions and legal accountability fades with a donation, it sends the worst possible signal about where crypto is heading,” said Marko Ratkovic, CTO of Graphite Network. “Moments like this force the rest of us building in this space to double down on trust, reputation, and systems that can’t be swayed by wealth or personality.” In a World of Hype and Anonymity, There’s Still Room for Trust, Reputation, and Equal Access Graphite Network offers a response to the growing concerns around manipulation and influence in the Web3 space. Rather than relying on hype, anonymity, or deep pockets, it’s building a foundation rooted in verifiable trust – where identity validation and on-chain reputation guide how users participate and interact. Operating on a Proof-of-Authority consensus, Graphite Network weaves reputation directly into the protocol. Participants who build credibility through transparent behavior can unlock more access and functionality, creating an environment where trust is earned, not bought. But trust-building doesn’t stop with users. Graphite Network is also one of the few blockchains that rewards all node operators, both transport and validator nodes, directly from the protocol itself. There are no exclusive club deals or private backdoors; anyone who contributes to the network’s operation can earn from it. In a time when blockchain headlines are dominated by big personalities and behind-the-scenes influence, Graphite’s model offers a more equitable, and more durable path forward. Key Features of Graphite’s Trust Architecture Below are the essential components of Graphite’s trust-based architecture, each of which play a crucial role in creating a more reliable and ethical blockchain environment: Proof-of-Identity Activation New accounts must pay a small fee to activate their account paid in @G, Graphite Network’s native coin, and complete verification. This is meant to comply with Graphite Networks’s one-person-one-account rule and also discourages spam and creating multiple disposable accounts, which are typically used for shady transactions, as each wallet is tied to a single user. Tiered KYC with Privacy Graphite Network offers a multi-tier, off-chain KYC process that begins with basic social media verification and will expand to include more advanced methods like document and video checks. Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), users can prove they meet specific criteria, such as being over 18 or residing in a certain country, without revealing any personal data, since all verification happens off-chain. This privacy-by-design model allows users to voluntarily verify their identity while keeping sensitive information completely secure. Trust Score Reputation System Every Graphite account earns a Trust Score – a numeric rating of credibility, akin to a credit score for blockchain. The score is calculated from an array of factors: verification level, transaction history, account longevity, network activity, and the trust scores of one’s associates. The on-chain reputation is visible to all and gives a glance at how trustworthy any given participant is. A higher Trust Score isn’t just for bragging rights, it actually brings a better user experience. Reputation-Based Contracts and Tagged Addresses Graphite Network lets users filter interactions based on trust criteria. For example, users can choose to accept funds from accounts that meet a certain KYC level or Trust Score and can block unknown senders or anyone with poor scores. Smart contracts can be coded to require a minimum reputation to participate. For example, users can create lending contracts that only allow loans to those with a proven track record. The platform even plans to introduce tagged addresses for earmarked funds: if money is designated for charity or specific purposes, it gets a visible tag on-chain, and any misuse of those funds can be instantly flagged for all to see. New Layer 2 Tools Aim to Reinforce Accountability in a Decentralized Ecosystem According to its 2025 roadmap , Graphite Network is developing a range of Layer 2 solutions built around transparency, fairness, and verifiable trust. The first to roll out will be the Phonebook Reputation MVP, designed to link phone numbers to trust scores via smart contracts, giving users a simple, decentralized way to verify reputation before interacting. Other upcoming releases include a reputation-based dating app, a Hotspot Bundle for underserved regions to run nodes, a geo game simulating real-world economic behavior, and a voting system that ties influence to integrity, not token balance. All of it reflects the same principle: blockchain should empower trustworthy users – not amplify the reach of the wealthiest ones. A Reminder Of What Trust Looks Like As the crypto industry grapples with the fallout from influencer coins and credibility issues, Graphite Network’s approach serves as a reminder of what blockchain technology was originally designed to be: an engine for trust, not insider enrichment or political palm-greasing. But only if designed that way. In the battle for crypto’s future, projects like this one are attempting to show that trust and transparency can win over hype. The ultimate success of its reputation-based model will depend on its ability to maintain privacy while fostering a transparent and accountable system, which may take time to implement at scale but offers a real shot at rebuilding confidence in a space where it’s been badly shaken.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 15:43:03

45334933,https://invezz.com/?p=2743276,1748706480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Last time a token did 3x in 60 days, it did 100x within 6 months, MUTM could be next",https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/31/last-time-a-token-did-3x-in-60-days-it-did-100x-within-6-months-mutm-could-be-next/,"Anyone who watched the rise of Polygon (MATIC) or Solana (SOL) knows how fast things move in crypto once momentum starts. Both projects saw their tokens triple in price within weeks — only to explode by 100x shortly after. These were early signals that many ignored. But smart investors recognized the pattern: rapid community adoption, surging utility, and product milestones that triggered massive parabolic growth. Now, that same pattern is flashing again — this time with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The token has already climbed more than 165% from its Phase 1 price of $0.01 to $0.03 in Phase 5. Over $9.70 million has been raised, and more than 11,650 holders are already in. This is not a hypothetical setup — it’s unfolding right now. The numbers don’t lie: 3x gains with real traction When a token moves 3x in under 60 days, most call it a fluke. But when that move is backed by a functioning DeFi product, upcoming milestones, and a rapidly growing user base, it’s not just a price pump — it’s proof of product-market fit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the few new tokens under $0.03 that combines rising price action with a real use case. The protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity platform where users can lend and borrow crypto assets. Lenders earn yield by depositing tokens like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), or Dai (DAI) into shared liquidity pools and get rewarded based on pool utilization. Borrowers lock their own tokens as collateral and access stablecoins or other assets, all while keeping full ownership of their original holdings. With an upcoming beta launch set to go live along with the token’s exchange debut or launch, every step is lining up just like the early days of Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL) — only this time, the token is still cheap. Passive income is creating organic demand What’s different about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is that it isn’t relying on speculation to drive demand. Instead, passive income is built into the model. When users deposit their crypto into Mutuum’s pools, they receive mtTokens — interest-bearing assets that track their position. These mtTokens can then be staked to earn additional MUTM dividends from the protocol’s revenue-sharing model. This utility has already attracted tens of millions in liquidity, because people aren’t just buying a token — they’re buying an income-generating asset. For example, a user who deposits $5,000 worth of ETH or DAI into the platform can earn an annual return of up to 10%, depending on pool usage. That’s $500 per year in passive income, without having to trade or sell a thing. Those who stake their mtTokens earn extra MUTM from buybacks funded by protocol revenue, adding yet another layer of profit. The power of P2P and P2C models combined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the few protocols offering both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, users earn yield from shared liquidity pools — a structure familiar to DeFi veterans. But the P2P side unlocks something even more exciting: custom loans on assets not typically supported by other protocols. For example, users can lend or borrow memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) — assets that most lending platforms ignore. This gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an edge in catering to high-volume retail users and memecoin traders who are often excluded from traditional DeFi lending. Investors are already doing the math. At the current price of $0.03, a $1,000 investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives you 33,333 tokens. When the price reaches $0.45 — a 15x move — that position is worth $15,000. At $0.90, a 30x move, it becomes $30,000. With rising demand, passive income utility, and a product that is already in motion, these outcomes are becoming less speculative and more expected. And remember, the current price is just $0.03 — still well below where most DeFi tokens started before their explosive runs. Token utility that keeps giving The MUTM token isn’t just a reward asset — it’s the backbone of the entire ecosystem. Anyone can access platform benefits, including those who stake their mtTokens earn ongoing dividends from protocol revenue as Mutuum buys back MUTM and distributes it to loyal users. As activity on the platform increases, so does buying pressure for MUTM. It’s a self-sustaining flywheel: more users, more revenue, more buybacks, and more rewards to holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already cleared a full audit from CertiK. The audit involved both static analysis and manual code review, with a Token Scan Score of 70.00. That’s not a marketing claim — it’s an independently verified green light. It’s one more reason early adopters are trusting the protocol with real capital. Still early, still undervalued The gap between Phase 1 and Phase 5 has already delivered more than 165% gains — from $0.01 to $0.03. Those who got in early have already won. But the bigger move is still coming. That same token is about to power a working lending platform, serve as a passive income generator, and attract thousands more users when the beta goes live. Too many traders wait until a token hits $0.10 before believing in it. But the real money is made at $0.03. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the same trajectory that Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL) followed.

This was a highly publicized event where crypto moguls had to spend millions of dollars for a seat at the table. Among those in attendance was Justin Sun , the billionaire founder of Tron, who had poured $18.5 million into Trump’s coin to secure his spot as the #1 holder. He was treated with a gold, Trump-branded watch and thanked the President for his “unwavering support” of crypto. Sun faced U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges for alleged market manipulation on his blockchain platform, Tron (TRX). SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated in a report : “Sun and his companies not only targeted U.S. investors in their unregistered offers and sales, generating millions in illegal proceeds at the expense of investors, but they also coordinated wash trading on an unregistered trading platform to create the misleading appearance of active trading in TRX.” Despite facing serious charges, Sun’s substantial financial backing of Trump’s crypto ventures appears to have shifted the focus of U.S. authorities toward negotiating a settlement. The situation raises concerns about the appearance of preferential treatment and suggests a troubling alignment between financial influence and political access, potentially amounting to a pay-to-play dynamic at the highest levels of government. Blockchain technology was originally meant to democratize finance with open, transparent networks. In practice, however, this memecoin saga shows it can be used as a tool for backroom influence. Protesters outside the gala event held signs reading “America is not for sale” and “stop crypto corruption,” a telling indication of the public’s skepticism and a sign that more needs to be done to protect the industry from those willing to corrupt it for personal gain and profit. The event caught the attention of builders across the crypto space who are focused on restoring trust, reputation, and reliability in blockchain. For projects working to make crypto less vulnerable to personalities, influence, and unchecked money flows, one of which is Graphite Network , the dinner was a clear signal of what’s broken. “ When seats at the table are sold for millions and legal accountability fades with a donation, it sends the worst possible signal about where crypto is heading ,” said Marko Ratkovic, CTO of Graphite Network. “ Moments like this force the rest of us building in this space to double down on trust, reputation, and systems that can’t be swayed by wealth or personality. ” In a World of Hype and Anonymity, There’s Still Room for Trust, Reputation, and Equal Access Graphite Network offers a response to the growing concerns around manipulation and influence in the Web3 space. Rather than relying on hype, anonymity, or deep pockets, it’s building a foundation rooted in verifiable trust – where identity validation and on-chain reputation guide how users participate and interact. Operating on a Proof-of-Authority consensus, Graphite Network weaves reputation directly into the protocol. Participants who build credibility through transparent behavior can unlock more access and functionality, creating an environment where trust is earned, not bought. But trust-building doesn’t stop with users. Graphite Network is also one of the few blockchains that rewards all node operators, both transport and validator nodes, directly from the protocol itself. There are no exclusive club deals or private backdoors; anyone who contributes to the network’s operation can earn from it. In a time when blockchain headlines are dominated by big personalities and behind-the-scenes influence, Graphite’s model offers a more equitable, and more durable path forward. Key Features of Graphite’s Trust Architecture Below are the essential components of Graphite’s trust-based architecture, each of which play a crucial role in creating a more reliable and ethical blockchain environment: Proof-of-Identity Activation New accounts must pay a small fee to activate their account paid in @G, Graphite Network’s native coin, and complete verification. This is meant to comply with Graphite Networks’s one-person-one-account rule and also discourages spam and creating multiple disposable accounts, which are typically used for shady transactions, as each wallet is tied to a single user. Tiered KYC with Privacy Graphite Network offers a multi-tier, off-chain KYC process that begins with basic social media verification and will expand to include more advanced methods like document and video checks. Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), users can prove they meet specific criteria, such as being over 18 or residing in a certain country, without revealing any personal data, since all verification happens off-chain. This privacy-by-design model allows users to voluntarily verify their identity while keeping sensitive information completely secure. Trust Score Reputation System Every Graphite account earns a Trust Score – a numeric rating of credibility, akin to a credit score for blockchain. The score is calculated from an array of factors: verification level, transaction history, account longevity, network activity, and the trust scores of one’s associates. The on-chain reputation is visible to all and gives a glance at how trustworthy any given participant is. A higher Trust Score isn’t just for bragging rights, it actually brings a better user experience. Reputation-Based Contracts and Tagged Addresses Graphite Network lets users filter interactions based on trust criteria. For example, users can choose to accept funds from accounts that meet a certain KYC level or Trust Score and can block unknown senders or anyone with poor scores. Smart contracts can be coded to require a minimum reputation to participate. For example, users can create lending contracts that only allow loans to those with a proven track record. The platform even plans to introduce tagged addresses for earmarked funds: if money is designated for charity or specific purposes, it gets a visible tag on-chain, and any misuse of those funds can be instantly flagged for all to see. New Layer 2 Tools Aim to Reinforce Accountability in a Decentralized Ecosystem According to its 2025 roadmap , Graphite Network is developing a range of Layer 2 solutions built around transparency, fairness, and verifiable trust. The first to roll out will be the Phonebook Reputation MVP, designed to link phone numbers to trust scores via smart contracts, giving users a simple, decentralized way to verify reputation before interacting. Other upcoming releases include a reputation-based dating app, a Hotspot Bundle for underserved regions to run nodes, a geo game simulating real-world economic behavior, and a voting system that ties influence to integrity, not token balance. All of it reflects the same principle: blockchain should empower trustworthy users – not amplify the reach of the wealthiest ones. A Reminder Of What Trust Looks Like As the crypto industry grapples with the fallout from influencer coins and credibility issues, Graphite Network’s approach serves as a reminder of what blockchain technology was originally designed to be: an engine for trust, not insider enrichment or political palm-greasing. But only if designed that way. In the battle for crypto’s future, projects like this one are attempting to show that trust and transparency can win over hype. The ultimate success of its reputation-based model will depend on its ability to maintain privacy while fostering a transparent and accountable system, which may take time to implement at scale but offers a real shot at rebuilding confidence in a space where it’s been badly shaken.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-31 15:50:05

Comparing Ruvi AI (RUVI) and Ethereum’s (ETH) Potential for Explosive Gains",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/comparing-ruvi-ai-and-ethereums-potential-for-explosive-gains/,"The post Can $1,500 Turn into $100K? Comparing Ruvi AI (RUVI) and Ethereum’s (ETH) Potential for Explosive Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News For investors navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, the promise of transforming modest investments into life-changing sums is deeply enticing. Ethereum (ETH), widely recognized as a titan of the crypto industry, offers steady growth and solid utility. However, Ruvi AI, an ambitious newcomer merging blockchain with artificial intelligence, is making waves with its potential for explosive gains. Here we compare both platforms and explore whether a $1,500 investment could realistically transform into over $100,000. Ethereum – An Established Contender Ethereum has firmly established itself as the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. Known for its robust smart contract capabilities, the network supports a thriving ecosystem of dApps, DeFi projects, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This foundational status means Ethereum has significant staying power and a solid track record of growth. Yet, its maturity as a cryptocurrency limits the scope for exponential gains. With ETH’s current market valuation already high, turning $1,500 into $100,000 would require an improbable surge in price. For example, this scenario would necessitate Ethereum’s value growing more than 60-fold. Though ETH remains a stronghold for stability, it’s harder to label it the best choice for astronomical ROI. Ruvi AI – Positioned for Exponential Growth Enter Ruvi AI , a burgeoning new player in crypto with game-changing ambitions. Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Ruvi AI is solving real-world problems in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Beyond this compelling utility, it has garnered attention for its presale success , selling over 130 million tokens and raising approximately $1.5 million . What sets Ruvi AI apart is its low entry price of just $0.015 per token in its presale phase. Experts project the token value could climb to $1 by Q4 2025 , delivering returns exceeding 12,800% . For a $1,500 investment, this could mean walking away with $128,000, a feat Ethereum may find challenging to replicate given its evolved stage. Ruvi AI’s structure also caters to early adopters, providing opportunities to maximize returns with minimal initial commitment, an attractive proposition for ambitious investors. Real-World Applications Driving Ruvi AI’s Growth Ruvi AI’s potential isn’t built on speculation alone. Its utility across critical sectors fuels optimism for widespread adoption: Healthcare : Leveraging AI to improve diagnostics, reduce errors, and enhance patient care solutions. Logistics : Streamlining supply chain efficiency with real-time data insights, lowering costs and improving workflows. Finance : Introducing fraud-prevention tools and transparent payment systems that strengthen trust and efficiency in financial transactions. Such real-world applications enable Ruvi AI to carve out a unique niche and establish long-term utility in essential industries. Maximizing Returns With Ruvi AI’s VIP Opportunities Investors can further amplify their returns through Ruvi AI’s VIP program , which offers bonus tokens for early commitment. Here’s how it works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens awarded: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at presale price of $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Tokens awarded: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at presale price of $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Tokens awarded: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at presale price of $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $1,280,000 . The VIP tiers enable early supporters to lock in substantial advantages, providing unmatched growth opportunities compared to more established assets like Ethereum. Strategic Partnerships for Accessibility One of Ruvi AI’s hallmark moves has been its partnership with WEEX Exchange , a strategic alignment designed to enhance liquidity and accessibility for token holders. This collaboration ensures global visibility for Ruvi AI, a critical factor for growing adoption and reinforcing investor trust. Such partnerships underline the project’s long-term strategy aimed at sustainable growth. The Verdict – Ruvi AI vs. Ethereum While Ethereum continues to command respect in the crypto space, its growth is moderated by a market position that’s largely established. Turning $1,500 into $100,000 with ETH is a long shot, given its significant market cap and evolving competition. On the other hand, Ruvi AI offers a compelling case for exponential growth . With its low entry price, sector-specific applications, and strategic momentum, the project opens doors for investors seeking life-changing gains. If your goal is to achieve high ROI with limited risk, Ruvi AI provides the innovation, accessibility, and scalability needed to meet those ambitions. This is not just an investment into cryptocurrency; it’s a stake in the future of AI-driven solutions. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this exciting narrative before its prices soar.

While stories of massive gains often capture headlines, significant losses are also a reality, especially for those playing at the highest levels. Recently, a prominent trader on the Hyperliquid platform, known as a Hyperliquid whale , experienced a staggering setback. What Led to This Massive Crypto Trading Loss? Data circulating in the crypto community highlights a dramatic crypto trading loss incurred by a trader identified as James Wynn. According to figures tracked by HyperDash, a platform monitoring Hyperliquid activity, Wynn reportedly lost a colossal $73.34 million over a mere seven-day period. This eye-watering figure serves as a stark reminder of the immense risks involved in the fast-paced decentralized finance (DeFi) trading environment, particularly when employing high leverage. Diving into James Wynn’s Leveraged Crypto Trading Strategy The significant loss is primarily attributed to James Wynn’s aggressive leveraged crypto trading strategy. At the time the data was reported, he held substantial long positions on two volatile assets: Bitcoin (BTC) and PEPE. Here’s a breakdown of the reported positions: Bitcoin (BTC) Position: A 40x leveraged long position with an average entry price of $105,554. The liquidation price for this position was set at $103,242. PEPE Position: A 40x leveraged long position with an average entry price of $0.0129. The liquidation price for this position was $0.0114. A 40x leverage means that for every dollar of his own capital, Wynn was effectively controlling $40 worth of the underlying asset. While this amplifies potential profits if the market moves favorably, it equally magnifies losses if the market turns. The small difference between the entry price and the liquidation price on both positions underscores just how precarious highly leveraged trades can be. Who is This Hyperliquid Whale? In cryptocurrency markets, a “whale” is an individual or entity that holds a significantly large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices. Being identified as a Hyperliquid whale suggests James Wynn commands substantial capital and actively engages in large-scale trades on the platform. His recent James Wynn loss puts a spotlight on the sheer scale of capital that moves within these high-frequency trading venues. Whales often have a notable impact due to their ability to place massive orders that can move the order book. However, as this case illustrates, even whales are not immune to the market’s unforgiving nature, especially when utilizing high leverage. The Risks Amplified by Bitcoin Price Drop (and other market movements) While the data doesn’t specify the exact market movements that triggered the loss, it’s clear that adverse price action in Bitcoin and PEPE, potentially including a significant Bitcoin price drop or downward movement towards liquidation levels, played a critical role. With 40x leverage, a relatively small percentage drop in the asset’s price translates into a massive percentage loss on the trader’s principal capital. For instance, on a 40x leveraged long position, a drop of just 2.5% in the asset’s price can wipe out 100% of the initial margin used for that position (100% / 40 = 2.5%). The reported liquidation prices being so close to the entry prices confirm this extreme sensitivity to market fluctuations. Understanding the Dangers of High Leverage Leverage is a powerful tool in trading, allowing participants to increase their exposure to an asset with less capital upfront. However, it is a double-edged sword. The potential benefits of amplified gains are directly mirrored by the risks of amplified losses. Here are key dangers: Amplified Losses: The most significant risk. Small adverse price movements can lead to substantial losses that quickly exceed initial margin. Increased Liquidation Risk: High leverage brings your liquidation price closer to your entry price, making your position vulnerable to even minor market retracements. Margin Calls: Platforms may require additional funds (margin calls) to maintain a position if the market moves against you. Failure to meet a margin call results in liquidation. Emotional Stress: The high stakes and rapid potential for loss can lead to poor decision-making driven by fear or panic. Actionable Insights: Navigating Leveraged Trading Responsibly While the case of this Hyperliquid whale highlights the extreme end of potential losses, it offers valuable lessons for any trader considering or using leverage. Responsible leveraged crypto trading requires discipline and a strong understanding of risk management. Consider these actionable insights: Understand Leverage Fully: Never use leverage you don’t understand. Know exactly how much exposure you are taking on and how it affects your liquidation price. Start Small: If you are new to leverage, begin with very low multiples (e.g., 2x-5x) to understand its mechanics and risks without risking significant capital. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Implement stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain unfavorable level, limiting potential losses. Avoid Excessive Leverage: High leverage (like 40x) should generally be avoided unless you are an extremely experienced trader with a robust risk management strategy and capital you can afford to lose entirely. Monitor Liquidation Price: Always know your liquidation price and understand what market movement would trigger it. Manage Position Size: Even with leverage, ensure the amount of capital allocated to a single leveraged trade is a small percentage of your total trading portfolio. The Aftermath: What Remains of James Wynn’s Positions? Following the reported $73.34 million loss, James Wynn’s current holdings on Hyperliquid were valued at around $760,000. This figure likely represents the remaining value in his trading account after the significant losses were realized from the highly leveraged positions. It underscores the dramatic impact the loss had on his capital, wiping out the vast majority of the funds tied up in those specific trades. Summary The reported $73.34 million James Wynn loss on Hyperliquid serves as a dramatic illustration of the inherent risks in high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. Even for a seasoned trader like a Hyperliquid whale , aggressive positions, such as 40x leverage on Bitcoin and PEPE, can lead to catastrophic outcomes when the market moves unfavorably. This event underscores the critical importance of understanding and managing the amplified risks associated with leveraged crypto trading , particularly in volatile conditions that can lead to a rapid Bitcoin price drop or similar sharp moves in other assets. While leverage offers the potential for amplified gains, this case is a powerful reminder that it can just as quickly lead to devastating losses if not handled with extreme caution and robust risk management practices.

In the update, CasiTrades detailed a highly focused scalp trade setup for XRP, explaining why today’s Fibonacci levels present a short-term opportunity for nimble traders seeking quick, defined-profit moves. With XRP showing a promising bullish reaction after completing its 0.5 Fibonacci extension correction, the stage is set for an intraday play that’s gaining attention across trading circles. The Setup: Key Levels and Strategy According to CasiTrades, XRP has now officially reached the 0.5 extension level of its recent corrective move, which sits at $2.135. This point represents a key technical milestone, with price action indicating early signs of a bullish rebound. The critical focus now shifts to the 0.118 Fibonacci retracement at $2.196, an area CasiTrades identifies as the ideal entry point for a scalp trade. $XRP – Friday Trade Setup to Watch Closely! Happy Friday, everyone! Today's post is focused on a clean scalp trade setup now that #XRP has officially reached the .5 extension in this correction, and started a decent bullish reaction. We’re nearing the .118 Fibonacci… pic.twitter.com/Zx0zWHzcsr — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) May 30, 2025 The proposed setup revolves around entering at $2.20, targeting the 0.236 Fibonacci resistance level at $2.253 as the take-profit zone, while maintaining a tight stop-loss at $2.13, just below the recent swing low. This strategy prioritizes low-risk trades with a high probability of success, aiming for conservative profits without relying on a complete market turnaround. It’s a structure optimized for traders who want to capitalize on short-term relief moves without exposing themselves to the broader volatility that can often shake out less disciplined positions. Scalp Trading Dynamics and Market Conditions Scalp trading, by its nature, is about capturing small, precise price movements within a well-defined technical range. While many associate this style with leveraged accounts, CasiTrades points out that the strategy is equally valid for spot entries, especially when the setup aligns cleanly with Fibonacci levels and established market structure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In the current market context, XRP’s ability to hold above the $2.135 zone is essential. Should this level continue acting as support, it increases the probability that the relief move to $2.253 will unfold as projected. However, if the price breaks below $2.13, the setup becomes invalid, and attention would shift toward identifying lower macro support levels for the next potential trade opportunity. This disciplined approach reflects the importance of trading within clear parameters, especially in a fast-moving, sentiment-driven asset like XRP. Broader XRP Landscape Heading Into the Weekend Beyond the specifics of today’s scalp setup, XRP’s recent price action reflects a broader phase of technical recalibration. After a recent surge, the asset is undergoing a normal correction, with traders and analysts closely monitoring key Fibonacci levels to assess support strength and potential for renewed growth. The weekend often brings lighter trading volumes, which can amplify both volatility and opportunity. For scalp traders, this environment can be rewarding if approached with caution and precision. CasiTrades’ outlined parameters offer exactly that: a roadmap for engaging with XRP’s short-term moves without falling prey to the common pitfalls of emotional or undisciplined trading.

According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, Musk and his top aides have been personally reaching out to members of Congress in recent weeks to advocate for legislation that would allow the broader deployment of self-driving cars on American roads. Sources familiar with the matter say that Musk and top aides have been personally reaching out to members of Congress in recent weeks to advocate for legislation that would allow the large-scale deployment of self-driving cars on American roads. These conversations come as lawmakers review a bill designed to prescribe standards for autonomous vehicles, introduced earlier this month by Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, and considering new proposals before the July 4 congressional recess. Musk returns to Tesla to push for a national framework At the heart of Musk’s push is Tesla’s plan to launch a rideshare service in Austin on June 12, using a fleet of Model Y SUVs. Tesla eventually plans to replace those vehicles with its purpose-built Cybercab, which is projected to reach volume production for the ride-share service. However, federal law currently only allows automakers to deploy 2,500 vehicles per year without traditional driver controls under a limited exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). That’s a ceiling Musk wants to raise or eliminate entirely. “It’d be wonderful for the United States to have a national set of rules for autonomous driving instead of 50 state-specific standards,” Musk told U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy during a May visit to Tesla’s headquarters. The Lummis bill aims to restart momentum on a policy debate that has stalled for years. A previous bill backed by Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH) passed the House in 2017 but never made it to a Senate vote. Now, with Tesla, Waymo, Zoox, and others pushing harder than ever, there’s growing pressure to update federal rules. Rep. Latta is also working on an updated version of his earlier legislation, with sources suggesting it may be reintroduced in the House within weeks. After years of juggling multiple ventures and, most recently, heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in President Trump’s second administration, Musk has signaled a more concentrated focus on Tesla, particularly its AI and robotics initiatives. Autonomy is central to that vision, and Musk has described Tesla’s ride-sharing ambitions as a future growth engine — one that could dwarf traditional car sales. White House open to federal rules but not making promises The Trump administration has shown openness to developing federal standards for AVs but has stopped short of committing to any specific framework. “The administration’s policy is driven by one thing and one thing only: achieving the president’s agenda and his commitment to the American people,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields in a statement. A White House official familiar with the discussions added that Tesla “has to make business decisions in its own best interest” and added that the President will continue to pursue and create infrastructure that strengthens America’s energy dominance. For now, Tesla’s ridesharing launch in Texas will benefit from the state’s relatively relaxed AV regulations, which treat self-driving vehicles much like conventional cars, provided they carry insurance, obey traffic laws, and use sensors or cameras. However, in other states, varying rules or complete legal ambiguity could prevent expansion. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Leading the pack are established favorites like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP), both known for their strong communities and promising developments that could fuel next-level growth. Alongside these heavyweights, emerging gems like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer a fresh avenue for investors seeking the best cryptocurrencies to invest in with multi-thousand percent return prospects. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has then priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). Together, these three cheap cryptos represent some of the most opportunities for those looking to maximize gains in the crypto market. XRP and Shiba Inu: A Comparative Analysis of Two Prominent Cryptocurrencies XRP is trading at $2.30 with a positive market sentiment. Ripple’s ETF uncertainty has brought about some volatility; however, the recent surge in whale activity and shrinking exchange reserves suggest a growing foundation. Compared to other analysts, some predict a likely jump to $2.50 over the short term. SHIB, meanwhile, is trading at $0.0000143. The token is currently consolidating at significant support and resistance levels, indicating a condition of indecision. Despite this, SHIB has been strong, with current technical trends pointing towards a possible breakout. The active participation of the community as well as ongoing developments in the Shiba Inu ecosystem continue to favor its long-term prospects. Although XRP and SHIB occupy different niches of the cryptocurrency sphere, both offer their own investment opportunities. There are new ventures like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) becoming in vogue for their potential to yield massive returns. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stablecoin Secures Future with Completed Certik Audit A new USD-pegged stablecoin backed by Ethereum and running on it is soon being launched by Mutuum Finance. The advantage of MUTM stablecoin’s extra collateral is that it stops the kind of collapse that algorithmic tokens are still subject to. Using recently audited and confirmed smart contracts from Certik, Mutuum Finance can be trusted by all users and investors. Thanks to its special buy-and-distribute approach and an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM joins innovation, safety and trust among its members. Early investment gives daring traders a chance to join the project in its very initial days. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ripple (XRP), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are top cheap cryptos to watch in 2025. SHIB and XRP show strong community and market support, while MUTM offers huge potential with a 200% presale gain, a current price of $0.03, and a launch price of $0.06—doubling early investors’ money. With $9.4 million raised, a unique token model, and a Certik-audited stablecoin, MUTM is set for major growth. Act now and join the presale to maximize your returns.

Since the start of the correction phase on May 12, XRP has posted consecutive lower highs on the daily timeframe, slipping further from its May peak of $2.65. This ongoing decline comes after a rally that started last month, which saw the XRP price rebound from $1.80 in early April. However, the momentum that drove that surge has now been overtaken by a clear wave of red candles, and technical analysis suggests that the XRP price can crash below $2 again in the coming days to the April low. MasterAnanda Flags Risk Of Further XRP Downside A recent technical update shared by analyst MasterAnanda on TradingView reinforces the short-term bearish sentiment. The chart shared alongside the analysis shows XRP has broken down from a rising channel, with three consecutive daily closes below the lower trendline. Related Reading: Analysts Are Predicting XRP Price To Climb Above $20 In Unexpected Rally These three consecutive red days have rejected the setup of an upwards bounce on the lower trendline. Although XRP is still trading above $2 right now, the longer it continues to trade below the $2.30 region, the more likely a steeper drop becomes. In his analysis on TradingView, the analyst MasterAnanda acknowledged that XRP may appear due for a rebound, but the underlying signals tell a different story. “It looks like XRPUSDT can recover any minute now, but the correction might not be over,” the analyst noted. Interestingly, despite the ongoing decline, bearish volume has been quite low. This shows that the selling may not be particularly strong, but also not challenged. This low-volume pullback suggests the market is drifting down due to a lack of buyers rather than intense selling pressure. Even so, the analyst noted that XRP has yet to reach a solid support level. XRP Bullish Long-Term, But Can Crash Below $2 Although the short-term chart paints a troubling picture, MasterAnanda is confident in XRP’s bullish trajectory in the long term. However, the Fibonacci retracement levels marked on the chart show that the price has already dropped through the 0.382 zone and is hovering near the 0.236 line at $2.035. Beneath that, the low near $1.75 is the critical area to watch, which aligns with the analyst’s projected support zone. Related Reading: Can XRP Market Cap Touch $1.5 Trillion? Analyst Reveals The Math Behind It If XRP fails to hold above $2.00, it could slip toward that higher low. A red arrow drawn on the daily candlestick timeframe chart shows the trajectory of this decline. As such, XRP traders should prepare for the possibility of a strong downside unless a strong reversal happens before the crypto breaks below $2. XRP’s bearish sentiment is gradually intensifying. If this correction continues unchecked, a retest of the $1.70 to $1.80 range may come sooner than expected. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.13, down by 3.85% in the past 24 hours and 8.9% in the past seven days.

If so, you might have noticed a subtle shift in the overall mood. The widely followed Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular gauge of market psychology, recently dropped to the 50 mark, placing it squarely in the ‘Neutral’ zone. This change from the ‘Greed’ territory signals a potential cooling off or a period of uncertainty in the market. But what does this neutral stance really tell us about the state of cryptocurrency news and future Bitcoin price movements? What Does the Shift in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signify? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, developed by Alternative, is designed to provide a snapshot of the general sentiment pervading the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear (Often indicates undervaluation and a potential buying opportunity) 25-49: Fear 50: Neutral (Represents a balance between fear and greed, often a period of uncertainty or consolidation) 51-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed (Often indicates overvaluation and a potential correction) The recent move from a higher ‘Greed’ score (it was 60 the day before) down to 50 signifies that some of the recent bullish momentum or overly optimistic sentiment has subsided. A neutral reading suggests that investors are neither excessively fearful nor excessively greedy. This can be interpreted in several ways: perhaps the market is taking a breather, waiting for a clear catalyst, or facing conflicting signals that prevent a strong lean in either direction. Understanding Crypto Market Sentiment : More Than Just a Number The value of the index lies in its attempt to quantify something as intangible as market sentiment. It’s not just a random number; it’s calculated based on a combination of six weighted factors, aiming to capture the overall feeling of market participants: Volatility (25%): High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a positive market suggest greed; low volumes in a negative market suggest fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzing keywords and hashtags on platforms like Twitter to gauge public mood. Surveys (15%): Polling crypto investors (though this factor is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A rising Bitcoin dominance can signal fear as investors move away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Analyzing search queries related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to see public interest levels. When the index moves, it’s because the aggregate signal from these factors has shifted. The move to ‘Neutral’ suggests a more balanced input from these indicators compared to the previous day when ‘Greed’ signals were stronger. Understanding these underlying factors helps you see that the index is a composite view, not just one data point. How the Index Relates to Bitcoin Price Movements It’s crucial to understand that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. However, historically, extreme readings on the index have sometimes coincided with significant price points. Extreme Fear can occur near market bottoms, when panic selling is rampant, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for contrarian investors. Conversely, Extreme Greed can appear near market tops, fueled by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), which might signal a good time to be cautious or take profits. The current ‘Neutral’ reading is less clear-cut. It doesn’t strongly suggest an imminent pump or dump. Instead, it aligns with a market phase where Bitcoin price might consolidate, trade sideways, or experience moderate fluctuations as sentiment remains balanced. It tells us that the strong emotional biases that often drive sharp price movements (either up or down) are currently less dominant. While Bitcoin dominance is a factor in the index itself, the index as a whole is often correlated with Bitcoin’s major price swings, given its market-leading position. A neutral index often reflects a period where the directional conviction for Bitcoin price is weak among the general market participants. Navigating Cryptocurrency News and the Index Cryptocurrency news plays a significant role in shaping market sentiment and, consequently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Major news events can quickly swing the index from Fear to Greed or vice versa. Positive News: Announcements about institutional adoption, favorable regulations, technological advancements, or major partnerships often fuel optimism and push the index towards Greed. Negative News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange hacks, security vulnerabilities, or macroeconomic concerns can trigger panic and drive the index towards Fear. When the index is neutral, it might suggest that the recent flow of cryptocurrency news has been mixed, or that the market is digesting information without a strong, unified emotional response. It’s a reminder that staying informed about the latest developments is key, as news can be the catalyst that pushes the index out of neutrality. Actionable Insights for Investing in Crypto So, how should this ‘Neutral’ reading influence your approach to investing in crypto? Here are some actionable insights: Benefits of Using the Index: Gauges Market Psychology: It provides a quick visual cue of whether the market is predominantly fearful or greedy. Contrarian Indicator: Extreme readings can be useful prompts for contrarian thinking (buy when others are fearful, be cautious when others are greedy). Supplements Analysis: It’s a valuable tool to use alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) and fundamental analysis (project roadmaps, adoption rates). Challenges of Relying Solely on the Index: Not a Guarantee: A high greed score doesn’t guarantee a crash, nor does a high fear score guarantee a bottom. Backward-Looking: It reflects *current* sentiment based on recent data, not necessarily future price movements. Doesn’t Explain ‘Why’: It tells you *what* the sentiment is, but not *why* it is that way, which requires deeper research into cryptocurrency news and market events. Actionable Steps: Use it as One Tool: Don’t make buy or sell decisions based *only* on the index. Stay Disciplined: A neutral index is a good time to stick to your long-term investment plan, like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), rather than being swayed by extreme emotions. Observe for Shifts: Pay attention if the index starts to move decisively towards either Fear or Greed, as this could signal changing market dynamics worth investigating further. Educate Yourself: Understand the factors behind the index and how different types of cryptocurrency news impact sentiment. Investing in crypto always involves risk. A neutral index reading suggests a period where caution and balanced analysis are particularly important. Summary: Navigating the Neutral Zone The Crypto Fear & Greed Index sitting at 50, in the ‘Neutral’ zone, indicates a market that is currently balanced between optimism and pessimism. This shift from recent ‘Greed’ reflects a potential pause or uncertainty among investors, influenced by various factors like volatility, volume, and cryptocurrency news. While the index is a helpful gauge of market sentiment and can offer contrarian insights at extremes, it is not a crystal ball for Bitcoin price or altcoin movements. For effective investing in crypto, use the index as a supplementary tool alongside thorough research and a disciplined strategy. The neutral zone is a reminder to stay balanced in your approach, just as the market sentiment currently appears to be.

In a New York Times interview, Dalio says his “3% solution” will result in a massive improvement to America’s financial picture. “The 3% solution is very practical. It has worked many times in many places, most recently in the US from 1991 to 1998.” The so-called “3% solution” calls for lowering the annual deficit-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio down to 3%, from around 7%. Dalio says the US can achieve the 3% ratio by implementing three simultaneous measures: cut spending, raise tax revenue and lower interest rates. However, Dalio warns that it may take more calamitous impacts of the debt crisis before politicians act. “All the political decision makers on both sides of the aisle that I spoke with agree that we are likely headed for a terrible outcome if the deficit isn’t cut down to about 3% of GDP. So I feel it’s like being on a boat headed for the rocks in which everyone agrees that we will crash if we don’t change our course, but they’re too hung up arguing which way to turn… The forcing mechanism will likely be a debt crisis and all that goes with it.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But while Tron eyes gain, a low-cap gem named Unilabs (UNIL) is stealing the spotlight. Riding on the AI revolution and DeFi momentum, Unilabs offers something bigger: real utility, sustainable yields, and first-mover advantage. Many believe this altcoin could surpass the Solana price growth this year. Tron (TRX) Price Poised for Major Breakout as Analyst Highlights “Insane” Monthly Chart In a rival X post, crypto analyst Lennaert said the monthly Tron price chart is ‘absolutely insane.’ Lennaert stated that the Tron price has been in a very strong and consistent uptrend since 2020, a move due to solid project fundamentals. Tron price has been resilient through multiple market cycles, climbing steadily while many altcoins recorded extreme volatility. Meanwhile, the Tron price is currently close to a major breakout level on the monthly chart. The breakout could send the price of Tron soaring, Lennaert added. Looking ahead, Lennaert forecasts the Tron price could surge to $0.95 on one condition. The Tron price has to surpass the huge sell wall around the $0.30 range. Currently, the TRX price is now on the radar of traders and investors looking for the next big breakout in the altcoin space. At the moment, info from CoinMarketCap reveals the Tron price has increased by 1.7% on the weekly chart. Solana (SOL) Testing Major Support The Solana price has been bouncing off the $170 support in the past few days after failing to cross the $186 barrier. Current data from CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Solana has plummeted by 2.9% in the weekly timeframe. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered dropped its Solana price prediction for the coming years. The financial giant forecasts the Solana price could rally to $275 before the end of this year and $500 by 2029. This positive Solana price prediction comes as reports revealed that SOL witnessed an inflow of $1.1 billion from centralized exchanges in May. Another crypto supporter who is positive about the Solana price is Don. The trader predicted that the Solana price has the potential to hit $300 this cycle. Don revealed that the Solana price currently trades inside an asymmetrical triangle. A breakout could take place if trading volume increases in the coming days. In the meantime, investors should watch the $190 level for a potential breakout. AI Meets DeFi: Why Unilabs (UNIL) Could Be the Next Big Crypto Powerhouse Data from Zion Market Research shows the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance could surpass $232 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in AI and smart contract automation. Riding this wave is Unilabs (UNIL) , an AI-based DeFi project designed to make crypto investing smarter, safer, and more rewarding. Unilabs operates through a multi-fund structure, offering users tailored access to different asset strategies like the BTC Fund, AI Fund, and Stablecoin Yield Account. These are all managed by an AI engine that analyzes on-chain data, sentiment, and market signals to deliver consistent returns with minimal user input. Unilabs has already pulled in more than $1.6 million in funding. At its crypto ICO price of $0.0051, $UNIL provides early investors with tiered staking rewards, a transparent fee-sharing model, and automated profit distribution. Those holding the token can enjoy passive income through staking. Compared to Solana, which grew over 10,000% thanks to its speed and low fees, Unilabs offers broader earning streams through DeFi fund exposure. If Unilabs captures just 0.2% of Solana’s current market cap, its value could surge 50x or more, showing how early entry now could mean huge gains later. The New DeFi Project Set To Outshine Solana While the Tron price eyes $0.95, Unilabs emerges as a serious contender in the altcoin arena. With AI-powered portfolio automation, multi-fund investment options, and rewards, it offers utility and earning potential rarely seen in early-stage crypto projects. For investors seeking the best crypto investment opportunities, Unilabs could be the under-the-radar gem of the year. Early movers who join the ongoing cryptocurrency ICO have a high chance of getting the biggest rewards.

Following community approval via on-chain voting, approximately $160 million in frozen funds associated with the attack were transferred to a multisig wallet jointly managed by CETUS, the Sui Foundation, and security firm OtterSec. Despite this statement from the developers, the CETUS token price lost over 4% today. “Following the on-chain vote, the previously frozen funds were securely transferred to a multisig wallet that is jointly managed by Cetus, the Sui Foundation, and OtterSec,” Cetus said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter).

Cetus officials reported that with this development, the next stage of the recovery process has been moved on and their teams are working at full capacity to implement the roadmap in question. The plan includes updating smart contracts, restoring liquidity, and reopening the platform. To keep the community informed, Cetus also announced plans to host a Twitter Space event with the Sui community on June 2, 2025. The event will cover details of the attack, progress in the recovery process, and questions from the community. The exact time of the event will be announced in the coming days. What Happened? Cetus Protocol was hit with a major security breach on May 22. Attackers exploited a vulnerability in an open-source library for smart contracts and manipulated prices in liquidity pools, removing approximately $223 million worth of SUI and other tokens from the system. Although Cetus immediately paused its smart contract after the attack was discovered, the attackers had already taken a large amount of funds. *This is not investment advice.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $616.1M in outflows on May 30 amid growing market caution. Bitcoin is consolidating below $110K, with rising volatility signals and key breakout zones in focus. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a sharp reversal on May 30, recording $430.8 million in outflows and ending a 31-day inflow streak — the longest since the fund’s launch in January. According to Farside data , this marks IBIT’s largest daily outflow to date, surpassing the previous record of $418.1 million on February 26. The pullback comes after a strong month in which BlackRock accumulated nearly $6.2 billion in new Bitcoin holdings. IBIT Holds $70 Billion in Bitcoin ETF analyst Nate Geraci commented on the sudden shift, writing on X: “What a run over the past 30+ days, though.” He noted that IBIT now holds roughly $70 billion in Bitcoin, calling the figure “ridiculous” given the fund’s relatively short history. iShares Bitcoin ETF no outflows streak comes to an end… $400+mil exits fund. What a run over past 30+ days though. IBIT now pushing $70bil in assets *$70bil* Not sure I have words to describe how ridiculous this is. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 31, 2025 Across the broader U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market, the story was similar. The group of 11 funds posted $616.1 million in net outflows on May 30, marking a second consecutive day of redemptions. The previous day, May 29, saw $346.8 million in outflows, breaking a 10-day inflow streak. Interestingly, BlackRock bucked the trend on May 29 by recording an inflow while other issuers saw redemptions. “Every other issuer saw red. BlackRock kept buying… big brain energy right there,” Master Ventures founder Kyle Chasse commented. Chasse suggested the recent sell-off wasn’t driven by retail panic but reflected a “quiet transfer of supply to the strongest hands.” Despite the recent ETF activity, Bitcoin’s spot price remains under pressure. BTC is trading at $103,700, down 2.27% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. In the week ending May 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs had posted $2.75 billion in inflows. Bitcoin Consolidates Below $110K Bitcoin is consolidating near key levels after its recent all-time high, with traders closely watching for signals of the next major move, according to Hyblock Capital’s latest market report. In a recent note shared with Cryptonews.com, Hyblock CEO Shubh Varma noted that Open Interest (OI) remains elevated in the 95th percentile, while combined order book liquidity is at 96%, reflecting a market primed for volatility. “The longer this range holds, the greater the odds of a sharp breakout or stop hunt,” Varma said. Retail stop-losses are reportedly concentrated at the edges of the current range, making them potential targets for liquidity-driven wicks. On Binance, resistance is building between $109.5K–$110.5K, while key support lies at $105K–$105.5K. A break below could open the door to $98K. A similar structure is forming on Bybit, with notable resistance at $110.5K–$111K and support zones mirroring Binance. Varma highlighted a shift in sentiment, with retail longs at 48% and leverage flipping to short-heavy positioning. This setup may fuel increased volatility if impatient traders rush into new positions. “The passive order book is highly stacked, and leverage indicators are leaning bearish,” Varma said. However, retail positioning near the 48% long mark has previously coincided with bullish reversals.

As of May 21, 2025, loan volumes have dwindled to just over $50 million – a steep 83% drop since January and a staggering 97% from the January 2024 high. At its peak, activity surged with platforms like Blur’s Blend and NFTfi attracting traders eager to access liquidity without selling their NFTs. Today, however, interest has faded, which signals that the hype around NFT lending has lost its appeal amid current market realities. NFT Lending In Crisis The downturn in NFT lending is closely linked to the broader slump in the NFT market. Many top-tier collections have seen their floor prices plunge over 50% from peak levels, eroding the value of collateral and, in turn, lending activity. While a handful of projects have bucked the trend, they remain rare exceptions unable to revive the sector. Loan durations averaged 31 days in May, maintaining a consistent trend seen throughout 2024 and into 2025. This figure is notably shorter than the 40-day average observed in 2023, which, according to DappRadar’s report , hints at a shift in borrower behavior toward shorter, more strategic use of liquidity, rather than longer-term commitments. The average NFT loan in May 2025 was just $4,000, a steep decline from $14,000 in May 2024 and $22,000 in early 2022, which represents a 71% yearly drop. It suggests borrowers are either using less valuable NFTs or avoiding heavy leverage. The user base has collapsed too: active borrowers and lenders have fallen nearly 90% and 78%, respectively, since their January 2024 peak. Reigniting The Sector For NFT lending to regain momentum, new drivers are essential. DappRadar stated that integrating real-world asset (RWA) NFTs – like real estate or yield-generating tokens – could provide stronger, more reliable collateral. Simplified, intent-based interfaces that match loan terms to user needs may reduce complexity and attract more users. Additionally, evolving beyond traditional peer-to-peer lending toward smarter infrastructure, including undercollateralized options, credit profiling, and AI-based risk tools, could elevate the ecosystem and make NFT lending a more viable and scalable financial service.

As altseason approaches, ETH is expected to be at the forefront, with SHIB on course to lead the meme craze. Meanwhile, experts are bullish on Unilabs (UNIL) , a novel AI-backed asset manager for digital assets. Hailed as the future of decentralized finance, its utility coin, UNIL, is among the best AI coins to buy now. Alongside ETH and SHIB—top DeFi tokens to buy—its upside potential as a low-cap makes it a must-have this year. The Ethereum Price Explodes Ethereum has been one of the best performers this month, exploding from a 30-day low of $1,736 to above $2,000. The Ethereum price soared by over 50% in the past month, cementing its status as one of the top DeFi tokens to buy. On the weekly chart, it recorded a 5% rally, pushing the ETH price above $2,700. While some analysts’ Ethereum price predictions suggest a decline—a retest of the $2,000 and $2,100 support—bulls hint at further upswings. A bold Ethereum price prediction was shared by Ted Pillows, hinting at the Layer-1 coin reaching $6,000 by Q4 2025—one of the top DeFi tokens to buy. Growing institutional demand and interest were cited, alongside a potential ETH ETF staking feature. Equally optimistic is Ash Crypto, predicting an ETH price jump between $7,000 and $10,000 this year. Shiba Inu Price Targets a Retest of $0.000017 The leading ETH memecoin, SHIB, is up over 5% on the monthly chart, changing hands around $0.000014. It reflects current bullish sentiment, with experts’ Shiba Inu price prediction suggesting a retest of $0.000017—its 30-day peak—next. Moreover, the Bull Bear Power and 9-HMA signal a bounce in the Shiba Inu price, adding to its bullish outlook as one of the top DeFi tokens to buy this year. The Shibmagazine is among the leading experts bullish on SHIB. According to their Shiba Inu price prediction, the meme token could climb to $0.000081 this year. At the current Shiba Inu price, it is undoubtedly one of the top DeFi tokens to buy. However, Unilabs’ UNIL token is on experts’ lists of the best AI coins to invest in. It has higher upside than the SHIB coin, courtesy of its small market size and bullish AI narrative. Unilabs (UNIL) – The Future of Decentralized Finance Unilabs (UNIL) is a new DeFi protocol designed to meet the growing demand for alternatives to conventional financial markets. At the intersection between decentralized and traditional finance, it will be the first asset manager for digital assets. Hence, its native utility coin, UNIL, has been listed among the top DeFi tokens to buy. This novel asset management platform has over $30 million in assets under management (AUM) as of Q2 2025. Interestingly, the Unilabs platform stands out for targeting diversified exposure—its AUM reflects disciplined capital allocation across four flagship funds: BTC Fund, Real-World Assets (RWA) Fund, AI Fund and Mining Fund. Given the above, its dedication to maximizing gains by focusing on high-potential crypto sectors cannot be overemphasized. Further, its robust AI technology will discover promising projects at early stages, that is, before broader market recognition. Early identification means greater return potential while minimizing risk exposure. Closing Thoughts The Ethereum price registering a 50% gain in the past month highlights a shift in market structure. Hence, it is unsurprising that bullish Ethereum price predictions have been flying. In addition, analysts’ Shiba Inu price predictions suggest a big leap, positioning it among the top DeFi tokens to buy now. However, Unilabs, a new and low-cap AI coin, remains a favorite among seasoned investors. It costs $0.0051 in stage 2 of the ICO, with the price designed to increase as the presale unfolds—a 20% surge by the next stage. In addition, holders will be redistributed 30% of the platform-generated fees, making it arguably one of the top DeFi tokens to buy now.

Understanding whether the market is favoring Bitcoin or altcoins is crucial. The latest data from a key metric provides a clear signal: we are currently in Bitcoin Season. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index, a widely referenced metric provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a barometer for the state of the crypto market. It helps investors gauge whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin, or if Bitcoin is leading the pack. Here’s a breakdown of how the index works: It tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from the calculation to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The index looks at performance over the past 90 days. An index score is calculated based on the percentage of these top 100 altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day window. The index ranges from 1 to 100, with specific thresholds defining the ‘season’: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days (Index score of 75 or higher). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days (Index score of 25 or lower). Neither Season: The period in between, where performance is mixed (Index score between 26 and 74). As of 00:33 UTC on May 31, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 16. This figure, down six points from the previous day, falls well below the 25 threshold, definitively signaling that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Implications for Your Portfolio When the market is in Bitcoin Season, it typically means that capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is holding its value significantly better than most altcoins. This can happen for several reasons: Risk-Off Sentiment: During periods of uncertainty or volatility in the broader financial markets, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer haven within the crypto space compared to more speculative altcoins. Major Bitcoin Events: Events like the Bitcoin halving, significant institutional adoption news, or regulatory clarity often drive interest and investment specifically into BTC. Early Cycle Accumulation: In the early stages of a bull run, Bitcoin often leads the charge, with altcoins catching up later. Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) tends to increase during these periods. For investors, Bitcoin Season presents both challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Many altcoins may see stagnant or declining prices relative to Bitcoin. Finding profitable trades among altcoins becomes more difficult. Portfolios heavily weighted towards altcoins may underperform a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio. Opportunities: Focusing on Bitcoin accumulation may be a prudent strategy. Identifying altcoins that show relative strength even during Bitcoin Season could highlight potential future leaders. It can be a good time to research and understand promising altcoin projects for when the season eventually shifts. Understanding Altcoin Performance During This Phase With the Altcoin Season Index at 16, it explicitly states that only a small fraction (16% or fewer) of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last three months. This poor Altcoin Performance is characteristic of Bitcoin Season. What factors contribute to this? Lower Liquidity: Capital is concentrated in Bitcoin, leaving less liquidity for smaller altcoin markets, making them more susceptible to price drops. Investor Sentiment: As Bitcoin rises, investors may sell altcoins to increase their Bitcoin holdings or simply lose interest in altcoins that aren’t keeping pace. Project Development Cycles: While altcoin projects continue developing, major breakthroughs or news might not be enough to counteract the prevailing market sentiment favoring Bitcoin. It’s important to remember that not all altcoins will perform identically during Bitcoin Season. Some may still post gains due to project-specific news, technological advancements, or unique market niches. However, the index confirms that this is not the widespread outperformance seen during Altcoin Season. Future Crypto Market Trends: When Could the Season Shift? The crypto market is cyclical, and Bitcoin Season does not last forever. Historically, periods of strong Bitcoin performance are often followed by periods where altcoins catch up and even surpass Bitcoin’s gains, leading to Altcoin Season. Several factors could signal a potential shift in Crypto Market Trends: Bitcoin Price Stabilization: When Bitcoin’s rapid price appreciation slows down or enters a consolidation phase, investors may look to deploy profits into potentially higher-growth altcoins. Increased Risk Appetite: A general improvement in macroeconomic conditions or a surge in confidence within the crypto space can encourage investors to move into riskier assets like altcoins. Major Altcoin Catalysts: Significant upgrades (like Ethereum’s developments), successful project launches, or widespread adoption of specific altcoins can attract substantial capital. Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained trend of Bitcoin’s market cap percentage decreasing relative to the total crypto market cap is a strong indicator of altcoins gaining ground. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index itself is the most direct way to track this potential shift. A gradual increase towards the ‘Neither Season’ range (above 25) and eventually towards the ‘Altcoin Season’ threshold (75) would confirm the change in market dynamics. The Cryptocurrency Index as a Tool for Investors The Altcoin Season Index, along with other Cryptocurrency Index tools and metrics, provides valuable context for investment decisions. While no single index can predict the future, understanding the current market phase offers actionable insights. During Bitcoin Season (like now, with the index at 16): Prioritize research into solid, established altcoin projects with strong fundamentals, rather than chasing speculative, low-cap coins. Consider dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin. Be patient with altcoin holdings, understanding that they may not see significant gains until the season shifts. Conversely, when the index signals a shift towards Altcoin Season: Review your research on promising altcoins. Consider rebalancing your portfolio to potentially capitalize on higher Altcoin Performance. Be mindful of increased volatility in the altcoin market. Using the Altcoin Season Index as part of a broader market analysis strategy can help investors make more informed decisions aligned with prevailing Crypto Market Trends. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Cryptocurrency Index Insights The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at a low 16, a clear indicator that the crypto market is in a period of Bitcoin dominance. This Bitcoin Season means that most altcoins are underperforming relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. While this presents challenges for altcoin holders, it is a normal phase in the cyclical nature of the market. Understanding the implications of this low Altcoin Season Index is key. It suggests focusing on research, potentially accumulating Bitcoin, and being patient with altcoin investments until market conditions change. Keep a close eye on the index and broader Crypto Market Trends for signals of a potential shift back towards widespread Altcoin Performance and the return of Altcoin Season. Armed with insights from this vital Cryptocurrency Index, you can better navigate the market’s current phase.

Ripple remains stagnant despite legal win, as the SEC's silence adds pressure on market sentiment. XRP news sparks investor caution as legal uncertainty weighs on short-term price movement. Unilabs attracts $1.6M in early investment as its affordable, AI-driven crypto tools gain momentum. The SUI price has recaptured the confidence of market followers after a shaky start to last week. Ripple, on the other hand, is looking for a stagnant June, with the recent XRP news triggering bearish outlooks. Meanwhile, Unilabs is attracting crypto fans with its affordability, solid fundamentals, and potential for upside. Read on to find out what makes UNIL stand out in this current cycle. SUI Price Rebounds Amid ETF Hopes The SUI price has rallied over the past day after news emerged that Nasdaq has submitted an ETF proposal. If the SEC approves this proposal, SUI will join Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only assets with spot ETFs. Source: CoinCode At the time of writing, the SUI price is around $3.68 after rallying 4% in the past session. The recent surge in SUI price indicates that the network has regained customers after it was breached last week. Meanwhile, recent XRP news, which borders on legal concerns, has caused investors to be cautious of the asset. Right now, the sentiment is shifting in favor of better-performing assets like SUI and Unilabs. This could cause SUI to rally faster than Ripple, potentially reaching $4.50 by June. But with ICOs known to offer explosive upsides, Unilabs could surpass SUI as a low-cost gem in 2025. Its current fast-growing presale and low price of just $0.0051 give early adopters a chance for explosive gains, considering the rapid growth of the AI-themed crypto sector. XRP News Triggers Investor Caution as Watchers Awaits SEC Response While the SUI price initiated a recovery, crypto enthusiasts are still awaiting the outcome of the recent XRP news. After Judge Torres' latest ruling in favor of Ripple, the SEC has gone quiet on its next move.Unfortunately, this latest development has caused tension among Ripple holders. At the time of writing, XRP is facing resistance at $2.36, with support at $2.28. Source: CoinCodex Meanwhile, staked XRP assets in AMM pools have dropped significantly, a sign that XRP news has sparked cautious moves.Although Ripple offers fast transactions, its price trend hasn't hit $3, which has discouraged investors seeking short-term gains. This is where Unilabs steps in as a stable and cheaper alternative. Its AI-backed products and massive adoption position the project for more gains in this current cycle. Unilabs Emerges as an Affordable, AI-Driven Alternative Unilabs’ edge over established assets like Ripple is its affordability and potential for high returns. With the recent XRP news sparking unease, crypto investors are already swarming the UNIL token. At present, buyers have added over $1.6 million to the project by scooping up nearly 300M UNIL tokens. After all, the hedge fund is pioneering the next wave of AI-backed asset managers. With its AI Market Pulse tool, investors no longer have to manually scan the market for profitable opportunities. It generates an actionable overview by using artificial intelligence to monitor data points and onchain trends. The result? Precise insights for portfolio adjustment.Memecoin traders can also use the platform’s Memecoin Identification Tool to pounce on promising projects. The protocol reduces the risk of memecoin investment by ranking viable tokens based on liquidity, virality, and listing chances. Furthermore, crypto newbies do not require extensive technical knowledge to begin trading on the platform. Its AI-powered portfolio management feature optimizes an investor’s portfolio according to their goal and market conditions. Unilabs not only offers real-world applications, but it is also affordable. Given its market fundamentals, the project shows a trend that could surpass the SUI price action in June. Conclusion The SUI price has overcome the bearish storm to mount a price rally. But the recent wave of unfavorable XRP news has cast doubt over the potential of Ripple in the short term. For investors seeking gains, Unilabs offers a high return ceiling and real-world usage. At $0.005, investors can take part in this rare chance for explosive returns.

Notably, prominent trading expert Ali Martinez highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator is flashing a major buy signal on Bitcoin’s 12-hour chart. This setup suggests a possible move above $105,000, he said in an X post on May 31. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The TD Sequential is a time-based indicator that identifies trend reversals or price exhaustion. When the system counts to “9,” it often signals that the current trend is weakening and that a reversal or correction may be imminent. Notably, Bitcoin has printed a bullish “9” candle, hinting that the recent downtrend could end and a short-term rally might be underway. If the signal plays out, Martinez believes Bitcoin could retest $105,000, a level that recently flipped from support to resistance. Bitcoin record high price target Supporting the bullish outlook, analyst Ted Pillow pointed out that the global M2 money supply, offset by 90 days, reliably forecasts Bitcoin price moves. His model predicted the May dip and now projects a sharp upward move, potentially pushing Bitcoin above $125,000 by late summer. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows Will Bitcoin rally pause? While the long-term outlook remains bullish, on-chain data suggests a possible pause before further gains. According to analytics platform CryptoQuant, several demand indicators are nearing peak levels, resembling past market slowdowns. CryptoQuant indicated that Bitcoin demand has grown by approximately 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days, approaching the December 2024 peak of 279,000 BTC, an area that previously marked a local top. Additionally, Bitcoin balances held by whales have risen 2.8% in the past month. Historically, such accumulation often precedes a cooling period in large-holder activity. Bitcoin demand zone.

The payouts represent the exchange’s second round of distributions after smaller creditors categorized in FTX’s “Convenience Class” started receiving repayments in February. Creditors in this round include “convenience class” members and larger claims. They will all receive funds via BitGo or Kraken within one to three business days from Friday, per a new press release . FTX will make payouts from its $11.4 billion cash reserves, and the exchange says subsequent distributions will be announced “in due course.” In October, a US bankruptcy court greenlit FTX’s plan to distribute between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion worth of payouts to the crypto exchange’s former customers. The plan calls for 98% of the exchange’s creditors to receive approximately 119% of the value of their holdings on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. The increased payouts are thanks to crypto prices and FTX’s 8% stake in the AI (artificial intelligence) safety and research company Anthropic. FTX imploded and filed for bankruptcy amid accusations that its then-chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, mishandled the exchange’s funds by loaning out billions of dollars worth of customer deposits to Alameda Research, the firm’s trading arm. A US judge sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison last year after he was convicted of fraud charges in 2023.

The move now puts dollar savings and staking rewards within reach of over 1 billion users globally. Ethena Enters the TON Ecosystem with USDe and tsUSDe As announced , the arrival of Ethena on the TON blockchain means Telegram users can now access stable dollar savings through USDe and earn extra rewards by staking it for tsUSDe. This integration has been rolled out across key TON wallets such as TON Space Wallet on Telegram, MyTonWallet, TonHub, and TonKeeper. Users can now buy, bridge, or withdraw USDe into these wallets. They can then stake USDe into tsUSDe directly within the app to begin earning rewards every eight hours. The staking process varies slightly between wallets. For example, in TON Space, users are directed to a section within the wallet that allows them to begin staking. In TonHub, users click through the Earnings section, while MyTonWallet offers an “Earn” button. TonKeeper users access the staking option through a separate staking app built by StonFi. With USDe and tsUSDe fully supported, Ethena is now embedded in a communication app that already serves over 1 billion people. This gives Ethena a unique path to mainstream usage without requiring users to leave their everyday apps. It is worth noting that this update coincides with Telegram’s entry into DeFi, as the TON Foundation partners with Libre to launch a $500 million bond fund. 16-Week Campaign Offers Up to 18% APY As part of the launch, Ethena has introduced a 16-week reward campaign. Users who stake at least 10 tsUSDe and hold 10 TON tokens in supported wallets will be eligible for boosted annual percentage yields (APY). The campaign starts with an additional 10% APY for the first four weeks. This bonus will gradually reduce to 5% by the end of the campaign, but it will be on top of the regular 8% APY offered by tsUSDe. There is a limit to how much the bonus rate can be. Only up to 10,000 tsUSDe per wallet will qualify. Anything beyond that will still earn the base reward. This makes the offer appealing to both small and mid-level holders. Clear Options to Access and Stake USDe There are three key ways users can get USDe on TON. They can bridge it from Ethereum or other chains through Stargate, buy it directly on TON using USDT or other assets within wallets, or withdraw from exchanges like ByBit, MEXC, BitGet, and Gate. Once received, users can stake it for tsUSDe in their wallets to begin earning. This launch makes Ethena savings easily available inside wallets tied to Telegram, bringing stable earnings to users with a simple in-app experience. Meanwhile, on an operational level, as a DeFi platform, Ethena recently announced that, under pressure from German regulators, it will shut down all operations in the country .

Meanwhile, all eyes are turning to Unilabs (UNIL) , an AI-driven DeFi platform gaining traction as a potential ""Cardano killer."" With its AI and real-time analytics, Unilabs is transforming funds management. As the altcoin race heats up, the value of UNIL could surge to a new peak as adoption soars. Cardano (ADA) Price Consolidates in Symmetrical Triangle, Analyst Eyes Breakout Per crypto analyst Sssebi, a key technical pattern is forming on the Cardano price chart, which could lead to a breakout. He told his followers the Cardano price is currently consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle, a pattern that usually precedes a strong directional move. Meanwhile, multiple candle wicks are bouncing off the $0.70 area, which has been a key support for the Cardano price. Sssebi believes that the price of Cardano may retest the upper trendline of the triangle near the 0.80 level. A successful retest with strong volume could produce a breakout that pushes the Cardano price into a new bullish phase. Potential targets include $1.5 and $2.1. However, a downtrend may begin if the ADA price breaks below the $0.70 support zone. At the moment, the Cardano price has just dipped by 2.8% at the weekly level. The DeFi coin is currently retesting the $0.74 support and could lose it in the coming days if selling pressure tightens. Ethereum (ETH) Price Soars, $3,000 In View While the Cardano price eyes an uptrend, the Ethereum price could be set for a huge rally in the coming months, according to recent data. In a recent X post, Mister Crypto revealed that massive amounts of funds are flooding into Ethereum. Also, the Ethereum price has risen by 4.7% on the weekly timeframe and 48.9% on the monthly level. Chill told his followers that the Ethereum price and believes some god candles could start to appear in the next few days. The on-chain trader expects the ETH price to rally to $3,000 soon. CryptoWZRD is another market expert who expects the Ethereum price to see some gains and climb above the $3,000 level. He noted that the altcoin has formed an ascending channel in the 4H timeframe and might touch $3,550 soon. Meanwhile, an expert called Kamran Asghar forecasts the price of Ethereum might teleport to $8,000. However, the crypto supporter's chart showed the Ethereum price faces a barrier at $3,900. So, bulls must clear the region first. Can Unilabs (UNIL) Follow Ethereum's Footsteps? AI-Driven DeFi Project Sparks Investor Buzz The Ethereum price launched at just $0.31 during its ICO and has surged by over 12,000x since then. While past performance does not guarantee future results, it offers valuable insight into what early entry into powerful ecosystems can yield. Now, Unilabs (UNIL) is capturing similar early interest. In its first presale week, Unilabs has raised north of $1.5 million. Unilabs is not just another DeFi project; it is an intelligent, automated wealth engine. The platform runs multiple AI-managed funds, including a Stablecoin Fund for low-risk earnings and a Tech Fund targeting cutting-edge web3 projects. These funds are designed to auto-balance and adapt using real-time AI insights, giving users the edge of institutional-level strategies without lifting a finger. Currently trading at $0.0051, UNIL is a good crypto to buy. Holders gain access to the platform's 12-tiered reward system, staking yields, and 30% referral bonuses. If user adoption grows by just 1% of Ethereum's 2021 level, it could drive a 400x surge in token value post-launch. So, investors who want to grow their portfolios can take advantage of the ongoing cryptocurrency ICO that Unilabs just launched. Why the Unilabs DeFi Token is Challenging Cardano In a market where innovation drives momentum, Unilabs is emerging as a serious contender to Cardano. Although the Ethereum price is in the green zone, Unilabs' AI integration and presale success position as one of the best cryptos to invest in. As adoption grows, early supporters of Unilabs could see huge returns on their investments.

Bitcoin dips as demand roars on (UPDATED),https://crypto.news/bitcoin-dips-pullback-powerup-demand-roars-on/,"After soaring to a record high of nearly $112,000, Bitcoin has slipped amid a wave of profit-taking, rising geopolitical tension, and cautious signals from the Federal Reserve. The 7% dip, while notable, comes in the context of a broader rally driven by surging demand for spot ETFs and a tightening supply. With Bitcoin ( BTC ) adoption accelerating—companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding it to their treasuries—and daily mining output capped at just 450 coins, the recent pullback may simply be a pause in what many investors view as a longer-term structural uptrend. Consider the numbers: Bitcoin dropped to below $104,000 on Saturday, down by 7% from its all-time high of $111,900. Source: CoinGecko The decline occurred as investors booked profits after it jumped by 50% from its lowest point in April to its highest level this month. It is common for Bitcoin and other assets to drop after such a strong rally. Bitcoin also dropped as concerns about trade rose. Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, said that talks between the U.S. and China had stalled, while Trump accused China of not honoring its commitments. He also said that the U.S. would increase its tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%. At last check on Saturday, Bitcoin hovered above $104,550. See below. Source: CoinGecko You might also like: Shiba Inu price crashes as whales sell, burn rate slows Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve minutes showed that officials are not in a hurry to cut interest rates. Instead, they are having a wait-and-see approach as they observe the impact of tariffs on the economy. Fortunately, Bitcoin has strong supply and demand dynamics. Demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs is rising, with the cumulative inflows rising to over $44 billion. Companies like Trump Media and GameStop have started buying Bitcoin for their treasury. At the same time, the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has dropped by 57% from its highest point in March 2020, and the decline is accelerating. Bitcoin’s supply has dropped from 3.22 million to 1.37 million in the same period. This supply crunch may keep falling since only 450 coins are mined daily, and a company like Strategy is buying thousands a week . The supply held by miners has dropped to 1.74 million, its lowest level since 2010. Therefore, the supply and demand dynamics mean that the coin will continue rising.

BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news This chart shows that it has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Also, it has formed a bullish flag pattern, a popular continuation sign in technical analysis. The Bitcoin price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is currently in the handle phase. The depth of the cup is approximately 32%, which implies a target price of $144,650. This target is calculated by measuring the depth of the cup from its upper edge.

Despite being known for its high-speed blockchain and innovative features, Solana’s momentum seems to have stalled temporarily, which has prompted savvy investors to investigate alternative options for stronger returns. One project that’s gaining significant traction is Ruvi AI . With its real-world utility, impressive presale success, and explosive growth potential, Ruvi AI has emerged as a standout choice for those seeking a blend of practicality and unprecedented ROI. Solana’s Faltering Week Solana, often touted as an “Ethereum killer,” has experienced notable slowdowns this week, with its price remaining stagnant and no major updates or partnerships to spark renewed interest. While its blockchain boasts scalability and speed, investor confidence has taken a hit due to fluctuating activity levels and competitive pressure from other emerging projects. For existing holders, the stagnation may feel like just a minor bump in the road. However, for those seeking immediate growth opportunities, waiting out Solana’s rebound doesn’t seem like the ideal move. This is why attention is shifting to Ruvi AI, a project delivering immediate results and setting itself apart with a robust roadmap. Why Investors Are Moving to Ruvi AI Ruvi AI is capturing the crypto world’s imagination thanks to its incredible presale performance. The project has already sold over 130 million tokens , raising nearly $1.5 million in funding. Unlike many speculative projects in the market, Ruvi AI offers investors a clear path to growth, thanks to its low starting price of just $0.015 per token and a projected value of $1 by Q4 2025 . This means investors could see a stunning ROI of over 12,800% if they act early. What makes Ruvi AI a true alternative isn’t just its financial promise; it’s the real-world utility and innovation embedded in its platform. The Technology Powering Ruvi AI Ruvi AI leverages a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to deliver solutions for some of the world’s most pressing challenges. Key industries that stand to benefit include: Healthcare: AI-powered tools are revolutionizing diagnostics, helping healthcare providers improve accuracy and enhance patient outcomes. Logistics: Ruvi AI optimizes supply chains, streamlining operations, and cutting costs for businesses globally. Finance: With tools designed for fraud detection and secure transactions, Ruvi AI strengthens the backbone of digital finance. By addressing these critical sectors, Ruvi AI goes beyond being a cryptocurrency; it becomes an innovation hub that drives tangible impact. How VIP Investment Options Boost ROI Investors looking to maximize rewards can take part in Ruvi AI’s VIP investment program. The program offers tiered bonuses to early participants, allowing them to significantly enhance their token allocations: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $4,900. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $15,680. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $89,600. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $1,280,000. These tiers underscore Ruvi AI’s commitment to delivering significant gains to its earliest backers, creating a win-win scenario for both the project and its supporters. Broadening Reach Through WEEX Exchange To bolster accessibility and visibility, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a move that guarantees liquidity and ease of trading for its token. This partnership ensures that all investors, from retail participants to institutions, can confidently engage with Ruvi AI while benefiting from a secure and reliable trading experience. The Future Belongs to Ruvi AI While Solana continues its struggle to regain momentum, Ruvi AI is taking the lead by offering investors the best of both worlds: rapid growth and practical utility. Its breakthrough technologies and applications make it more than a passing trend; it’s a forward-thinking solution for various industries. For investors looking to capitalize on a project with a solid foundation and the potential for transformational gains, Ruvi AI stands out as the ideal choice.

SHIB is holding near $0.000014, and LINK is stuck at just under $16.50. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is stealing the show with over $279 million raised in its presale. Its current entry price of $0.0018 is driving buyers to act fast, making it one of the most popular crypto projects this year. While SHIB draws attention for its loyal fanbase and LINK remains known for its utility, BlockDAG (BDAG) is doing something unique, it’s converting visibility into actual capital. It might not be topping social charts, but it’s already topping portfolios. LINK Trades Tight Near $16.50 As Traders Wait for a Breakout Chainlink (LINK) is known for powering smart contracts with real-world data. At present, it’s locked in a tight range just under $16.50. That price level has resisted multiple breakout attempts, and many believe a significant move will follow once it breaks. The market is quiet now, but this could change. LINK’s price action shows signs of a buildup, with increased buying at lower levels. Still, without a confirmed breakout, it’s stuck. Long-term potential remains, but short-term returns may be limited. For people searching for strong upside, this may not be the most attractive entry compared to newer names in the space. SHIB Holds at $0.000014 But Still Awaits a Fresh Driver Shiba Inu (SHIB) has maintained its spot near $0.000014, staying steady despite wider market shifts. A strong community helps it stay relevant, even after many lost interest in meme coins. But beyond the loyal base, SHIB is missing a spark to move higher. Without a new reason to rally, SHIB remains flat. The Shibarium rollout is old news, and market activity isn’t pushing prices. It may jump when markets turn bullish again, but the days of massive gains seem to have passed. SHIB feels more like a well-known brand now rather than a coin ready for big growth. BlockDAG Hits $279M, Offers 2,678% Profit at $0.0018 Entry BlockDAG is pulling ahead while others stay flat. It has already raised over $279 million in its presale. Right now, buyers can still get in at $0.0018. That price offers a 2,678% gain when compared to the final $0.05 launch target. Over 21.5 billion coins have already been sold. What makes BlockDAG stand out isn’t just the presale price. Its tech is built for speed and efficiency, blending blockchain security with DAG scalability. It’s also EVM-compatible and comes with a low-code smart contract builder, making it more usable for developers and real-world applications. Few presale projects have this level of detail. June 13 is the big date. That’s when the GO LIVE reveal will happen, along with the announcement of 15 new exchange listings. These join the five already confirmed: BitMart, CoinStore, LBank, XT.com, and MEXC. These listings are expected to drive major liquidity and wider visibility. BlockDAG’s rise is backed by utility, not noise. With 20 listings, a locked-in $0.0018 price, and clear upside to $0.05, it’s becoming the most popular crypto choice of 2025. While others wait, people are buying now, before the doors close. Where the Smart Money Moves SHIB and LINK still draw fans and discussion. Their communities are strong, and their use cases are known. But today’s top choices aren’t just about familiarity, they’re about room to grow. LINK might break out, but upside is limited. SHIB has loyalty, but its biggest days may be behind it. BlockDAG is different. With $279 million raised, over 21.5 billion coins sold, and a limited-time $0.0018 entry, it’s delivering what others can’t: structure, strategy, and serious potential.

Recent comments from a high-ranking U.S. official have cast a spotlight on rising geopolitical tension in the region, specifically concerning China’s ambitions. While this might seem distant from the world of cryptocurrency, understanding the broader global landscape, including potential conflicts and shifts in power, is crucial as these events can ripple through financial markets, impacting everything from traditional stocks to digital assets. What Did the US Defense Secretary Say About China’s Dominance? During a recent Asian security conference held in Singapore, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth delivered a clear and stern message regarding China’s actions and intentions in the region. According to official reports from the U.S. Department of Defense, Hegseth asserted that China is actively pursuing a strategy to alter the current situation in Asia through the use of force. His remarks painted a picture of a nation seeking not just influence, but outright hegemony. Hegseth explicitly stated that China’s goal is to become the dominant power in Asia, aiming to control and exert significant influence over the entire region. The language used was unambiguous, suggesting a perceived shift from competition to a more aggressive posture. A particularly striking part of his statement was the assessment of the potential timeline and severity of the perceived threat. Hegseth warned, “The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent.” This phrasing elevates the concern from a long-term strategic challenge to a potentially near-term crisis, demanding immediate attention from regional partners and global powers alike. These comments from the US defense secretary underscore a significant point of friction between Washington and Beijing, highlighting differing visions for the future of Asian security and governance. They serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing power dynamics shaping international relations in one of the world’s most economically vital and strategically important regions. Understanding China’s Ambitions in Asia When discussing China’s dominance, it’s important to look beyond just military posturing. China’s rise is multifaceted, encompassing economic, diplomatic, and military dimensions. For decades, China has focused on rapid economic development, lifting millions out of poverty and becoming a global manufacturing and trading powerhouse. This economic strength provides a foundation for expanding influence. However, recent years have seen a more assertive foreign policy stance. Key aspects often cited when discussing China’s ambitions include: Military Modernization: Significant investment in its navy, air force, and missile capabilities, aimed at projecting power further from its shores. Territorial Claims: Assertive claims in the South China Sea, building artificial islands and militarizing them, despite competing claims from several neighboring countries. Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): A massive infrastructure project spanning continents, aimed at boosting trade and connectivity, but also viewed by some as a tool for expanding China’s economic and political influence. Diplomatic Engagement: Increasing presence and activity in international forums and organizations, often challenging the existing U.S.-led global order. Secretary Hegseth’s remarks specifically focused on the perceived willingness to use force to achieve these goals, suggesting that diplomatic and economic tools are being augmented or potentially overshadowed by military considerations in certain contexts, particularly concerning territorial disputes. The Impact on Asian Security and Regional Stability The statements from the U.S. Defense Secretary highlight significant challenges to regional stability in Asia. The accusation that China is attempting to change the status quo by force raises concerns among neighboring countries and U.S. allies. This perceived threat can lead to several outcomes: Potential Impact Description Increased Military Spending Neighboring countries and allies may boost their defense budgets and capabilities in response to the perceived threat. Strengthened Alliances Existing alliances, such as those between the U.S. and Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia, are likely to be reinforced. New security partnerships or blocs may also emerge. Heightened Tensions in Flashpoints Areas like the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and border regions could see increased military activity and a higher risk of miscalculation or confrontation. Economic Uncertainty Geopolitical tension can create uncertainty for trade, investment, and supply chains in the region, potentially impacting global markets. The U.S. position, as articulated by the defense secretary, is clearly aimed at galvanizing support among allies and partners to counter what it sees as destabilizing actions by China. This strategic competition between two global powers inevitably affects the entire region, creating a complex and potentially volatile environment for Asian security. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean? While this news directly concerns international relations and defense policy, understanding such geopolitical shifts is valuable for anyone tracking global trends. For those interested in financial markets, including cryptocurrency: Monitor Geopolitical News: Stay informed about major developments in U.S.-China relations and Asian security. Significant escalations or de-escalations can influence market sentiment. Consider Diversification: Geopolitical risks are a reminder of the importance of a diversified portfolio, not solely reliant on assets tied to a single region or economy. Assess Risk Appetite: Periods of heightened tension might lead some investors to become more risk-averse, potentially impacting volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. The comments from the US defense secretary are a high-level assessment of a complex situation. They reflect a particular viewpoint from Washington and are part of an ongoing dialogue and competition between major global powers. Understanding this context is key to interpreting the news accurately. Conclusion: A Shifting Geopolitical Landscape Secretary Hegseth’s remarks in Singapore serve as a powerful indicator of the current state of U.S.-China relations and the significant concerns held by the U.S. regarding China’s dominance ambitions in Asia. The assertion that China seeks to use force to alter the regional status quo highlights the perceived risks to Asian security and regional stability. This geopolitical tension is not confined to diplomatic or military circles; it has the potential to influence global economic conditions and market dynamics. As the situation evolves, the interactions between these major powers will continue to shape the future of Asia and hold implications for the wider world.

Bulls eye a breakout above $200 for SOL, while ADA is tipped to outperform—it could soar as high as $8. At the same time, focus has shifted to Unilabs (UNIL) , one of this year’s top DeFi projects. Unlike most utility actions, UNIL will combine two of the world’s most innovative technologies: blockchain and artificial intelligence. Its unique offering revolves around being the first cryptocurrency-based asset manager backed by AI. At the heart of the ecosystem will be the UNIL token—one of the top DeFi projects to watch out for this year. Solana Price Approaches a Breakout Above $200 The Solana price exploded from a 30-day low of $140 to a high of $187. Despite the slight dip, it hovers above $170 as of press time, recording a monthly gain of 16%. And what is next for the Layer-1 coin? A retest of its 30-day high of $187 will be a great step in its resurgence, which could spark a breakout above $200. Flipping this level could push SOL toward $500 this year—a bullish Solana price prediction shared by Bilo Crypto. While bears’ Solana price prediction suggests a decline toward $140 and $150, current market conditions say otherwise. Growing retail investment and rising whale demand are bullish catalysts, backed by technical indicators, notably the 100-EMA and 200-EMA. However, a more promising alternative could be the AI token UNIL—one of the top DeFi projects worth betting on. Can the Cardano Price Cross $8 This Cycle? Analysts’ bold Cardano price predictions can be linked to growing adoption and rising institutional appetite. The Layer-1 altcoin is among the top ten cryptocurrencies, tipped to outperform this cycle. In the past month, ADA recorded a modest 5% gain, but experts are nonetheless sharing bold Cardano price predictions. A notable one is from TYLER BURKE, suggesting the altcoin could reach $5 before the year’s end. Meanwhile, Awil Mowliid’s Cardano price prediction suggests the altcoin could cross $8 this cycle. Despite ADA’s upside potential, investors have been shifting focus to Unilabs, a low-cap altcoin on experts’ lists of the top DeFi projects set for a breakout. Unilabs (UNIL): A Top DeFi Project That Intersects With AI Unilabs (UNIL) is among the top DeFi projects experts are bullish on, especially with its deep AI integration. Its intriguing blend of decentralized finance and artificial intelligence is one of its biggest selling points, driving massive demand among whales and retailers. Given the rapid growth of DeFi and an expanding investor base seeking alternatives to traditional financial markets, the UNIL protocol is a game-changer. This is because it introduces a proprietary AI Launchpad—a pioneering platform designed to identify unconventional investment opportunities within the crypto market. Even more impressive is its focus on strong and high-performance sectors. Hence, users will get a smart and diversified portfolio with high-profit potential across AI, RWA, BTC and DePIN, among others. Despite the bold Solana price predictions and ADA’s potential rally above $8—a bullish Cardano price prediction—Unilabs’ future adoption and small market size mean it has higher upside. Closing Thoughts While optimistic Solana price predictions have been flying and analysts are throwing out bold Cardano price predictions, savvy investors have been stockpiling the UNIL token. At $0.0051 in the second stage of the ICO, it is significantly undervalued, with a 20% gain expected when it reaches $0.0062 in the third presale stage. Other incentives to holding, like staking and the redistribution of 30% of platform-generated fees to holders, further drive demand. Hence, early funding has surpassed $1.5 million in record time, positioning it among the top DeFi projects to watch out for this year.

In his latest post, Xaif reported that a massive Hyperliquid whale, operating under the wallet address 0x1e5c, has just opened a long position on XRP with a staggering $1.08 million at stake, using 12x leverage at an entry price of $2.1336. The message was emphatic: “IT’S TIME TO SEND $XRP TO VALHALLA.” For seasoned traders and XRP enthusiasts alike, this is not just another speculative bet; it’s a signal that something seismic may be unfolding beneath the surface of the XRP market. The Weight of Whale Movements In crypto, whale behavior often acts as a leading indicator of major price shifts. Large holders, or “whales,” wield significant influence over market dynamics, given the sheer size of their positions. When a whale commits over a million dollars with high leverage, it’s a bold display of confidence in the asset’s near-term upside. Such trades are rarely random; they are typically informed by deep market insight, advanced technical models, or even insider-level intelligence on upcoming events. JUST IN: Hyperliquid Whale (0x1e5c) Long $XRP with 12x leverage, entry price $2.1336, position value $1.08M. IT'S TIME TO SEND $XRP TO VALHALLA pic.twitter.com/un4hIcP7d0 — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 31, 2025 Xaif’s revelation about the Hyperliquid whale’s aggressive long on XRP has sent waves through trading communities. Hyperliquid, a rising player in the decentralized perpetual futures market, enables large-scale, on-chain leverage, making these positions highly transparent. The sheer size and leverage level here suggest that this whale is betting not just on a casual uptick, but on a decisive, potentially explosive XRP price movement in the days or weeks ahead. Technical Landscape Supporting the Bullish Thesis The whale’s conviction appears well-aligned with current technical signals flashing across XRP charts. XRP has recently broken through key resistance levels, flipping them into support, while maintaining strong momentum on both daily and four-hour timeframes. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is signaling controlled bullishness, avoiding the overbought zone, while moving averages — particularly the 50-day and 200-day — have crossed into a bullish alignment. Additionally, trading volumes have surged alongside rising open interest in XRP derivatives markets, suggesting that institutional players and seasoned traders are positioning for a major move. Whale participation, like the one highlighted by Xaif, often serves as both a catalyst and a confirmation for these broader technical patterns, reinforcing the bullish case. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Broader Narrative and Market Catalysts Beyond the charts, the fundamental backdrop for XRP remains compelling. Ripple, the enterprise blockchain company closely tied to XRP, continues to expand its global footprint, particularly in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. Ripple’s ongoing efforts to integrate XRP into central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives and real-time settlement solutions add a layer of fundamental strength that could support sustained price growth. The whale’s aggressive positioning, therefore, isn’t occurring in a vacuum; it’s embedded within a landscape of growing optimism around Ripple’s future and XRP’s evolving utility. While whale actions are never a guarantee of future price direction, they often foreshadow major market shifts, especially when backed by strong technicals and fundamentals. For now, all eyes are on XRP’s next moves, as traders, analysts, and investors alike wait to see if this bold whale bet will indeed propel XRP to “Valhalla” and beyond. One thing is certain: something big is brewing for XRP, and the crypto market is watching every second of it.

After a period of notable inflows, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs took a significant hit on May 30th, recording a massive $614.02 million in total net outflows. This marks the second consecutive trading day where more money left these investment vehicles than entered, raising questions about shifting sentiment in the crypto market . Breaking Down the Latest U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Data According to data shared by @thepfund on X, the scale of the outflows on May 30th was substantial. A net figure of $614.02 million leaving the combined U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market in a single day is certainly noteworthy. Let’s look at which specific funds saw the largest movements: BlackRock’s IBIT: Led the pack with a significant $428.62 million in net outflows. This was by far the largest contributor to the day’s negative total. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Saw $120.14 million in net outflows. Bitwise’s BITB: Experienced $35.33 million in net outflows. Grayscale’s mini BTC (BTCW): Had $16.22 million in net outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC: Recorded $13.71 million in net outflows. Interestingly, the remaining U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs tracked reported no change in their holdings for the day, meaning they saw neither significant inflows nor outflows. Understanding Bitcoin ETF Outflows: Why Do They Matter? For those new to the space, Bitcoin ETF outflows occur when investors sell their shares in the exchange-traded fund, leading the fund manager to sell underlying Bitcoin to meet those redemptions. Net outflows mean the total value of shares being sold exceeds the value of shares being bought on a given day. Why is this data important? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a significant avenue for traditional investors, institutions, and even retail traders to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. The flows into and out of these funds are often seen as a barometer for institutional and broader market sentiment towards Bitcoin. Large net inflows are typically viewed positively, indicating increasing demand, while large net outflows can signal profit-taking, a shift in sentiment, or reallocation of capital. What Could Be Driving These Bitcoin ETF Outflows? Pinpointing the exact reasons behind large Bitcoin ETF outflows on any given day can be complex, as it’s often a confluence of factors. However, here are a few potential explanations market observers are considering: Profit-Taking: Bitcoin saw a notable price rally leading up to this period. Some investors who entered the ETFs at lower prices might be cashing out to realize gains. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news, such as anticipation or reaction to inflation data, interest rate outlooks, or changes in investor risk appetite across traditional markets, can influence decisions to pull capital from riskier assets like Bitcoin. Fund-Specific Reallocations: Large institutions or wealth managers using these ETFs might be rebalancing their portfolios for reasons unrelated to Bitcoin’s specific fundamentals, leading to significant movements in funds like IBIT or ARKB. Short-Term Trading Strategies: Some investors might use ETFs for short-term trading, buying on dips and selling into strength, contributing to daily volatility in flows. Anticipation of Volatility: Sometimes, large outflows can occur ahead of expected market events, as investors reduce exposure to potentially volatile assets. It’s crucial to remember that these are potential drivers, and the market is influenced by a multitude of forces simultaneously. Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Broader Crypto Market The immediate impact of large Bitcoin ETF outflows on the Bitcoin price can vary. While outflows theoretically mean selling pressure on the underlying asset (Bitcoin), the market is vast and influenced by many other factors, including derivatives trading, exchange order books, and global demand outside of U.S. ETFs. Historically, significant multi-day outflows have sometimes correlated with periods of Bitcoin price consolidation or decline. However, the relationship isn’t always one-to-one, and Bitcoin has shown resilience even during periods of ETF selling. For the broader crypto market , Bitcoin’s price action often sets the tone. If significant ETF outflows contribute to a sustained dip in Bitcoin’s price, it can potentially lead to downward pressure on altcoins as well, due to market correlation and shifts in overall investor sentiment. Key Takeaways and What’s Next The $614.02 million net outflow on May 30th is a significant data point, particularly as it follows another day of outflows. Here’s what to keep in mind: Monitor the Trend: While one or two days of outflows aren’t a definitive trend reversal, watching whether this continues over the next few days is crucial. Sustained outflows would be a stronger signal of shifting sentiment. Context is Key: Compare these outflows to previous periods of inflows. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions since their launch, so some periods of outflows are to be expected. Look Beyond ETFs: Remember that ETF flows are just one piece of the puzzle. Global crypto exchanges, derivatives markets, and macroeconomic news also heavily influence the Bitcoin price and the overall crypto market . Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports detailing the daily flows for funds like IBIT , FBTC, and others, as well as broader market analysis. This period of outflows highlights the dynamic nature of the market. While the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs brought significant optimism and capital, flows can and do reverse, reflecting the ebb and flow of investor sentiment and broader economic conditions. The crypto market remains a fascinating space to watch, and these ETF flow dynamics are now a central part of that narrative. Whether this signals a temporary pause or a more significant shift remains to be seen, and market participants will be closely watching the data in the coming days.

While Solaxy progresses through the end of its presale phase, attention is shifting elsewhere. Pepeto, a meme-powered project with real utility, has entered the conversation with increasing strength. With the best crypto to buy in 2025 up for debate, the split in investor focus reflects growing curiosity about which contender offers the greatest upside. Pepeto: The Meme Coin Rewriting the Rules Pepeto is not just another meme coin chasing hype. It brings real technology, optimization, and purpose to a space often driven by fleeting trends. Pepeto introduces a cross-chain exchange platform built with zero listing fees, strong security, and support for promising new tokens. These features set it apart from earlier meme coins. Inspired by the mythic God of Frogs, Pepeto’s concept goes beyond internet culture. It builds its ecosystem on six symbolic pillars: Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization. Together, they form a foundation that aims to restore legitimacy to meme coins. Through this vision, Pepeto is offering what could be the best meme coin to buy in 2025, not just for entertainment, but for real functionality in crypto. Solaxy: A Scalable Layer 2 Built on Solana Solaxy positions itself as a Layer 2 chain designed to solve long-standing network issues in the Solana ecosystem. It delivers greater scalability, reduces transaction failures, and maintains Solana’s fast speeds and low fees. With multi-chain compatibility, Solaxy is being built to future-proof Solana’s infrastructure. The current presale for Solaxy’s $SOLX token is nearing its end. Investors are able to buy tokens before they list, offering early entry at a discounted rate. The roadmap includes staking, token generation events, and a rollout across multiple exchanges. Post-presale, users will be able to bridge their tokens into the Solaxy ecosystem seamlessly. Tokenomics reveal a well-structured distribution plan: 30% toward development, 25% to reward early adopters, and 20% to treasury. Marketing, listings, and other allocations reflect the project’s long-term goals. While Solaxy presents a strong case, its dominance is no longer certain, especially with Pepeto igniting momentum. Pepeto’s Presale and Staking System Gains Momentum Pepeto is currently deep into its presale, having already raised over $5.2 million. With tokens priced at $0.000000131 , early investors are jumping in ahead of a possible price surge. The project’s staking system is another major draw, offering estimated returns exceeding 280% annually. This system has already attracted over 29 trillion $PEPETO tokens staked, a sign of deep investor confidence. Token distribution supports long-term growth. 30% of the 420 trillion supply is set aside for the presale, another 30% is allocated to staking rewards, and 20% goes toward marketing. Development and liquidity allocations ensure the project can scale effectively post-launch. Moreover, rewards are distributed per Ethereum block for two years, ensuring consistent engagement from holders. How to Buy and Stake $PEPETO with Ease Buying $PEPETO is straightforward. First, users need a compatible wallet like Metamask or Best Wallet. Next, load the wallet with ETH, USDT, or BNB. Finally, head to the official Pepeto site to buy or stake tokens. The platform makes it easy to choose between purchasing for gains or staking for even greater rewards With staking live and presale tokens still available, investors are seizing the opportunity to get in early. Follow the frogs now and stake your claim with Pepeto before the next bull run begins. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Information obtained from Lookonchain indicates that the trade accumulated over $17 million profit, whereas the losses incurred by Wynn are estimated to be nearly $100 million. Contrarian Bet against Wynn’s Transactions for Enormous Gains Beginning about May 24, 0x2258 started mirroring the reverse of Wynn’s positions. If Wynn shorted, then 0x2258 went long; if Wynn went long, then 0x2258 shorted. On May 24, 0x2258 shorted Bitcoin and Ethereum against Wynn’s longs, closing with a profit of $1.36 million. On May 25, after Wynn shorted, 0x2258 went long, earning an extra $2.54 million profit. On May 26, there was another $1.7 million profit when 0x2258 shorted and Wynn longed again. This pattern repeated in a number of trades and amounted to $17 million profit. James Wynn: From $100M High to $98M in Losses James Wynn is famous for his high-leverage trade on Hyperliquid, where he previously turned $4 million into $100 million—before his wealth dropped to minus $13 million. Undeterred by his loss, “Zero regrets. Flipping $4 million to $100 million and back down to -$13 million is one hell of a thrill,” he posted on X.

UNI's recent 10.9% price range demonstrates how geopolitical factors are directly influencing digital asset valuations, as traders navigate between risk-off sentiment and opportunistic positioning. Despite challenging conditions, Uniswap has shown resilience by breaking above key resistance levels, suggesting potential stabilization after significant volatility. Technical Analysis Highlights UNI experienced significant price turbulence over the 24-hour period, with a substantial range of 0.644 (10.9%) from the high of 6.589 to the low of 5.945, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. The token faced a sharp selloff during the 16:00-01:00 period, plummeting from 6.510 to 5.954, with notably high volume (4.4M) at the 01:00 low, establishing a strong volume support zone. A modest recovery followed, with UNI finding resistance around 6.120 and consolidating between 6.000-6.050, suggesting market indecision after the significant correction. In the last hour, UNI experienced a significant downward trend followed by a modest recovery. The token declined from 6.110 to a low of 6.017 around 13:51, establishing a key support zone with increased volume. A notable reversal occurred at 14:01 when UNI surged 3.6% from 6.032 to 6.054, accompanied by elevated volume (28.7K), suggesting renewed buying interest. The price action formed a bullish channel with resistance at 6.055 and support at 6.030, with the closing price of 6.051 indicating potential short-term stabilization after the earlier volatility.

He ended a volatile month with just $23 left in his account, according to HyperDash data . Wynn built his reputation and following by placing massive, leveraged on-chain trades across bitcoin BTC, PEPE PEPE, and other tokens. His downfall began with a $1.25 billion long position on BTC that unraveled as prices dropped below $105,000 amid growing geopolitical uncertainty. That trade alone cost him more than $37 million after fees. The trader briefly pivoted to memecoins like PEPE , where one long position initially gained over 10%, before market swings liquidated him again. Over the course of the month, Wynn cycled through assets including ETH, SUI, TRUMP, and even FARTCOIN. His trades at one point saw him achieve an unrealized gain of $85 million. An account associated with Wynn on X commented on the liquidation and dismissed the losses. “I’ll run it back, I always do. And I’ll enjoy doing it.

Meme-fueled PEPE has continued its upward climb, while Hedera (HBAR), long favored for its enterprise-grade infrastructure, has cooled off, with price action showing a pause near recent support. While both assets stay on watchlists, a third project is quickly overtaking them in relevance. BlockDAG, now deep into its presale, has raised over $278 million, is priced at $0.0018, and is nearing the $300 million mark. Without hype-driven surges or technical slowdowns, it’s quietly attracting more capital and attention than most post-launch tokens. As the crypto market recalibrates, this shift marks a change in what qualifies as a top-tier project. PEPE Sees Renewed Momentum as Speculation Builds PEPE, one of the most recognizable meme coins of the past two years, is again turning heads. After consolidating during Q1, the token recently surged double digits, driven by renewed trading activity and online buzz. Social metrics are climbing, liquidity is returning, and short-term traders have jumped back in. While some view the move as another wave of speculative capital, others are tracking PEPE’s support levels and volume for potential continuation. The challenge remains the same, how sustainable is the rise? With limited utility, PEPE’s movement often reflects sentiment more than infrastructure. That doesn’t make it irrelevant. It simply positions it as a short-term play rather than a long-term allocation. Despite the current rally, most investors aren’t betting on PEPE to reshape anything structurally. The gains are real, but the staying power is always uncertain. Hedera’s Price Action Cools as Buyers Take a Breather Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), often cited for its efficiency and strong corporate relationships, is currently in a holding pattern. After a promising start to the year, the token has failed to sustain momentum. Analysts now describe the price chart as directionless, hovering in a narrow band with reduced volatility. HBAR’s core strength, a scalable, energy-efficient consensus mechanism, hasn’t changed. What has changed is the market’s appetite for projects that take time to unfold. Despite enterprise adoption and technical achievements, the token’s current growth curve has flattened. There’s little doubt HBAR remains a solid infrastructure coin, but right now, it’s not where momentum is flowing. In a cycle where capital seeks catalysts and speed, HBAR’s price behavior feels more like a wait-and-see scenario than an active opportunity. BlockDAG Nears $300M and Sets a New Standard While PEPE benefits from short-term enthusiasm and HBAR drifts sideways, BlockDAG is growing with discipline and focus. The presale has now surpassed $278 million, and the pace of inflows suggests it could reach $300 million ahead of its next milestone, the GO LIVE Reveal on June 13. At a locked presale price of $0.0018, BlockDAG is still accessible to early participants. The project isn’t relying on hype or legacy branding. It’s attracting attention because of what it offers: a scalable, fast, and developer-friendly environment that bridges blockchain and DAG technology. This hybrid model gives it high transaction speed, strong decentralization, and robust security, without relying on Layer 2 add-ons or off-chain dependencies. BlockDAG is also EVM-compatible, allowing existing Ethereum-based tools to operate seamlessly within the network. On top of that, it features a low-code smart contract builder, making it easier for less technical users to deploy applications. Its post-launch presence is also being built in advance. 15 new exchange listings will be revealed at the June 13 event, joining the 5 already confirmed: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. This ensures wide distribution, trading access, and high liquidity from day one, a rare setup for a project still in presale. BlockDAG isn’t trying to replicate existing models, it’s prioritizing usability, scalability, and measurable rollout progress. The project's consistent growth in funding, combined with its active development, stands in contrast to projects that either wait for catalysts or ride temporary waves of speculation. Its target launch price of $0.05 suggests early buyers could realize 2,677% returns, and some community estimates have floated long-term targets as high as $20, implying a 10,000x upside. While those figures are projections, they reflect the confidence forming around the project, and they’re backed by actual capital, not theoretical hype. What makes BlockDAG stand out isn’t just its numbers, but the way those numbers are being reached. There's no dependence on hype cycles, influencer campaigns, or buzzwords. The value is being created through clear action: a functioning tech stack, confirmed listings, and transparent rollout. Key Takeaways PEPE is rallying, and that deserves attention, but mainly from short-term traders. HBAR is steady, but that steadiness isn’t drawing new capital. The conversation is shifting because projects like BlockDAG are showing what actual forward movement looks like. At $0.0018, BlockDAG still offers the kind of early entry point that’s becoming harder to find. With over $278 million raised, a detailed exchange rollout, and a roadmap that is already being executed, the project now competes not as a hopeful newcomer, but as a front-runner for the next cycle. For those scanning the charts, reading forecasts, and comparing fundamentals, the new answer to “What’s the top crypto project to watch right now?” is no longer hypothetical. It’s BlockDAG, and it’s getting harder to ignore.

The Bitcoin mining difficulty has just hit an all-time high, a move that has important implications for everyone involved in the network, from individual miners to large-scale operations and even those who simply hold Bitcoin. What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty, Anyway? Let’s break down what mining difficulty actually means in the context of Bitcoin. Think of it as a self-adjusting mechanism built into the Bitcoin protocol. Its primary job is to ensure that blocks are mined (added to the blockchain) at a relatively consistent pace, specifically, about every 10 minutes. Here’s how it works: Miners use powerful computers (hardware) to solve complex computational problems. The first miner to solve the problem for a block gets to add it to the blockchain and receives a reward (newly minted Bitcoin plus transaction fees). The ‘difficulty’ is a measure of how hard it is to solve that problem. The network automatically adjusts this difficulty every 2016 blocks, which is roughly every two weeks. This adjustment is based on how quickly the previous 2016 blocks were found. If blocks were found faster than the 10-minute target (meaning more computing power, or hash rate, joined the network), the difficulty increases. If blocks were found slower (less hash rate), the difficulty decreases. The Latest Spike: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Soars According to data from CloverPool, the Bitcoin mining difficulty saw a notable increase, rising by 4.38%. This adjustment occurred around 00:01 UTC on May 31 at block height 899,136, pushing the difficulty metric to a new peak of 126.98 T. This isn’t just a small step; it marks a new Bitcoin ATH (All-Time High) for this specific network parameter. This increase signifies that the overall computing power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network (the hash rate) has grown substantially over the past two weeks. More miners are competing to find the next block, making the computational puzzle harder to solve for everyone. Why is the Difficulty Reaching a Bitcoin ATH? The main driver behind the rising mining difficulty is an increase in the network’s total hash rate. Several factors contribute to this: New Hardware Deployment: Miners are continuously upgrading to more efficient and powerful ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) machines. As new generations of miners come online, the total hash rate of the network increases. Entry of New Miners: When Bitcoin’s price performs well, it attracts new participants into the Bitcoin mining space, both large institutional players and smaller operations. Operational Expansion: Existing mining farms might be expanding their facilities, adding more machines to their operations. Geographical Shifts: Changes in energy costs or regulations in different regions can lead to miners relocating or expanding in more favorable areas, contributing to the global hash rate. Essentially, the network is responding exactly as designed: more competition (higher hash rate) leads to a harder puzzle (higher difficulty) to maintain the target block time. What Does This Record Difficulty Mean for Miners? For those actively engaged in cryptocurrency mining , a record high difficulty presents both challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Reduced Profitability (per unit of hash rate): With the difficulty increasing, each unit of computing power (hash rate) is less likely to find a block compared to when the difficulty was lower. This means miners need more hash rate to earn the same amount of Bitcoin, assuming the Bitcoin price and transaction fees remain constant. Increased Operational Costs: To maintain or increase their share of the network’s hash rate, miners must invest in more powerful hardware or run more machines, leading to higher electricity consumption and capital expenditure. Pressure on Older Hardware: Less efficient mining machines become less profitable or even unprofitable at higher difficulty levels, forcing miners to upgrade or shut down older equipment. Opportunities & Considerations: Efficiency is Key: Miners with access to cheap electricity and the latest, most energy-efficient hardware are better positioned to remain profitable even at high difficulty. Focus on Long-Term Value: Many miners operate with a long-term view, accumulating Bitcoin with the expectation of future price appreciation, which can offset periods of lower immediate profitability. Transaction Fees: While the block reward (subsidy) halves over time, transaction fees collected by miners become increasingly important for profitability. It’s a constant arms race in the Bitcoin mining world, driven by technological advancement and economic incentives. Impact on the Bitcoin Network While higher difficulty creates challenges for individual miners, it’s largely a positive sign for the overall health and security of the Bitcoin network: Enhanced Security: A higher difficulty means the network is being secured by more computing power. This makes it exponentially harder and more expensive for any single entity to attempt a 51% attack, where someone tries to control the majority of the network’s hash rate to manipulate transactions. Stable Block Times: The difficulty adjustment mechanism successfully keeps the block production rate stable, ensuring predictable transaction confirmation times despite fluctuations in the total hash rate. Proof of Work Strength: The increasing difficulty is a testament to the strength and robustness of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism and the ongoing commitment of miners to the network. The network is behaving exactly as designed, adapting to the growing computational power dedicated to it. Looking Ahead: The Next Difficulty Adjustment The provided data also gives us a glimpse into the near future. The next difficulty adjustment is anticipated in approximately 14 days. Based on the current hash rate trends observed since the last adjustment, the projection suggests a slight decrease in difficulty to 126.83 T, a change of -0.12%. It’s important to remember that this is a projection and the actual adjustment can vary depending on how the total network hash rate changes over the next two weeks. Hash rate can fluctuate due to various factors, including: Changes in electricity prices. Weather events impacting power grids. Large mining farms coming online or going offline. Market price movements of Bitcoin influencing miner profitability and decisions. A slight decrease, if it occurs, would indicate that the average hash rate over the current 2016-block period was marginally lower than the period leading up to the recent ATH, or perhaps the initial surge didn’t fully sustain its pace. Is Cryptocurrency Mining Still Worth It? This is a question many ask, especially with mining difficulty reaching new heights. The answer isn’t simple and depends heavily on individual circumstances: For Large-Scale Operations: With access to wholesale electricity rates, state-of-the-art cooling, and the latest hardware, large farms can often remain profitable. Their scale provides significant advantages. For Individual Miners: Home mining has become significantly more challenging due to high electricity costs and the expense of competitive hardware. Profitability often requires access to very cheap or renewable energy sources. Cloud Mining: This offers an alternative but comes with its own risks, including scams and variable contract terms. Ultimately, assessing profitability requires careful calculation of hardware costs, electricity rates, and the expected lifespan and efficiency of the equipment, all while considering the volatile price of Bitcoin. Summary: A Network Growing Stronger The recent jump in Bitcoin mining difficulty to a new all-time high of 126.98 T is a clear indicator of the continued growth and robustness of the Bitcoin network. Driven by an increase in the global hash rate, this milestone reflects ongoing investment in cryptocurrency mining infrastructure and technology. While posing challenges for miners by impacting profitability and demanding greater efficiency, the higher difficulty significantly enhances the security and stability of the Bitcoin blockchain. The projected slight decrease in the next adjustment highlights the dynamic nature of the network’s self-regulating mechanism. This event underscores Bitcoin’s resilience and the competitive landscape of its underlying mining industry.

It’s about picking coins with real value, strong plans, and timing it right. While some chase short-term gains or meme coins, others are paying attention to useful projects with solid systems and clear goals. As the market starts gaining pace again, the smart strategy is to get in early on coins with real-world use. From AI tools to asset-backed tokens and strong Layer-2 networks, some projects are building for long-term success. This breakdown highlights four coins worth watching: one AI-driven platform with major upside and three more that are building strength. Whether you’re into automation, decentralized finance, or network support, these choices show why they are among the best altcoins to invest in now. Let’s begin with one many think has a chance to quietly deliver 27x returns. 1. Unstaked: A Fresh Take on AI Utility in Crypto Unstaked is changing how people connect with crypto by offering a system where users set up AI agents to work for them across social platforms. These agents are made to handle tasks like posting, replying, and growing communities on platforms such as X and Telegram, all without needing constant user input. Users can deploy these agents right after Unstaked’s upcoming public launch. Each agent's activity is recorded on-chain, giving full transparency and a clear history of what they do. Users earn $UNSD rewards based on how well their agent performs. With a monthly cost of $10 to $25, these agents act as useful tools that could replace old-school customer service and social teams. The project is now in stage 17 of its presale, with each token priced at $0.01043. It has already raised more than $8.2 million and sold nearly 1 billion tokens. The expected launch price is $0.1819, giving early buyers a chance at a 27x return. In a market full of loud projects, Unstaked focuses on tools, value, and clear rewards. For anyone looking at the best altcoins to invest in, this one offers early access, strong use, and big potential gains. 2. Ondo Finance Bridges Crypto and Real-World Assets Ondo Finance is building strong momentum and is now seen as one of the best altcoins to invest in, especially for those interested in linking traditional finance with DeFi. Its main feature is turning real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries into crypto-based options, giving users access to stable, regulated, and yield-bearing tools.

Earlier, the country had already declared mining and trading in digital assets illegal. The crypto market fell in response to the news. Here is how the latest ban by Chinese authorities may affect the crypto industry. Subscribe to our newsletter and get updates on what's happening in the Web3 world straight to your inbox! What Happened The Chinese government has announced new restrictions on the crypto community. Authorities now ban not only the trading and mining of cryptocurrencies, but also the private ownership of digital assets such as Bitcoin. The ban could encourage greater decentralization of cryptocurrency use in Asia, as users seek out jurisdictions with more favorable policies. The decision underscores the Chinese authorities' desire to centralize control over the financial system, especially amid the promotion of the digital yuan. The national cryptocurrency is a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Control over the circulation of the digital yuan is entirely in the hands of the authorities. Regulators see traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as competitors to their CBDC. These restrictive measures aim to reduce Chinese users' interest in other digital coins. The decision to ban private storage of cryptocurrencies was preceded by news of the sale of confiscated cryptocurrencies by Chinese authorities. Even after regulators sold some of the coins, China remains second among countries with the largest holdings of BTC. The PRC has 194,000 Bitcoins worth $20.6 billion on its balance sheet, or 0.924% of the cryptocurrency's total supply. The sale of such a volume of BTC could be a powerful blow to the market. At the same time, it is not known whether the ban on crypto storage extends to government agencies, or whether China plans to liquidate all its holdings. Notably, there were earlier rumors circulating in the market that China might, on the contrary, lift restrictions on crypto. Market Reaction The crypto market reacted to the news with a drop. Bitcoin fell to $104,684 at one point, but then began to recover. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $104,541. Following BTC, many altcoins also declined. Among the top 10 by market capitalization, Cardano recorded the largest losses in 24 hours (-5.55%). Many members of the crypto community had trading positions liquidated amid the fall of Bitcoin. For example, popular trader James Wynn liquidated 949 BTC ($99.3 million). The crypto community has ridiculed the Chinese authorities' attempts to ban their citizens from using cryptocurrencies. In their opinion, these restrictive measures will not force the Chinese to stop using Bitcoin. Not the First Ban The ban on private storage of cryptocurrencies is not the first for Chinese crypto community members. PRC regulators have been consistently suppressing the crypto industry for several years. In September 2017, China banned ICOs and crypto trading. Amid the PRC authorities' pressure on the crypto industry, BTC fell in price by almost 40% almost overnight. However, by December 2017, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high near the $20,000 mark. In May 2021, Chinese authorities imposed a ban on mining. The decision hurt the market because, at the time, the PRC was the main center of bitcoin mining. As Chinese miners had to shut down their equipment and look for a new home, the BTC hashrate collapsed rapidly. The price of Bitcoin plummeted as well, with the depth of the fall exceeding 50%. However, by November 2021, BTC reached a new all-time high near $69,000. Past market crashes following crypto bans in China suggest that regulatory pressure from Chinese authorities is not fatal to the industry. Another ban is unlikely to pose a serious problem for the global crypto community.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-31 17:27:59

Among these, XRP, Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Ozak AI are being identified by analysts as top picks, driven by both technical signals and rising adoption. These cryptocurrencies are positioned at strategic intersections of blockchain evolution, with distinct utilities that cater to enterprise and retail demands. XRP Seeks to Maintain Key Support Levels XRP is currently undergoing a critical technical phase as it attempts to establish support near the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $2.27. Recent price action shows a decline below the 50-day EMA around $2.29, with bearish indicators building momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has issued a sell signal after the MACD line crossed below the signal line on May 20. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below the midline at 50, pointing toward sustained downside momentum. Technical analysts are closely monitoring support zones at $2.07, $1.61, and a projected target near $1.00, based on a developing bear flag pattern. Meanwhile, the SuperTrend indicator presents dynamic support near $2.17, a level that may hold significance should price recovery begin. On the upside, resistance levels at $2.65 and $3.00 are expected to act as short-term hurdles if buyers regain control. XRP remains under watch for its potential to rebound, especially with growing institutional interest and increased utilization in cross-border payment systems. Hyperliquid Registers Strong Monthly Gains Hyperliquid (HYPE) has demonstrated robust market performance throughout May 2025, posting a 110.15% gain over the past 30 days. The altcoin recently achieved an all-time high of $39.93, bolstered by increased volume and high-profile activity, including the closure of a $1.2 billion BTC position by James Wynn. Currently, the altcoin’s market cap is $12.58B, which ranks it in 11th place among other cryptocurrencies. Also, there are price indications being balanced by several price indicators, including the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and MACD. The steady growth on both 12-day and 26-day EMAs is being noted by analysts, reinforcing the positive outlook. An upward momentum in projections expects the upward momentum in HYPE to either visit or exceed its current peak, with a short price target of $45. As such, a correction could see retests of $35 support or $30 on a broader market correction. Ozak AI Combines AI and Blockchain Utility Ozak AI has quickly gained attention for its combination of decentralized infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Currently in its third presale stage at a token price of $0.003, the next stage four will see a price climb to $0.005. The platform has already raised over $1.1 million via presale phases with 176 million $OZ tokens sold. Its ecosystem includes components such as the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) for real-time data processing, DePIN infrastructure for storage, and customizable Prediction Agents (PAs) for enterprise forecasting. The $OZ token powers the operations of the platform and is employed as transaction fees, for service access, as part of the governance protocol, and as an incentive. Starting at $0.001 and coming off a good presale the token is drawing comparisons to early-stage projects. There are a number of upcoming developments, including exchange listings and the beta release of predictive tools, that should serve as catalysts for growth. According to analysts, what gave the project traction early on was its dual focus on real-world utility and decentralized design. Ozak AI is considered an interesting gateway into this arena of hybrid AI blockchain.

Toncoin and Virtuals Protocol are likely to see growth from AI and event-driven exposure. Quant and NEAR blockchains stand out for their interoperability and cross-chain execution. Crypto analyst Mattie from Altcoin Buzz says the altcoin market may be on the verge of a breakout in June. In a YouTube video , he highlights four tokens that show strong technical fundamentals and upside potential. In the analysis, Mattie points to several on-chain indicators that suggest a market shift is underway. The leading indicator was the declining Bitcoin supply on exchanges, often a precursor to a supply shock. At the same time, Bitcoin dominance is falling, signaling that investor attention may be shifting toward altcoins. He also pointed to Ethereum’s stability despite trading at a 3.8% loss in the past day.

Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), two of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, are already positioning themselves at the forefront. Ethereum, the cornerstone of smart contracts and DeFi, recently rebounded above $2,000 and continues to benefit from ETF inflows and Layer-2 adoption. Meanwhile, Solana, trading around $174, remains one of the best cryptos to invest in thanks to its unmatched speed and low fees, gaining favor among both retail and institutional players. But beyond these giants, attention is also turning toward new crypto coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which could offer exponential upside as the bull market builds. Far higher than average, the project’s support comes from more than 11,500 investors who have contributed $9.4 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see their investment doubled to $0.06 when the token is launched in exchanges. It is expected that MUTM will head the next wave of higher prices. Mutuum Finance into Phase 5 of its Presale. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $9.4 million total sales and attracted more than 11,500 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders can depend on regular income, while borrowers find safe options when they borrow money. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Resilient USD-Pegged Stablecoin Following Certik Audit Completion Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem, charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway to be conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive. ETH and SOL hold strong chances of doing well during the next large bullish period because of their well-tested technology and wide-reaching use. Still, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is unique for offering two lending types and is gaining the interest of investors. Already raising $9.4 million and supported by over 11,500 investors, MUTM now costs $0.03 and will be listed at $0.06, allowing early investors to gain up to 100% if they buy during the presale. Security as well as the possibility of strong growth come together in Mutuum Finance, thanks to a completed audit and the approaching USD-pegged stablecoin. You should take a look at MUTM and think about signing up prior to the next price hike.

This recent sluggishness has called into question the strength of the latest bull rally that saw the market leader climb to a new all-time high last week. According to an investment data platform, the price of BTC might not be done just yet with its bullish run, with the latest on-chain data suggesting room for further upside movement. Is BTC In An Overheated Market Condition Yet? Market analytics firm Alphractal took to the social media platform X to share an exciting on-chain insight into the current setup of the Bitcoin price. According to the blockchain company, the price of BTC sits in an interesting position that could profit only “attentive” investors. Related Reading: This Chart Warns Bitcoin’s Momentum May Be Running Out, Here’s Why The relevant metric here is the Sharpe Ratio, which evaluates the risk-adjusted returns of a specific asset (Bitcoin, in this scenario). This indicator basically measures how much profit an investment offers per unit of risk (considering risk is measured by volatility). A rising Sharpe Ratio typically indicates a higher risk-adjusted performance. On the other hand, when this metric is in a downward trend, it implies that the coin is in a “lower-risk zone” and profits are becoming less significant. As observed in the chart above, the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio (blue line) has not yet reached the upper trendline (red dashed line) — a crucial level that has served as a market peak indicator in the past. The indicator suggests that the flagship is currently in a zone of medium risk, implying that the market is less prone to uncontrolled movements. Alphractal noted: The upper trend line (red dashed line) has functioned as an excellent signal for moments of excessive euphoria in the Bitcoin market. The fact that we haven’t touched this region yet indicates there may be room for additional appreciation in the current cycle. While the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio is still away from the region that signaled the past tops of the 2013, 2017, and 2021 cycles, investors might still want to apply some level of cautious optimism in their market approach. This is especially as the metric’s current values have historically coincided with both optimistic rallies and pessimistic corrections. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above the $104,100 level, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is down by more than 3% in the last seven days.

After a period of anticipation and regulatory hurdles, these investment vehicles are starting to show real traction, highlighted by a notable streak of inflows. What Are US Spot ETH ETF Inflows Telling Us? On May 30, US spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs collectively saw a net inflow of $70.2 million. This figure is significant, not just for its size, but because it marks the tenth consecutive day these ETFs have recorded net positive flows. This sustained interest suggests growing confidence among investors following the recent regulatory steps forward. Looking closer at the data from Farside Investors reveals a fascinating detail: the entirety of the $70.2 million inflow on that specific day was directed towards BlackRock’s ETHA fund. Other approved US spot ETH ETF products reported no change in their holdings for May 30. This points to a strong preference or initial momentum favoring BlackRock’s offering in the nascent market. Let’s look at the recent trend: Date Total Net Inflow (USD) Key Contributor(s) May 21 (Initial Approval Impact) Market Reaction May 22 – May 29 (Various positive net flows) Multiple Funds May 30 $70.2 million BlackRock ETHA May 31 onwards (Continued trends) Monitoring required This table, while simplified, illustrates the shift towards consistent positive movement after the initial regulatory catalyst. The concentration of the May 30 inflow into BlackRock ETHA is a key observation. Why is BlackRock ETHA Dominating These Early ETH ETF Inflows? The focus on BlackRock’s ETHA isn’t entirely surprising. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, commanding immense trust and infrastructure within traditional finance. When they launch a new product, especially in a novel asset class like cryptocurrency, it often attracts significant attention and capital. Several factors might contribute to BlackRock’s early lead in the US spot ETH ETF space: Brand Recognition: Investors, particularly institutional ones, are familiar and comfortable with the BlackRock name. Distribution Channels: BlackRock has extensive networks for distributing financial products. Scale: The sheer size of BlackRock’s operations allows for efficient market making and liquidity provision. First Mover (Effective): While not the only approved fund, BlackRock’s launch timing and market presence give it a strong initial advantage in capturing these early ETH ETF inflows. It’s important to note that the US spot ETH ETF market is still in its infancy. While BlackRock ETHA currently leads, the landscape could change as other funds gain traction and market awareness increases. How Do These ETH ETF Inflows Compare to Bitcoin ETFs? Many observers are comparing the early performance of US spot ETH ETFs to their Bitcoin counterparts, which launched in January 2024. Bitcoin ETFs saw massive inflows immediately after launch, breaking records for ETF debuts. The initial ETH ETF inflows appear more modest than Bitcoin’s explosive start. However, this doesn’t necessarily indicate weaker long-term potential. The market context is different, and regulatory clarity for ETH ETFs arrived differently than for Bitcoin ETFs. The current streak of ten consecutive inflow days for ETH ETFs, even if the daily numbers are smaller than Bitcoin’s peak, is a positive sign of sustained interest. The consistent flow, particularly the concentration in funds like BlackRock ETHA, suggests a deliberate accumulation phase might be underway, potentially driven by investors who waited for the product to become available. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for US Spot ETH ETFs? The introduction and subsequent inflows into US spot ETH ETFs bring several potential benefits: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors can gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements through regulated, familiar investment products without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Institutional Adoption: ETFs facilitate participation from large institutions, potentially bringing significant capital into the Ethereum ecosystem. Price Discovery: Increased trading volume and institutional interest can contribute to more robust and efficient price discovery for ETH. Market Legitimacy: Regulatory approval and successful ETF launches add a layer of legitimacy to Ethereum as an asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. However, challenges remain: Market Volatility: The price of Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile, which will impact the performance of the ETFs. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the ETFs are approved, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. Competition: As the market matures, competition among different ETH ETF providers will intensify. Investor Education: Many traditional investors may still require education about Ethereum and the risks associated with investing in crypto-linked products. Actionable Insight: What Should Investors Watch For? For those tracking the crypto market or considering investment, the performance of US spot ETH ETFs is a key metric. Pay attention to: Sustained Inflows: Are the consecutive days of inflows continuing? This indicates persistent buying pressure. Diversification of Inflows: Do other ETH ETFs besides BlackRock ETHA start seeing significant inflows? This would suggest broader market adoption across different providers. Impact on ETH Price: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained ETF inflows could put upward pressure on Ethereum’s price over time. Trading Volume: High trading volume in the ETFs indicates strong market participation. These US spot ETH ETF inflows are more than just numbers; they represent tangible capital entering the ecosystem through regulated channels. This is a critical step for Ethereum’s integration into traditional finance. Compelling Summary: The Tide is Turning for Ethereum ETFs The $70.2 million net inflow into US spot ETH ETFs on May 30, extending a ten-day positive streak, is a clear signal of growing investor confidence. While BlackRock’s ETHA currently dominates these early flows, the consistent trend across the market indicates increasing acceptance of Ethereum as an investable asset class via familiar ETF structures. Compared to the initial frenzy around Bitcoin ETFs, the ETH ETF inflows appear more measured but potentially represent a steady accumulation by traditional investors. While challenges like market volatility persist, the long-term benefits of increased accessibility and institutional participation are significant. Monitoring these flows will be crucial for understanding the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the Ethereum network.

Pi Network onboarded millions before even launching. Now Coldware ($COLD) is getting the same kind of attention — but with something the others didn’t have: real utility. The presale is live, and early adopters are already talking about what comes next. Coldware ($COLD) is more than a hype project. It offers secure hardware devices, easy DeFi access, and a shot at financial freedom for people who need it most. Some analysts expect a 400% jump this May. Could $COLD outshine the giants? Let’s take a closer look. Shiba Inu Set the Standard for Explosive Community-Led Growth Shiba Inu built early momentum without a presale. Strong community support rivaled even the most polished launches. The ShibArmy pushed SHIB into the spotlight, and now, updates like Shibarium aim to turn it from a meme into a long-term network. At $0.00001439, SHIB stays close to key support. A recent spike in whale activity — over 576 trillion tokens traded in 24 hours — has caught attention on X. One analyst pointed out that this volume shift reflects growing interest among large holders and could fuel a stronger move if momentum builds. With summer usually slow for altcoins, SHIB’s resilience gives buyers a reason to stay alert. Some price models suggest a return to $0.00002800 by Q3. Pi Network Proved That Hype Alone Can Move Millions Pi Network never held a proper presale, yet it pulled in millions with its invite-only app and mobile mining model. Hype carried the project for years, but users now want results. Slow progress and centralisation worries have started to wear on long-time supporters. The price is now at $0.77 after a drop below key levels. Bitcoin still offers some support, but the Pi chart shows weakness. A large withdrawal from OKX and concerns about validator control raised more red flags. Most nodes remain inactive, and many sit in one country. Without stronger fundamentals or clear next steps, Pi may stay range-bound. Still, if BTC holds up, a short-term rebound to $0.79 could play out. Coldware Presale Picks Up Speed as Stage 2 Nears Completion Coldware’s presale shows signs of the same early traction once seen with Shiba Inu and Pi Network. It was recently voted Best Presale of 2025 , and some experts believe $COLD could shift overall market sentiment. Over $3.95 million has already come in, with 66% of tokens from the current round sold. The price now sits at $0.00625, but the next jump to $0.008 is already set. With interest rising fast, this round may close sooner than most expect. What the $COLD Token Actually Does $COLD isn’t a passive coin. It fuels Coldware’s full ecosystem—from security and payments to DeFi tools and real-world access. Users can move money, access smart financial tools, and pay directly through apps or Coldware Devices. The token also powers tokenized assets, which means people can invest in things like energy or digital goods, even without access to banks. Voting rights come built in. That gives every $COLD holder a say in how the system evolves. On top of that, the network moves fast, charges less, and works where many coins can’t. That includes areas without stable banking. So far, over $3.9 million backs this idea. That tells you one thing—people aren’t just watching. They’re getting in before the next price jump. Conclusion Shiba Inu proved that community matters. Pi Network showed how fast a project can grow when the buzz hits. But both had limits—one leaned on hype, the other still waits to deliver. Coldware ($COLD) steps into this space with real tools, real utility, and a presale that moves fast. With $COLD gaining traction and analysts pointing to a possible 400% rise, this could be the next breakout. Timing is key, and for those who missed the early days of SHIB or Pi, this might be the second chance they’ve been waiting for.

BCH recently demonstrated strong technical performance, forming a V-shaped recovery after testing critical support at $391.656, with substantial buying volume establishing a high-volume support level. This comes as the global cryptocurrency market faces headwinds from the ongoing US-China trade disputes, which continue to introduce uncertainty across financial markets worldwide. Meanwhile, traditional financial indicators like rising US Treasury yields signal systemic stress that historically creates mixed environments for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Technical Analysis Highlights BCH tested critical support at $391.656, triggering substantial buying volume particularly during the 01:00-04:00 timeframe. A powerful breakout occurred during the 13:00 hour, with BCH surging to $416.958 on the highest hourly volume (28,068 units). Price established a new resistance-turned-support level at $409.800, with momentum indicators suggesting potential for continued upside. A bull flag pattern formed after the initial impulse move, with decreasing volume during consolidation suggesting potential continuation. The $413.000-$413.500 zone represents a key support level that bulls need to defend to maintain upward momentum. External References "" What’s Happening in Crypto Today?

Expert Analysts Share Their Predictions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-in-bitcoin-in-june-expert-analysts-share-their-predictions/,"Bitcoin enters June with bullish expectations, supported by institutional investor interest and strong ETF inflows. In May, the balance between both macroeconomic uncertainty and crypto adoption was tipped in favor of Bitcoin by blockchain-based institutional moves. BTC closed the month up nearly 10%, posting its second consecutive monthly gain. This performance was largely driven by Bitcoin ETF inflows totaling $5.6 billion and corporate treasuries purchasing Bitcoin. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, the amount of Bitcoin held by public companies increased by 4% in May, reaching a total of $85.6 billion. This trend is expected to continue in June. Experts say that uncertainties, especially regarding customs duties brought back to the agenda by US President Donald Trump, may pose a short-term risk for Bitcoin, but this situation may increase interest in cryptocurrencies in the long term. “The ability to make sudden policy changes on things like customs duties makes short-term pricing very difficult,” said Chris Rhine, head of liquid assets strategies at Galaxy Digital. Rhine also said that such uncertainties could cause a slowdown in economic activity, which could increase the likelihood of monetary support such as rate cuts. In May, Bitcoin’s tendency to diverge from stocks also drew attention. It was observed that Bitcoin gained value both in periods when risk appetite increased and in times when the search for safe havens in the markets came to the fore. 21Shares USA President Federico Brokate stated that “The macro situation is still very important” and that whether this divergence is sustainable will be more clearly understood in June. Related News: SEC's Crypto Task Force Chair Hester Peirce Delivers Definitive Take on TRUMP and All Memecoins Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,999 on May 22 before falling to $104,000 amid Trump’s comments about a trade war with China. The president has taken to social media to suggest that China is violating the existing trade agreement. This development comes on the heels of an interview in which Treasury Secretary Bessent said that U.S.-China trade talks are “a little stuck.” Investors are closely monitoring not only price movements but also regulatory regulations. The “GENIUS” Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins), which advanced to the Senate on May 19, could be put to a vote in early June. Whether or not the law passes is seen as an important indicator of sentiment for Bitcoin investors. On the other hand, Wells Fargo stated that a separate stablecoin regulatory bill in the House of Representatives points to a difficult process. On the technical analysis side, it is estimated that the bulls will continue to control in June. Tracy Jin, COO of the MEXC exchange, stated that the $ 109,000 resistance level will be defended against pressures from hedge funds' put options, and if this resistance is broken, the $ 113,000 – $ 115,000 range can be tested. According to Jin, if this region is also overcome, Bitcoin is likely to rise to $ 130,000. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What to Expect in Bitcoin in June?

A newly created Anonymous wallet has made a massive withdrawal of TRUMP token from the Binance exchange, totaling an eye-watering $4.53 million. This isn’t just any everyday transaction; it’s a Large crypto transaction that immediately sparks questions about who is behind the wallet and what their intentions might be. What Exactly Happened? Unpacking the Binance Withdrawal The details of this intriguing movement were first brought to light by the on-chain analytics platform, Onchain Lens. According to their report shared on X (formerly Twitter), the withdrawal of the TRUMP token occurred in quick succession. Within a short timeframe, the wallet executed three separate transactions. These transactions collectively moved 425,764 TRUMP tokens out of Binance. Based on the market price at the time, this amounts to approximately $4.53 million USD. But the activity wasn’t limited solely to Binance or the TRUMP token . Prior to the substantial Binance withdrawal , the same Anonymous wallet was also active on other exchanges. It withdrew 3,256 SOL tokens, valued at around $499,000, from platforms including OKX. This suggests a broader strategy involving multiple assets and exchanges by this unidentified entity. Why Does a Large Crypto Transaction Matter? In the world of cryptocurrencies, tracking large movements of digital assets is a crucial part of Crypto market analysis . These transactions, often made by individuals or entities known as ‘whales,’ can potentially signal upcoming market shifts, changes in sentiment, or strategic positioning. A Large crypto transaction like the one involving the TRUMP token from Binance raises several points of interest: Potential Market Impact: Moving such a large volume of a specific token off an exchange can reduce the available supply on that platform, potentially impacting liquidity and price dynamics, especially if the intention is to hold or move it to cold storage. Conversely, if the funds are moved to another venue for selling, it could indicate potential selling pressure. Identity Speculation: The anonymity of the wallet fuels speculation. Is it a high-net-worth individual? An institution? Someone closely associated with the token or political figure it represents? The mystery adds to the intrigue. Strategic Positioning: Why withdraw now? Is it a reaction to recent market events? A planned move ahead of anticipated news or volatility related to the TRUMP token or broader political landscape? The Nature of the Anonymous Wallet The term Anonymous wallet is common in crypto, though it’s more accurate to say ‘pseudonymous’. While the wallet address is public and its transactions trackable on the blockchain (thanks to tools like Onchain Lens), the real-world identity of the owner remains unknown unless they voluntarily reveal it or link it to an identified service. The use of a newly created wallet for such significant transactions is noteworthy. It could be a measure taken specifically for this large move to avoid associating it with existing, potentially identifiable, addresses. This highlights both the privacy features of crypto and the challenges they pose for full transparency. Focusing on the TRUMP Token The TRUMP token is part of a growing category of politically themed memecoins. Its value and popularity are often closely tied to political events, statements, and the overall political climate surrounding Donald Trump. As such, it can be highly volatile and susceptible to sudden price swings based on news cycles. A Binance withdrawal of this magnitude involving a token like TRUMP is particularly interesting because it intersects financial movement with political speculation. Is this wallet connected to the political campaign? A supporter? An investor betting on political outcomes? Without further information, it remains speculative, but the sheer size of the withdrawal makes it a key data point for anyone conducting Crypto market analysis on politically themed assets. Actionable Insights and What to Watch For While the identity and motive behind this Large crypto transaction remain unknown, market participants can derive some actionable insights: Monitor the Wallet: Keep an eye on the activity of this specific Anonymous wallet . Will the withdrawn funds sit idle? Will they be moved again? To another exchange, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, or cold storage? Future movements could provide clues. Observe Market Reaction: How does the market for the TRUMP token react to this news? Does it cause price volatility? Increased trading volume? Contextualize with News: Correlate the timing of this Binance withdrawal with any recent news or developments related to Donald Trump or the broader political landscape. Deepen On-Chain Analysis: This event underscores the value of on-chain analytics platforms like Onchain Lens for gaining visibility into significant market movements that aren’t immediately obvious from exchange order books alone. Understanding the flow of assets off exchanges is a critical component of effective Crypto market analysis , helping investors and traders gauge potential supply shifts and whale behavior. Challenges in Interpreting Anonymous Wallet Activity Despite the transparency of the blockchain ledger itself, interpreting the meaning behind an Anonymous wallet ‘s actions comes with inherent challenges: Lack of Motive Clarity: The blockchain shows *what* happened (funds moved) but not *why*. Was it for security, diversification, preparation for selling, or something else entirely? Identity Concealment: Unless the owner chooses to reveal themselves or the funds are moved to a known entity, the ‘who’ remains a mystery. Potential for Misinterpretation: A large withdrawal might be interpreted as preparation to sell, but it could equally be a move to secure assets in cold storage or prepare for participation in a decentralized application. Conclusion: A Mysterious Move in the TRUMP Token Market The withdrawal of $4.53 million in TRUMP token from Binance by a newly created Anonymous wallet , coupled with significant SOL withdrawals from other platforms, represents a notable Large crypto transaction that warrants close observation. While the identity and intentions of the wallet owner remain shrouded in mystery, this event highlights the power of on-chain data in providing insights into significant market movements and the behavior of large holders. For those engaged in Crypto market analysis , this transaction serves as a reminder of the potential impact that whale activity can have, particularly on niche or politically sensitive assets like the TRUMP token . As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, tracking these large, anonymous flows will remain a critical tool for understanding market dynamics.

Developers are flocking to these platforms, hinting at potential future surges. Could these coins spearhead the AI-driven DeFi movement? This article delves into their recent growth and what it could mean for their values, sparking curiosity among investors. Render Price Analysis: Past Trends and Key Levels Today Over the last month, RENDER experienced a clear decline, with a 16.25% drop that contrasts with its behavior over the past six months, during which it fell by 57.23%. The one-week change showed a nearly 20% drop, highlighting short-term weakness. The trading range settled between about $3.06 and $5.33, indicating consistent downward pressure. Historical performance suggests a largely bearish trend, with significant losses accumulating over the six-month period. The recent weeks have shown a steep decline from previously stronger levels. Currently, RENDER hovers within a defined price channel with key levels in focus. Immediate resistance stands at roughly $6.18, while a second barrier appears around $8.45. On the downside, consider $1.65 as a strong support level. Technical signals, with a low relative strength index around 34 and negative momentum, suggest that bears maintain control. Price continues to trade sideways without a clear long-term trend. Trading ideas include waiting for a bounce near support for potential long entries or considering shorts near resistance if the price fails to break higher. Chainlink Price Trends: Monthly Shifts and Key Levels Examined Chainlink experienced a modest decline over the past month with a price drop of about 4.95% and a sharper fall of approximately 28.30% over the last six months. Weekly fluctuations also revealed a drop of nearly 12.50%, pointing to increased volatility. The trading range for Chainlink has oscillated between approximately $11.15 and $16.41, showing that despite temporary recoveries, sellers have maintained influence over the coin’s longer-term performance. The current price situation places Chainlink in a challenging zone with nearest support at $8.01 and resistance at $18.52, while more distant levels lie at $2.75 for support and $23.77 for resistance. Bears currently maintain control, as technical measures like a 36.36 RSI signal further downward pressure. Traders might consider short positions if the price falls below the immediate support, or look to enter long positions should a strong breakout occur above the $18.52 resistance. Conclusion Recent trends highlight increasing developer interest in RENDER and LINK . As these projects see more engagement, the possibility of RENDER reaching $8 and LINK hitting $40 grows stronger. This development fuels optimism in the AI-powered DeFi sector. The momentum these coins are gaining may drive broader adoption and innovation in the space. With the rising traction among developers, both RENDER and LINK stand poised to play significant roles in the evolving DeFi ecosystem.

That’s exactly the potential future outlined by a former executive, suggesting that Coinbase , the leading US crypto exchange, should acquire Circle , the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, USDC . This bold proposition, shared by Ryan Y Yi, formerly of Coinbase Ventures, highlights the increasing importance of USDC to Coinbase’s bottom line and the strategic advantages of gaining full control over the stablecoin protocol. Why USDC is Becoming Indispensable for Coinbase According to Yi, the rationale for a Coinbase acquisition of Circle is simple yet powerful: capitalize fully on the growing significance of USDC . USDC, a popular dollar-pegged stablecoin, has seen its circulation share on Coinbase’s platform increase dramatically. By Q1 2025, Coinbase was reportedly holding around 23% of the total USDC supply. This surge in adoption on the exchange has propelled USDC to become Coinbase’s second-largest revenue driver. The stablecoin’s utility extends across various functions within the Coinbase ecosystem, from trading pairs to facilitating transfers and potentially powering future decentralized applications on networks like Base. Its deep integration makes it a critical asset for Coinbase’s operations and growth strategy. Understanding the Current Revenue Split Holding Coinbase Back Despite playing a leading role in driving USDC adoption and holding a significant portion of the stablecoin supply, Coinbase doesn’t capture the full revenue potential. The current setup involves a revenue-sharing agreement with Circle . While Coinbase earns full reserve income on USDC held directly on its platform, the income generated from off-platform USDC is split 50/50 with Circle. This is notable because, as Yi points out, Coinbase holds substantially more USDC than Circle. This 50/50 split on off-platform revenue, combined with a lack of protocol-level control, limits Coinbase’s ability to innovate and scale certain products. For instance, integrating USDC more deeply or strategically into consumer wallets, developer tools, or new blockchain initiatives (like Base) might be constrained by this shared control and revenue model. A full crypto acquisition would remove these limitations. The Strategic Benefits of a Coinbase Acquisition of Circle Acquiring Circle would unlock several key strategic advantages for Coinbase , according to the former exec’s analysis: Full Revenue Capture: Coinbase would gain complete control over all revenue streams generated by USDC, including reserve income from the entire supply, not just the portion on its platform. Protocol Governance: Owning Circle would give Coinbase direct governance over the USDC protocol. This means having a decisive say in its development, upgrades, and strategic direction. Multichain Integration Control: Coinbase could fully dictate and optimize USDC’s integration across various blockchain networks, crucial for its multichain strategy and products like Coinbase Wallet and the Base network. Enhanced Product Flexibility: With full control, Coinbase could more seamlessly integrate USDC into its existing and future products, potentially creating more compelling offerings for users and developers. Dominance in the Stablecoin Market: A Coinbase acquisition of Circle would position Coinbase as a dominant force not just in crypto trading but also in the foundational layer of the crypto economy – stablecoins. This move would transform Coinbase from a major distributor and holder of USDC into its owner and primary steward, fundamentally altering its position in the market. Is a Crypto Acquisition Between Coinbase and Circle ‘Inevitable’? Ryan Y Yi believes that a Coinbase acquisition of Circle is not just strategically sound but potentially inevitable. He suggests that both companies likely understand the significant long-term value and synergies that such a merger would create, even if specific deal terms haven’t been publicly discussed or agreed upon yet. However, it’s important to note the other side of the story. Recent rumors circulating about Circle being in acquisition talks, including with Coinbase and Ripple, were explicitly denied by Circle. Circle publicly stated that these rumors were baseless. This indicates that while the strategic logic might be compelling from an external perspective (like Yi’s), internal discussions or public stances from the companies might differ significantly at this time. The path to any major crypto acquisition is complex, involving regulatory considerations, valuation challenges, and aligning corporate cultures and visions. While the strategic case for Coinbase acquiring Circle to solidify its position with the USDC stablecoin is strong, the timeline and likelihood remain subjects of speculation, despite the former executive’s conviction. Conclusion: A Strategic Vision for Stablecoin Dominance The proposition that Coinbase should acquire Circle highlights a fascinating potential future for the crypto giants and the USDC stablecoin . As USDC continues its trajectory as a vital asset within the crypto ecosystem, gaining full control over its revenue, governance, and strategic integration presents a compelling opportunity for Coinbase. While the companies themselves deny current acquisition talks, the strategic logic articulated by a former insider underscores the potential long-term benefits. Whether this vision becomes reality remains to be seen, but it certainly sparks important conversations about the future consolidation and control within the rapidly evolving crypto market.

Here’s the Timeline",https://timestabloid.com/cardano-creator-predicts-500000-bitcoin-price-heres-the-timeline/,"In a compelling video clip shared by Angry Crypto Show on X, Charles Hoskinson , the creator of Cardano and one of the most influential figures in the cryptocurrency space, laid out an astonishing long-term prediction for Bitcoin. According to Hoskinson, the world’s largest cryptocurrency could soar to a price between $250,000 and $500,000, potentially transforming into a $10 trillion ecosystem comparable to gold. This bold forecast underscores not only Hoskinson’s enduring belief in Bitcoin’s resilience but also his broader perspective on the maturing crypto landscape. Hoskinson’s Long-Term Bitcoin Vision Speaking candidly, Hoskinson emphasized that Bitcoin’s trajectory remains firmly upward despite the many cycles of volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and technological challenges the asset has faced over the years. JUST IN: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says ""over the next few years, Bitcoin's probably going to grow to $250,000 to $500,000. It's going to be a $10T ecosystem at some point, comparable with gold."" pic.twitter.com/KMWe6Ef7ig — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) May 30, 2025 He projects that “over the next few years,” Bitcoin’s value could surge into the quarter-million to half-million dollar range, effectively placing it in the same league as gold in terms of total market capitalization. For context, gold’s market cap currently hovers around $15 trillion, but Hoskinson’s more conservative estimate places Bitcoin reaching a $10 trillion valuation, making it a major global store of value. This is not the first time prominent voices in crypto have drawn parallels between Bitcoin and gold, but what makes Hoskinson’s take stand out is his measured yet confident timeline. Rather than making an explosive short-term prediction tied to hype or speculation, Hoskinson situates Bitcoin’s potential within a multi-year horizon, reflecting his deep understanding of macroeconomic forces, institutional adoption, and the evolution of blockchain technology. Factors Driving the Prediction Hoskinson’s bullish outlook is not built on hype alone. Bitcoin has seen increased institutional acceptance in recent years, highlighted by the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, the entry of major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity, and rising demand from both retail and sovereign actors seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. Meanwhile, macroeconomic pressures such as inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, and concerns over fiat currency debasement have positioned Bitcoin as a modern hedge, a digital version of gold in the eyes of many investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Importantly, Hoskinson’s view resonates with ongoing debates in the crypto community about Bitcoin’s utility beyond speculative trading. As layer-two solutions like the Lightning Network continue to mature, and as Bitcoin’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi) gradually expands, its long-term value proposition strengthens. Hoskinson has always acknowledged Bitcoin’s unique role as the pioneer of the space and its unmatched reputation as a secure, censorship-resistant asset. Community Reactions and Market Implications The video clip has sparked widespread discussion on X. While some skeptics argue that Bitcoin still faces scalability limitations, others see Hoskinson’s forecast as realistic given the accelerating pace of institutional integration and the increasing narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold.” If Bitcoin were to hit the $500,000 mark, it would represent a seismic shift in the global financial landscape, challenging traditional asset classes and reshaping how wealth is stored and transferred. Such a surge would also ripple through the broader crypto ecosystem, potentially catalyzing further development, investment, and innovation across altcoins, decentralized platforms, and blockchain-based financial systems. While no one can predict the future with certainty, Charles Hoskinson’s forecast provides a visionary perspective rooted in years of experience and a profound understanding of both technological and financial trends.

45337607,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738513,1748714186,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45337607.jpeg,Wall Street is dumping stocks of companies like Trump Media and GameStop,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-saylors-bitcoin-strategy/,"Michael Saylor’s all-in Bitcoin plan turned Strategy into a market beast. The company’s value exploded past $80 billion. They’ve stacked more than $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Yet somehow, Wall Street is still side-eyeing anyone else who tries to do the same thing. This week alone, a wave of firms announced new Bitcoin treasury plays. Trump Media said it’s raising $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin. GameStop followed with a $500 million Bitcoin push. And a new player, Twenty One, backed by Tether, SoftBank, and Strike’s Jack Mallers, launched with a plan to hold 42,000 Bitcoin from day one. That would make it the third-largest corporate holder globally. Market reacts fast, and not in a good way Wall Street’s reaction? Brutal. Trump Media stock dropped more than 20% after its announcement. GameStop fell 17%. Investors clearly weren’t convinced. Meanwhile, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) just keeps ripping higher. Since late 2022, its stock has jumped 26x. It’s become the blueprint for corporate Bitcoin stacking. But it seems the market isn’t treating copycats the same. “Maybe the market wanted them to buy more bitcoin,” Saylor said in Las Vegas during Bitcoin 2025. “But these are short-term dynamics. Over the long term, bitcoin on the balance sheet has proven to be extraordinarily popular.” He shared his views on Trump Media too, calling their move “courageous, aggressive, and intelligent.” He said we’re seeing a real change in how companies approach money itself. “There’s an explosion of interest right now,” he said. “Everywhere I go at this conference, someone says, I’m working on a bitcoin treasury company in Hong Kong. I’ve got a thing going in Abu Dhabi. There’s one starting in Korea. Another one in the U.K. We’re going to do this in the Middle East.” He’s convinced Bitcoin has gone global. According to him, ambassadors are now “planting the orange flag everywhere on Earth.” Trump pushes government into Bitcoin It’s not just companies jumping in. The US government is now in on it too. In March, President Trump signed an executive order creating a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Federal agencies were told to treat Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. The kicker? The entire reserve will be funded with Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil cases. White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks said the move was designed to avoid adding to the budget. The reserve is also locked—it can’t be sold off. The order includes a full audit of the government’s current crypto stash. It’s reportedly more than 200,000 Bitcoin. That alone would make Uncle Sam one of the largest holders on the planet. The change in tone from the White House is clear. Under Biden, Bitcoin was mostly treated like a risk. Under Trump, it’s become a sovereign asset. Vice President JD Vance made history this week too. He became the first US VP to speak directly to the Bitcoin community. He called crypto a shield against inflation, censorship, and unelected bureaucrats. Even the Department of Labor reversed course. It pulled back old rules that had blocked Bitcoin from retirement accounts. “No force on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come,” Saylor said. “Bitcoin is digital capital and maybe the most explosive idea of the era.” Big companies still hesitate Still, many big players aren’t on board. Take Microsoft. Last year, shareholders shot down a proposal to follow Saylor’s lead. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave,” he told them in a video pitch. He also said the lukewarm reaction to Trump Media and GameStop wasn’t just about Bitcoin. He pointed to the financing. GameStop’s stock soared 50% when it first teased the idea. Volume went up 10x. Then, it raised $1.5 billion through convertible bonds. Trump Media did the same thing; raised capital through a big bond deal. According to Saylor, these kinds of moves create pressure in the short term but help in the long term. He says they’re just getting started. “We’ll keep buying bitcoin,” Saylor told CNBC. “We expect the price of bitcoin will keep going up. We think it will get exponentially harder to buy bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy bitcoin.” For people worried about big institutions ruining Bitcoin’s decentralization, he says relax. “The network is very anti-fragile, and there’s a balance of power here,” he said. “The more actors that come into the ecosystem, the more diverse, the more distributed the protocol is, the more incorruptible it becomes, the more robust it becomes. That means the more trustworthy it becomes to larger economic actors who otherwise would be afraid to put all of their economic weight on the network.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|Bitcoin|Tether|Trump Media,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 17:56:26

That’s where platforms like Binance Alpha come into play. Recently, Binance announced via an X post that Taiko (TAIKO), a promising early stage crypto project, has been added to this curated platform within the Binance Wallet. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter? Binance Alpha is not a trading platform itself, but rather a discovery zone nestled within the broader Binance ecosystem, specifically accessible through the Binance Wallet . Its core purpose is to shine a spotlight on emerging and early stage crypto projects that show significant potential based on factors like community engagement and market trends. Think of it as a showcase – a curated list designed to introduce Binance users to innovative projects before they potentially gain wider recognition. This is particularly valuable in the fast-paced crypto landscape where staying ahead of the curve can offer unique opportunities. By featuring projects on Binance Alpha, Binance provides visibility to these nascent protocols and offers users a convenient way to learn about them without leaving the familiar environment of their wallet. Meet Taiko: The Latest Early Stage Crypto Project on Alpha The newest addition to the Binance Alpha lineup is Taiko (TAIKO). While the announcement itself was brief, Taiko is known in the crypto space as a Type 1 ZK-EVM – essentially, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum designed to be highly compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure and tooling. This technical approach aims to help Ethereum scale while maintaining strong security guarantees. Taiko has generated considerable buzz within the developer community and among Ethereum enthusiasts, which likely contributed to its selection for Binance Alpha. The platform’s focus on community engagement and market trends means that projects with active communities and promising early traction are more likely to be featured. Taiko’s presence on Alpha suggests it met these criteria in the eyes of Binance’s selection process. What Does Being Featured on Binance Alpha Mean for Taiko and You? For Taiko, being featured on Binance Alpha is a significant milestone. It provides invaluable exposure to millions of users within the Binance ecosystem. This visibility can lead to increased awareness, potential user adoption, and further community growth. It’s an endorsement of the project’s potential, even if it’s not a direct financial investment or a guarantee of future support. For users, the inclusion of Taiko crypto on Binance Alpha presents an opportunity to discover and research a potentially impactful project early in its lifecycle. It serves as a signal that this project has caught the attention of analysts monitoring the market for emerging trends. Accessing this information within the Binance Wallet simplifies the discovery process for users already active on the platform. Key Benefits: Discovery: Find out about promising early stage crypto projects. Convenience: Access information directly within your Binance Wallet. Early Insight: Gain potential exposure to projects before they become widely known. Validation (Partial): Inclusion suggests the project has met certain community and trend criteria. Navigating Early Crypto Opportunities: Risks and Actionable Insights While being featured on Binance Alpha is positive news for Taiko, it is absolutely crucial to understand what it does not mean. As stated in the original announcement, inclusion on Binance Alpha does not guarantee a future crypto listing on the main Binance exchange. This distinction is vital. A main exchange listing involves a much more rigorous due diligence process and signifies a higher level of endorsement for trading purposes. Binance Alpha is purely for showcasing and discovery. Investing in early stage crypto projects carries significant risks. These projects are often unproven, highly volatile, and may fail. Users should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough Due Diligence (DYOR) before considering any interaction with or investment in featured projects like Taiko crypto. Actionable Insights for Users: Do Your Own Research: Investigate Taiko’s technology, team, roadmap, and community beyond its presence on Binance Alpha. Understand the Risk: Be aware that early-stage projects are speculative and carry high risk. Binance Alpha is NOT a Listing Guarantee: Do not assume Taiko will be listed on the main Binance exchange based on this feature. Use Binance Wallet Features: Explore how Binance Wallet presents information about featured projects on Alpha. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from both Binance and Taiko. Beyond Binance Alpha: What’s Next for Taiko? While the Binance Alpha feature provides a valuable spotlight, Taiko’s future trajectory depends on its continued development, successful implementation of its technology, growth of its ecosystem, and overall market conditions. The feature is a stepping stone, not the destination. Projects featured on Alpha hope to build momentum that might, in the future, make them candidates for a full crypto listing on major exchanges, including Binance. However, this is a competitive process with no certainty. Using Binance Wallet to Explore Early Projects For those interested in discovering early stage crypto projects, the Binance Wallet serves as the gateway to the Binance Alpha platform. Users can typically find the Alpha section within the wallet interface, allowing them to browse the currently featured projects and access any information Binance provides about them. This integration makes it convenient for existing Binance users to explore these opportunities. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Future Potential The inclusion of Taiko on Binance Alpha is an exciting development, highlighting Binance’s effort to curate and showcase promising early stage crypto projects within its ecosystem. It offers users a valuable opportunity to discover projects like Taiko crypto and learn about their potential. However, it is paramount for users to approach this information with caution, conduct independent research, and remember that inclusion on Alpha is distinct from a full crypto listing on the main exchange. It’s a chance to look into the future of crypto, but one that requires careful consideration and risk awareness.

Pepe ( PEPE ) dropped to a low of $0.00001096, down by 32% from its highest point this year. On the positive side, the supply of Pepe coins on exchanges has crashed to 105.33 trillion, its lowest level since 2022. It has also fallen from last year’s high of 215 trillion, a sign that holders are not selling their coins. Nansen data shows that the number of Pepe coins whales hold has increased this month. These investors now hold 9.71 trillion coins, a 2.74% increase from April. Accounts labeled as smart money have also continued to accumulate Pepe this month. Their holdings jumped to 625 billion, a 145% month-on-month increase.

On the other hand, savvy money investors are those that Nansen has determined have a long track record of success. Smart money holdings of Pepe | Source: Nansen Another bullish case for Pepe is that its positive funding rate has been rising since May 8. A positive funding rate is a sign that investors believe a coin’s future price will be higher than the spot rate. Pepe coin price analysis Pepe price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Pepe price peaked at $0.00001625 in May and then pared back some of these gains to $0.00001095. Its weekly low was notable since it aligned with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average and the highest swing in September last year. Pepe moved below the lower side of the bullish flag pattern, while the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have pointed downwards. Therefore, technicals point to more downside, potentially to the 78.6% retracement level at $0.00001057, and then it will bounce back as bulls target the 50% point at $0.000017.

45337973,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164832,1748715023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45337973.jpeg,Crypto Market Drop: US-China Tensions Trigger Shock Plunge,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-market-drop-tensions/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Market Drop: US-China Tensions Trigger Shock Plunge The cryptocurrency world recently experienced a significant jolt, marked by a substantial crypto market drop . Over just two days, the total value of the market shed approximately $200 billion. This sharp downturn brought the market capitalization down to around $3.36 trillion, according to data highlighted by CryptoPotato, sourced from CoinGecko. What triggered this sudden shift? Many observers are pointing towards escalating geopolitical tensions, specifically between the United States and China. Why the Bitcoin Price Drop Matters At the heart of this market movement was a notable bitcoin price drop . The flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, saw its value dip significantly. After recently trading near a peak of $112,000, Bitcoin plunged to a multi-week low, settling just above the $103,000 mark. This move isn’t just about Bitcoin; its performance often sets the tone for the entire market. When Bitcoin sees a significant price drop, altcoins typically follow suit, amplifying the overall market’s decline. Understanding the factors behind Bitcoin’s dip is crucial for grasping the broader market dynamics at play. The initial signs of this downturn appeared after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed new tariffs targeting the European Union. However, the situation intensified considerably when President Trump publicly accused China of violating existing trade agreements. This accusation significantly heightened already simmering US-China tensions crypto investors and analysts were watching closely. How US-China Tensions Impact Crypto It might seem counterintuitive that geopolitical disputes between major global powers would directly affect digital assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, the link is becoming increasingly clear. US-China tensions crypto markets react to stem from several factors: Risk-Off Sentiment: When global political or economic uncertainty rises, investors often move away from assets perceived as higher risk, including cryptocurrencies, and seek safety in traditional assets like gold or certain government bonds. Economic Impact: Trade disputes and escalating tensions can negatively impact global economic forecasts, reducing investor confidence and appetite for speculative assets. Currency and Capital Flows: Geopolitical events can influence currency valuations and international capital movements, indirectly affecting how investors view and allocate funds into crypto. The market’s sensitivity to these geopolitical shifts underscores the growing interconnectedness between traditional global affairs and the nascent crypto ecosystem. This particular episode serves as a stark reminder that external macro factors can significantly influence market volatility in the digital asset space. Staying Informed with Cryptocurrency News For anyone involved in the digital asset space, keeping up with reliable cryptocurrency news is essential, especially during periods of heightened uncertainty. Rapid market movements like the recent $200 billion drop highlight the importance of timely information. Understanding the news allows investors to potentially anticipate trends, understand the forces driving price changes, and make more informed decisions. Here are some key takeaways from this event for those following cryptocurrency news : Geopolitical events, not just crypto-specific developments, can be major market movers. Bitcoin’s price action remains a critical indicator for the broader market health. Sudden, significant drops are a reality of the crypto market. This event isn’t just a headline about price; it’s a case study in how global politics can ripple through financial markets, including the digital ones we care about. Navigating Market Volatility The recent plunge serves as a clear example of the inherent market volatility in cryptocurrencies. While volatility can present opportunities, it also carries significant risks. For investors, understanding and preparing for volatility is crucial. Challenges: Sudden, rapid price swings can lead to significant losses. Predicting the impact of external events like geopolitical tensions is difficult. Emotional reactions to sharp drops can lead to poor investment decisions (e.g., panic selling). Actionable Insights: Diversification: Don’t put all your capital into one asset. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, to average out your entry cost. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders if you are actively trading. Stay Informed: Follow reliable cryptocurrency news and analysis. Long-Term Perspective: Consider your investment goals and time horizon. Short-term volatility might be less concerning for long-term holders. While the recent crypto market drop was sharp, such events are not uncommon in this space. Learning from them is part of navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of digital assets. Summary In summary, the cryptocurrency market recently experienced a significant $200 billion downturn, largely attributed to escalating US-China tensions. This geopolitical friction triggered a sharp bitcoin price drop and highlighted the market’s sensitivity to global events. Staying updated with reliable cryptocurrency news is vital for understanding these dynamics and navigating the inherent market volatility . While challenges exist, adopting strategies like diversification and maintaining a long-term perspective can help investors better manage the risks associated with sudden market movements driven by external factors like US-China tensions crypto markets are increasingly reacting to.

Established names like Aave, Uniswap, and Shiba Inu continue to evolve through innovation and community initiatives. However, a new project is generating intense excitement for its technological edge and strategic rollout, BlockDAG. With over $278 million raised and a projected ROI exceeding 2,500%, BlockDAG is becoming one of the top crypto coins 2025 investors are watching closely. Whether you’re seeking DeFi value, meme coin momentum, or next-gen blockchain infrastructure, understanding how these assets compare can give you a serious edge. This breakdown covers the latest updates for AAVE, UNI, and SHIB, and spotlights why BlockDAG’s mix of innovation, accessibility, and early pricing power could place it firmly among the top crypto coins of 2025. BlockDAG: The Future Leader Among Top Crypto Coins 2025 BlockDAG is breaking all the rules of a typical crypto presale, and setting new records while doing it. With over $278 million raised, more than 21.7 billion BDAG coins sold, and a community exceeding 170,000 holders, it’s clear this isn’t just another speculative launch. The current presale price of $0.0018 is frozen until June 13, even though Batch 28 pricing is officially $0.0262. And with a confirmed launch price of $0.05, early buyers could see returns of up to 2,520%, if not more. Beyond the numbers, BlockDAG’s real strength lies in its foundation. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work model supports high-speed, scalable blockchain activity with the added bonus of full EVM compatibility. This means developers can deploy Ethereum dApps without switching ecosystems or enduring high gas fees. It’s a major reason why BlockDAG is now mentioned among the top crypto coins 2025. Already, five exchanges, MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com, are on board, with 15 more to be revealed at the June 13 GO LIVE event. With its no-code dApp builder and upcoming miner rollout, BlockDAG isn’t just promising, it’s delivering. For investors eyeing long-term upside, this presale may be the most strategic entry point of the year. Aave (AAVE): Growth Fuelled by DeFi Expansion Aave (AAVE) remains one of the top crypto coins 2025 analysts are bullish on. Trading at around $270.41, AAVE has seen steady gains with projections pointing to an average price of $311.25 this month and up to $380 by year’s end. Aave’s DeFi borrowing and lending protocols continue to expand across chains, reinforcing its role as a foundational player in decentralized finance. As institutional interest grows in lending-based applications, AAVE’s ability to evolve with multi-chain support and governance updates keeps it competitive. Investors looking for long-term DeFi exposure may find Aave’s fundamentals appealing heading into late 2025. Uniswap (UNI): Resilient Leader in Decentralized Trading Uniswap (UNI), currently priced at $6.89, continues to lead among decentralized exchanges. Despite minor fluctuations, its reputation and growing liquidity ecosystem keep it stable. Price predictions for 2025 range between $6.49 and $12.10, depending on market strength. What keeps UNI among the top crypto coins 2025 is its commitment to improving AMM technology and integrating Layer 2 solutions. While it might not deliver massive short-term spikes, UNI remains a reliable bet for those seeking exposure to core DeFi infrastructure with proven traction and a large user base. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Community Power With Deflationary Mechanics Shiba Inu (SHIB) may have started as a meme, but its evolution has secured it a spot among the top crypto coins 2025. Trading at $0.00001437, SHIB continues to attract attention through community-led initiatives like token burns and ecosystem development. While short-term projections are mixed, ranging from $0.0000156 to $0.00002042, its long-term growth depends on ongoing support and new use cases. As SHIB builds out its metaverse and DEX components, investors remain optimistic about its upside, especially if broader market sentiment turns bullish. Top Coins For June From DeFi giants like Aave and Uniswap to meme-fueled SHIB, the crypto landscape in 2025 is brimming with opportunity. But no project is turning heads quite like BlockDAG. With its massive $278 million presale, locked-in $0.0018 price, and a confirmed listing at $0.05, BDAG offers a window of entry that may never be repeated. Its unique mix of scalability, EVM compatibility, developer tools, and exchange support puts it on a clear path to becoming one of the top crypto coins 2025 . The upcoming June 13 exchange reveal is expected to spark another wave of momentum, positioning BlockDAG not just as a high-ROI play, but as a long-term ecosystem contender. Whether you’re diversifying across blue chips or chasing early-stage winners, BlockDAG’s fundamentals and timing are hard to ignore. Get in while the price is still frozen, because the next phase may come fast. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

The TRUMP coin price is back in the spotlight after a high-profile dinner helped fuel a 16% rally, pushing the token to around $14.70. The event brought attention, but concerns remain. Over 80% of the supply is controlled by a Trump-linked firm, raising serious questions about long-term transparency and sustainability. In contrast, Binance Coin continues to show strength based on actual usage. The BNB price is rising alongside record-breaking ecosystem activity, including more than 8 million daily transactions and over 2 million active wallets. Still, another project is taking a different path entirely. Unstaked ($UNSD) is not chasing headlines, it is building tools that work. With AI agents designed to automate engagement across Telegram, Discord, and X, priced at just $0.01043 in stage 17, Unstaked is proving that real value comes from solving real problems. Trump Coin Gains Traction Following High-Profile Event Trump Coin has surged over 16% to around $14.70, driven by renewed attention after a private dinner hosted by Donald Trump. The event rewarded the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token, with the top 25 receiving a personal White House tour. This exclusive gathering has helped reignite buzz around the coin, which previously dropped from its January high of $75.35. The token now commands a market cap of roughly $2.9 billion. However, caution remains as 80% of its supply is controlled by Fight Fight Fight LLC, closely tied to the Trump Organization. While interest is growing again, concerns about centralized supply and long-term sustainability persist. BNB Climbs as Binance Chain Activity Breaks Records BNB has jumped over 5%, trading close to $683, as the Binance ecosystem records a notable rise in user activity. With daily transactions now above 8 million and more than 2 million active wallet addresses, the uptick signals strengthening adoption across DeFi apps and new project launches. Support remains firm near $682, and recent volume surges point to sustained bullish momentum. Although resistance looms near $684, the broader outlook appears optimistic. With Bitcoin trending higher and Binance’s infrastructure continuing to evolve, BNB is gaining attention as a platform-driven asset with real long-term growth potential. Unstaked Turns Memes, Data, and AI into Nonstop Brand Growth Unstaked is designed for the pace of crypto culture, where timing, relevance, and online presence can make or break a project. Following Unstaked’s launch, the platform will let users launch AI agents that not only schedule posts but also join conversations, ride trends, and engage with audiences across Telegram, X, and Discord without missing a beat. These agents speak the internet fluently. From reacting to memes to tagging influencers in real time, they are tuned to keep your brand visible and relatable. Every agent is owned directly through your wallet, which means full on-chain control, transparency, and personalization at your fingertips. Unstaked is now in stage 17 of its presale for $0.01043. With a projected launch value near $0.1819, early users are looking at a potential 2,700% return. More than $8.2 million has already been raised, a clear sign that creators and Web3 marketers see the value and are acting fast. For anyone trying to stay relevant without burning out, Unstaked offers a way to automate influence and amplify reach. It is not just about being online, it is about owning the conversation. Unstaked gives you the tools to do that, all day, every day. Market Takeaways While TRUMP coin rides on exclusive events and BNB reflects network strength, Unstaked offers real functionality that goes beyond headlines. Its AI agents work across major platforms like X, Telegram, and Discord, handling engagement, posts, and replies without manual input. This is not a concept or a theory. It is a working system with live tools designed to scale digital presence. Now in stage 17 of its presale, Unstaked is priced at $0.01043 with a target launch of $0.1819. That brings a potential 2,700% return backed by more than $8.2 million already raised. Unstaked is not just part of the conversation, it is building the infrastructure to lead it.

Data from HyperDash shows his account now holds just $23 , following a volatile month of trading. Wynn became famous for placing huge leveraged positions on-chain in tokens like BTC , PEPE , and others. His most devastating move came with a $1.25 billion long on Bitcoin , which collapsed as BTC dipped below $105,000, leading to a loss of over $37 million including fees. Despite some early wins—like a profitable PEPE position that surged more than 10%—market volatility repeatedly wiped out his trades. Over the month, he rotated through assets such as ETH, SUI, TRUMP, and even FARTCOIN, at one point sitting on an unrealized profit of $85 million . In response to the dramatic loss, an X account linked to Wynn remained defiant, stating: “I’ll run it back, I always do. And I’ll enjoy doing it.

Buzz surrounds these digital assets as they approach potential breakout points. The article delves into the reasons behind this optimism and explores the possibility of hitting notable price targets. Curious about which coins hold promise for growth? Discover the details within. GALA Faces Selling Pressure: Price Levels and Market Sentiment GALA experienced an 8% drop over the last month and a sharper fall of over 65% in the past six months, reflecting continuous selling pressure. The weekly change of approximately -14% further highlights the coin’s ongoing bearish trend. Historical price movements show that GALA has struggled to maintain its value amid consistent fluctuations. Traders have reacted with persistent selling, indicating a lack of stability. This pattern suggests that the coin is under strain, adjusting without strong recovery signals in recent observed timeframes. The current trading landscape places GALA within a range defined by support near $0.0080 and resistance around $0.0235, with an additional upper resistance level at $0.0312. Price action remains under bearish influence, supported by technical indicators like the relative strength index at around 37. Market participants should monitor the $0.0080 support closely; a rebound here might signal a short-term buying opportunity. Conversely, breaking above $0.0235 resistance would be necessary for building confidence in a sustained rally. As GALA faces ongoing bearish pressure, traders might consider entering on dips while maintaining cautious positions within this defined range. JasmyCoin: Key Levels and Recent Bearish Momentum JasmyCoin has faced a steady decline, losing about 9.06% in the past month and nearly 49.38% over the last six months. A one-week decrease of 13.61% emphasizes the ongoing downward trend. These fluctuations indicate growing bearish pressure and investor uncertainty, with trading activity reflecting a heightened sensitivity to market shifts. Overall, the coin has struggled to gain momentum, remaining susceptible to further declines in challenging market conditions. Currently, JasmyCoin trades between approximately $0.00987 and $0.02161. The nearest resistance is around $0.02666, with another level near $0.0384. Key support is at roughly $0.00318, with a potential floor near zero if selling pressure persists. Current indicators show that bears dominate the market, with no clear upward trend visible. Traders might look to enter gradually if prices stabilize at support while using protective stops, as a break below these levels may trigger additional sell-offs. Conclusion GALA and JASMY both show promising signs of breaking out. GALA is targeting a price of $0.07, while JASMY aims for $0.03. Both coins are capturing attention with their potential for significant gains. Stay tuned to market movements to see how these targets play out.

The outflow followed a recent decline in BTC value, which saw its price below $105,000. According to data from Farside Investors , IBIT saw a total of $430.8 million outflows on a day that other spot Bitcoin ETFs also bled funds. Fidelity FBTC and Bitwise BITB recorded $13.7 million and $35,3 million outflows, respectively, while Ark Investments 21 Shares ARKB had a negative $120.1 million flow. While the IBIT outflow ends its no-outflow streak, analysts consider the run impressive for the product, which has been around for less than 18 months. ETF Foundation president Nate Geraci praised it. He said: “What a run over the past 30+ days though. Not sure I have words to describe how ridiculous this is.” However, IBIT’s outflow was unsurprising, given that all the other funds have experienced multiple days of outflows this month. In fact, the combined net outflow of $347 million for Bitcoin ETFs on May 29 had already ended the two-week streak of consecutive inflows for the asset class, making the eventuality of an IBIT outflow inevitable. With the massive outflows from IBIT , the 11 Bitcoin ETFs finished May 30 with a combined outflow of $616.1 million, one of the biggest daily outflows in over a month. Still, the streak of inflows and the few outflows highlights Bitcoin’s positive performance in May, during which it reached a new peak. IBIT AUM is now above $70 billion despite the BTC decline Meanwhile, IBIT now has over $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) despite the recent outflows, enough to rank 23rd on the list of top 100 ETFs. This performance has shattered all expectations about spot Bitcoin ETFs and shows how the product has outdone even the most bullish prediction at the time of their approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the next youngest ETF in the top 25 has been around for 12 years, showing IBIT’s significance. The around $6.5 billion in inflows in May for IBIT is a monthly inflow record and contributed to the over $70 billion AUM milestone. Interestingly, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively pulled in over $9 billion in inflows over the last five weeks. This sharply contrasts with the almost $3 billion that flowed out of gold ETFs, further showing that investors view Bitcoin as a hedge asset different from gold. Cumulatively, Bitcoin ETFs have seen a net inflow of around $45 billion since their launch. This is still impressive, given that Grayscale GBTC has seen an outflow of $23.21 billion since its conversion into an ETF. What is next for Bitcoin? With Bitcoin down more than 4% in the last seven days and dropping to $104,000 after peaking around $112,000, investors are observing the crypto market’s next move. The general sentiment among analysts is that the bull run is not over yet, and BTC might still have more room to run. According to Cryptoquant analysts, the conditions for Bitcoin are still bullish even though some metrics are already overheating. The firm stated that its Bull Score Index is currently at 80 and expects the flagship asset to keep rallying until the score is below 50. However, the analysts noted that Bitcoin demand growth seems to have reached a local top after the 30-day demand growth estimate reached 229,000 BTC, close to 279,000 BTC, which marked the top in December 2024. Interestingly, the Bitcoin balance held by whales also increased by 2.8% last month. Such rapid increase has historically preceded reduced accumulation, which could mean less buying pressure to push prices further up. Nevertheless, many believe that the demand for BTC remains very strong. Appolo Sats founder Thomas Fahrer noted that the Bitcoin double-top in 2025 is nothing compared to similar double peaks in price in 2021. This is because BTC’s recent performance is supported by demand from the ETF, treasury companies , and sovereign states that have established BTC reserves. Bitcoin Net Realized Profit & Loss remains limited despite recent peak (Source: CryptoQuant) Crypto analyst Crypto Dan also believes Bitcoin will continue the upward cycle and points to the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit and Loss (NPRL) metric as evidence. He stated that the current level of profit-taking is lower compared to previous highs in 2024. Thus, its effect would likely be a price correction in the short term rather than a complete reversal of the upward cycle. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A meme coin with no real product, no use case, and no development roadmap — Dogecoin (DOGE) — turned a modest $1,000 investment into more than $120,000. All it took was community hype and a viral moment. DOGE went from a joke to a life-changing opportunity in just one market cycle. But now, the market is watching something very different take shape. A project with real utility, a working model, growing user base, and passive income already being generated. That project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — and analysts are projecting an even bigger move. At today’s presale price of $0.03, a $1,000 investment in MUTM has the potential to grow to $150,000 before the end of 2026. This time, it’s not about memes or momentum. It’s about fundamentals. DOGE was a joke, MUTM is a financial protocol built for the future Dogecoin had no products, no lending system, no staking, and no actual use cases. Its rise was based on hype, social media buzz, and celebrity endorsements. While it made many people rich, the project itself never evolved beyond being a meme. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the opposite. It’s a decentralized lending platform offering both peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) models. The platform is designed for real users and real income — not speculation. In the P2C model, users can deposit assets like ETH or DAI into a common liquidity pool and earn interest based on how much is borrowed. The higher the utilization of the pool, the higher the APY, with top rates reaching up to 18% annually. In the P2P model, users have full control. They can lend and borrow tokens typically not supported by traditional lending protocols, including memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, or PEPE. This flexibility opens the door for traders and holders who want to put their assets to work without selling them. Real growth, real users, real demand So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $9.70 million in its presale across five phases. The price has already risen by 165% — from $0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.03 in Phase 5. More than 11,650 users are already holding MUTM tokens, and interest continues to grow daily as the next phase approaches. Those who joined in Phase 1 have already seen solid returns — nearly 3x in less than two months. And those who wait until later stages will have to pay higher prices for the same tokens, meaning smaller gains. At the current price of $0.03, a $1,000 investment buys 33,333 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $4.50, that investment becomes $150,000. That’s just 50% more than Dogecoin’s run — but the difference is that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built with long-term value in mind. Beta launch coming soon — with real passive income already flowing According to the project roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch the beta version of its platform with the token goes live on exchanges. This gives it a huge edge over other presale tokens that often launch without any working product. When someone deposits $5,000 worth of DAI or ETH into the Mutuum protocol, they can earn up to $900 a year in passive income depending on pool utilization. In return, they also receive mtTokens — interest-bearing tokens that can be staked to earn more MUTM through dividend payouts. These dividends are funded by actual revenue generated from borrowers using the platform. On top of that, the protocol buys back tokens from the open market and redistributes them to stakers. Certified Secure by CertiK — Trusted by Over 11,650 Users Security is a big concern in crypto, especially for DeFi protocols. That’s why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) completed an in-depth audit by CertiK, one of the industry’s most respected security firms. The audit, which included manual review and static analysis, gave MUTM a Token Scan Score of 70.00. The audit was requested on February 25 and updated again on May 20, 2025. This level of transparency is exactly what smart investors want to see — especially when so many other projects skip these steps or delay audits until after launch. Stronger than DOGE, smarter than memecoins The beauty of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies in its combination of utility and timing. DOGE exploded without a product. MUTM is already delivering income before its public exchange debut. That means this is not just a presale gamble — it’s a real opportunity with strong foundations. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating long-term value. Its smart tokenomics, staking features, and growing user base are building momentum the market can measure — not just imagine. The presale is already in Phase 5, and early investors have made gains of more than 165% from the first round. As new users continue to join and the platform moves closer to launch, the entry price will keep rising. Every new phase reduces the upside for latecomers. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and rising demand, the current $0.03 price won’t last long. When the token lists, the market will decide its true value — and it’s clear that value is rising fast. A chance to create generational wealth DOGE made millionaires overnight without ever promising anything. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers real income, a working platform, a flexible lending system, and strong token holder benefits. The $100,000 giveaway and upcoming beta launch are only accelerating its growth. At $0.03, a $1,000 investment will turn into $150,000. And unlike the meme coin wave, this time there’s a roadmap, a revenue model, and real value behind the rise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just the next big thing — it’s the smart choice in a market that rewards utility, security, and community. The signals are clear, and the next Dogecoin-sized success is already here.

Reports also showed that about $600 million worth of OUSD and USDY stablecoins were held on Ethereum. On Solana, deposits topped $300 million in similar stablecoins. Arbitrum One added over $150 million in USDY, while Polygon saw around $50 million in OUSG. Many in the market believe this steady increase highlights a growing interest in real-world assets from investors looking for steady returns with less risk than other, more volatile assets. In another positive step, JPMorgan completed its first public blockchain transaction involving tokenized government bonds. The bank worked with Ondo Finance on the deal. Key Price Levels to Watch Ondo (ONDO) technical analysis points to a bullish setup, with slow and steady accumulation underway. The price stays above key support zones while forming a higher low structure, signaling renewed interest from buyers after previous consolidation. CoinMarketCap data shows that ONDO has stayed below the $1 mark with a modest gain of 0.09% in the last 24 hours. However, its price action remains centered on the $0.80 level. In April, this level acted as strong support during bearish movements. Early May saw a brief breakout above a descending trendline. But that move quickly faded, leaving traders cautious. Indicators have shown mixed signals, adding to the uncertainty. Holding above $0.80 is considered vital, as a drop below this level could invite more selling and prolong the bearish trend that began early in 2025. Future Outlook for ONDO If ONDO can hold above $0.80, it might push up towards $1.37. Hitting that could bring a chance to test the high of $2.20 from late last year. But if the mood shifts and investors pull back, the price could slip again, even with the solid growth in TVL. What happens in the next few weeks will matter much for where ONDO goes next. In related news, reports indicated that early investors who accumulated the ONDO coin at $0.10 saw their investments skyrocket as ONDO peaked near $1.50 .

In a new press release , the DOJ is announcing charges against six individuals connected to a “sprawling” scheme that hauled in $66 million in food stamps by allegedly abusing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The suspects – Michael Kehoe, Mohamad Nawafleh, Omar Alrawashdeh, Gamal Obaid, Emad Alrawashdeh, and Arlasa Davis – are charged with conspiracy to steal government funds and with misappropriating U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) benefits, among other charges. Authorities say that starting in 2019, Kehoe and his co-conspirators allegedly submitted fraudulent applications to obtain machine terminals that accepted payments from SNAP recipients for unauthorized places, such as smoke shops. SNAP recipients use specialized payment cards to purchase food at stores. According to the press release, Kehoe set up 160 illegal terminals across New York and processed millions of dollars worth of fraudulent EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer) transactions. One of the members of the group – Davis – worked for the USDA and is suspected of using her position to acquire and distribute a list of license numbers for qualifying stores, which allowed the thieves to illegally obtain EBT terminals for stores not authorized by the USDA. In return, she received bribes disguised as gifts. As stated by U.S. Attorney Perry Carbone, “Michael Kehoe and his co-conspirators misappropriated tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds meant to help low-income families put food on the table. This fraud was made possible when USDA employee Arlasa Davis betrayed the public trust by selling confidential government information to the very criminals she was supposed to catch. Their actions undermined a program that vulnerable New Yorkers depend on for basic nutrition. These charges should be a reminder that those who exploit anti-poverty programs for personal gain will be held accountable for their crimes.” If convicted, the suspects face decades behind bars.

IBIT witnessed over $430 million in outflows on May 30, a reversal after 31 consecutive days of positive accumulation. Investors Pull $430.8 Million From BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Investors pulled $430.8 million from BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF on Friday amid flaring tensions between the U.S. and China over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. It was IBIT’s biggest single-day net outflow since its launch, according to data from U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Before this, IBIT’s largest outflow day was on Feb. 26, bleeding $418.1 million in investor money. Nate Geraci, the president of investment advisor ETFStore, observed in a May 31 post on X, “What a run over the past 30+ days, though.” Geraci pointed out that BlackRock’s IBIT is now pushing approximately $70 billion in Bitcoin assets under management since its debut — continuing to assert its dominance in the market. “Not sure I have words to describe how ridiculous this is,” he posited. Overall, the dozen US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs as a whole posted net outflows for the second consecutive day on May 30, totaling $616.1 million. The latest pullback came as global economic tensions rattled financial markets, triggering a cascade of liquidations and pulling prices below key support levels. Bitcoin was trading hands at around $104,140 at publication time, according to CoinMarketCap data. Just nine days ago, the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency was trading at all-time highs of nearly $112,000. The volatility comes after U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating a bilateral trade pact, forcing him to double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% to protect domestic industries. Trump claimed China broke a May agreement to ease trade tensions, adding that he might discuss the issue with President Xi Jinping. The President also announced new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, reigniting trade war fears and sending ripples across financial markets.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Blackrock,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-31 18:46:42

This bold move signals a dramatic shift in corporate treasury strategy and has reignited speculation about the next wave of institutional crypto adoption. GameStop’s $513 Million Bitcoin (BTC) Move Redefines The Corporate Treasury Game GameStop’s declaration on May 28 that it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin (BTC) for $513 million has aligned it with major players, such as MicroStrategy and Tesla. This decision followed a March update to its treasury policy and a $1.3 billion convertible notes issuance. GameStop's CEO, Ryan Cohen, during the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, dubbed Bitcoin (BTC) superior to gold, citing its fixed supply and digital security. The market reaction was volatile as GameStop stock surged 6.6% in pre-market trading but closed the day down by nearly 11%. At $107,883 as of May 29, Bitcoin (BTC) remains relatively stable, with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump forecasting highs exceeding $170,000 if corporate adoption continues. Crypto Twitter lit up, memes flourished, and financial analysts began drawing parallels between Bitcoin’s (BTC) institutional acceptance and the early dot-com boom. GameStop’s pivot has added fresh momentum to crypto’s march into mainstream finance. Meme Culture Meet AI: The FloppyPepe (FPPE) Player Awakens While GameStop reshapes its treasury model to adopt Bitcoin (BTC), this sleeper player is carving out dominance in an emerging sector: AI-powered meme tokens.

Dimon stated during a May 30 appearance at the Reagan National Economic Forum in California that the United States should prioritize defense logistics over stockpiling Bitcoin. US Should Focus On Essential Resources Like Ammunition and Rare Earths “We shouldn’t be stockpiling Bitcoins,” Jamie Dimon opined, reiterating his long-standing criticism of the foremost cryptocurrency. This comes after President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order in March, mandating the establishment of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Bitcoin Reserve will initially consist of the coins seized by the government in civil and criminal forfeitures. The president also called for a crypto stockpile of other types of assets beyond Bitcoin. But according to the anti-crypto billionaire banker, real-world defense logistics, not crypto assets, should take priority. Specifically, he suggested the US should prioritise “guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, and rare earths.” “If there’s a war in the South China Sea, we’ve got missiles for seven days. That’s not something we should be saying with a straight face,” Dimon explained. Dimon’s Bitcoin Bashing History Dimon has long been critical of Bitcoin, asserting at one point that the OG crypto’s “true use case” was for criminals. He also dubbed Bitcoin “a fraud,” and last year described it as a “pet rock,” before declaring he’d “shut it down” if he were the government. But now, likely due to client demands, the bank will allow customers to buy it. He announced earlier this month that JPMorgan clients will soon be able to buy it, though the bank will not custody the asset. At the time, he clarified that he’s still “not a fan” of Bitcoin, mainly because of its use for illegal activities, including sex trafficking and money laundering. He also dismissed the industry’s hype around blockchain technology, claiming it’s less important than it’s made out to be.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Jamie Dimon,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-31 18:49:49

This development is particularly interesting for those in the tech and crypto space who value control, privacy, and decentralized processing capabilities. Discovering the Google AI App Google’s new offering, the Google AI Edge Gallery, is an Android app (with an iOS version planned) that provides access to a selection of openly available AI models hosted on the Hugging Face platform. Unlike many popular AI services that rely on cloud-based processing, this Google AI app lets users download and execute these models locally on their smartphones. This shifts the computational load from remote servers to the device itself, leveraging the phone’s built-in processors. The Power to Run AI Offline One of the standout features of the Google AI Edge Gallery is the ability to run AI offline . Once a model is downloaded to the device, it can perform tasks without requiring an internet connection. This has several advantages: Enhanced Privacy: Sensitive or personal data doesn’t need to be sent to a remote data center for processing. Accessibility: AI capabilities are available even in areas with poor or no network connectivity. Reduced Latency: Tasks can potentially be completed faster as there’s no network delay. While cloud models often boast superior power due to vast computing resources, the benefits of offline functionality for specific use cases are clear and compelling. Bringing AI on Phone Capabilities to Life The Google AI Edge Gallery app showcases various ways you can use AI on phone . The app’s interface provides shortcuts to different AI tasks, such as ‘Ask Image’ for image analysis or ‘AI Chat’ for conversational interactions. Tapping into these tasks presents a list of compatible models you can use, including Google’s own Gemma 3n model. The app also includes a ‘Prompt Lab,’ designed for experimenting with ‘single-turn’ tasks like text summarization or rewriting, offering customizable settings to fine-tune the model’s output. Exploring the World of Edge AI This initiative represents a significant step forward in the field of Edge AI , which focuses on running AI computations directly on devices at the ‘edge’ of the network, rather than in the cloud. Google is positioning the AI Edge Gallery as an ‘experimental Alpha release,’ inviting developers and users to provide feedback. The app is released under an Apache 2.0 license, making it freely usable for almost any purpose, including commercial projects. This open approach encourages broader adoption and innovation in local AI development. Performance of the models running locally can vary. Devices with more powerful processors will naturally handle tasks faster than older hardware. Additionally, the size and complexity of the chosen AI model will impact processing time. Users should expect performance differences depending on their specific phone and the model being used. In conclusion, Google’s quiet launch of the AI Edge Gallery app is a notable development for mobile AI. By enabling users to download and run AI models locally and offline, it offers increased privacy and accessibility. While still in its early stages, this app provides a tangible look at the future of running powerful AI capabilities directly on our personal devices.

Two new Ethereum and Solana-focused ETFs planned to be launched by REX Financial and Osprey Funds have received initial registration approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raising new questions about the funds’ legal status. The SEC said the funds in question may not meet the definition of an “investment company” under federal securities laws, meaning they fail to meet one of the basic legal requirements for being listed on an exchange. SEC officials said in a letter to the issuer of the ETF Opportunities Trust that the two ETFs may have been falsely registered as “investment companies” and that the statements they made may have been misleading. The funds aimed to allow investors to earn staking rewards on cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana. Related News: What to Expect in Bitcoin in June? Expert Analysts Share Their Predictions “We believe we can address the SEC’s concerns regarding the investment company definition and do not plan to float the funds until this issue is resolved,” REX Financial General Counsel Greg Collett said in a statement. The SEC declined to comment beyond the letter’s content. “Even if the SEC doesn’t allow this structure to be listed, we believe that simpler ETF attempts that include staking will eventually be successful. It’s just a matter of time. But the SEC doesn’t seem to like the way REX is moving these applications forward,” said James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. This is the SEC’s second overt crackdown on ETFs that invest in alternative asset classes in recent months. In March, the SEC publicly criticized the world’s first ETF investing in the private credit market, offered by State Street Corp. and Apollo Global Management, just hours after it began listing. REX announced yesterday that it had received “active registration” for the two ETFs in question and that the funds could now be traded on the exchange. REX founder Greg King stated that both funds were planned to be launched in mid-June. “Until these concerns are addressed, appropriate steps will be considered to ensure compliance with the federal securities laws,” the SEC said in its letter. *This is not investment advice.

The Minneapolis-based sports marketing company is joining others attempting to mirror the Bitcoin strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy). SharpLink Is Amassing Ether As A Treasury Reserve Asset In a May 30 filing, SharpLink Gaming said it plans to sell up to $1 billion in shares of common stock to purchase more ether for its treasury. “We intend to use substantially all of the proceeds from this offering to acquire Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain commonly referred to as ‘ETH,’” the filing reads. SharpLink also aims to use some proceeds from this offering for working capital, general operating expenses, and affiliate marketing operations. The capital raise follows the company’s May 27 announcement that it would be creating an Ether-based corporate treasury strategy. SharpLink Gaming nominated Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lupin as chairman of its board of directors. The MicroStrategy Of Ethereum SharpLink joins a growing roster of microcap companies trying to mimic the success of Strategy, the first publicly traded company to adopt a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy, leading to an over 2,400% growth of its share price since it started buying the leading cryptocurrency in 2020. Before spot Bitcoin ETFs became a multi-billion-dollar hit on Wall Street, MicroStrategy (now known as simply Strategy) embarked on a quest to become one of the asset’s largest corporate holders. The Michael Saylor-led company currently owns 580,250 Bitcoin , valued at $60.7 billion, as the price of BTC now hovers around $114,400. This is equivalent to 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply.

Gensler isn’t the first official to be dismissed, and he likely won’t be the last According to Vance, the lack of clear regulation for the crypto market could lead to trillions of dollars flowing to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Vance emphasized that the U.S. needs to draft legislation to fully integrate cryptocurrencies into the national economy, rather than restricting the industry. “If we don’t create transparent rules now, this $3 trillion industry will go overseas,” he said. The vice president said there should be no officials remaining in government positions who oppose digital assets. He mentioned Gary Gensler, the former head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who left the agency immediately after Trump’s inauguration in January. “We’ve already fired Gary Gensler, and we’re going to fire anyone who shares his stance,” Vance said, hinting at upcoming personnel changes among financial regulators. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, known for his friendly approach to the crypto market, as the new head of the SEC. Atkins has already announced that the agency will overhaul its approach to regulating the crypto industry and will seek to make the U.S. the “cryptocurrency capital of the world.” The Commission recently created a task force on cryptocurrencies, headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce. She is known in the crypto community as “Crypto Mom.” Peirce said that the SEC will first focus on revising the classification of crypto assets. The regulator’s Digital Asset Working Group has already held three roundtables on digital assets. During the most recent one, which took place on May 12, commissioners discussed moving assets to blockchain and tokenization. The next meeting is scheduled for June 6.

While Durov confirmed that the deal is yet to be signed, the Telegram founder said there is an “agreement in principle,” which might be why TON still has significant support at the $3.0. Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin rise above $100,000. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000?

Image source: CoinStats Ton network launched in 2018 as the Telegram Open Network (TON) but was later renamed “The Open Network” and taken over by the TON Foundation. In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event. On September 20, 2021, TON registered its all-time low price at $0.3906. Its first significant break came in November 2021. In days, the coin slid from $0.8 to $4.5. It corrected in 2022, reaching a low of $0.9. In 2023, it ranged between $1.1 and $2.5. In 2024, it registered another bull run, rising from $2.11 to its all-time high of $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024.

Analyst Reveals End-Of-Year Prediction",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/can-dogecoin-price-still-rally-1000-analyst-reveals-end-of-year-prediction/,"A crypto analyst has forecasted a potential 1,000% rally for the Dogecoin price by the end of the year, suggesting that the leading meme coin could not only reach the coveted $1 milestone but blast past it to $2. While this target may seem bold, especially with Dogecoin still trading below $0.5, the analysis is backed by a compelling combination of historical price behavior, market structure, and accumulation patterns. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ Dogecoin Price Targets $2 By Year’s End According to a 2-day chart analysis published by crypto market expert ‘Setupsfx_‘ on TradingView, Dogecoin has been navigating a textbook accumulation phase reminiscent of previous cycles that preceded explosive price surges. Based on this distinct historical price behavior, the analyst is boldly predicting a major breakout, anticipating a 1,000% rally that could allow the meme coin to smash through $2 by the end of the year. Using the Wyckoff theory as a foundation, the TradingView expert presented a chart illustrating a clear structure of accumulation, distribution, markdown, and markup—- all of which have played out in past market movements. The chart shows that Dogecoin followed a typical Wyckoff accumulation in its early 2021 cycle, where it traded sideways and spent months consolidating in a defined range. This range, indicated by the blue box on the chart, has been highlighted as a key buy zone between roughly $0.12 and $0.16. Notably, this key zone is the final area where the Dogecoin price could be revisited before launching higher. A return to this range would complete the historical price structure and present an ideal entry point before the markup stage begins. Currently, Dogecoin has concluded its markdown phase and is approaching the final stages of accumulation, paving the way for a potential bullish breakout. If price action continues to respect this historically bullish roadmap, Setupsfx_ forecasts that Dogecoin could gradually move higher over the coming months. By late 2025, this could culminate in a full-blown rally to $2, a level that represents approximately 1,000% upside from current prices. While the TradingView analyst maintains a bullish stance on Dogecoin’s outlook, he has tempered expectations, cautioning that the journey to $2 isn’t expected to be linear. Dogecoin could still face volatility, retracement, and psychological resistance around levels like $0.25, $0.5, and $1, which could slow down its climb. A Push Above $3 Still In The Cards Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade on X (formerly Twitter) is even more bullish on Dogecoin’s future price, projecting a potential rally to $3.8. This optimistic forecast is supported by the emergence of a bullish Ascending Broadening Wedge pattern on Dogecoin’s weekly chart. Six key touch points confirm the pattern, labeled A through F, within a widening channel indicated on the price chart. The critical level to watch is the $0.47 resistance level, marked by the previous high around point E. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare A confirmed breakout above this level could validate the wedge and potentially trigger a significant price surge. Based on the measured move from the wedge’s widest point, the analyst highlights a projected path to $3.8, representing a massive 2,011% surge from current prices around $0.18.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) and XRP are showing signs of recovery as technical patterns and ecosystem progress bring new attention to their markets. SHIB is gaining traction after analysts pointed out a setup that could trigger a 43% rise if it passes key resistance levels. XRP is also drawing interest again due to Ripple’s steady global expansion and a more hopeful outlook on its legal clarity. Though these two coins are back in the spotlight, another project is gaining notice for offering more than just price action. Web3 ai , priced at $0.000402 during its Stage 07 presale, has raised over $6.6 million and has a projected ROI of 1,747% once launched. The project is creating a full AI tool ecosystem for crypto users, focused on long-term purpose and growth. As SHIB and XRP gain momentum, Web3 ai is shaping up as a major breakout crypto based on early interest and real-world plans. SHIB Builds Toward 43% Breakout as Patterns Tighten Shiba Inu (SHIB) is gaining speed as analysts highlight a bullish triangle pattern that could lead to a 43% jump if confirmed. SHIB is nearing key resistance at $0.00003, and a move past this level may draw more buyers. Increased whale activity and renewed focus on Shibarium, its Layer-2 network, are supporting this setup. Shibarium is processing more transactions and shows scaling promise, adding new value to SHIB. Community sentiment is still strong, and as SHIB tests a key level, traders are bracing for possible swings. Broader market mood will shape short-term moves, but technical signals support a bullish view. Still, the SHIB price depends more on public sentiment and news, making it harder to predict than projects like Web3 ai that focus on real use and utility. This puts Web3 ai in a different league among breakout crypto projects. XRP Outlook Gains as Ripple’s Plan Expands Globally XRP is gaining more long-term support as Ripple broadens its role in cross-border payments. The Motley Fool reports Ripple’s network is expanding in Latin America and Asia, helping blockchain payments become more common in financial systems. This shift adds support for XRP as a future value asset. Ripple’s legal case with the SEC is still ongoing, but signs are pointing in Ripple’s favor. With less legal pressure and more practical use, future outlooks for XRP are improving. Some analysts believe XRP could play a key role in asset tokenization systems. However, XRP still faces risk. Its price closely follows news on regulations and adoption, so its path forward may be slower. For those willing to take the risk, XRP has potential, but it doesn’t have the fast upside that early-stage breakout crypto projects like Web3 ai might offer. Web3 ai Builds AI Tools with Utility, Growth, and ROI in Focus Web3 ai is gaining attention not for hype, but for building useful tools that aim to improve crypto decisions. Its platform includes a scam detector, a staking advisor, portfolio optimizer, and a news filter. These tools are being developed to help users lower risk, improve profits, and make better choices in both centralized and decentralized crypto markets. Right now, Web3 ai is in Stage 07 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.000402. The expected launch price is $0.005242, with a projected ROI of 1,747%. So far, the presale has brought in over $6.6 million, showing strong interest in the project’s purpose and future goals. To support adoption, Web3 ai is also running a $777,000 giveaway. Anyone who buys at least $100 worth of tokens can take part. The $WAI token will be used for platform access, staking, and voting, which adds ongoing value beyond trading. This focus on real use makes Web3 ai different from meme coins and marks it as a serious breakout crypto option for 2025. The project’s flexible design also helps it stand out. Its modular setup means tools can be added or upgraded without needing to change the whole system. This makes Web3 ai ready to scale as more people join, from casual users to large players. With this structure, Web3 ai is not just a breakout crypto today, but a growing AI platform ready to shape how Web3 evolves. Which Crypto to Buy? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is gaining speed, and current chart patterns suggest it could rise by 43% if it breaks past resistance. XRP is taking a slower path, building a solid base through payment solutions and better legal standing. While both coins have appeal, the size and timing of gains may vary. Web3 ai brings a new kind of offer to the table. It focuses on building tools with real use, has a utility token with clear functions, and shows strong early interest, with $6.6 million already raised. With a projected 1,747% ROI, Web3 ai could be a leading breakout crypto for those seeking value from projects that offer more than just price swings. This is not just a presale. It’s a platform shaped for real and lasting use.

The parties filed a joint motion in federal court requesting the dismissal, calling the move appropriate “in the exercise of [the SEC’s] discretion and as a policy matter”. In response, a Binance spokesperson hailed the outcome as “a landmark moment,” thanking SEC Chair Paul Atkins and the “Trump administration” for stepping in to prevent what it called “regulation by enforcement” . Binance’s new CEO, Richard Teng, celebrated on social media. On X (formerly Twitter), Teng wrote that “the tide has turned. The SEC’s case against us is dismissed— justice, finally.” He credited Chairman Atkins and the Trump administration with resisting regulatory overreach, saying, “The U.S. is back in the arena, ready to lead the world in blockchain innovation.” Source: Richard Teng X Binance.US likewise welcomed the decision. In a statement , a Binance.US spokesperson said they were “pleased” the SEC had fully dismissed the charges, affirming it has always known the company “did not violate U.S. securities laws.” The statement added that resolving the matter is “a major m ilestone” that will allow Binance.US to refocus on growing its business and rebuilding impacted relationships. Market Reaction: BNB Price Analysis Despite the bullish headlines, BNB’s price has shown only a modest reaction. Crypto market data indicate BNB traded around $687 on May 29 (the day of the filing) and slipped to about $654.80 by May 30. That’s roughly a 3% drop on May 30 from the prior close. Trading volumes actually picked up: BNB’s 24-hour volume at roughly 24.7 million (BNB tokens) on May 30, up from about 21.7M on May 29. In other words, the news drew more activity, but the price move was muted. Key derivatives metrics were similarly calm. Data from CoinGlass shows total open interest in BNB futures is around $800–$820 million, little changed on the news. Net fund flows into and out of Binance were roughly balanced, indicating indecisive traders. Volatility remains moderate—for example, BNB’s 14-day Average True Range (ATR) is on the order of $20 (about 3% of its price), reflecting only normal daily swings. In summary, BNB’s charts show it continuing in the range it was in prior to the news. It briefly tested resistance near the mid-$670s (its recent highs) on May 29, then retreated. As of this writing, BNB sits in the mid-$600s—around where it was a week earlier—suggesting the SEC news has largely been priced in. Source: TradingView Traders will be watching whether easing regulatory pressure spurs a sustained breakout, but at least in the first trading sessions after the announcement, the market response has been fairly restrained. Comparison to Past Crypto Regulatory News This reaction echoes similar cases. Historically, major regulatory announcements have often caused short-lived shocks. For example, when the SEC first sued Binance in June 2023, BNB’s price plummeted nearly 9% in one day. In June 2023, BNB traded around $282, up 1.6% from a day earlier, after the SEC lawsuit news saw it suffer its worst daily fall. By contrast, the SEC’s withdrawal of that case (with prejudice) has only briefly paused BNB’s uptrend rather than triggering a big sell-off. Likewise, the SEC’s recent pattern under the new administration has been to step back. Earlier in 2025, it dropped a high-profile case against Coinbase (another major U.S. crypto exchange) that had accused it of offering 13 unregistered tokens. When the Coinbase enforcement action was halted in February 2025, Coinbase’s stock jumped, but its crypto market impact was modest. Industry observers note that “sell-the-news” versus “buy-the-news” reactions vary: once an overhang is removed, prices sometimes rally, but not always. In this case, analysts say the SEC’s change of course likely removes a cloud of uncertainty, but it doesn’t by itself guarantee an immediate rally in BNB. Other factors – like broader crypto sentiment, macro markets, and on-chain usage – will determine the longer-term trend.",Cryptocurrency|News|Binance|BNB|SEC,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-31 19:01:23

This comes just days after it hit an all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. At the same time, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $616 million in outflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $430.8 million redeemed, ending its 31-day inflow streak. Is this a healthy market correction or the start of a broader crypto downturn? Bitcoin ETF Outflows Signal Changing Sentiment On May 30, the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw $616.1 million leave their funds according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s IBIT alone accounted for $430.8 million—the largest single-day outflow since its January 2024 debut. Just a week earlier, these same ETFs pulled in $2.75 billion for the week ending May 23, a 4.5× increase from the $608 million of the prior week . ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted on X that IBIT has now amassed roughly $70 billion in Bitcoin holdings since launch, calling the recent fund flows “ridiculous.” Kyle Chasse of Master Ventures said the outflows are not driven by retail panic but rather reflect a “quiet transfer of supply to the strongest hands.” Source: X These outflows coincide with Bitcoin’s pullback from its May 22 peak. After surging to $111,970, BTC briefly traded near $108,141 on May 23 before sliding toward $103,700 on May 30. ETF flows and price action appear tightly linked; heavy redemptions placed downward pressure on spot markets, reversing mid-May gains. Bitcoin’s late-May drop also reflects broader macroeconomic factors. On May 30, the total cryptocurrency market cap fell 2.12% to $3.34 trillion. Investors cite renewed geopolitical tensions and U.S. economic concerns as reasons to reduce risk exposure. High Treasury yields and talk of inflationary headwinds have slowed appetite for volatile assets. In traditional markets, the S&P 500 slipped 0.7% on May 22 while Bitcoin hit $111,970, showing a rare decoupling between stocks and crypto. However, equities and crypto felt pressure by the month’s end. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell from 78 (“Extreme Greed”) on May 22 to 66 (“Greed”) by May 30, signaling a slight cooling of investor enthusiasm. Bitcoin has a history of sharp corrections after rapid rallies. After climbing from $60,000 to $69,000 in October 2021, BTC plunged 20% in two days, retracing gains before consolidating. Similarly, following its $69,000 peak in November 2021, BTC fell below $50,000 by January 2022—over a 27% drop. The May 2025 dip to $103,700 marks roughly a 7% pullback from the $111,970 high. That is modest compared to past corrections. Nonetheless, it underscores Bitcoin’s volatility. Analyst Crypto Dan of CryptoQuant pointed out that funding rates remain low relative to previous peaks, suggesting limited leverage-driven excess. What’s Ahead for Bitcoin Price? Traders will watch ETF flows closely in early June. If outflows persist, they may signal waning institutional demand, potentially dragging BTC lower. BTC/USDT Daily Chart| Source: TradingView However, many see the late-May redemptions as a temporary rotation rather than a wholesale exit. As Kyle Chasse noted, supply is shifting to long-term holders, which could support price stability once selling subsidies. Upcoming U.S. macro data—especially the June 13 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report—and any Federal Reserve commentary on interest rates will be crucial. A dovish Fed could buoy risk assets, including Bitcoin. Conversely, hotter-than-expected inflation data might prompt another pullback. On the technical side, traders are eyeing $100,000 as key psychological support. Below that, the next major support zone lies near $94,000, the mid-April low. If BTC holds above $100,000, it may reclaim momentum and attempt new highs. Failure to hold could open the door to a deeper correction. For now, Bitcoin’s $103,700 dip appears more like a correction than a meltdown. Institutional flows have swung rapidly, but large holders seem poised to absorb supply.

At an event organized by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, Dimon told regulators that the full effect of all the money printed since 2020 remains to be seen. “You are going to see a crack in the bond market. It is going to happen. And I tell this to my regulators, some of you who are in this room, I’m telling you it’s going to happen and you’re going to panic. I’m not gonna panic. We’ll be fine. We’ll probably make more money, and then some of my friends will tell me, ‘We like crises because it’s good for JPMorgan Chase.’ Not really.'” Dimon says bond vigilantes are back, selling bonds to protest unsustainable fiscal policies and America’s ballooning debt. In the long run, Dimon says he’s not too worried about China as a potential adversary, and instead believes the US needs to self improve and erase the “enemy within.” “If we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That’s a fact. Just read history… We we have to get our act together and we have to do it very quickly.” Dimon says a concerted effort to streamline regulations, immigration, taxation, healthcare and schools is needed. He also reiterated his dissatisfaction with Bitcoin’s emergence as a strategic reserve asset. “We shouldn’t be stockpiling Bitcoin.

US District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington heard closing arguments on Friday during the trial focused on potential measures to tackle Google’s purported illegal dominance in these areas. Google shared an X post stating it will await the court’s decision . Still, the search engine company firmly believes that the court’s initial ruling was incorrect, and it has demonstrated its eagerness for upcoming appeals. Google’s antitrust case gets more complex with each round In April, a federal judge ruled that Google violated antitrust laws in two online advertising technology markets in the US. During the trial, US District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington heard final arguments addressing how to address the tech firm’s illegal monopoly in online search and advertising. The Department of Justice argued that the company should be required to sell at least its Google Ad Manager, including its publisher ad server and exchange. Additionally, the DOJ and a coalition of states demanded that Google share search data and stop its multibillion-dollar deals with Apple and other smartphone makers that secure its position as the default search engine on new devices. John Schmidtlein, a lawyer for Google, tried to defend the company. He explained that even though generative AI is changing how search works, the tech firm has tackled competition issues in AI. Schmidtlein stated that the company has stopped making exclusive deals with wireless carriers and smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung Electronics. According to him, this change allows these companies to install competing search and AI apps on their new devices. However, despite these assurances, antitrust regulators remain concerned that Google’s dominance over search results gives it a competitive advantage in AI products such as Gemini — and that this influence works both ways. Judge Mehta shifts his attention to artificial intelligence Last year, Judge Mehta found that Google broke antitrust laws to maintain its monopoly in search and shifted his attention to artificial intelligence , which many technological stakeholders believe will upend search. Since AI products are already transforming the tech industry, the judge mentioned he was struggling with whether these proposals might encourage a new competitor to step up and create a general search engine. He then asked the government if it thinks there is a chance for a new search engine to emerge like the ones they have today. The government responded that AI products are linked to the future of searching online. Following this, analysts anticipate that Judge Mehta’s ruling might reshape a company synonymous with online search at a time of tremendous power in the business community. Google is fighting with other tech companies, like Microsoft, Meta, and the start-up OpenAI, to get consumers to use generative AI tools that can spit out humanlike responses to queries. However, Judge Mehta’s decision might hinder Google’s attempts to create its own AI and could give an advantage to its rivals as they compete to develop their own AI-driven search tools.

Historical Data Reveals Shocking Trends,https://coinedition.com/is-june-the-worst-month-for-bitcoin-historical-data-reveals-shocking-trends/,"June has consistently been a difficult month for Bitcoin, with underwhelming returns. Bitcoin experienced a significant decline of -37.28% in June 2022, one of its worst drops. The recurring weak performance in June has led to cautious behavior among Bitcoin investors. June is a challenging month for Bitcoin, raising concerns among traders. Historical data shows that the cryptocurrency often brings disappointing returns in June. Many investors have become concerned about this trend. Since this has happened many times, traders are wondering if it will keep going. According to historical data, Bitcoin’s price fell by 3.18% in June 2020, and in June 2021, it decreased by 5.95%. The situation worsened in June 2022, when the price of Bitcoin declined by 37.28%. June 2022 became one of the worst months for Bitcoin, marked by significant price declines. The significant loss helped forge the perception that June tends to be a challenging month for Bitcoin. Many people in the financial world quickly connected the month with a higher chance of losses.

The company has been implicated in running a “pig butchering” scam. $200M Scam Uncovered According to the official press release, Funnull has stolen over $200 million from American investors. OFAC has also placed two of Funnull’s cryptocurrency addresses on its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List to restrict their access to financial systems. In response, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) issued a public advisory, outlining key technical indicators, such as infrastructure components and IP addresses tied to Funnull’s scam operations. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Michael Faulkender, in an official statement , said “Today’s action underscores our focus on disrupting the criminal enterprises, like Funnull, that enable these cyber scams and deprive Americans of their hard-earned savings. The United States is strongly committed to ensuring the continued growth of a legitimate, safe, and secure digital asset ecosystem, including the use of virtual currencies and similar technologies.” Connection to Triad Nexus and Huione Pay According to the findings by blockchain intelligence Chainalysis, Funnull Technology Inc. enabled cybercriminals by purchasing IP addresses in bulk from major cloud service providers and selling them to operators of fraudulent investment platforms. This infrastructure allowed scammers to host malicious websites that mimicked legitimate investment platforms, thereby deceiving victims into investing in non-existent opportunities. Funnull was a central player in a network dubbed by security researchers as “Triad Nexus,” which includes more than 200,000 unique hostnames, many of which are associated with investment scams, fake trading apps, and suspect gambling networks. OFAC identified two crypto addresses linked to Funnull Technology Inc., used for receiving cybercriminal payments. These addresses are tied to scam-related infrastructure and show connections to Huione Pay, which was recently flagged by FinCEN as a major money laundering concern. Further investigation by blockchain security firm Elliptic revealed that the two addresses in question received more than $4 million in total.

Enthusiasts and investors are keen to see if these popular tokens could spark significant gains by July. This article delves into the factors driving the momentum and what it could mean for potential investors. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Bearish Movements and Key Levels to Watch Recent Shiba Inu performance shows a notable drop over the week, with a 12.37% decline that set the tone for further decreases. A one month slide of 5.29% affirmed the downward movement. Over the past six months, Shiba Inu lost nearly 60% of its value, signaling a protracted bearish phase. Price action during these periods has been marked by consistent weakness and declining investor confidence. The coin struggled to sustain momentum, and technical indicators reflect a challenging environment. Past behavior underlines that failure to reverse the trend could result in continued pressure. SHIB current market displays a tight trading range, with Shiba Inu priced between $0.000010 and $0.000015. Immediate resistance is noted around $0.000018, while a higher resistance is set near $0.000023. The nearest support level is established at $0.000008, offering a buffer against further declines, with a deeper support around $0.000003. The relative strength index at 36.09, combined with negative readings from the Awesome Oscillator, points to a bearish setup. Both summary and moving average recommendations indicate a downward bias, leaving sellers in control. The lack of a clear upward trend suggests consolidation, with bears setting the pace and buyers waiting for a rebound. Traders might consider testing support at $0.000008 or watching for a decisive break below this level as an alert for deeper losses. Caution remains essential. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Recovery Signs Against Long-Term Decline Dogecoin has shown a modest recovery over the past month with a 10.73% increase, reflecting renewed buyer interest following a significant 56.69% decline in the last six months. Price movements have been volatile, confined between $0.1371 and $0.2002. A divergence between this recent rise and the extended bearish trend suggests that while market sentiment may be improving, uncertainty remains regarding the long-term outlook. Short-term indicators hint at a potential rebound, creating cautious optimism despite the overall challenging trend marked by substantial losses over half a year. The current trading environment highlights key levels to monitor. Support is at approximately $0.1019, while the first resistance sits around $0.2281, allowing traders to strategize between these areas. Despite the recent positive movement, indicators suggest that momentum is still tilted toward the bearish side, with the RSI at 39.34 indicating weak bullish strength. Traders might consider setting stops just below support and targeting resistance levels. The trend remains mixed, necessitating vigilance in response to potential volatility within these identified price ranges. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE are showing signs of potential growth at crucial price points. The recent activity suggests that these cryptocurrencies could see significant gains soon. If the momentum continues, there is a real possibility for SHIB and DOGE to achieve impressive profits by July. The upcoming months will reveal if these coins can maintain the pressure and meet the optimistic projections. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

New Cryptocurrency Forecasted to Soar 14,000% Before Year-End",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-killer-new-cryptocurrency-forecasted-to-soar-14000-before-year-end/,"Solana (SOL) continues to dominate headlines, holding firm as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2025. At $174, Solana is now a top choice for developers and investors due to its fast transactions and growing DeFi space. Despite its resilience and impressive gains, some market watchers are questioning whether SOL has hit its peak in the short term, especially as fresh contenders enter the scene with the potential for exponential growth. With a rising appetite for cheap cryptocurrencies and early-stage altcoins, attention is now shifting to a new token forecasted to soar up to 14,000%, challenging Solana’s dominance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still worth under $0.03 and is attracting more interest fast. Already, more than $9.4 million has been raised in the Mutuum Finance presale, attracting 11,500 people, who will see the value of their tokens rise to $0.035 at the start of the second phase. When the token hits its planned launch price of $0.06, investors could double their investment. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors through its Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions which is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.4 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its launch price of $0.06. Certik Audit Finalized: Mutuum Finance Strengthens Position in DeFi Lending The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while consolidating its market position. A Certik smart contract audit has now been officially completed, and the results shared boosting investor confidence in the project. With this milestone, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. Gamified Leaderboard Engages the Community In addition to securing community ties, Mutuum Finance has established a leaderboard feature which displays the top 50 token holders in real-time. Bonus tokens will be received by the top 50 ranks, which becomes an entertaining, game-like incentive for users to move up and hold their positions. It is a smart merge of DeFi mechanics and community involvement. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance continues to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its growing investor community. To award early investors Mutuum Finance platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. One of the revolutionary aspects of the Mutuum Finance model is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. The Buy-and-Distribute mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fastly catching up to Solana (SOL), giving crypto enthusiasts the potential to see their gains grow by up to 14,000% in the coming months. While SOL is still thriving close to $174 and receives great developer support, MUTM’s DeFi lending concept which just finished Certik auditing, has gotten over $9.4 million in presales and attracted over 11,500 individuals during its period of sale before launch. Early investors in the token which costs $0.03 now and will rise to $0.035 before launching at $0.06 with up to 100% returns, will find it valuable. Anyone interested in being ahead of the game and taking advantage of consequential rise opportunities should register at Mutuum Finance now.

This sets the stage for a fierce showdown in the meme coin sector, PEPETO versus Solaxy, or a battle of 100X tokens. PEPETO , packed with real utility, is quickly emerging as the frontrunner in what could become the biggest presale race of 2025. What Makes PEPETO One of the Best Meme Coins to Buy PEPETO is not just another meme coin. It returns with a purpose, rooted in six core elements: Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization. Each element forms the foundation of its mission to outdo the early memecoin leaders. The project goes beyond laughs and memes. PEPETO is building a powerful, fair exchange that gives actual value to memecoins, ensuring they’re not just trends, but lasting forces. The Pepeto Exchange brings key features that put it ahead: zero listing fees, top-tier security, and a cross-chain bridge for seamless token transfers. Projects get listed based on merit, not money, which builds trust and transparency. By supporting token owners with tools and resources, Pepeto fosters a healthier and more inclusive crypto environment. This makes it a serious contender among the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Solaxy: A Promising Solana Layer 2, But Still Playing Catch-Up Solaxy (SOLX) enters the scene as Solana’s first Layer 2 chain, engineered to address its known weaknesses, network congestion, and failed transactions. Built for scale, Solaxy enhances transaction speed and reliability while keeping Solana’s core strengths intact. It also supports multi-chain compatibility, giving users flexibility to move assets across networks with ease. Currently in its presale stage, the project offers early access to SOLX at the lowest possible price. As the presale phases move forward, prices will rise, increasing urgency among potential investors. However, despite its ambition and utility, Solaxy faces stiff competition from Pepeto. While Solaxy focuses on scalability, Pepeto merges utility with viral appeal, giving it stronger potential for rapid mainstream traction. Why Pepeto Could Be the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025 Pepeto’s presale has raised over $5.2 million so far. Priced at just $0.000000131, the token offers a low entry point for investors aiming for high upside. With growing demand, $PEPETO stands out as a strategic buy with solid long-term potential. Holders can also stake $PEPETO for up to 280% annual rewards. Over 29 trillion tokens are already staked, showing strong community confidence. Rewards are distributed at 32,015,981.73 tokens per ETH block over two years, making Pepeto a top choice for the best meme coin to buy now. More Reasons Pepeto Is Gaining Ground Over Solaxy Pepeto stands for more than memes, prioritizing transparency and fairness. Only vetted tokens with strong fundamentals and real communities are listed, while filtering out scams. This strict policy makes the platform trusted by both traders and project developers. Buying $PEPETO is easy. Set up a Metamask or Best Wallet, fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT, and buy directly on the site. You can also stake for higher rewards. With simple access, strong returns, and a secure platform, Pepeto stays ahead of the competition. Its tokenomics support growth and stability, with a 420 trillion total supply allocated as follows: 30% for presale, 30% for staking rewards, 20% for marketing, 12.5% for liquidity, and 7.5% for ongoing development. Pepeto’s solid tokenomics, staking, utility, and vision make it a presale project to watch. Check it out today, and capitalize . ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

The coin’s price has dropped almost 4% within the last 24 hours, suggesting market tension and volatility. Mixed Market Sentiments Force BNB Price Dip BNB is likely rattled by renewed global trade tension and broad market volatility overshadowing the newly established positive regulatory landscape. The coin traded at $672.53 and then dropped to $646.27, a 3.9% dip within 24 hours. This coincided with an acceleration in selling during high-volume trading hours, as traders reacted to macroeconomic developments. At the time of this writing, BNB traded at $658.17, corresponding to a 1.79% drop in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume is 10.71% lower than its previous 24-hour level, at $1.75 billion. Also, BNB’s market cap is at $92.7 billion. One macroeconomic development is President Trump’s new tariffs on Canada and Mexico. This news ignited a shockwave across the financial markets, including the crypto sector. This is evident in BNB’s underperformance. Although not peculiar to Binance Coin alone, it remains one of the altcoins most affected in the past month. BNB Price Spike as BNB Smart Chain Sees Strong Demand About a week ago, BNB was doing better than it is currently. BNB saw a 13% increase from its lowest this month on May 25, reaching $660. At the time, BNB Smart Chain was experiencing strong demand, and this growing interest contributed to sustaining the bullish momentum. Within 30 days, the BNB Smart Chain successfully processed over $100 billion in trading volume across all its Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). This outweighed the record set by both Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). For context, ETH saw only $67 billion in volume while SOL registered up to $97 billion. SEC Dismisses Lawsuit Against Binance Generally, the Binance ecosystem has seen some strong positive sentiments, even with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). From urging a U.S. federal judge to send a securities-related class-action lawsuit into private arbitration, the exchange had the SEC dismiss its lawsuit against it. This was a joint decision between both entities. Since the case was dismissed with prejudice, the agency will not be able to pursue future filings of this matter.

Two notable players vying for the $1 milestone are Shiba Inu and Ruvi AI . While Shiba Inu draws investor interest through community-driven hype, Ruvi AI has positioned itself as a utility-focused project with a clear path toward long-term growth. With analysts weighing in on their potential, the comparison highlights the key differences in strategies as both projects aim for groundbreaking success. Shiba Inu’s Hype-Driven Growth Shiba Inu has always thrived on its strong community efforts and meme appeal. Often referred to as the “Dogecoin Killer,” Shiba Inu relies heavily on social media buzz and celebrity endorsements for its momentum. While the project recently gained some traction with innovations like Shibarium and efforts to introduce token-burning mechanisms, it still struggles to establish itself as a solution-oriented platform. Despite these limitations, Shiba Inu has attracted widespread attention due to its massive potential for short-term surges driven by speculation. However, its long-term sustainability largely depends on ongoing hype, making it a riskier choice for investors looking for consistent, grounded growth. Ruvi AI’s Utility-Driven Approach On the other hand, Ruvi AI stands out as a project with a focus on real-world applications and technological innovation. Launching to tremendous success, Ruvi AI’s presale saw over 130 million tokens sold , raising almost $1.5 million . With a low entry price of $0.015 , this high-utility crypto has quickly gained favor with investors looking for projects grounded in solutions rather than speculation. Ruvi AI’s roadmap forecasts token prices reaching $1 by Q4 2025 , offering early investors the potential for returns exceeding 12,800% . What makes Ruvi AI unique is its ability to address real-world challenges faced by industries such as: Healthcare: Employing AI to improve diagnostic accuracy, speed, and outcomes. Logistics: Streamlining supply chains with solutions that enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Finance: Providing advanced tools for fraud detection and secure digital transactions, adding a layer of safety in an increasingly vulnerable financial ecosystem. This utility-first model not only establishes Ruvi AI as a tangible solution provider but also ensures sustained adoption, creating a strong foundation for long-term growth. Maximizing Growth with Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI also offers a compelling investment opportunity through its lucrative VIP investment program . The tiered system allows early adopters to reap significant rewards, making it especially attractive for long-term investors. Here’s how the VIP tiers work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens awarded: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $4,900. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens awarded: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $15,680. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens awarded: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $89,600. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $1,280,000. These tailored tiers amplify investor confidence, presenting opportunities for gains while supporting the project’s growth efforts. Growing Accessibility Through WEEX Exchange Ruvi AI isn’t just about technology and rewards–it’s also about accessibility. By forming a strategic partnership with WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI has ensured that its tokens are widely available to both retail and institutional investors. This move not only improves trading liquidity but also sets the stage for further adoption across global markets. Strategic collaborations such as this reinforce Ruvi AI’s commitment to reliability and transparency. The Verdict: Utility vs. Hype While Shiba Inu continues to thrive on hype, Ruvi AI delivers something far more substantial for investors. Its utility-driven model , bolstered by real-world applications in healthcare, logistics, and finance, sets it apart in a market often dominated by speculative projects. With its successful presale, accessible investment tiers, and projected growth to $1 by Q4 2025, Ruvi AI offers an unparalleled opportunity to combine strong ROI potential with tangible innovation. For smart investors looking to back a cryptocurrency that prioritizes sustainability and impact over short-term excitement, Ruvi AI stands as the stronger contender for long-term success .

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spot-two-compelling-paths-for-shib-price-heres-the-significance/,"Shiba Inu has faced downward pressure in recent days, with the token trading around $0.00001288 at the time of writing. This marks an 8.70% drop over the last 24 hours and a 12.72% decline over the past week, underscoring a bearish short-term outlook. This negative trend has prompted market analysts to assess potential scenarios for the token’s price movement. Aram Salimi, a TradingView analyst, has presented two possible trajectories for SHIB based on its long-term chart patterns. His analysis focuses on two critical trend lines: a descending resistance line that has been in play since the asset’s all-time high in late 2021 and an ascending support line that emerged in mid-2023. Technical Overview: Key Levels and Patterns Since reaching its peak near $0.000088 in late 2021, SHIB has consistently been rejected by a descending resistance line that has acted as a ceiling during multiple rallies. This resistance has been tested at several points, first in March 2024 at approximately $0.0000453, and again in December 2024 near $0.0000335, each time resulting in a pullback, reinforcing the strength of this barrier. In contrast, SHIB established an ascending support line beginning in June 2023, following a low at $0.00000483. This support has provided several bounce points, most notably on January 1, 2024, at $0.0000071, and again on August 5, 2024, around $0.0000108. Although this trendline held for a period, SHIB has recently broken below it and is now hovering near a previously tested demand zone around $0.0000108, a level that acted as support in both August 2024 and April 2025. Forecast: Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios Salimi identifies two potential directions for SHIB in the coming weeks. In the bullish scenario, the token maintains its position above the $0.0000108 support zone and begins a recovery. A successful breakout above the descending resistance line could open the door for further gains, possibly pushing the token back toward its previous high near $0.000088. This would represent a substantial upside from current levels, with potential returns exceeding 570%. In contrast, if SHIB fails to hold above $0.0000108, further losses could follow. The next significant levels to monitor would be around $0.000009 and, in a more pessimistic scenario, down to $0.0000043, translating to a potential 67% drop from current prices. Still, Salimi suggests that the upward trajectory is more plausible, given continued support from the SHIB community.

SHIB’s trading volume has increased significantly, by over 71%, to $227.26 million, reflecting rising market participation. However, open interest has decreased by 15.52% to $194.10 million, possibly indicating that traders are closing out positions or waiting for clearer signals before re-entering the market. Long/short ratios also vary across exchanges. On Binance, the ratio stands at 0.9168, suggesting more accounts are holding short positions. On OKX , however, the ratio is notably higher at 2.02, with long positions dominating. These discrepancies highlight differing market sentiments depending on the platform. In terms of liquidations, long positions have taken the brunt of the losses. Over the past 24 hours, $1.4 million in long positions were liquidated, compared to just $5,280 in short positions. Despite this, the funding rate remains positive at 0.0065, indicating that more traders are paying to maintain long positions, a sign that bullish expectations persist even during this decline. SHIB’s price is currently at a critical juncture. While bearish momentum has been strong, a rebound remains possible if key support holds. The community’s optimism and growing market interest suggest that an upward break, while not guaranteed, remains on the table.

Despite this volatility, WCT/KRW trading volume on South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit reached $558 million in the last 24 hours, equivalent to 35% of the global WCT trading volume, suggesting that the decline may be due to South Korea. WCT futures have reached the brink of negative funding rates on major centralized exchanges (CEX). According to Coinglass data, the funding rate is currently hovering at -2% on most platforms. Total 24-hour trading volume reached $3.4 billion, while total open interest in the futures market reached $196 million. Related News: SEC Does Something It Rarely Does: Issues Negative Opinions on ETF Applications for Two Altcoins On-chain data also revealed a significant transfer that could be related to the volatility in the WCT price. On May 28, the address “0x19F…cCA67” received 2.5 million WCT from the WalletConnect project’s multi-signature wallet and transferred these tokens to Binance. The value of the transfer was recorded as approximately $2.34 million. The same address received 2.5 million WCT during the token launch (TGE) a month ago. It is claimed that this address may be connected to Arrington Capital, but it is not yet clear whether the transfer was made for market making or sales purposes. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents Game-changer investment platform: Unilabs sees growing demand Tron Network growth: What it means for TRX price? Key takeaways TRON Network has achieved a new milestone. Tether USDT by Tron has reached an all-time high in transactions: $600 billion. This shows the network’s growing role in stablecoin transfers in the crypto world. Meanwhile, Unilabs, a game-changing AI-powered platform, is giving tough competition to market leaders. In its ongoing presale, UNIL has shattered records by raising $1.39 million in just a week. While analysts predict some turbulence in the TRX price, Unilabs is all set to lead the market in the 2025 bull run. Find out more about UNIL and how the record transaction volume in the Tron network could impact the TRX price.

This platform is changing retail investing by providing access to institutional-grade investment strategies and tools without any human intervention. The project recently launched its token presale, raising over $1.39 million in a short period. This demonstrates high investor confidence in the platform and its potential for long-term growth. Unilabs uses the “Early Access Scoring System (EASS),” which evaluates over a thousand cryptocurrencies in real time. According to the market conditions and risk-reward ratio, the platform changes strategies across different market segments, including memecoins, different fund bases, and risk levels. The platform uses AI technology to make these funds and offers investors real-time NAV tracking for their peace of mind: AI Fund: Invests in projects rooted in artificial intelligence. BTC Fund: This fund covers various Bitcoin-related assets. RWA Fund: Invests in blockchain assets like commodities and real estate. Mining Fund: This fund lets investors earn from mining activities. With over $30 million in assets under management (AUM), Unilabs now leads the AI-crypto segment and is fully prepared to disrupt asset management. In its ongoing presale, UNIL tokens are available at a highly undervalued price of $0.0051. As AI adoption is increasing exponentially, Unilabs could be the biggest AI opportunity in the crypto market. Tron Network growth: What it means for TRX price? Tether (USDT) transactions on the TRON network have reached a record-breaking $600 billion, showing strong demand for the network’s services. Since January 2022, the Tron network has consistently handled more USDT volume than Ethereum, cementing its position as a key player in the stablecoin market. While some see TRON as a fading giant compared to newer Layer-1 blockchains, its rising on-chain activity tells a different story. The surge in USDT transactions highlights TRON’s growing utility, and this momentum could support a positive trend in the TRX price. After reaching a high of $0.44 in the November rally, the TRX price has faced immense bearish pressure, dropping below the $0.22 support. However, in the recent broader market reversal, the TRX price has surged 40% from the previous swing lows. Prominent crypto and DeFi analyst Zola Christian recently posted on X that the TRX price has performed impressively, rising 115% annually to date. He further added that the coin could soon break the $0.30 resistance level. While Tron Network has continuously grown outperforming giants like Ethereum, some analysts are still skeptical whether the TRX price could sustain the extended rally. Savvy investors are already diversifying into futuristic projects like Unilabs, which can explode in the upcoming rally. Key takeaways Tron Network is still growing steadily, but TRX has yet to show strong signs of a lasting price recovery. According to analysts, investors will start focusing on platforms that show technological strength and market-demand potential — the current market leader is Unilabs . Smart investors are paying close attention to the UNIL presale, and developments surrounding it are starting to resemble the early TRX before its 2024 rally.

As a result, confidence about its approval is going through the roof, with Polymarket data showing that it has hit 84%. ETFs enable diversification at a low cost because investors are not required to purchase individual assets. An XRP ETF will open the floodgates to institutional capital, making it an ideal stepping stone in this altcoin’s ecosystem.

This announcement follows the country’s establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, alongside other partnerships, in recent months. Pakistan’s pro-crypto stance has left the community elated, being among the countries to make a swift turn backing the market. IMF Wants Clarity: Report According to local news outlets, the IMF flagged Pakistan’s recent announcement by its pro-crypto task force to allocate 2000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin and AI data centers. The organization seeks clarity on its legality as major power shortages plague the country. This development comes amid sensitive budget talks between both parties as Pakistan looks to integrate digital assets into its economy. According to sources familiar with the matter, the government is yet to disclose a formal framework to the IMF, while the latter stressed that all policy steps under the External Fund Facility must be considered. Additionally, a delegation is expected to hold a separate session on the plan to provide electricity to Bitcoin and AI centres. “ There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative. The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the ongoing talks,” a source added. On May 25, Pakistan’s crypto task force allocated 2,000 megawatts of electricity to Bitcoin mining, seeking to attract foreign investment. Backed by the Finance Ministry, the move is expected to drive employment and generate revenue following massive global adoption of the asset class. The government also plans tax cuts and incentives for miners and AI firms. Bilal Bin Saqib, Task Force Chief Executive, explained that the decision was a turning point for the country’s economy. Pakistan’s Pro-Crypto Stance This year, Pakistan has become increasingly bullish on Bitcoin, contrary to its previous policies on the asset class. The country rolled out a Digital Asset Authority tasked with tokenizing government assets and licensing crypto platforms. Notably, the crypto task force launch and appointment of Changpeng Zhao as an adviser drew institutional attention. At the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, Saqib announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve inspired by the United States’ decision. So far, President Trump remains committed to his promise of clear and favourable policies to the sector.

After a brief period of relative stability, recent breakdowns on the daily and intraday charts suggest a shift in market momentum that traders can’t ignore. As bearish pressure mounts and critical support levels begin to falter, XRP’s next move has become a major topic – will it find its footing soon, or is a deeper correction on the horizon? The XRP Key Bullish Divergence In an X update, prominent crypto analyst Gowanus Monster highlighted a critical technical development for XRP. According to his analysis, the token has completed a bearish Descending Triangle formation across multiple timeframes, a classic pattern that often signals continuation to the downside. Based on the measured move from this structure, the projected target is around $1.90, suggesting a potentially significant retracement if bearish momentum continues to build. Related Reading: XRP Price Slips Again — Is a Deeper Correction Underway? Zooming out to the weekly chart, the pattern is beginning to evolve into a well-defined structure, with clear upper and lower boundaries. Gowanus Monster noted that the current focus lies on identifying a higher low within this channel. He also pointed to a key principle: when a price rebound from the upper boundary of a descending channel fails to reach the lower boundary, instead bottoming out early, it often precedes a bullish breakout to the upside. This nuanced behavior, if confirmed, may set the stage for XRP to defy the current bearish structure and ignite a fresh rally beyond the confines of its channel. Bear Trap Scenario: When Oversold Meets Demand According to crypto analyst GemXBT, XRP remains firmly entrenched in a short-term downtrend, with price action currently trading below the 5, 10, and 20-period moving averages. This alignment of moving averages is a classic sign of sustained bearish momentum, suggesting that sellers continue to dominate the market in the near term. Related Reading: XRP Price Confirms Bullish Reversal Setup With This Demand Zone Presently, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into the oversold zone, suggesting an imminent reversal or a period of consolidation as the market seeks equilibrium. Meanwhile, the MACD line remains below the signal line, indicating that downside pressure persists, and any potential recovery could face headwinds. From a price structure standpoint, GemXBT identified key support around $2.15, which could serve as a critical level for buyers to step in and defend. On the upside, resistance lies near $2.25, a zone that bulls would need to reclaim in order to shift short-term sentiment. The recent uptick in trading volume is worth noting, as it could introduce more volatility in the sessions ahead, either accelerating a breakdown if support fails or fueling a sharp recovery if sentiment flips.

This comes after the regulator’s announcement to delay a decision concerning these products. The SEC has repeatedly delayed the approvals of multiple altcoin ETFs citing recent rule changes and financial regulations. Cardano’s Decentralized Governance Offers Transparency The financial regulator monitors transparency, stability, and other factors to protect investors before approving a spot ETF. In a comment to the Commission, Dave highlighted multiple factors backing a spot Cardano product approval. According to the note, the network’s decentralized governance and on-chain mechanism show a clear and transparent path. Mirroring decentralization are a community-driven roadmap and treasury allocations. Cardano bulls argue that the blockchain has shown sufficient financial strength, soaring to a $28.8 billion market capitalization, which proves that it meets regulators’ standards and investor protection principles. Further, Dave lauded Cardano’s security and robust architecture over the years, describing it as resilient enough to bag a spot ETF product in the United States. Cardano has integrated 3,200 stake pools globally, ensuring no downtimes in the last decade. Supported by a clear and predictable monetary policy, its capped 45 billion ADA cools inflation concerns. “ Its clear and predictable monetary policy, including a capped maximum supply of 45 billion ADA, ensures transparency and addresses potential inflation concerns. Cardano’s global presence is complemented by a strong and growing U.S. footprint, with many contributors and projects based domestically, reinforcing its relevance to U.S. markets.” Dave wrote. The SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Cardano and Avalanche ETFs this week. Community sentiment dipped slightly with the ADA price pulling back 10% before marking gains. The wider market continues a sideways trading pattern as bullish sentiment drops over 48 hours. Bulls Poised For ADA Rally? Crypto traders have supported a bullish Cardano price range in the next two quarters. This follows growing institutional interest in the crypto market and a spike in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. As mainstream finance increases its crypto exposure, many investors are backing altcoins to lead the next bull cycle. Approval of spot ADA ETFs could be the catalyst for added bull pressure. After the launch of Bitcoin products , traditional investors increased their exposure, driving the price to new all-time highs. Cardano and other altcoins could move on a similar trajectory.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-31 20:34:18

Despite recent price stagnation, EGRAG asserts that XRP is showing signs of a potential major rally driven by strong historical indicators. Currently, the token is trading at approximately $2.19, having declined from a recent high of $2.65 reached on May 12. While short-term volatility has kept the asset consolidating around the $2 level, EGRAG believes the broader picture points toward significant upside potential. Historical Chart Patterns Suggest Bullish Momentum The foundation of EGRAG’s analysis lies in a recurring bullish engulfing candle formation observed on XRP’s yearly chart. A bullish engulfing candle consists of a small bearish candle followed by a larger bullish candle that entirely eclipses the previous one, signaling a possible trend reversal to the upside. #XRP – Candle Number 1⃣3⃣, Price $13 or $22 & The Noise Signal Here are the 3⃣ main themes we can unveil from the 12-month/yearly chart: 1⃣ Candle 1⃣2⃣: The Most Bullish Candle Formation Candle 12 was actually the strongest Bullish Engulfing pattern, the engulfing… pic.twitter.com/h1kqQRmshL — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 29, 2025 EGRAG notes that this pattern has been evident in XRP’s price movements since 2017. He highlights the significant example of a modest -0.68% red candle in 2016, followed by a massive green candle in 2017, which led to an exponential increase of over 33,000%. According to the analyst, the continuation of this pattern into 2024, reflected by what he labels “Candle 12,” is a strong technical signal that the trend could repeat. He emphasizes that bullish engulfing formations carry more weight when observed on higher time frames such as the 12-month chart, reinforcing the potential impact of the 2024 signal. Candle 13 and Forecasted Price Levels The analyst points to the current year, 2025, as “Candle 13” in this ongoing pattern series. At the time of analysis, XRP had already recorded a 6.53% gain for the year. Drawing parallels to previous cycles, EGRAG recalls a major price rally in 2021, referred to as “Candle 9”, which saw XRP rise by approximately 800%. If a similar increase were to occur in 2025, the asset could potentially reach $17. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition to candlestick patterns, EGRAG identifies three ascending trendlines on the long-term XRP chart. These lines represent historical levels of support and resistance. The analyst focuses on two resistance lines: Line 1 intersects at $13, and Line 2 at $22. He believes these levels are the most probable targets if the bullish scenario unfolds, suggesting that XRP could rise to either of these values depending on how the market develops. Short-Term Range Considered Market Noise Despite the optimistic long-term forecast, EGRAG cautions against misinterpreting short-term fluctuations as trend-defining moves. He characterizes the current price range between $1.85 and $3.4 as “market noise,” implying it is not a reliable indicator of the asset’s longer-term direction. However, he maintains that a close below $1.85 would invalidate the current bullish setup, while a close above $3.4 would confirm a continuation toward higher targets. EGRAG’s analysis underscores the potential for the asset to break out of its current consolidation phase and move toward double-digit prices. Backed by historical chart patterns and long-term resistance levels, his projection suggests that a rally to $13 or even $22 is plausible, provided XRP maintains its current upward momentum and avoids a close below critical support levels.

With TON eyeing $10 and SOL targeting $250, curiosity mounts: could Ethereum disrupt this momentum with a major move? This analysis delves into the potential surges of these cryptocurrencies and explores whether Ethereum has a big play up its sleeve. Stay tuned for insights into these digital assets. Toncoin: Price Trends and Key Levels Spark Tactical Trading Toncoin has seen a one-month decline of 3.10%, contrasting sharply with its significant six-month drop of 55.17%. A slight gain of 2.92% over the past week suggests potential for a short-term recovery. Recent price fluctuations indicate minor volatility, yet the long-term trend remains downward, causing some hesitance among traders regarding the asset’s long-term outlook. Weekly trading sessions show modest momentum, but the gains are insufficient to reverse the extensive decline noted in the previous months. Technical indicators reveal uncertainty, with the market oscillating between slight optimism and pessimism as participants monitor crucial support and resistance levels. Toncoin currently trades within a range of $2.55 to $3.99, with resistance levels at $4.82 and $6.26, while key support is positioned at $1.94 and a lower support around $0.50. Momentum indicators show mixed signals, with the Awesome Oscillator slightly positive but the Momentum Indicator negative. The Relative Strength Index sits at 47.20, indicating no overbought conditions. Bears have a slight advantage, as moving averages suggest caution, yet the recent uptick could hint at recovery. The price trend is unclear, with sideways movement indicating neither bulls nor bears have clear dominance. Traders should watch these levels for breakout opportunities or declines, utilizing tight stop-loss strategies to navigate this volatile market. Solana Price Analysis: Historical Trends and Key Levels Solana experienced a modest month-long increase of around 5%, while facing a week-long drop of roughly 11%, indicating short-term weakness. Over the past six months, SOL has slid by about 35%, reflecting significant downward pressure during this period. The price behavior shows mixed results with some recovery attempts amid ongoing volatility. The shifts in percentage values suggest an erratic performance where near-term improvements contrast with a prolonged decline. The current trading range for Solana hovers between $109 and $171, with the nearest resistance forming at $195 and clear support at $72. Bears dominate the market, indicated by a negative momentum indicator and an RSI near 40. A slightly positive Awesome Oscillator hints at potential undervaluation. Trading ideas may involve testing support for bounce opportunities or shorting near resistances if price action slows. The current setup suggests caution as traders await clearer signals for recovery or further declines. Ethereum Market Update: Recent Shifts and Key Boundaries Strong monthly gains of 40.42% contrast with a 32.14% decline over the past six months. Price movements have shown significant upswing in the last month, while the half-year trend indicates considerable downward pressure. The one-week change of -0.21% reflects limited reaction after a volatile period. Data shows a market oscillating between short-term strength and longer-term weakness. Indicators suggest brisk monthly movement, yet the asset remains vulnerable to broader bearish tendencies observed over the past half-year. Current ETH prices trade between $1468.66 and $2037.85, with support at $1142.44 and $573.25, while resistance stands at $2280.82 and $2850. Bears and bulls are battling for control as prices approach the first resistance level. Mixed signals from oscillators and momentum readings advise caution. Lack of a clear trend suggests strategic trades within these boundaries. Buyers may find opportunities near support levels, while sellers should monitor for breakdowns below key supports, staying alert to price movements in these defined zones. Conclusion Toncoin and Solana show potential for significant gains. Predictions suggest that TON could reach $10 and SOL might hit $250. Ethereum remains a key player that could make its own significant move. Market watchers are keenly observing these developments. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

45342841,https://thecoinrise.com/while-tron-climbs-and-hype-gains-blockdag-targets-20-with-25-referrals-live-and-a-record-breaking-279m-presale/,1748725228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/45342841.jpeg,"While Tron Climbs and HYPE Gains, BlockDAG Targets $20 with 25% Referrals Live and a Record-Breaking $279M Presale!",https://thecoinrise.com/while-tron-climbs-and-hype-gains-blockdag-targets-20-with-25-referrals-live-and-a-record-breaking-279m-presale/,"Crypto markets are shifting once again as Tron sees an unexpected price climb and Hyperliquid gains momentum with bullish forecasts pushing it toward new highs. Both projects are drawing attention, but the spotlight may be slightly misplaced. Tron is working to move past its historical baggage, and Hyperliquid is thriving on short-term hype. However, neither offers the clarity, infrastructure, or sustained traction currently driving BlockDAG (BDAG) forward. With over $279 million raised, a presale price still locked at $0.0018, and a projected target of $20, BlockDAG is emerging as one of the most strategic moves in the market. This is not just potential, it is progress unfolding in real time. Tron’s Price Climb Draws Interest, but Utility Questions Remain Tron has gained attention after pushing past key resistance and moving above $0.12, prompting talk of a trend reversal. Analysts highlight Tron’s consistent DApp usage, low transaction costs, and stable network metrics as signs that the rally may be supported by real engagement. This has created renewed short-term optimism across trading circles. However, concerns remain over Tron’s lack of innovation. The technology has seen few major updates, and its broader ecosystem still struggles with reputation issues. While traders may benefit from short-term movement, long-term value depends on whether Tron can deliver new functionality and shift the utility narrative meaningfully. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Rallies: Long-Term Picture Is Unclear Hyperliquid recently surged to nearly $38, triggering bullish calls for a continued move toward $45 or more. Backed by visible liquidity and Arthur Hayes’ involvement, the token has gained traction quickly. Traders are watching closely to see if HYPE can replicate the explosive growth of earlier breakout projects. Still, its long-term prospects remain uncertain. The market cap is relatively small, and HYPE has yet to prove long-lasting demand beyond initial hype cycles. Without strong infrastructure or mass user adoption, the project will need to show more than price action to secure lasting credibility in the market. BlockDAG Sets the Standard with Speed, Access, and a $20 Vision BlockDAG is not relying on hype to drive momentum. It is focused on delivering real infrastructure at scale. Built on a hybrid architecture combining blockchain and DAG technology, BlockDAG supports thousands of transactions per second without the congestion issues seen in projects like Tron and HYPE. This foundation is designed for speed, security, and long-term reliability. Beyond performance, BlockDAG is prioritising accessibility for developers. It is fully EVM-compatible, which means Ethereum developers can deploy on BlockDAG with ease. Tools like the Low-Code Smart Contract Builder open up Web3 to non-coders, allowing a broader range of users to build decentralised apps and financial tools without needing a technical background. The project has already raised over $279 million in its ongoing presale, with the price currently locked at $0.0018 until June 13. Despite the significant capital raised, BlockDAG remains early in its pricing curve. With a projected value of $20 by 2027, a $1,000 purchase today secures 555,555 BDAG tokens, which could translate to over $11 million in returns if the forecast is met. This is not a concept in development. BlockDAG is shipping real products, including the X10, X30, and X100 miners. It has 20 centralised exchange listings in motion and a Go Live Reveal set for June 13. While others are still promising, BlockDAG is already building and scaling for real adoption. Final Analysis Tron and HYPE are making headlines, but questions remain about their staying power. Tron’s innovation curve has slowed, and HYPE still needs to prove it can convert attention into lasting utility. In contrast, BlockDAG is building across every layer, from infrastructure to user engagement, with visible progress on-chain and off-chain. With a $0.0018 entry price, over $279 million raised, and a roadmap targeting $20, BlockDAG stands out as one of the few projects combining real execution with massive upside. In a market full of noise, it is the signal that serious early movers are paying attention to.

The ministry announced the donations, stating that they had sold the BTC. According to reports , the ministry had accepted a donation of 480 Bitcoins worth around 1 billion Czech Koruna (over $45 million) from Tomáš Jiřikovský, who previously served four years in prison. Jiřikovský was convicted for operating the darknet platform Sheep Marketplace, where users bought drugs and other illegal items. However, the platform stopped operating in 2013, which many considered an exit scam, as the operators disappeared with users’ money. It was not until 2016 that Jiřikovský would be arrested for the incident with a wallet containing over 1,500 Bitcoins found on his computer, according to authorities. He was eventually sentenced to prison for drug trafficking and embezzlement. Blažek’s decision to accept the donation despite the donor’s checkered history has landed him in hot water. Opposition parties have been especially critical of his actions, with speculations of money laundering since he did not know the origin of the funds. The bad press surrounding the incident appeared to be the major factor in the minister’s resignation. Although he has continued denying any wrongdoing, he said he resigned to prevent a negative impact on Prime Minister Peter Fiala’s coalition government. Interestingly, Blažek is a close ally of Fiala, with the two belonging to the same Civic Democratic Party. With the parliamentary election set to happen in October, there are concerns that the incident could further worsen the chances of the incumbent government , which many have already predicted would lose the election. Blažek defends Bitcoin donations Despite his decision to resign, Blažek has defended the ministry’s acceptance of the funds, noting that it was fully legal and would go towards improving the justice system. He highlighted several ways the ministry would use donations, including digitizing the justice system, improving housing conditions for prison staff, and helping fight drugs. According to him, Jiřikovský likely donated the funds to show remorse. He is reported to have said: “Why should a convicted person not be allowed to give something to the state, for example, as a form of penance?” Unsurprisingly, Prime Minister Fiala said that he believed the Justice Minister had acted in good faith and praised his decision to resign. However, many suggest there might be more to the donation than Blažek claims. According to reports , Jiřikovský has been trying to recover the Bitcoins the government seized from him upon his arrest. Although he claimed that he had obtained them legally, which entitles him to keep them, investigations at the time suggested they might be connected to another darknet marketplace, Nucleus. Nucleus shut down the day Jiřikovský was arrested. Czech authorities are investigating the donation Interestingly, Jiřikovský’s lawyer had reached out to Blažek to negotiate the return of the seized assets with an agreement that one-third of the funds would be donated to the ministry. The minister reportedly agreed. This eventually led to the signing of an agreement and the movement of Bitcoin, which was connected to Nucleus, to another wallet in March after being dormant for almost 10 years. While Blažek insisted that he had no interest in the case, which happened long ago, the circumstances around the incident continue to raise eyebrows. Meanwhile, Czech legal authorities are investigating the Bitcoin donation to determine the source of the funds. Given Jiřikovský’s past, there are concerns that the funds might be part of money laundering from criminal activity. According to reports , the National Headquarters for Combating Organization is investigating the incident, while the Public Prosecutor Office for Olomouc is separately probing whether the minister, as a public official, exceeded his powers.

45343071,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69230,1748726109,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s how XRP Could Hit $100 Price Milestone,https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-xrp-could-hit-100-price-milestone/,"The XRP Ledger is beginning to realize its foundational goal of supporting asset tokenization on a large scale. In 2025, the network has witnessed increased traction from institutions seeking to digitize real-world assets, and this trend could become a key factor in propelling XRP to a significantly higher valuation, potentially as high as $100 . Effect of Increased Institutional Adoption XRP’s price movement has historically been influenced by its utility in cross-border transactions, but tokenization may now represent a new growth catalyst. Analysts argue that as more institutions adopt XRPL to digitize real-world assets, such as real estate, private equity, or government bonds, XRP will be in greater demand to facilitate these transactions. Because XRP serves as a bridge asset on the ledger, large-scale tokenization may require institutional participants to hold substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. This would effectively remove a portion of XRP’s circulating supply from open markets. As demand increases and accessible supply diminishes, market dynamics could shift in favour of higher prices. This scenario, grounded in classic supply and demand theory, suggests that if XRPL’s utility in tokenization continues to expand and institutions continue accumulating XRP, the resulting scarcity could put strong upward pressure on the token’s value. Technological Enhancements Supporting XRPL Tokenization To support these developments, Ripple has implemented multiple updates aimed at making XRPL more suitable for institutional use. In Q3 2024, Ripple introduced the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard. MPTs are designed to function as hybrid tokens, offering both fungible and non-fungible characteristics. They also enable the inclusion of additional data, such as legal terms or asset-specific metadata, making them highly useful for financial institutions. Another critical upgrade came in October 2024, when XRPL integrated Decentralized Identity (DID) capabilities. This feature ensures that tokenized assets on the ledger can comply with regulatory frameworks, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. These improvements are essential for attracting serious institutional participants seeking regulatory-compliant infrastructure for asset digitization. Practical Implementations Gaining Traction Several initiatives launched in 2025 reflect growing institutional interest in XRPL-based tokenization. One major example is a collaboration between the Dubai Land Department and the Dubai Future Foundation. This partnership resulted in a $16 billion real estate tokenization platform built on XRPL, allowing individuals to invest in property with as little as AED 2,000. The project has already attracted over 3,000 investors and offers reduced transaction costs.

Aurum Equity Partners has introduced a $1 billion tokenized fund encompassing private equity and debt instruments, while Ripple’s partnership with Ondo Finance aims to bring tokenized U.S. Treasury products to XRPL. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has emphasized the growing role of XRPL in facilitating real-world asset tokenization. His remarks at the Apex 2023 developer summit affirmed that the network is increasingly being viewed as a reliable platform for institutional-grade projects. Market Limitations and Cautionary Notes While the long-term prospects appear promising, there are notable limitations to the idea that XRP could reach $100 in the near term. Such a valuation would imply a market capitalization of approximately $5.9 trillion, far exceeding the current total cryptocurrency market cap, which is around $3.33 trillion. For XRP to attain that value, the entire digital asset market would need to grow substantially. At present, the token is priced at $2.19. Achieving the $100 milestone would require a 4,466% increase, which analysts agree would only be plausible under conditions of explosive industry-wide growth and sustained institutional demand. The XRPL’s expanding role in tokenization and its technological upgrades have positioned it as a viable platform for institutional adoption. If demand continues to rise while the available XRP supply contracts due to increased holding by institutions, upward price movement could follow. However, reaching the $100 target would depend heavily on broader market growth and continued utility-driven adoption.

For new participants in digital assets, choosing the right entry points is crucial. The ideal assets for beginners combine usability, clear utility, and community-driven growth, rather than simply chasing hype or volatility.This week, three standout projects exemplify this principle. Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as a breakout leader, offering a feature-rich ecosystem that prioritizes accessibility and privacy, notably through its decentralized VPN. Meanwhile, Bittensor (TAO) and Cosmos (ATOM) represent cornerstone protocols with proven infrastructure and network effects. Each serves a distinct role in the blockchain world, but all are considered among the best cryptos for beginners seeking long-term utility and technological credibility. Qubetics (TICS): Redefining Privacy with a Decentralized VPN Network Qubetics continues to attract significant attention as one of the best cryptos for beginners , driven by a practical approach to digital privacy and cross-chain access. Among its most compelling features is the Decentralized VPN (dVPN) built into the Qubetics ecosystem. This innovative infrastructure offers secure, anonymous internet access without relying on centralized VPN providers—effectively eliminating single points of failure, censorship risks, and user tracking. The Qubetics dVPN allows users to route traffic through decentralized nodes, creating a dynamic network that enhances anonymity and resilience. For professionals handling sensitive client data, journalists operating in restrictive jurisdictions, or everyday users accessing geo-restricted content, the Qubetics VPN provides uncompromised security. It also opens new revenue models, enabling individuals to monetize unused bandwidth as node operators—fostering a community-powered privacy economy. Enterprises can integrate this decentralized VPN directly into internal systems, ensuring that employees and departments across geographies connect through secure channels without dependence on legacy providers. For example, a fintech startup managing international transactions can utilize Qubetics’ VPN for encrypted backend operations, reducing vulnerability to surveillance and cyber-attacks. Analysts’ Projections for $TICS In parallel with these utility-driven innovations, Qubetics is executing the most successful crypto presale of 2025. The platform has now entered its 36th stage, selling over 514 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,300 holders, with $17.5 million raised. The current price is $0.3064 per token. Analysts tracking Qubetics have forecasted various growth trajectories depending on user adoption and integration levels. A post-presale valuation of $1 suggests a 226% ROI, while mid-range targets of $5 and $6 offer 1,531% and 1,857% returns respectively. At $10, the return exceeds 3,163%, and at $15 following the mainnet launch, community participants could see up to 4,794% ROI. Qubetics combines essential digital privacy through decentralized VPNs with real-world interoperability and growing early adoption. Its presale performance and functional innovation position it clearly among the best cryptos for beginners looking to build a meaningful position in Web3 infrastructure. Bittensor (TAO): Advancing Decentralized AI Through Open Participation Bittensor (TAO) has carved out a unique and increasingly vital niche at the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence. It enables an open, decentralized machine learning protocol where participants contribute computational resources and intelligence models in exchange for on-chain rewards. The result is a constantly improving, distributed AI ecosystem that grows in performance and scope with every new participant. Unlike traditional AI systems controlled by corporations, Bittensor democratizes access to machine learning. Developers, data scientists, and independent researchers can plug into the Bittensor network to share and monetize models while improving the collective intelligence of the system. This incentivized model-building creates a feedback loop of utility and innovation, with TAO as the native token facilitating interactions and rewards. The protocol is particularly popular among AI-focused Web3 developers and institutions experimenting with decentralized knowledge aggregation. As AI integration spreads across industries—finance, healthcare, legal, education—Bittensor’s scalable infrastructure provides an efficient, neutral alternative to siloed AI services. From an accessibility standpoint, Bittensor lowers the barrier to AI monetization. A developer building a niche model for sentiment analysis or fraud detection can submit their output to Bittensor and receive TAO rewards as long as their model contributes value to the network. This open contribution model is a powerful entry point for technically inclined beginners eager to explore AI within a blockchain context. Bittensor represents a paradigm shift in how artificial intelligence can be built, owned, and monetized. For beginners interested in AI and Web3 convergence, it’s a standout among the best cryptos for beginners due to its real-world potential and decentralized ethos. Cosmos (ATOM): The Internet of Blockchains Enabling Scalable Interoperability Cosmos (ATOM) stands as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure, celebrated for pioneering interoperability through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Rather than building one chain to rule them all, Cosmos provides a framework for connecting independent blockchains into a cooperative, scalable ecosystem. The Cosmos SDK enables developers to launch purpose-built blockchains customized for specific applications—from DeFi protocols and NFT platforms to CBDC pilots and gaming infrastructure. These chains operate independently but communicate seamlessly through IBC, enabling token transfers, cross-chain governance, and data exchange. This modular architecture makes Cosmos a go-to for enterprises and developers prioritizing flexibility and scalability. National governments and corporations have deployed solutions using Cosmos tech, such as Colombia’s central bank’s pilot for blockchain-based finance and various Web3 projects migrating from Ethereum due to gas fee efficiency. For new community participants, Cosmos offers multiple entry points. Individuals can stake ATOM to secure the network, delegate to validators, or participate in governance decisions. Developers can launch chains or apps on the Cosmos Hub or any compatible zone, while tech-curious buyers can explore the broader Cosmos ecosystem via integrated wallets and dApps. Cosmos is widely respected for its contribution to blockchain architecture. It serves as the technical backbone of many modern Layer 1s and application chains, reinforcing its importance as a long-term infrastructure play. Cosmos delivers technical sophistication with user-centric flexibility. Its interoperability and real-world deployments make it one of the best cryptos for beginners seeking foundational exposure to blockchain innovation and scalability. Final Thoughts For those exploring the digital asset space, not every project delivers both accessibility and long-term value. Qubetics offers a beginner-friendly gateway through practical tools like a decentralized VPN and seamless cross-chain access—paired with a highly active presale signaling widespread adoption. Its use cases stretch from privacy protection to enterprise integration. Bittensor provides a revolutionary model for how AI can evolve within open-source, decentralized frameworks. It invites participation from developers and researchers seeking autonomy and network-based rewards. Meanwhile, Cosmos offers an unparalleled platform for blockchain scalability through secure, modular interoperability that empowers businesses and developers alike. This trio—Qubetics, Bittensor, and Cosmos—reflects the next wave of high-utility crypto infrastructure. Each is designed with a clear mission, real-world impact, and a growing community that makes them not only reliable but also educational starting points for new digital asset adopters. To get involved early, consider securing $TICS tokens before Stage 36 ends. Access privacy, scale, and interoperability—right from the beginning.

Bitcoin falls below $104K support; the next test lies at $ 97K – $99 K for potential reversal. Ethereum struggles below key EMAs, with support at $2,400-$2,450 and risk of further decline. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) are approaching significant points in their price trends. SHIB has dropped in price after falling below critical supports, and Bitcoin has shown signs that it may reverse following its recent highs. Ethereum is moving within an upward-sloping channel, struggling to choose a clear path. As of press time, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001237 , down by a 7.80% drop over the past day. The meme coin recently dropped below its 50-day EMA support, which had been holding its price for the previous few months. As a result of this breach, there is a concern about lower prices, which could drop below the support range of $0.0000120-$0.000009. In this case, SHIB would increase by another zero, and this could make investors anxious and more likely to sell their SHIB.

The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. However, buyers aim for a surge by sending the price above the EMA20 trend line. MANTA price chart The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.78, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost an upward correction.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.256, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.327. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.196, resulting in a correction to $0.16. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price has triggered a strong bearish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers failed to maintain the buying pressure around local tops. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday, describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time.

Ryan Yi, a former member of Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, thinks that the exchange could still acquire Circle. Coinbase USDC Shares Records Growth According to an X post, Yi suggested that Coinbase would capitalize on USDC’s growing importance by acquiring Circle. The publicly traded company has a share of USDC circulation, and over the years, this share has experienced tremendous growth. In Q1 2025 alone, Coinbase USDC shares increased to 23% of the total supply of the stablecoin, reflecting massive growth. It is, therefore, little wonder that the USD-pegged stablecoin ranks as the second-largest source of Coinbase revenue. On this basis, Yi says that the acquisition of Circle would help the crypto exchange fully capture the revenue around USDC. Coinbase and Ripple in Battle to Acquire Circle Unfortunately, Coinbase is not the only company bidding to take over Circle’s stablecoin system . While the crypto exchange is having informal talks with the USDC issuer, San Francisco-based Ripple offered Circle $5 billion. The firm later rejected this particular offer because it was small. At first, Ripple was unsure whether to try again or walk away from the bid. However, once Coinbase came into the picture, the competition became steep, and the blockchain payment firm more than doubled its offer to $11 billion in cash and XRP. Until now, the terms of Coinbase’s offer remain unknown. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently stated that Ripple’s acquisition of Circle will benefit the broader crypto market. He noted that it could make the industry more open and fair. Circle Files For IPO, Plans to List Shares on NYSE Amidst these acquisition talks, Coinbase is focusing its attention on going public before this year ends. The company officially filed for an IPO just before the end of May , citing that it plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” The firm is targeting an IPO valuation of up to $5.65 billion. This fund will come from the company selling about 9.6 million new shares, while current shareholders will sell another 14.4 million. Circle is looking forward to getting support from some of the biggest names in finance, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and many others. The IPO filing suggests that neither Coinbase nor Ripple will acquire the company.

According to a May 20 article on the Binance blog, WCT’s price pumped from a meager $0.35 at the start of the month to a stunning (and suspicious, in retrospect) peak above $1.30 – an approximately 270 percent increase in just two weeks. According to Binance data, WCT surged from $0.35 to above $1.3 over the past month, but in the last two days, WCT has plummeted sharply, halving to around $0.65. In the past 24 hours, South Korea's largest exchange, Upbit, recorded a WCT/KRW trading volume of $558 million,… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 31, 2025 However, WCT’s price promptly plummeted over the weekend, falling back down to around $0.65 by May 21 and thus appearing to have given back about half its earlier gains in what some might call a “get-rich-quick scheme” gone wrong. Even with the actual price movements, we see an ecosystem that is highly active and engaged around WCT. South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, has emerged as a major venue for trading WCT. They account for a large part of the global WCT trading volume right now. And staking with Wallet Connect continues to see robust participation in my opinion; tens of thousands of stakers have locked up millions of tokens for long-term holds. Sharp Price Surge and Sudden Correction WCT’s price moved in surprising ways over the last month. Starting from near $0.35, the token surged ahead, seemingly unanchored by anything other than the rising interest in and adoption of the Wallet Connect protocol. By half-past the month, WCT crossed the $1.3 threshold, making it appear as if WCT might be a solid buy at some point last month. The positive progress of the Wallet Connect ecosystem helped partly to fuel this rally. It has, for one, extended its partnerships to a much greater degree than before. And it is now celebrating an upsurge in the use of its decentralized wallet connection technology. Traders sensibly concluded that the development was an opportunity to invade the exchanges en masse and push prices higher. The euphoria was, however, short-lived. Within just 48 hours, WCT witnessed a sharp turnaround. The token’s price sank to nearly 50%, before recovering to the mid-$0.60 levels. Mid-level market corrections of this nature are not uncommon in the crypto space. But the suddenness and size of this downturn have certainly captured the attention of more than just WCT investors. Market analysts are now casting shared speculative nets over a few probable causes, including: 1. Profit-taking by early investors. 2. Broad market conditions. 3. Concentrated trading on certain exchanges. WCT Upbit Leads with Massive Trading Volume The recent price action has a key element, which is the oversized role that Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange, has been playing. Just in the last 24 hours, the trading volume clocked by Upbit for WCT/KRW was $558 million. That figure is not just a number; it makes Upbit that much more relevant a player in the WCT space, as this accounts for about 35% of the total global trading volume for WCT. This gives insight into something that had not been in focus, which is the role of South Korean traders in WCT. WCT trading is concentrated at Upbit, which means there is regional interest and liquidity in the token. South Korean crypto investors have been major players in many digital asset markets. For this reason, and because WCT has been trading at a premium on Upbit, we take the above as indications of investor confidence in the long-term performance of this token. Upbit’s trading volume is high. This means that if someone decides to buy a large amount of something and a few people working for the exchange also decide to buy, then by the time you could buy, the price has already gone up. And conversely, if a big sell order comes through, these kinds of price movements can influence the sentiment that others have about the whole market. Wallet Connect Staking Growth Reflects Strong Community Engagement Apart from trading, the staking platform of Wallet Connect portrays an enlightening picture depicting a devoted and burgeoning user base. At present, there exist 47,439 stakers who have collectively committed an excess of 120 million WCT tokens to the staking contract. This sizeable amount of staked tokens bodes well for the sorts of governance and security undertaken by the Wallet Connect network. 47,439 stakers. 120M+ WCT already staked. 119,839 WCT rewards distributed this week alone. Staking takes seconds, secures the network, and puts your WCT to work. Here's how pic.twitter.com/jmhKkh46XR — WalletConnect (@WalletConnect) May 30, 2025 Complementing this image of the platform’s active engagement with the community, it distributed rewards in the past week alone of nearly 120,000 WCT in staking rewards. This ongoing incentive for holders to stake their tokens, thus contributing to a reduced circulating supply, is yet another potential mechanism for price stability over time. Since we started discussing this, by the way, I’ve noticed price actions seemingly toning down as well. The increase in staking activity shows that, in spite of recent price swings, the Wallet Connect ecosystem is growing and allowing us to participate in a way that feels now, as it did in the past, much more intimate. For holders, staking is a way to gain when the protocol gains but also a way to bolster the protocol’s long-term resilience. Looking Ahead: Navigating Volatility and Opportunity The recent surge in price and the subsequent correction of WCT offer a clear view of the challenges and opportunities of moving too quickly in the crypto markets. Not every project is as firmly rooted in a community, and not every project offers as much exposure to future price action as WCT does. But for investors in projects like WCT, this is a lesson to be learned. People in the market will probably keep a close eye on how the token does in the next several weeks—especially since the broader market is changing. For holders who are in it for the long term and for fresh investors, figuring out the imbrication of trading activity, regional markets, and staking will be crucial to making any kind of assessment about WCT’s future. At the same time, the expanding network of Wallet Connect and the continuing staking rewards present a strong and compelling base that may enable the token to ride out its present volatility and possibly command further upward price action in the next several months.

45344009,https://nulltx.com/?p=150128,1748727862,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,FTX Begins Second Phase of $5 Billion Fund Distribution to Creditors,https://nulltx.com/ftx-begins-second-phase-of-5-billion-fund-distribution-to-creditors/,"FTX , the cryptocurrency exchange, has now started round two of sending back funds to its users. The exchange has returned to the convenience class creditors and is considering the next steps for those in the non-convenience class. That means if you traded on the exchange and didn’t send over a passport picture, you might still get some crypto back. To the extent that FTX can return some of these assets, that’s a positive development, said James Murphy, an associate professor at American University’s Washington College of Law. The firm has announced that qualifying customers should see their funds credited to their accounts within one to three business days from the time of the announcement. This is an initial step in what promises to be a rather long recovery for creditors following FTX’s sudden collapse. Understanding the Second Distribution: Who Benefits and What to Expect The second distribution from FTX bankrupt estate marks one of the biggest single-payout moments of the whole bankruptcy case. This time, 5 billion dollars is being handed over in a kind of 50-50 split between two main categories of creditors: the convenient class and the non-convenient class. Now, the convenient class, according to FTX and its lawyers, generally includes smaller account holders with balances below 1 million dollars, while the non-convenient class includes anyone with an account balance above that threshold. So, in the convenient class, we’ve got a bunch of smaller account holders, and in the non-convenient class, we’ve got larger account holders and what seems to be a lot of institutional clients. (1/3) FTX today announced that it has commenced the Second Distribution of more than $5 billion to holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes that have completed the pre-distribution requirements. — FTX (@FTX_Official) May 30, 2025 For creditors to be included in this second distribution, they were required to finish some verification steps and submit the essential documentation that confirms their claims as valid. Payouts only went to accounts that had completed these steps and were therefore eligible for distributions. Meanwhile, FTX’s attorneys and restructuring team have been working intensively behind the scenes to verify as many claims as possible and ensure that the integrity of the process is above board. Cash should arrive in creditors’ accounts within a few days, so lots of folks are apparently seeing movement on their accounts. For most, movement means something along the lines of this tweet from BlackLine customer account recovery director Joe Kavanagh: “@BlackLine has processed and successfully accounted for the cash received from our unsecured creditors. Thank you for your hard work and transparency in this process!” Security Alert: FTX Warns Against Phishing Scams In conjunction with the announcement of the distribution, FTX also issued an essential security reminder. This reminder was aimed at protecting customers from the upsurge of phishing scams and fraudulent websites attempting to mimic official FTX communications. Since the exchange’s collapse, scam actors have exploited the customer uncertainty created by these events. They have done so by sending deceptive emails and creating fake portals that look like FTX’s official platforms. FTX advises users to exercise extreme caution when receiving any email or link purporting to be from the company. The announcement emphasized that all legitimate communications will originate from verified channels, and implored customers not to click on any links that look even somewhat suspicious or to furnish any amount of sensitive information on sites that are not quite as secure as Fort Knox. This warning comes as an especially critical reminder because customers are getting ready to receive large amounts of money back into their accounts. During times of high customer activity, scammers step up their game in trying to steal login info and personal details. Customers can stay a couple of steps ahead of these threats by being on the lookout and confirming that the communications they’re receiving are actually from the companies they do business with. What the Future Holds for FTX Creditors Although the second distribution is a momentous step, it is just one part of what is an all-too-regular appearance of this ongoing, larger process. The appearances may seem familiar, but the plot is not yet resolved. As FTX keeps going with its long, somewhat drawn-out bankruptcy saga, it and we too can expect some more asset-recovery appearances and creditor claim-finalization appearances, with some releases in between. Here is the latest appearance. For a lot of people, this second payment could almost be like a hug. It may be as close to an apology as we get from FTX. And in the absence of such an apology, companies going under historically haven’t been very good at saying sorry. My excuse-making earlier in this piece aside, this payment could almost position FTX as a better actor than the normal Chapter 11 players. Figuring out what happens next requires remembering that FTX is a global company. Meanwhile, clients must keep themselves updated via FTX’s official communication channels, make sure they complete any remaining tasks that concern them, and follow any and all security notifications that come from the exchange. FTX’s promise to be as upfront and engaging with its creditors as possible is, within my view, crucial to the rebuilding of trust that is necessary for any kind of meaningful resolution to occur. This latest distribution marks a crucial step forward in an unprecedented chapter of crypto history. For the thousands affected, it brings hope that the recovery process is tangible and progressing, even as many challenges remain to be addressed in the months to come.

45344060,https://nulltx.com/?p=150127,1748727973,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,NATIX and Bittensor Unite to Pioneer Decentralized AI Mining for Real-World Autonomy,https://nulltx.com/natix-and-bittensor-unite-to-pioneer-decentralized-ai-mining-for-real-world-autonomy/,"A new decentralized AI frontier is forming that combines the gathering of physical data, a distributed machine learning infrastructure, and tokenized incentives to produce even smarter, real-world artificial intelligence. Leading this evolution is NATIX Network, a decentralized sensor platform that is changing how we gather, process, and deploy the kind of data that underpins autonomous driving. NATIX is moving from merely gathering sensor data to using it to train artificial intelligence models in earnest, and it has done this by establishing a dedicated subnet on Bittensor, a decentralized AI compute protocol. This move is nothing less than a leap in the architecture of AI, an evolution that emphasizes the use of real-world data over synthetic “training sets” and, in this case, “rewards” competitive performance with “real” economic value. Street-Level Video Becomes Training Fuel in Subnet 72 This development’s beating heart is Subnet 72, known as StreetVision. It is NATIX’s new home for crowdsourced video data. This data, when raw and freshly captured, comes from a global fleet of a quarter of a million drivers who have signed on to participate in NATIX’s venture. These drivers have mapped over 170 million kilometers. Their trajectory takes them through every conceivable real-world context—from journeys that are unremarkable to those encompassing something really unusual. These are the kinds of adventures that yield traffic signals, construction detours, and other road videos—such as the footage that an American driver made of the unfurling of a tornado while he was inside the funnel cloud. On Subnet 72, decentralized AI participants — often referred to as miners — compete to process the incoming video data, pinpointing aspects of the feed that it is essential to recognize if one is going to navigate the virtual world constructed from this real-world input. Each participant runs a particular model or set of models, usually within the family of AI algorithms known as deep learning, to derive the insights that Bittensor needs to make sense of the data it receives. 1/ Decentralized Physical AI meets AI mining. @natixnetwork ’s new Bittensor subnet transforms crowdsourced street-level video into deployable AI models for autonomous driving and mapmaking. Real-world sensors → decentralized training → smarter AI agents. pic.twitter.com/IXcvFxPzYw — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) May 30, 2025 The continuous feedback loop is created through this process. Data collected from the real world immediately trains and fine-tunes AI models, which are then put back into NATIX’s edge devices. These include intelligent dashcams and the mobile sensors that drivers in the network use. The result is a system where the development of the AI doesn’t happen in some far-off lab but is intimately connected to real-world usage and is tested in the kinds of environments that serve its purpose. Decentralization, Incentives, and Real-Time Deployment What differentiates NATIX’s approach is its devotion to every layer of decentralization—from data acquisition to model training and deployment. Where centralized systems demand proprietary infrastructure and siloed datasets, NATIX and Bittensor rely on open participation and competition to propel innovation. Not only does this structure make AI development accessible for all, but it also democratizes the process when it comes to performance. With miners pitted against one another in a contest to see who can build the best model, the subnet is setting up an incredibly effective incentive to continuously iterate and optimize. The outcome? Better models, better data extraction, and better navigation tools—and then some. It is significant that this procedure does not merely end with the formation of the model. The outputs from the subnet are put to work immediately in real time on the edge device. This means that the AI isn’t just trained on the most recent data; it’s actual learning from it live and using it to continuously shape its own future performance. The implication of this is of massive magnitude: self-updating maps, self-driving cars that can shift with the changing environment, and urban analytics that are created as a kind of continuous performance from street-level devices. Tokenomics Reinforce Long-Term Alignment Driving this innovation is a meticulously designed incentive system. Emissions from the $TAO token power Subnet 72, which compensates AI miners for their work. But NATIX has gone a step further, committing to reinvest emissions back into the ecosystem via buybacks and token burns. This deflationary mechanism adds long-term value to the system and keeps platform growth and token health in alignment. At the same time, parallel liquidity pools for dynamic TAOs help maintain value and stimulate even more participation. These pools are set up to allow the AI miners and participants to have immediate access to liquidity. At the same time, they’re set up to allow long-term staking strategies and reinvestment strategies, which are designed to benefit the network as a whole. The mechanisms work in unison to create a closed economic loop. Data provides the fuel; AI provides the power; insights generate the value. And that value reinforces the system that made it possible. A Glimpse Into the Future of Decentralized AI The collaboration between NATIX and Bittensor shows a daring vision of what decentralized AI can be when it’s based on real-world data, near real-time feedback, and economic incentives. This isn’t just about training better, more intelligent models — it’s about constructing a system that can learn from the real world, get better with every passing moment, and make intelligent use of the contributions that its various denizens make to its workings. This model could completely change our conception of autonomous navigation, and even infrastructure planning, the sorts of things one might be tempted to call maps. NATIX is an AI living system — a loop, not in the lab, but with the streets of an urban world as its setup. Subnet 72 is developing toward something that could well be a new kind of AI: decentralized, deployable, and not driven by confined research-lab innovation but by the kinds of street-level realness that makes everything we talk about with respect to crypto and web3 a potential reality. Where does that leave your average AI researcher? Well, for just a moment, let’s leave the average researcher out of it. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

No more has this been true than on the fresh frontier of Virtuals Genesis, a speculative new zone for on-chain launches. As some virtual projects seek to establish themselves, a handful of contenders has vaulted to the front of the pack, reaping outsized returns on early investments and catching the eye of discerning critics. The front-runners are two tokens: $VIRGEN from the Virgen ecosystem and $SOLACE from Solace Launch. Counting these two as the leading tokens, at their peak, they have rewarded their presale participants with incredible returns, with $VIRGEN delivering a 132x return on investment (ROI) and $SOLACE not far behind at 130x. Top Virtuals Genesis performers as per their ATH ROI's Which one did you participate? $Virgen @virgen_official is the top performer with a 132x return (at peak price) for presale participants, closely followed by $Solace @solacelaunch at 130x Data provided by @WhaleintelAI … pic.twitter.com/MrrECSd6Nd — 100xDarren (@100xDarren) May 31, 2025 Virgen ($VIRGEN): The Best Performer of the Bunch Leading the ROI leaderboard is $VIRGEN, with an impressive peak return of 132x for early investors. In fact, it’s the most successful token launch to date under the Virtuals Genesis framework — a shining example of not just market enthusiasm, but project execution as well. Virgen’s place in the broader ecosystem seems to be hitting all the right notes. It’s a blend of utility, tokenomics, and community that is, at least for now, taking $VIRGEN places. However, it is not just the record-breaking price of $VIRGEN that makes it stand out; it’s also the fact that large stakeholders are consistently and confidently accumulating it. And the on-chain data from last month says it all. In a very clear and unmistakable signal of confidence, the top 100 wallets, holding the largest amounts of $VIRGEN, increased their holdings by a staggering over 254 million tokens in just eight days. That is not a typo. They went from holding a collective approximately 388.45 million tokens on May 22 to now holding a collective approximately 642.86 million tokens as of May 30. $VIRGEN holders are stacking. Over the past 30 days, the top 100 addresses increased their $VIRGEN holdings from approximately 388.45M on May 22 to 642.86M by May 30. That’s a +254M token increase, or +65% growth in holdings. Clear sign: large holders are accumulating. pic.twitter.com/Dk84ndRrzq — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 30, 2025 This signals a 65% increase in the strength of support held by the largest holders, a group that includes many insiders and also well-capitalized market participants. It is both unusual and praiseworthy for these key holders not to take profits and instead to “double down”—to maintain or increase their positions in what is often a very early- and very superficial-selloff market. Their not taking profits and instead doubling down signals a long-term belief in this project and in the idea that its current path promises to pay off in a way that will make headlines. Solace ($SOLACE): Close Contender with 130x ROI Just behind $VIRGEN in the Virtuals Genesis rankings is $SOLACE, the native token of the Solace Launch platform. With a peak return of 130x for presale buyers, Solace has quickly become one of the most closely observed tokens within its niche. Its success reflects the growing demand for launchpad-driven projects that have well-structured tokenomics, transparent rollout plans, and governance models that put the community first. The allure of Solace is not solely in its stellar finances but in its far-reaching mission to help rebuild a broken system. It adopts a decentralized model, which directly addresses one of the crypto industry’s most pressing problems — access to the very tools and resources that make putting together a new project feasible and safe in today’s perilous climate. Solace is, in effect, acting as a launchpad, but in a way that saves its users from the many hazards en route to achieving lift-off. Although the same level of detail as in $VIRGEN has not been disclosed about specific whale activity concerning $SOLACE, the fact that it almost matched $VIRGEN’s ROI at peak strongly suggests that confidence in the market is quite high. In the coming weeks, it will be important to keep an eye on just how much early adopters are still participating in and engaging with the platform as it begins to scale its launch offerings. What These Returns Say About the Current Market What we see with the $VIRGEN and $SOLACE launches is something extraordinary. Even in today’s market, where many timely projects are having trouble finding post-launch traction, these two do—finding it in a major way. So if you didn’t catch these vibes in real-time, that’s the value of this piece: to put you on to the clear and present value of what are now $VIRGEN and $SOLACE. Furthermore, the accumulation of $VIRGEN by top holders indicates a change in behavior. In a landscape often characterized by short-term flipping and exit liquidity games, seeing major addresses accumulate rather than offload signals a level of strategic conviction not frequently observed in new token launches. This may suggest we are at a point where some sophisticated players are treating certain assets far beyond the speculative realm and as real long-term plays. As the Virtuals Genesis fringes continues to grow, the performance of early leaders like $VIRGEN and $SOLACE sets a high bar — not just in ROI, but in community trust, project delivery, and token holder behavior. Whether this trend continues will depend on market conditions, upcoming launches, and the ability of these projects to scale without losing their early momentum. At present, they have displayed what can occur when nascent crypto comprehends how to behave — and they have significantly elevated the standard every subsequent token must attempt to meet.

45344175,https://nulltx.com/?p=150125,1748728212,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Inside the Stellar Ecosystem: Data-Driven Growth Across DeFi Protocols,https://nulltx.com/inside-the-stellar-ecosystem-data-driven-growth-across-defi-protocols/,"The Stellar network, long recognized for its emphasis on speedy and low-cost payments, is subtly making its way into an exciting decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Through a set of imaginative applications, the Stellar blockchain is witnessing an upsurge in on-chain activity that, to many observers, seems to signal a fresh wave of adoption by developers and users who are actually diversified in use cases. This also seems to signal an emerging ecosystem of sorts. Although Ethereum and other big chains get most of the publicity, Stellar’s DeFi protocols are asserting themselves in more low-key fashion. They don’t get much in the way of good publicity. Yet, when you take a look at them, and you pull up their statistics, you can see that they’re getting some pretty decent traction. Respectable January volumes have made their way into February. Liquidity Grows Across Aquarius and Soroswap Stellar’s two most active platforms that focus on liquidity — Aquarius and Soroswap — are showing that a solid DeFi infrastructure is building on-chain. Aquarius, which aims to increase the decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity on Stellar, has seen the total volume of swaps reach the $50 million milestone. With the volume of swaps remaining alive and active on a weekly basis, questions are being asked about whether this liquidity is truly deep and sustainable or just temporary flotsam and jetsam. That said, we will give Aquarius the credit it is due for being quite obviously the local automated market maker (AMM) in the Oasis ecosystem when looking across the total landscape. Soroswap, meanwhile, is operating as a full-scale liquidity engine. It has recorded more than $21 million in total swap volume, and the protocol is picking up speed. Weekly pool-specific volume reveals a broadening distribution of liquidity, supporting a much wider range of token pairs. Besides, it has not been in the news, and that’s fine. Soroswap’s is a growth story, and what’s important here is that it’s a quiet one. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗘𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺: 𝗔 𝗦𝗻𝗮𝗽𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 @StellarOrg , the payments powerhouse, is expanding! Here’s what’s cooking across its DeFi landscape and the data trails its leaving. pic.twitter.com/f2C4hofeTD — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 30, 2025 Aquarius and Soroswap together help build the liquidity needed to support more complex DeFi use cases on Stellar. Their growth points to an emerging DEX economy that’s maturing with time. Blend and Phoenix Show User Engagement on the Rise Decentralized finance is not simply a matter of where to find liquidity; it concerns users, their wallets, and the interaction they will sustain over time in a given platform or app. Two platforms that show strong signals on this front are Blend and Phoenix. Blend infuses experimental energy into the DeFi universe wowed by Stellar. Similar to a mad scientist in a lab, with a dash of DeFi’s unconventional nature, everything blends, or rather mixes, together. The ingredients are on-chain indicators that matter to users. The big one is wallets. Wallet activity is up, and the addressable surge is likely to help DeFi users address major deficiencies in the current address system. The next ingredient in the address surge is NFTs. Top wallet net flows further illuminate these communities. They demonstrate everything from the amount of liquidity being supplied to the platform to the quantity being yanked out. And in between those two extremes, they’re a pretty good indicator of whether the platform’s user base is made up of true believers who’ve been, like the Blend team, in for the long haul, or short-termers who could be punking out at any moment. At the other end of the spectrum, Phoenix is on the fast track to heating up. Known for its rapid-fire swaps and fiery pool combos, Phoenix is stacking up almost $900K in 30-day volume. Its weekly swap activity also shows signs of a breakout moment, with pairs like USDC-PHO and XLM-USDC leading the charge. Phoenix’s dynamic market share growth among pools signals a rising competitive landscape and shifting user preferences. Both platforms tell a critical story for Stellar: DeFi on this network isn’t just a sit-back-and-watch affair. It’s interactive and even more engaging than before, with users finding new ways to earn, swap, and engage. It’s the future, and it’s happening now. FXDao Brings Debt Markets to Stellar One of the most intriguing developments in Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem is FXDao. This stable debt protocol isn’t just a copy of MakerDAO or any other pre-existing decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for that matter. FXDao has a structure that is both similar to the aforementioned systems and also very different from them in a few key respects. It is a system auditing itself in real-time with the assistance of a few Stellar specialists. FXDao is creating a small but expanding market for overcollateralized loans, with total debt issued exceeding $4.3 million. Users have the option to deposit digital assets and mint stable debt tokens in return. These include USDx, EURx, and GBPx — tokens that collectively offer multi-currency exposure in a decentralized format. The collateral mix indicates that the protocol is attempting to serve a variety of user needs, with backing that comes from both stable and volatile assets. Although the number of active vaults is growing, it is doing so at a rather slow pace. This suggests that Stellar DeFi is still in a niche, but also indicates that there is potential for significant expansion if the conditions in the broader ecosystem improve. FXDao is distinguished by its stability and balance. What we see in FXDao is an experimental approach to DeFi, but one that is firmly grounded in the sorts of practices and patterns that make DeFi work—and not crash, as some in the space do. A Network Poised for Broader DeFi Adoption Altogether, these data points paint a decisive picture: Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem is no longer just a concept in development. It is an increasingly concrete thing, comprised of a mix of liquidity protocols, user-focused platforms, and a nascent debt market, serving up the very infrastructure of a self-sustaining DeFi economy. Even if the overall numbers come up a little short compared to what some of the larger networks are doing, in terms of actual, real-life adoption, Stellar is showing up in some intriguing ways. That’s evident in the apparent Lighthouse navigation of DeFi the network is engaging in. Above all, it seems to me that we’re looking at a quiet DeFi breakout in the Stellar ecosystem.

45344234,https://nulltx.com/?p=150124,1748728338,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Signals: Ethereum and Base Networks Dominate Netflows in Past 24 Hours,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-signals-ethereum-and-base-networks-dominate-netflows-in-past-24-hours/,"On-chain trading and the movement of smart money are diversifying. The past 24 hours have seen a balance of maturity and speculative experimentation. Overall capital flows remain relatively light, but the bulk of smart net buying is concentrated on Ethereum and Base. These two protocols, and the ecosystems therein, are attracting serious attention from high-level wallets and advanced trading ops. Leading the charge of top performers are established DeFi projects like Maker (MKR), Aave (AAVE), and Uniswap (UNI), which directed net inflows on Ethereum toward those assets. Meanwhile, on the Base network, a totally new story is taking shape right now, with AI tokens and meme tokens emerging among the most purchased assets. Ethereum’s DeFi Majors Still Command Respect Smart money activity remains strongly concentrated in Ethereum’s DeFi protocols. Over the past 24 hours, the leading protocol for net buying was Maker (MKR), with net inflows of $100.61K. The project, which is renowned for its decentralized stablecoin DAI, seems to have been stirring up quite a bit of interest from savvy investors looking for stable-yield protocols and some governance exposure. After the Maker protocol, the next highest net buys were Aave (AAVE) with $68.56K and Uniswap (UNI) with $59.04K. These protocols have long reigned as pillars of the DeFi ecosystem, and while the sizes of these flows surely look moderate compared to past market highs, this continued interest probably indicates that some smart traders see value in positioning within trusted, functioning infrastructure. These inflows also underscore a much larger trend of allocating money with caution. In a calmer market, capital seems to be flowing into just a few projects—namely, those that are dependable and useful. Instead of pursuing shiny new trends, the smart money is flowing into the sorts of assets that have long been considered reliable and are, quite literally, in use. Base Network Assets Make a Statement Even though Ethereum is still at the forefront, the Base network is swiftly emerging as a suitable space for trial and niche innovation. Among the 10 cryptocurrencies that had the highest net inflows, four were on Base. The leading inflow came from AIXBT, which had $55.20K in inflows. AIXBT positions itself as an AI-powered trading agent, and its strong showing makes for a very interesting development. Another project based on Base, Solace (SOLACE), launched not long ago and secured its place at the number six spot on the leaderboard with net inflows of $36.13K. Its appearance so soon after launch signals growing confidence in early-stage assets deployed on Base, especially as the Coinbase L2 gains developer traction and user adoption. Completing the top ten for Base were NOICE with net buys of $33.70K and COCORO with $28.28K in net buys. This is a good reflection of something that looks to be a very consistent trend: Base is becoming a hub for smart money to explore speculative plays and frontier concepts outside the Ethereum mainnet. https://x.com/Chyan/status/1928796176498806813?t=Ma8mfg1VC3FRxvDlEIPz9g&s=19 Having several Base tokens among the net top buys shows the growing popularity of the network. While Ethereum hosts established DeFi projects, Base is doing an impressive job of establishing itself as a network with a unique identity, one that often features innovative tokens and savvy financial maneuvers. Memes, AI Agents, and New Narratives Rise Beyond the conventional DeFi assets, new stories are starting to pull in the attention. SPX6900, a meme coin on Ethereum, notched up $44.89K in net smart money buys, placing it firmly in the top five. While meme tokens often rely on community enthusiasm and go viral, their inclusion in smart money activity suggests that some investors are making calculated, short-term bets on momentum and social traction. The AI agent category is topped by AIXBT, which also leads in Base-based assets. Its growing traction is part of a larger movement in DeFi toward on-chain automation and artificial intelligence. As DeFi users seek new ways to generate yield, AI-native protocols and agent-driven financial tools are likely to see sustained and perhaps even burgeoning interest. The sole token not on Ethereum or Base found in the top ten was ABCPHAR on Avalanche. The net inflows were a measly $26.52K. Its presence in the top ten is a gentle reminder of the kinds of opportunities smaller chains serve up. Even as flows grow concentrated around the major ecosystems, the smaller chains still give us chances for niche plays and pocket allocations with tokens like ABCPHAR. Final Takeaways Sophisticated capital movement can be seen in real time with the net inflows and outflows of smart money over 24 hours. The latest data show Ethereum and Base courting all of this attention, with nine of the ten top tokens issued or being used on these two blockchains. Core DeFi tokens—those that serve as backbone elements of decentralized finance—are still very much in the picture, acting as safe havens for capital. With market tranquility comes a choosiness about where to put capital. Yet, in this period of relative calm, there’s also an opportunity to see clearly what investors with a brain and a backbone think is worthy of putting in the ground now — and what’s really set up to blast off when the market gets its groove back.

45344287,https://nulltx.com/?p=150123,1748728483,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Real DeFi in Action: Folks Finance Shows Strong Growth on Algorand,https://nulltx.com/real-defi-in-action-folks-finance-shows-strong-growth-on-algorand/,"Even though many in the crypto world pay attention only to Ethereum and its burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem, there is a world of decentralized finance (DeFi) activity that is quietly and steadily taking root elsewhere. For a perfect case study, look at Algorand. DeFi users on the Algorand blockchain have a rapidly maturing protocol that they can rely on for the kinds of DeFi activities that many in the crypto world associate primarily with Ethereum. Folks Finance is not just an Algorand case study; it is a DeFi protocol that is quietly and steadily serving a clear and growing purpose for a specific user base. From user engagement to capital deployment, Folks Finance is demonstrating what sustainable DeFi growth can look like outside the traditional hotspots. With rising transaction volumes, growing deposits, and high utilization rates, the platform is a clear sign that serious financial activity is happening on-chain within the Algorand ecosystem. User Activity and On-Chain Engagement Are Rising An unmistakable sign of the increasing attention on Folks Finance is the activity of users on the platform. In just the past week, the protocol has netted over 240,000 transactions — a number that is impressive for any DeFi dApp to reportedly handle, and even more so for one operating on an alternative layer-1 network. When considering unique user participation, Folks Finance sees nearly 1,500 individual users weekly engaging with the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking functions. This ongoing, regular, and organic interaction with the platform places it among the most-used decentralized applications across the Algorand blockchain today. Unlike many smaller DeFi platforms, where on-chain interaction can be sparse, Folks Finance is a sign of a healthy and growing community that actively engages with its financial products on a daily basis. Deposits and Utilization Reflect Strong Capital Efficiency User confidence isn’t just shown in transactions — it’s evident in the real capital being put to work. Total deposits on Folks Finance have now topped $3.2 million — a significant milestone for a project that’s not operating in the high-profile Ethereum network. Two major pools are the focus of much of that activity: the ALGO pool and the USDC pool. The ALGO pool remains one of the most popular, with it consistently enticing over 100 users that are active on a daily basis. Users seem to have established the ALGO pool as a destination for either earning yield or accessing liquidity with no reason to leave the Algorand network. Also significant is the current utilization rate of the USDC pool, which operates at over 85%. As with any lending pool in DeFi, this is key to understanding how capital is being used. A capital-efficient pool doesn’t just sit there with lots of capital waiting to be deployed; it has lots of borrowers taking loans and lots of lenders earning interest on those loans. The same holds true for the DeFi protocol as a whole: until it gets more DC, it’s not going to be capital efficient. To summarize, the platform doesn’t merely hold user assets but works them in a way that generates value across the ecosystem. Staking and xALGO Adoption Show Real Demand One of the biggest successes for Folks Finance is staking ALGO — the native asset of the Algorand network. At the moment, over 280 million ALGO tokens are staked via the platform. That’s a huge number. And it tells us a lot. That people are confident in the Folks Finance protocol. That they believe in the long-term value of Algorand’s DeFi infrastructure. The most telling signal of adoption for Folks Finance is the growth of xALGO, its liquid staking token. Users are opting to stake their ALGO in a way that permits them to stay flexible and continue DeFi-ing without locking up their assets. This is something that has become a hallmark of our user base. Folks who choose to interact with our protocol are mature users of DeFi who understand the benefits of capital efficiency and are actively pursuing it. Liquid staking, once thought of as an advanced feature of DeFi, is now becoming a baseline user expectation, even among the most active DeFi users. Folks Finance isn’t just making a splash with xALGO and grabbing headlines. The protocol seems to be pulling in participants who are taking a long, hard look under the hood and deciding to stick around, quite possibly because they understand and appreciate the DeFi landscape in which they are now fully engaged. A Model for DeFi Beyond Ethereum Despite DeFi narratives typically being centered around Ethereum scaling solutions or newer, faster, more performant chains, Folks Finance, a DeFi protocol built on Algorand, is demonstrating that real DeFi adoption is occurring on this chain. If you are examining the real on-chain economic activity behind the hype, then the data coming from Folks Finance is inescapable. It’s a prime example of how DeFi can work — and work well — in an ecosystem that emphasizes speed, low costs, and security. And it gives us a window into the future of decentralized finance on alternative networks. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This month comprises unlocks for Layer 1 behemoths, startups, and everything in between. Bundled together, the June unlocks raise many questions about investor sentiment and price resilience. Can the unlocked tokens be absorbed by the market? Will we see any price drops this month as the unlocked tokens start to hit the market? At the head of the list are initiatives such as SUI, ZRO, APT, and ZK, with each releasing token amounts in the tens of millions. Altogether, they represent a significant number of very recent events that are as yet poorly understood and whose potential effects on the broader market can best be described as up for grabs. The Heavyweights: SUI, ZRO, and APT Lead the Pack The biggest release of tokens in June will come from Sui (SUI), with $206.33 million worth of tokens being unleashed. This layer-1 blockchain, developed by a team from Mysten Labs, has made a name for itself in the crypto community thanks to its high throughput capabilities and an architecture based on the Move programming language. Despite these strengths, though, Sui’s huge token unlock this month calls to mind potential sell pressure and liquidity issues it might have. LayerZero’s ZRO, next on the list, plans to unlock $64.29 million worth of tokens. LayerZero has been a central player in cross-chain messaging protocols, and its much-anticipated token is closely watched by investors and users who have interacted with the protocol across dozens of chains. This unlock could have strong implications for both retail participants and many early contributors, who are looking to capitalize on early participation. Aptos (APT), a prominent layer-1 blockchain originally part of Facebook’s Diem project, is set to release tokens worth $58.52 million. Happenings at Aptos have historically shown to be good indicators for market price movements; that’s why holders and market analysts are keeping a close watch on this particular moment. Mid-Tier Unlocks: ZK, SAROS, VANA, and More Several mid-sized unlocks are planned for June, encompassing projects such as ZK, SAROS, VANA, and ARB, that are together releasing to the public more than $160 million worth of new tokens. ZK, an initiative centered on zero knowledge, will release 46.58 million tokens. Since the majority of ZK’s circulating supply is distributed community-wise via airdrop, this release might lead to more market activity in the immediate term. As we pointed out earlier, community-heavy token models often experience a much rockier road because low holding incentives and high market liquidity lead to heightened volatility. Saros (SAROS) and Vana (VANA) will release a total of $43.75 million and $37.02 million tokens, respectively. Both, recent projects, are looking to develop a following. Should these token unlocks serve as any kind of litmus test, we could expect Saros and Vana to behave more like traditional startups — i.e., find a way to generate some buzz and attention while also sometimes losing the same. For projects with $40 million to $50 million in market cap, like Saros and Vana, the next unlock may be a price-sensitive moment. Also on the schedule for this month is Arbitrum (ARB), one of the leading Ethereum layer-2 solutions, unfastening $36.91 million. Arbitrum has made a name for itself as a major player in the rollup space, and even though its market cap is quite hefty, any substantial release of tokens could sway short-term price action. That’s especially true now that investor sentiment is sensitive to any sort of macro shifts or risk-off behavior. Smaller But Notable: ENA, ZKJ, and OP Round Out the List Even smaller unlocks can create ripples, particularly when community sentiment or larger narratives are involved. Also in June, ENA will unlock $35.23 million, ZKJ will release $31.22 million, and OP (Optimism) will unlock $23.63 million. Even though these unlocks are of relatively low value compared to those in the past, they still constitute a noticeable jump in circulating supply for the tokens in question. The performance of the market in response to this latest unlock should tell us something about the resilience of layer-2 tokens in the face of mounting competition and the development of Ethereum’s roadmap. Notably, the amount of funds locked up in yield-generating contracts on Optimism, since the day of the token unlock, has actually not decreased. What This Means for the Market Misunderstanding token unlocks as simply bearish is common, but their effect mostly hinges on context: how they fit into the larger picture of not just current, but also expected future demand for a given token. Take, for instance, the supply and demand dynamics of a token whose total market cap and ideal price are already known, because, say, Bitcoin is a very low volatility investment. Now, couple that with the fact that the highest demand for a given token is almost always way back at its pre-ICO (Initial Coin Offering) price. Well, with context like that in mind, what do you think the average impact of token unlocks is on a given token’s price? The $2.7 billion wave of June unlocks could serve as a stress test for the crypto markets. They are already under pressure because of regulatory uncertainties, the surge in the price of Bitcoin and its effects on other coins, and the recent turbulence in the transition from a $0 interest-rate world to one where rates aren’t at or near zero. Investors in tokens should watch the unlock schedules closely and try to understand what is happening in real-time on-chain with the projects they are invested in. In the present cycle, the compellingness of a project’s narrative, the level of developer engagement, and the extent of ecosystem utilization can at times counterbalance that inevitable trigger along the road to short-term supply that shocks the market. But only if those projects have taken the necessary steps to establish a foundation of demand. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

DOGE has seen its momentum wane despite increased social buzz, while SHIB is hovering in consolidation territory with technicals hinting at either a breakout or deeper correction. Both remain top crypto assets by market cap, but traders searching for the next crypto to explode are increasingly rotating into low-cap coins with better ROI potential. One such coin grabbing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a sub-$0.03 token that’s quietly gaining ground ahead of the 2025 bull cycle. The MUTM presale has witnessed over 11,500 participants before a token price rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Investors at this level can potentially return up to 100% in profit when the estimated launch price of $0.06 is achieved. DOGE and SHIB: Meme Coins at a Crossroads Amid Market Shifts Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at a price of $0.2228, depreciating by around 1.3% within the past 24 hours. The coin is facing significant support levels, and technical indicators are indicating opposing signals whether the coin will be positive or negative in the near term. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trades at a price of $0.00001429, depreciating by around 0.012% over the past day. However, SHIB has built up a bull flag pattern, which is a potential breakout that will push its price to the resistance of $0.000022. While DOGE and SHIB struggle with these market forces, new coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), whose price is at the moment $0.03, are catching investors’ eyes with their potential high returns. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.4 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. It offers decentralization, security, and efficiency. Certik Audit Officially Completed, Stablecoin Secures Trust and Stability Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins.

While market volatility is nothing new in the cryptocurrency space, downturns like this often prompt investors to seek out alternative opportunities with greater growth potential. This shift in focus has put the spotlight on Ruvi AI , a rising star in the crypto landscape that combines innovation, real-world utility, and exceptional ROI possibilities. What Happened to Cardano? Cardano’s recent dip reflects the tight competition among cryptocurrencies as well as market reactions to broader economic factors. While many believe in Cardano’s long-term potential due to its robust proof-of-stake mechanism and sustainability efforts, the platform’s scalability challenges and evolving use cases contribute to its price fluctuations. The dip has left some Cardano investors questioning whether to hold, sell, or reallocate their investments. For those looking to diversify their portfolio, Ruvi AI stands as an attractive option that addresses some of the pain points currently holding back more established coins. Ruvi AI’s Promising Growth Ruvi AI has quickly made its mark in the crypto world by achieving what many projects fail to do early on—build momentum.

Based on reports, some users saw a hidden reference to the Pepe meme coin (PEPE). Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ In the next few hours, PEPE shot up by 5% but then fell back by 15%. Traders are now watching to see if this social push can do what Elon Musk once did for Dogecoin. Pepe Price Moves According to market data, PEPE’s price hit its upper resistance after the Trump post. A short surge brought a 5% gain. Then profit-taking and wider market pressure drove an 18% correction. The flip in momentum shows how fast things can change in meme-coin land. A small tweet or post can send prices soaring, but it only takes a bit of selling to push them down again. 🚨 Wait, what Trump just dropped a $PEPE pic on Truth Social 🚨 Is this a secret crypto endorsement or just trolling the internet? Either way the $PEPE rocket might just have a new co-pilot. What’s next a $PEPE rally or a Twitter melt down Stay tuned👀 pic.twitter.com/cu8RF7D55b — Josh Mair (@WizzOfCrypto) May 29, 2025 On Drama & Speculation Trump’s message saying he’s “on a mission from God” makes him sound like he has a special purpose, not just a political goal. The dark street scene and the words “nothing can stop what is coming” hint that something big is coming, even if he doesn’t explain it. This kind of talk can fire up his most loyal supporters – especially PEPE aficionados – because it feels dramatic and urgent. Chart Patterns In Focus Based on reports from chart watchers, PEPE appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern that began about five months ago. If the coin breaks above the handle, some say it could reach $0.000026—double its current level. Right now, the MACD line sits below the signal line after a recent death cross, hinting at a near-term downtrend. The RSI has dipped toward 52 and may cross below it soon, which could keep sellers in control. The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level sits at $0.00001 and could act as a bounce point. If that level gives way, traders will look at $0.000008 as the next support. Tariff Ruling Adds Pressure Based on US Court of International Trade filings, the court reversed Trump’s tariff suspensions right around the same time that PEPE spiked. That move seems to have dampened the market’s risk-on mood. For many traders, broader trade news can be a bigger factor than any single tweet. If traders worry about tariffs and slower growth, they often sell off riskier assets like meme coins. That mix of social hype and market worry helped push PEPE down after its brief rally. Looking Ahead For Traders Based on this mix of social buzz and chart signals, it’ll take more than a hint in a post to keep PEPE climbing. If the coin can break above its current resistance by mid-June, $0.000026 seems to be the main target. But a falling MACD and RSI point toward more selling pressure first. Traders should watch the 0.618 level at $0.00001 for signs of a bounce. If that level breaks, they’ll likely aim for $0.000008 next.
