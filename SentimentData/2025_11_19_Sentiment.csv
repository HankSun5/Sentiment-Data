According to recent Bank of America reports, investors are rapidly reducing their short positions on the US dollar, creating ripple effects across global markets. Understanding the dollar positioning shift Bank of America’s latest analysis reveals significant changes in how institutional investors are approaching the US dollar. The current dollar positioning reflects a notable departure from recent trends, with hedge funds and large speculators scaling back their bearish bets. This shift in dollar positioning comes amid changing expectations about Federal Reserve policy and global economic conditions. Why investors reduce shorts now Several factors are driving why investors reduce shorts at this particular moment. The primary reasons include: Changing interest rate expectations Global economic uncertainty Technical market signals Risk management considerations When investors reduce shorts, it typically indicates a reassessment of market conditions and risk appetite. The current move suggests traders are becoming less confident about dollar weakness in the near term. Key insights from BofA reports The latest BofA reports provide crucial data points for understanding market sentiment. According to their analysis: Metric Previous Position Current Position Change Net Short Positions -$25.6B -$18.3B +$7.3B Long Positions $42.1B $48.9B +$6.8B Short Positions $67.7B $67.2B -$0.5B The BofA reports highlight that this isn’t just a minor adjustment but represents a meaningful change in market positioning. Impact on the broader forex market These positioning changes are creating significant waves throughout the forex market. Major currency pairs are experiencing increased volatility as market participants adjust their strategies. The forex market implications extend beyond just dollar pairs, affecting cross rates and emerging market currencies as well. What the currency outlook suggests The current currency outlook appears to be shifting toward dollar strength, at least in the short term. However, the longer-term currency outlook remains uncertain due to several competing factors: Diverging central bank policies Geopolitical tensions Inflation dynamics Growth differentials Actionable insights for traders For active traders and investors, these developments offer several important considerations. Monitoring dollar positioning changes can provide early signals about market direction. The fact that investors reduce shorts suggests caution may be warranted for those betting on continued dollar weakness. FAQs What does Bank of America track in their currency reports? Bank of America (BofA) monitors futures positions, options activity, and cash market flows to assess market positioning. How often do these positioning reports come out? Major banks including Bank of America typically provide weekly updates on futures positioning and monthly deeper analysis. What other institutions provide similar analysis? Other major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase also publish regular currency positioning analysis. How reliable are these positioning indicators? While not perfect predictors, positioning data from sources like Bank of America provide valuable context about market sentiment extremes. The dramatic shift in dollar positioning represents a crucial moment for currency markets. As investors reduce shorts and reassess their outlook, the implications could extend far beyond traditional forex trading into cryptocurrency markets and global risk assets. This repositioning suggests markets are entering a new phase where dollar strength may surprise many participants.

According to the latest report from Sky News on the matter, the agreement is set to be announced formally next week. Curve told its shareholders in recent days that it had signed a share sale and purchase contract with Lloyds, which could see the UK’s largest high street bank make its most significant step into digital payments yet. Yet, according to insiders’ understanding, the purchase has sparked a dispute among some of Curve’s top shareholders, who believe the valuation is significantly below what the platform is truly worth. Curve acquisition by UK bank not in the clear yet According to anonymous sources, the company, boasting over six million users, could exhaust its cash reserves this year if a buyer is not secured. In early September, Chief Executive Shachar Bialick admitted that Lloyds Banking Group offered a valuation that was low compared to its previous fundraising rounds, but insisted that Curve needs to secure its future regardless of the sale. Curve has raised more than £250 million ($289 million) since its launch, including a £37 million ($42.8 million) funding round that took place in March this year, led by Hanco Ventures. We see issuers looking to enter the market, and networks introducing innovative products such as Visa Flex and MasterCard One Credentials. This investment would allow us to invest further in our customer experience, bring new partnerships, and accelerate our path to profitability. Shachar Bialick. The current deal values the business at a fraction of those investments, a gap that has been blasted by Curve’s shareholders, now seeking legal means to stop its sale. IDC Ventures threatens Curve and Lloyds Banking Group Sky News reported that Curve’s early shareholders, including IDC Ventures, the company’s largest external investor with a 12% holding, have publicly rejected the deal and are threatening legal action. IDC Ventures issued a statement saying it is deeply worried about how Curve’s management and board handled the sale talks. A company spokesperson told Sky that governance issues and ownership questions were unresolved at the time of the agreement, and argued that the transaction was not in the company’s best interests. It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. IDC does not intend to support the proposed sale and does not believe that it is capable of being implemented without its support. IDC Curve, in its message to shareholders, acknowledged the disappointment around the valuation, adding that the offer failed to meet the expectations set beforehand. We recognise that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve, and we share the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome. Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve’s creditors and shareholders as a whole. Curve. IDC Ventures said last Friday it would defend its commercial interests and asked both Curve and Lloyds to address its concerns before moving ahead with the acquisition . Curve wallet is facing internal leadership and governance issues In July, IDC Ventures attempted to remove Lord Stanley Fink, the former Conservative Party treasurer and a high-profile City figure, from his position as chair of Curve. The fund propounded that the appointing shareholder had already removed him, only for the board to reinstall him two days later. During Curve’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in early October, opponents failed to remove both Fink and chief executive Bialick through a shareholder vote. IDC Ventures, represented by the London-based law firm Quinn Emanuel, has been involved with Curve for six years and has participated in several major funding rounds. In a statement shared with Sky News last month, the investor said it was troubled by the reappointment of Fink and by the lack of transparency around the board’s handling of the sale process.

Bitcoin’s price action has hovered in the mid-$90,000 range since the drop, but the past 24 hours have been highlighted by a break below $90,000. In the middle of this bearish volatility, a new technical outlook from Tony “The Bull” Severino suggests that Bitcoin’s next move may be more bullish than the recent weakness implies. A Death Cross Forms During The Bitcoin Price Downtrend Tony’s analysis highlights the developing death cross on the daily timeframe, where the 50-day moving average is now bending down toward the 200-day moving average. The pattern is generally viewed as bearish, but the placement of the moving averages and the slope of the short-term line show something different unfolding on Bitcoin’s chart. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? The green 50-day average has been gradually drifting lower after weeks of fading momentum, and the red 200-day average has begun flattening out from the long-term uptrend. As shown on the chart below, this death cross has formed around $110,000, and according to the analyst, Bitcoin might pump into this price level next week. The reason a pump remains possible at this stage is tied directly to how moving averages behave. After the breakdown beneath $100,000, Bitcoin found support just below $92,000 and has since been forming a series of smaller-bodied candles that reflect the early stages of a potential reversal. If buyers take control, a fast move toward the region between $103,000 and $110,000 becomes realistic. However, price action in the past 24 hours, which has seen Bitcoin break below $90,000, threatens this bullish outlook. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: @TonyTheBullCMT On X The Path To $110,000 This Week For Bitcoin to reach $110,000 in the coming days, the market would need to replay a pattern seen several times in past cycles: a strong relief rally just before or immediately after a death cross forms. These rallies happen because sentiment becomes overly pessimistic at the exact moment when shorts begin to pile in, leaving the price vulnerable to a sharp upside reaction. However, for that scenario to unfold now, Bitcoin would first need to push convincingly back above $90,000 and show that momentum is shifting away from the recent sell-off. Related Reading: This Analyst Called The Bitcoin Crash Below $20,000 In 2021, He’s Back With A Shocking Prediction For Solana Interestingly, other analysts have pointed to bullish primers for Bitcoin, despite the bearish price action. One such case is the Bitcoin SSR RSI, which was highlighted by a CryptoQuant community analyst called Maartunn, that shows rising stablecoin buying power relative to Bitcoin’s market cap. On the other hand, a bearish indicator has risen up with the SuperTrend indicator, which proposes a further 67% drop in the price of Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,760, down by 5.8% in the past 24 hours.

Fewer than 1.05 million BTC are left to be mined, and issuance will slow sharply as the network advances through future halvings. Permanently Lost and Unspendable BTC A portion of Bitcoin’s supply can never re-enter circulation. Roughly 230 BTC are unspendable due to the genesis block subsidy and early invalid scripts. Additional coins are believed lost through forgotten or unrecoverable private keys, further tightening the effective supply. How Bitcoin’s Halvings Cut Issuance Bitcoin’s supply halves every 210,000 blocks. The most recent halving on April 20, 2024, reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, lowering daily issuance from 900 BTC to about 450 BTC. Earlier halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 brought the subsidy down from 50 BTC to its current level, pushing annualized supply growth below 1%. The next halving is estimated for April 2028, and the final fractions of Bitcoin are expected to be mined around 2140. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Price Pullback Aligns With Technical Weakness Despite a tightening supply, price action has weakened. Bitcoin has fallen toward the mid-$80,000s, breaking below a long-term ascending trendline that supported most of the 2024 advance. BTC now trades under both the 20-EMA and 50-EMA on the daily chart, reinforcing bearish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart also reflects a completed ABCD pattern near the $115,000 high and a breakdown from a rising wedge, both common precursors to broader corrections. Price is approaching the $83,800–$74,500 demand zone, an area that previously generated strong buying interest. RSI near 28 shows oversold conditions, although a clear bullish divergence has not yet formed. TradingView’s projected path suggests BTC may drift slightly lower before forming a stabilization pattern within the demand zone. A hammer or bullish engulfing candle would signal buyer re-entry. Levels to Watch in the Weeks Ahead A recovery above $96,000 would be the first sign of stabilization. A move through $100,700 could open the way to a retest of $115,200, provided sentiment improves. Failure to hold the demand area would expose $74,500 as the next key level. For traders, current conditions resemble the early phase of an accumulation zone. If BTC reclaims its short-term EMAs and confirms support, the next rally could extend to major altcoins, including ETH, SOL, and XRP. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed.

However, it’s important to note that such investments come with both opportunities and challenges that require careful consideration.

Tether’s strategic investment in Ledn represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin lending services. Both companies share a common vision: creating robust financial infrastructure that allows users to unlock liquidity while maintaining their Bitcoin positions. This approach addresses one of the biggest challenges facing long-term crypto holders – how to access funds without sacrificing potential future gains from their digital assets. The collaboration brings together Tether’s massive stablecoin ecosystem with Ledn’s established Bitcoin lending platform. While the exact investment amount remains confidential, the strategic nature suggests deep integration and shared goals. This partnership could potentially transform how millions of cryptocurrency users interact with their digital wealth. How Does Bitcoin Lending Work in Practice? Bitcoin lending platforms like Ledn provide essential financial services that traditional banks often overlook. Here’s how the process typically works: Users deposit Bitcoin as collateral The platform provides loans in stablecoins or fiat currency Borrowers maintain ownership of their Bitcoin Interest rates are typically lower than traditional alternatives This system creates a win-win situation where investors can access liquidity for personal or business needs while their Bitcoin continues to appreciate in value. The Tether-Ledn partnership strengthens this ecosystem by combining expertise and resources from two industry leaders. Why Is This Strategic Investment So Important for Crypto Adoption?

Many potential investors hesitate to allocate significant funds to Bitcoin because they fear locking up capital that might be needed for emergencies or opportunities. Bitcoin lending solutions eliminate this concern by providing flexible access to liquidity. Moreover, this partnership demonstrates growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrency infrastructure. When major players like Tether invest in Bitcoin lending platforms, it signals maturity and stability in the sector. This validation could encourage more traditional investors to explore cryptocurrency opportunities. What Challenges Does Bitcoin Lending Face? Despite the exciting potential, Bitcoin lending still faces several hurdles that the Tether-Ledn partnership aims to address: Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions Market volatility affecting collateral values Security concerns around digital asset storage User education about responsible borrowing practices The combined expertise of both companies positions them well to navigate these challenges. Tether’s experience with regulatory compliance and Ledn’s proven track record in secure Bitcoin lending create a formidable alliance. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Lending? This strategic investment could catalyze significant innovation in the Bitcoin lending space. We might see new products and services emerge, such as: More flexible loan terms and conditions Integration with traditional financial services Enhanced risk management tools Global expansion of accessible lending markets The partnership represents a crucial step toward building comprehensive financial ecosystems around digital assets. As more users recognize the benefits of Bitcoin lending without selling, we can expect accelerated growth and innovation in this sector. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin lending? Bitcoin lending allows cryptocurrency holders to use their Bitcoin as collateral to secure loans without selling their digital assets, providing access to liquidity while maintaining investment exposure. How does Tether’s investment benefit Ledn users? Tether’s investment brings additional resources, stability, and industry expertise to Ledn, potentially leading to better services, improved security, and expanded lending options for users. Is Bitcoin lending safe? While all cryptocurrency activities carry some risk, established platforms like Ledn implement robust security measures.

In the past 24 hours, it sank below $90K. Despite its struggles, Bitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency. While its transaction speeds are notoriously slow and expensive, Layer-2 projects have cropped up to solve this. Bitcoin Hyper is the first Bitcoin Layer-2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine for high-speed transactions. Its presale has shown massive momentum, raising over $27.8M and attracting significant whale investment. It’s been a tough several months for Bitcoin ($BTC). Just last month, it reached an ATH of $126K, leading many traders to believe that it would continue to go up from there. And yet the market shared a collective sigh as Bitcoin dropped below $90K in the last 24 hours, a level that would’ve been close to unthinkable in October. Despite that, Bitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency in the market. Because of this, it’s also easy to overlook the fact that it isn’t perfect at all. Bitcoin’s core limitations are well-known: slow transactions, high fees, and a lack of smart contract functionality. While its security is unmatched, its utility has been constrained, pushing developers and decentralized applications to other, more flexible blockchains. This has created a massive opportunity for solutions that can expand Bitcoin’s capabilities without compromising its foundational strength. The race to build effective Bitcoin Layer-2 networks is heating up, and this is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. Bitcoin Hyper Unlocks DeFi on Bitcoin with Solana-Like Speed Transactions Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the first-ever Bitcoin Layer-2 solution that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . This innovative approach aims to solve Bitcoin’s scalability problem by bringing the high-speed, low-cost transaction processing of the Solana ecosystem directly to Bitcoin. By creating a modular blockchain that uses Bitcoin for settlement and a real-time SVM layer for execution, it promises to deliver performance that could even surpass Solana itself. Unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the SVM is renowned for its parallel transaction processing capabilities. This allows it to handle thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of other networks. This architecture is designed to finally enable a robust ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and complex dApps on Bitcoin, backed by its unparalleled security and liquidity. The market has responded with overwhelming enthusiasm, signaling strong belief in the project’s vision. Read our detailed Bitcoin Hyper review for a full lowdown on the project. By building a Layer-2 on top of Bitcoin that uses this engine, Bitcoin Hyper effectively bypasses Bitcoin’s native limitations. It creates an execution environment where developers can build sophisticated applications in Rust, a language known for safety and performance. This opens the door for a wave of new use cases previously impossible on Bitcoin. Imagine high-frequency trading, decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and NFT marketplaces operating with the speed of Solana but settling on the trust-minimized Bitcoin blockchain. The platform provides a Canonical Bridge for seamless $BTC transfers, ensuring liquidity can flow easily between the layers. This combination of speed, low fees, and security is what makes the Bitcoin Hyper proposition so powerful. $HYPER Presale Surges Past $27M as Whales Take Notice When the L2 launches, its native $HYPER tokens will power it. While you can use it to pay for transaction fees, holding it will also give you governance rights and access to exclusive features. Right now, you buy get these tokens via the official Bitcoin Hyper presale website . The market’s response to the project has been nothing short of explosive. The project’s presale has soared, raising an impressive $27.8M, with the $HYPER token currently priced at just $0.013295. It’s easy to get your share of $HYPER tokens. Check out our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper for more details. This powerful momentum indicates strong investor confidence in its mission to scale Bitcoin. Adding to the bullish sentiment, on-chain data shows significant interest from major players. A recent whale buy just north of $500K worth of tokens is the strongest proof yet of the attention it is getting. This smart money movement suggests that high-net-worth investors are recognizing the project’s long-term potential. The Bitcoin Hyper price is expected to climb as the presale progresses, rewarding early participants. Beyond the initial offering, the project incentivizes long-term holding through a robust staking program. You can stake your tokens immediately and enjoy 41% APY, although this can still change as more holders lock their tokens in the staking pool. With just a day before the next price increase, now’s the time to get your hands on tokens at a discounted price. Ready to jump in? Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

The company is more than well positioned to monetize their ambitious ""target of 250–500 MW critical IT load of new HPC lease signings annually,"" thanks to the growing HPC capacity. WULF's projected NOI margin of over ~70% is extremely impressive as well, compared to other data center REITs, with it implying its robust top/ bottom-line growth prospects. The meltdown has already triggered WULF's cheaper FY2027 EV/Sales valuations of ~4.44x, nearer to its hyperscaler/neocloud peers while triggering an improved margin of safety. With the bright long-term prospects outweighing the near-term noise surrounding the recent moderation in BTC spot prices, I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock. I previously covered TeraWulf Inc (NASDAQ: WULF ) in October 2025, discussing how its timely transition to HPC opportunities had been backed by the insatiable cloud demand and the higher data center-related capex trends. Combined with the strategic leveraging of its existing bitcoin mining infrastructure for HPC purposes, the strategic financing from Alphabet ( GOOG ), and the cheap FY2027 valuations, I had initiated my Buy rating upon a moderate retracement to the 50/100-day moving averages for a lower dollar cost average then. In this article, I shall discuss why I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock as it finally nears my Buy Zones, thanks to its robust AI monetization opportunities arising from the multi-year contracted backlog and the growing HPC capacity. I am of the opinion that its bright long-term prospects far outweigh the near-term headwinds arising from the higher debt reliance and the volatile Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) spot prices as well. WULF Reports Robust AI Monetization WULF 1Y Stock Price Trading View Since my last article, the early Q3'25 earnings season has finally brought forth "" stock valuation fears ,"" with it triggering notable corrections across the AI value chain and WULF similarly pulling back by -35.5% since the 52 week heights. This development was also why I previously urged readers to wait before adding, preferably after a moderate retracement to the 50/100-day moving averages, thanks to the potential volatility and capital losses arising from chasing overpriced stocks during an exuberant AI hype. This is especially since WULF is mostly a bitcoin miner, with the FQ3'25 digital asset revenues of $43.37M ( -8.9% QoQ /+60.3% YoY) comprising 85.7% of its overall revenues (-14.3 points QoQ/YoY). Thanks to the higher average BTC spot prices of $114.47K in Q3'25 (+15.9% QoQ/+87.5% YoY) along with the expanding mining capacity of 245 MW ( inline QoQ / +25.6% YoY ), it is unsurprising that the company has proved itself as a beneficiary of the cryptocurrency boom, as demand for alternative assets grow and the de-dollarization trends continue . WULF's Robust HPC Opportunities WULF Otherwise, while nascent, WULF has reported robust HPC lease revenues of $7.2M (NA QoQ/NA YoY), with further growth likely, based on the Lake Mariner Campus HPC leasing capacity of 22.5 MW in FQ3'25 along with the planned expansion to 522.5 MW through 2026 and up to 750 MW in maximum capacity . This is on top of the upcoming HPC leasing capacity of 168 MW in Abernathy from H2'26 onwards and 400 MW in Cayuga, New York from 2027 onwards, which naturally lend credence to the management's aggressive guidance of ~1.5 GW in critical IT load capacity over the next few years and the ambitious growth ""target of 250–500 MW critical IT load of new HPC lease signings annually."" These may allow WULF to report robust top-line growth prospects moving forward, allowing them to monetize their 100% pre-leased contracted backlog of 510 MW at favorable rates, based on the overall contracted revenues of $17.2B across: the 60 MW - Core42 lease, with projected NOI margin of 85%, the 366 MW - Fluidstack lease, with projected NOI margin of 85%, and the 168 MW - Fluidstack lease, with projected NOI margin of 70%. These profit margins are impressive as well, compared to numerous data center REITs, including Equinix ( EQIX ) at over ~60% over the LTM and Digital Realty Trust ( DLR ) at ~50%, allowing them to deliver highly profitable margins ahead. The Conse nsus Forward Estimates Seeking Alpha As a result of the robust insights offered by the contracted backlog and the projected expansion in its capacity, I can understand why the consensus forward estimates appear rather promising, with WULF expected to report an accelerated top-line growth at a CAGR of +99.7% through FY2027. On the other hand, given the supposed 2Y+ time lag between the typical booking and the revenue recognition arising from the tight supply environment, I am of the opinion that WULF is likely to intensify their debt reliance in the mean time, with it likely to trigger its mixed near-term prospects before things drastically lift once its HPC capacity is ramped up and its multi-year backlog is monetized. For reference, WULF has already reported numerous financing activities across the $3.2B from GOOG and the $2B in Convertible Notes 2030/2031 (pre-FQ3'25 earnings call) along with the new $3.2B in Convertible Notes 2030 (post FQ3'25 earnings call) and the new $1.02B in Convertible Notes 2032. The elevated HPC ramping up costs/higher interest expenses may also be why WULF continues to report negative net income performances, despite the growing adj EBITDA profitability by +203% YoY in FQ3'25. A similar trend has been observed in numerous neoclouds/hyperscalers in the recent Q3'25 earnings season, with it signaling the hefty and bottom-line/cash flow dilutive capex trends during the multi-year AI boom. WULF Is An Even Better Buy After The Correction WULF 5Y Stock Price Trading View Thanks to the market-wide AI-related meltdown, WULF has already lost part of its recent Q4'25 gains to retest the prior support levels of $10s ranges, with it also bringing the stock nearer to the prior Buy Zone discussed in my last article. WULF Valuations Seeking Alpha On the one hand, given the nascency of its HPC leasing opportunities, WULF may appear to be somewhat expensive at FWD EV/Sales valuations of 27.43x, compared to the sector median of 3.40x and its peers, including: hyperscaler - Amazon ( AMZN ) at FWD EV/Sales valuations of 3.60x, hyperscaler - Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) at 8.21x, hyperscaler - Microsoft ( MSFT ) at 11.66x, neocloud - DigitalOcean ( DOCN ) at 6.21x, neocloud - CoreWeave ( CRWV ) at 10.78x, neocloud - Nebius ( NBIS ) at 36.85x, and Bitcoin miner turned HPC provider - Core Scientific ( CORZ ) at 14.19x. On the other hand, with much of its capacity expected to be ramped up over the next few years, I am of the opinion that WULF appears rather compelling at my estimated FY2027 EV/Sales valuations of 4.44x, based on the current Enterprise Value of $4.98B and the consensus FY2027 revenue estimates of $1.12B. This is especially since WULF benefits from the firm multi-year backlog and the growing HPC compute capacity, albeit with lumpy near-term performance arising from the recent moderation in BTC spot prices. With the bright long-term prospects far outweighing the near-term noise, I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock.",WULF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-18 13:53:07
54571944,629527,1763474428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54571944.jpeg,"Crypto Market Is Structurally Rigged, Warns Wintermute CEO",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-structurally-rigged-wintermute-ceo/,"A fresh bout of soul-searching has gripped the crypto derivatives industry as leading market participants argue that the market’s structure is fundamentally flawed – not just unlucky. Wintermute founder and CEO Evgeny Gaevoy set the tone on X, arguing that the core problem is not perpetual futures themselves but the way key venues are architected. Posting under his handle @EvgenyGaevoy (wishful_cynic), he wrote that “the real issue is not the perp design but the centralized (and quadi [sic] decentralized) exchanges that are prime broker, CLOB and custodian all in one,” adding that traditional finance “solved all this stuff long time ago.” His critique targets the vertically integrated model that dominates both centralized exchanges and some so-called “decentralized” platforms, where custody, matching, risk management and prime brokerage-like functions are bundled into a single entity. In stress events, that consolidation can turn one venue into a systemic choke point. Structural Weakness Threatens The Crypto Market DeFiance Capital founder Arthur Cheong (@Arthur_0x) places the blame partly on derivatives product design. He argues that “crypto derivatives (mainly perps) product design and market structure that surround it remain the biggest problem the industry needs to tackle before it can grow to the next level in a sustainable manner.” He draws a straight line between the March 2020 crash and the recent 10 October (“10/10”) meltdown . In March 2020, he notes, Bitcoin’s 50–70% intraday plunge was exacerbated by BitMEX-style BTC-margined “quanto” perps, “which means BTC perps are collateralized by BTC not stablecoins thus you get the extreme reflexivity on the downside and there’s just very little way you can hedge this quanto perp exposure.” According to Arthur, most participants recognized this as a design flaw. As stablecoin usage grew, the market share of BTC-margined quanto perps on BitMEX fell from “>80% to less than 20% in one year,” and by mid-2021 “most people are using USDT margined BTC perps.” That collective shift, he argues, “have definitely improve[d] the resilience of market structure significantly” and reduced volatility in BTC, though he still “look[s] forward to a new product design significantly better than the current iteration of crypto perps.” If Gaevoy and Arthur focus on architecture and instruments, pseudonymous trader The White Whale (@TheWhiteWhaleV2) has put the human cost of recent failures front and center in a X post with 1.8 million views. In the widely shared thread explaining his “personal decision to step away from trading on HyperLiquid ,” he praises HyperLiquid founder Jeff Yan and the team for dragging “structural fairness into the spotlight,” but concludes that 10/10 exposed something deeper. “The fact that one centralized exchange can trigger a global liquidation cascade and force temporary price dislocations across every protocol? That’s not a ‘black swan.’ That’s a design flaw.” His recap of 10/10 is stark: Binance relied on its own oracle , which depegged a stablecoin and started “a smaller, but manageable, liquidation chain.” Then “their API mysteriously went offline.” Market makers who “operate largely delta-neutral” suddenly couldn’t hedge; they pulled quotes across CEXs and DEXs. “With no liquidity present, price falls off a cliff.” The industry’s reaction, he argues, revealed a misaligned set of priorities. “Victory laps” over “Zero bad debt!” and “Liquidations processed flawlessly!” may show protocols survived, but “Great. The protocol didn’t die. But users did.” He insists that “protecting the protocol IS important – obviously. But it is not the same thing as protecting traders.” As an alternative, White Whale points to Drift on Solana as one venue that has at least attempted to encode protection at the protocol level. Drift’s liquidation protection, he writes, “isn’t magic. It’s not flawless. But it exists – and more importantly, it worked.” A key rule is simple: “Is the oracle price diverging by more than 50% from the 5-minute TWAP?” If so, the system temporarily halts liquidations, filtering out “scam wicks” and pushing edge cases to the insurance fund. Across Gaevoy’s structural critique, Yan’s product-design history and White Whale’s exit from HyperLiquid, a common conclusion emerges: today’s crypto market is not just volatile – it is structurally biased against traders in moments of stress. Whether the industry now prioritizes circuit breakers, segregated roles and on-chain protections will determine if 10/10 becomes a turning point, or just another preventable disaster.

The November 17 order grants Dimensional exemptions that enable open-end management investment companies to operate both ETF classes and mutual fund classes within the same fund structure, positioning the firm as the first to deploy this model for actively managed products. Dimensional filed its initial application in July 2023 and submitted three amendments before receiving final approval. The SEC’s order exempts the firm from several provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, including sections governing share pricing, redemptions, and certain affiliated transactions. SEC issues approval order allowing Dimensional to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds… Becomes second asset manager after Vanguard w/ this capability & the first w/ ability to use for actively managed products. Some *90* other asset managers pursuing this as well. pic.twitter.com/AILGy0Y9K3 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 17, 2025 Ninety Firms Await Similar Approvals Nearly ninety other asset managers have filed applications seeking identical capabilities, according to several ETF analysts. The approval signals potential momentum for a broader wave of hybrid fund structures across the industry. Nate Geraci, co-founder of ETF Store, noted that Dimensional holds a competitive edge as the first firm authorized to apply this model to actively managed strategies. While Vanguard pioneered the structure, its primary focus remains passive index funds. Dimensional’s approval extends the framework into active management, where fund companies typically generate higher fees and maintain greater differentiation from competitors. BIG news for DFA. Congratulations to them for being first. Have to assume floodgates are going to open for those ~90 other firms vying for similar approvals. https://t.co/pCPA8KfACU — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 18, 2025 James Seyffart, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, predicted an imminent surge of approvals for firms awaiting similar authorizations. The hybrid model allows asset managers to offer lower-cost ETF shares alongside traditional mutual fund shares, which can potentially attract investors seeking tax efficiency and intraday trading without forcing existing mutual fund shareholders to convert. Solana ETF Competition Intensifies VanEck launched the third U.S. Solana staking ETF on Monday , entering a field where Bitwise and Grayscale have collectively captured over $380 million since late October. The VanEck Solana ETF, trading under the ticker VSOL, has waived its 0.3 percent management fee through February 17, or until assets reach $1 billion. Fidelity is set to debut its Solana ETF, ticker FSOL, on November 19 with a 25 basis point fee. Canary Funds will launch its Solana ETF, ticker SOLC, the same day, in partnership with Marinade Finance for on-chain staking. Balchunas emphasized Fidelity’s scale advantage as the largest asset manager competing in this category, noting BlackRock’s absence from the Solana market despite its dominance in Bitcoin ETFs. Fidelity Solana ETF $FSOL is slated to launch TOMORROW. Fee is 25bps. Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out. $BSOL got out first, has $450m, $VSOL launched today, Grayscale is in mix. Game on. pic.twitter.com/iCXMkAH9qe — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 17, 2025 Bitwise’s Solana ETF, ticker BSOL, currently leads with approximately $450 million in assets under management. Grayscale has also entered the Solana ETF lineup alongside the new entrants. Regulatory Shift Signals Broader Industry Integration The hybrid model addresses longstanding friction between mutual fund investors seeking tax efficiency and ETF investors requiring traditional share class options. The approval builds on the SEC’s September streamlining initiative that eliminated case-by-case reviews for crypto ETF applications, dramatically accelerating product launches across the digital asset space. Today, the SEC also removed crypto from its examination priorities for 2026, indicating that digital assets are no longer considered a special risk area requiring heightened supervisory focus.

SIGNALING IT’S NO LONGER CONSIDERED A SPECIAL RISK AREA. pic.twitter.com/LUP4suYJ7j — Crypto Rover (@cryptorover) November 18, 2025 Industry observers view the removal as a tacit acknowledgment that crypto markets have matured sufficiently to warrant treatment comparable to other established asset classes under the agency’s standard regulatory framework. Digital asset investment products have recently declined amid the general market bear that saw Bitcoin slip below $90K today from $126K October ATH . Last week, these investment products saw $2 billion in outflows , marking the heaviest weekly withdrawals since February. The three-week streak resulted in cumulative outflows of $3.2 billion amid sharp price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Total assets under management in digital asset ETPs dropped 27 percent from their early-October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion. U.S.-based products accounted for $1.97 billion of last week’s outflows, while others also recorded notable outflows.

Recent price predictions suggest a 300% pump for $SHIB if the token reaches two critical levels, which would set it up for an aggressive rally. Bitcoin Hyper introduces a Layer 2 solution that brings high-speed smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem via a Solana Virtual Machine integration. The $HYPER presale raised over $27.8M so far with a token price of $0.013295 and staking rewards currently at 41%. The altcoin market is at a fascinating crossroads. While speculative assets have dominated cycles past, a clear trend toward utility is emerging. Investors are looking past fleeting hype, demanding projects with sustainable technology and real-world use cases. This shift in sentiment is reshaping the altcoin market outlook for 2025, forcing a re-evaluation of long-term value. Take top altcoins like Shiba Inu, for instance, which is currently at a crossroads, showing clear-cut signs of consolidation and momentum buildup. Trader’s expectation of a 300% $SHIB pump long-term is no longer unrealistic, provided $SHIB can hold two critical levels. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently at the opposite end of the spectrum, after crashing below $90K today. The reasons are multiple, from bulk whale sells to dwindling investor participation and increased fear. But there’s another problem worth talking about. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, offers unparalleled security and trust but its slow transaction speeds, high fees, and lack of native smart contract capabilities, have hindered its investor appeal. Right now, Bitcoin ranks 30th in terms of TPS . A new contender, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve this trilemma directly. As the newest Bitcoin Layer 2 solution integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Hyper promises to unlock Bitcoin’s dormant potential. By creating a high-speed execution layer on top of Bitcoin’s secure settlement, Bitcoin Hyper introduces the programmability and performance needed for modern dApps. This approach could fundamentally alter the competitive dynamics of the blockchain space, bringing high-performance applications to the industry’s most trusted network. Bitcoin Hyper Redefines Speed and Programmability Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) tackles Bitcoin’s core limitations head-on. Its modular architecture uses Bitcoin’s Layer 1 for ultimate security and settlement while a real-time SVM-based Layer 2 handles transaction execution. This allows for extremely low-latency processing and high-speed, low-cost transactions. The project’s decentralized Canonical Bridge facilitates seamless and secure cross-minting of $BTC into its L2 environment. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper brings fast, scalable smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem. This move enables developers to build sophisticated DeFi applications, NFT platforms, and gaming dApps using familiar tools like the Rust programming language. This innovative approach is capturing significant attention. The ongoing presale for its native token, $HYPER, has already raised an impressive $27.8M+ at the time of writing, with $HYPER sitting at $0.013295. This strong demand signals major investor confidence in the project’s vision. If this type of hype continues, $HYPER could explode post release. Our price prediction for $HYPER , based on the project’s utility and community support, puts the token at $0.08625 by the end of 2026. In terms of ROI, we’re talking about potential profits of 548%. This is enough of an incentive for any crypto hunter looking for portfolio diversification. If this sounds like you, make sure you read our guide on how to buy $HYPER today. Check $HYPER’s live presale today. A New Ecosystem for DeFi, Gaming, and Payments The implications of bringing high-performance smart contracts to Bitcoin are massive. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) unlocks a wide range of use cases previously impossible on the network, creating a new ecosystem for developers and users alike. Developers can build swaps, lending platforms, and staking protocols that leverage Bitcoin’s liquidity with the speed of an SVM chain. For everyday traders, use cases range from high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC with minimal fees to comprehensive DeFi protocols. With presale tokens currently priced at $0.013295, early participants are getting in at the ground floor – an opportunity which won’t last long anymore. The project has a projected release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 so, if you want to invest, invest today. Secure your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing. Crypto is a high-risk market and presales have no success guarantee.

BGIN's core operations include mining smaller coins and developing mining machines, with expansion plans into bitcoin and Dogecoin mining by 1H26. Despite a low price/sales multiple, BGIN's revenue is forecasted to decline 62% in eFY25, driven by weak demand and market headwinds. I recommend a Sell rating on BGIN, targeting $2.93/share, as continued market challenges may further impact revenue and shareholder value. Bgin Blockchain Limited ( BGIN ) is a cryptocurrency miner and mining machine developer that primarily focuses on smaller coins like the Kaspa coin. The company came into the public markets at the end of October 2025 through an IPO during a period of significant declines across the cryptocurrency markets. With reported 1h25 sales experiencing a large decline in machine sales and mining pool revenue, Bgin may be facing significant pressure for the coming quarters if the cryptocurrency market continues to decline. Given the challenges faced in the market, I believe shares should be trading at 2.93/share at 1.52x eFY27 price/sales; I am recommending BGIN shares with a Sell rating. Bgin Blockchain Limited Operations Bgin, a Cayman Islands-based company, came to the public markets on October 22, 2025 through an initial public offering, issuing 5mm Class A ordinary shares at an IPO price of $6.00/share. Bgin raised roughly $30mm from the offering that is expected to be used to purchase and/or construct mining farms as well as invest in research and development of proprietary chips designed for cryptocurrency mining machines. Bgin’s lockup period expires 6 months following the IPO, which should land in April 2026. Corporate Filings Bgin is a holding company operating under Bgin HK, Bgin Trading, Bgin Trade HK, Bgin Singapore, Bgin SG, Bgin Infrastructure US, and Bgin Management. Bgin, through its subsidiaries, conducts operations in the US, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Primary operations include mining cryptocurrency and selling mining machines equipped with its 8nm or 12nm ASIC chips designed to mine KAS coins, ALPH coins, and RXD coins. As part of its mining operations, Bgin offers a miner hosting service in which Bgin manages mining machines on behalf of customers for a service fee. Since the release of the prospectus, Bgin has grown its mining fleet from 48,277 machines to 72,825 machines as of September 2025 . Accordingly, Bgin primarily mines KAS coins for revenue generation. Kaspa was launched in 2021 through mining rather than an initial coin offering [ICO] and uses the BlockDAG architecture. Kaspa has a maximum supply of 28.7b coins, building in scarcity for the high-throughput coin. Standard CPUs are capable of mining the coins, making them accessible for various miners. The basis for Kaspa is for faster transactions while remaining decentralized. TradingView Bgin is aiming to grow its operations by a significant measure. As of September 2025, Bgin had 47MW of power in use and is targeting 500 MW of capacity within the next two years. As part of its growth strategy, Bgin is aiming to mine large-cap coins like Bitcoin and Dogecoin beginning in 1h26. As part of this, Bgin is expecting to begin developing mining machines for these larger coins in 1h26, potentially to be both utilized for internal mining operations and for sale. Revenue for FY24 was largely concentrated in Hong Kong, China, at 33%, the United States at 23%, and Singapore at 16%. Corporate Filings Bgin Blockchain Limited Financial Position Corporate Filings Bgin faced a significant decline in revenue generation in 1h25 as a result of lower mining machine sales as well as the significant decline in the KAS coin price, falling from $0.1165/coin to $0.0755/coin. Accordingly, US tariff policies on Chinese imports may impact costs for Bgin as well as disrupt its supply chain for chip fabrication and manufacturing, as well as materials sourcing from China. Corporate Filings Modeling Bgin’s financials, I believe the firm may face continued pressure across its external services, which may be particularly sensitive to the coins mined by Bgin’s machines. This may result in challenging mining machine revenue for the coming quarters following the large drop-off in 1H25. At the top-line, I’m forecasting revenue to decline by -62% for eFY25 to $116mm, largely driven by the pressure on cryptocurrencies, particularly in recent months. TradingView Risks Related to Bgin Blockchain Limited Bull Case Bgin focuses on a niche corner of the cryptocurrency market, mining smaller coins that may offer differentiated and less competitive returns regarding Bitcoin mining companies. Bgin has historically realized strong margins through miner sales and may experience a sharp turnaround if sales volumes were to pick back up. Bear Case The cryptocurrency market may be going into another bear market, potentially resulting in a drop-off of interest by retail investors seeking liquidity and safety. This may result in a continued decline in mining machine sales as well as mining pool revenue going forward. The lower price of KAS coin may result in a substantial reduction of mining revenue going forward, offset by higher volumes mined. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Filings BGIN shares are currently trading at 1.53x price/sales, a relatively low premium for high-growth companies. Despite the low trading multiple, I believe shares may face continued pressure as the market Bgin participants are going through declining coin pricing, potentially impacting broader revenue generation for the company going forward. Using my revenue forecast for eFY27, I believe shares should be trading at 2.93/share at 1.52x eFY27 price/sales; I am recommending BGIN shares with a Sell rating.

Nasdaq-listed Onfolio Holdings has successfully raised a staggering $300 million specifically for crypto investments, signaling strong institutional confidence in digital assets. This monumental funding round represents one of the most significant corporate commitments to cryptocurrency this year. Why Are Major Institutions Making Crypto Investments Now? Onfolio’s decision to allocate $300 million toward crypto investments comes at a pivotal moment in digital asset evolution. The company secured these substantial funds through institutional investors and a convertible note facility, demonstrating sophisticated financial engineering. This move follows increasing institutional adoption trends, where traditional finance meets blockchain technology. The strategic crypto investments will focus on three major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC) – The original cryptocurrency and digital gold Ethereum (ETH) – The leading smart contract platform Solana (SOL) – The high-performance blockchain network How Will This Impact Crypto Investment Strategies? Onfolio’s massive crypto investments could create ripple effects throughout the entire digital asset ecosystem. When publicly-traded companies make substantial commitments to cryptocurrency, it often signals to other institutions that the asset class has matured sufficiently for serious consideration. Moreover, this level of crypto investment from a Nasdaq-listed entity adds credibility and legitimacy to the entire sector. The company’s approach to crypto investments appears carefully calculated. By targeting established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum while including emerging leaders like Solana, Onfolio balances stability with growth potential. This diversified strategy in crypto investments mirrors approaches taken by other institutional players entering the space. What Challenges Do Institutional Crypto Investments Face? While the $300 million crypto investment announcement generates excitement, institutional participation brings unique challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern for companies making substantial crypto investments. However, Onfolio’s Nasdaq listing suggests they’ve conducted thorough due diligence and compliance checks before committing to these significant crypto investments. Another consideration involves market volatility. Despite growing institutional interest, cryptocurrency markets can experience sharp price swings. The company’s crypto investments will need sophisticated risk management strategies to navigate these fluctuations successfully. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto Investments? Onfolio’s bold move could inspire similar crypto investments from other publicly-traded companies. As more traditional finance players observe successful crypto investments from peers, the barrier to entry lowers for others considering similar moves. This development in crypto investments might accelerate mainstream adoption and potentially stabilize markets through increased institutional participation. The timing of these crypto investments suggests confidence in the long-term viability of digital assets. Despite recent market corrections, sophisticated players continue making substantial crypto investments, indicating they see value beyond short-term price movements. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investments Onfolio’s $300 million commitment to crypto investments marks a significant milestone in digital asset maturation. This move demonstrates that serious institutional capital continues flowing into cryptocurrency, validating the asset class for conservative investors. As more companies follow suit with their own crypto investments, we may witness accelerated innovation and stability in blockchain markets. Frequently Asked Questions What is Onfolio Holdings? Onfolio Holdings is a Nasdaq-listed company that acquires and operates online businesses, now expanding into cryptocurrency investments. How did Onfolio raise $300 million? The company secured funds through institutional investors and a convertible note facility, which is a type of debt that can convert to equity. Which cryptocurrencies will Onfolio invest in? Onfolio plans direct investments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Why is this significant for crypto markets? This represents substantial institutional validation and could encourage other public companies to make similar crypto investments. When will these investments happen? The company hasn’t specified a timeline but typically executes such strategies promptly after funding completion. Could this affect cryptocurrency prices? Large institutional crypto investments can influence market sentiment and potentially impact prices through increased demand. Found this insight into institutional crypto investments valuable?

54572408,629920,1763476179,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54572408.jpeg,"Kazakhstan Expands Crypto Mining Framework, Setting Up $PEPENODE",https://bitcoinist.com/kazakhstan-expands-crypto-mining-framework-setting-up-pepenode/,"Quick Facts: 1️⃣ Kazakhstan is clarifying its crypto rules, creating a friendlier environment for regulated mining and digital-asset activity. 2️⃣Crypto assets can now circulate across Kazakhstan, no longer restricted to the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC). 3️⃣ PEPENODE introduces a hardware-free mine-to-earn structure that lets users access mining-style rewards through virtual nodes instead of rigs, making the experience accessible to retail users priced out of traditional mining The regulatory environment in the Central Asian crypto mining hub, Kazakhstan, is shifting from a grey area to an increasingly structured one. Recent reforms give clearer legal footing for digital-asset mining, exchange activity, and tokens. A recent amendments bill vastly expands the range of options for crypto miners and users within the country. Essentially, Kazakhstan is giving a green light to crypto mining and moving the crypto industry a bit more into the limelight. The new law: Expands circulation Allows mining by both individuals and entities Permits mined crypto to be traded on more exchanges Kazakhstan’s move also sends a signal to the rest of the world. As jurisdictions like Kazakhstan upgrade their frameworks, projects that lean on real-world utility or scalable models (rather than pure hype) may benefit. Against that backdrop enters PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a meme-coin presale combining gamified ‘mining’ mechanics with virtual nodes, built on the premise of lowering entry-barriers for everyday miners. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Meme-Coin Momentum with Innovative Mine-to-Earn Mechanism PepeNode proposes a novel ‘mine-to-earn’ structure: rather than acquiring expensive rigs or relying on intense energy consumption, users purchase virtual mining nodes inside a gamified dashboard. The node upgrades, leaderboard mechanics, and reward system aim to replicate mining engagement minus the hardware burden. In addition to generating earnings in $PEPENODE itself, the mine-to-earn play includes rewards in market-leading meme coins, such as $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. Presale highlights include: $0.0011546 token price $2.1M presale raise 596% staking rewards during the presale 210B token supply With low-barrier access to a mining-style experience, a catchy meme narrative, and early-stage entry with presale pricing, PEPENODE brings all the benefits of mining to the meme coin sector, but without the real-world costs of intensive equipment. Kazakhstan, PEPENODE Usher in New Mining Era Mining barriers, including cost, hardware, and electricity, have pushed many retail users out of traditional crypto mining. That forces them to new frontiers, like Kazakhstan, or to innovative models where participation can be virtualised or abstracted. That’s precisely where $PEPENODE comes in. In the meantime, there’s another trend emerging. Meme coins have matured beyond pure jokes. Projects integrating game-mechanics, community engagement, and reward loops are earning more serious attention. That trend supports our PEPENODE price prediction , which shows $PEPENODE climbing from its current price to $0.0072 by the end of 2026. That represents 523% gains if you bought at today’s $0.0011546 token price. Our prediction highlights the potential for the project to fit in perfectly with growing regulatory clarity (as in Kazakhstan). The trend signals that some jurisdictions are moving from the ‘wild west’ to more structured regimes. That creates both headwinds, with more oversight, and opportunities; legitimate mining and regulated frameworks. For participants, that means paying attention not just to token mechanics but to jurisdiction, compliance, and roadmap fulfilment. Any positive regulatory narrative tends to bolster confidence. Kazakhstan’s evolving crypto laws and mining-friendly yet regulated posture provide a contextual tailwind for mining-adjacent concepts. Within an increasingly pro-mining context, don’t miss $PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn opportunity.

54572520,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=220362,1763476215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary: Stack Overflow’s Bold Transformation into Premier AI Training Data Provider,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stack-overflow-ai-data-provider/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary: Stack Overflow’s Bold Transformation into Premier AI Training Data Provider In a groundbreaking move that could reshape how AI systems learn from human expertise, Stack Overflow is undergoing a dramatic transformation from coding Q&A platform to essential AI training data provider. This strategic pivot positions the company at the heart of the enterprise AI stack, leveraging its vast repository of programming knowledge to fuel the next generation of artificial intelligence. Stack Overflow AI Enterprise Evolution During Microsoft’s Ignite conference, Stack Overflow unveiled a suite of new products designed specifically for enterprise AI applications. The company’s CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar revealed that this direction was inspired by observing how enterprise customers were already using Stack Overflow’s API for AI training purposes. The core product, Stack Overflow Internal, represents an enterprise-grade version of the familiar forum, but with enhanced security controls and administrative features tailored for corporate environments. Enterprise AI Stack Integration The new tools are engineered to seamlessly integrate with internal AI agents using the model context protocol. What makes this particularly innovative is Stack Overflow’s development of specialized variations specifically designed for their platform. This approach allows enterprises to incorporate verified programming knowledge directly into their AI systems, creating more reliable and accurate AI assistants for development teams. Feature Benefit Enterprise Impact Reliability Scoring AI agents understand answer trustworthiness Reduced errors in code generation Knowledge Graph Connects programming concepts dynamically Faster problem resolution Custom Tagging Enterprise-specific categorization Better organizational knowledge capture AI Training Data Goldmine Stack Overflow has secured content deals with multiple AI labs, allowing them to train models on public Stack Overflow data in exchange for substantial fees. While specific figures remain confidential, Chandrasekar compared these arrangements to “the Reddit deals,” which reportedly generated over $200 million for that platform. This represents a significant revenue stream diversification for Stack Overflow beyond traditional advertising and subscription models. Advanced AI Agents Capabilities The most exciting development comes from CTO Jody Bailey’s vision for read-write functionality. Future AI agents will be able to create their own Stack Overflow queries when they encounter knowledge gaps or cannot answer questions. This represents a fundamental shift from passive knowledge consumption to active knowledge seeking by AI systems. Dynamic query generation by AI agents Automatic knowledge gap identification Reduced developer effort in knowledge capture Continuous organizational learning Model Context Protocol Implementation A critical innovation in Stack Overflow’s approach is the metadata layer exported alongside traditional question-answer pairs. This includes: Answer authorship and timing data Content categorization tags Internal coherence assessments Automated reliability scoring This metadata enables AI systems to make informed decisions about answer trustworthiness, significantly improving the quality of generated responses and reducing the risk of propagating incorrect information. What Does This Mean for Enterprise AI? While Stack Overflow is building the tools rather than the AI agents themselves, the implications are profound. Enterprises can now leverage decades of collective programming wisdom through their internal AI systems. The reliability scoring system means AI agents can prioritize verified solutions over experimental or outdated approaches, potentially saving companies millions in development time and error resolution. The transformation of Stack Overflow from community forum to AI data provider represents a strategic masterstroke in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. By monetizing their vast knowledge repository while maintaining quality through sophisticated reliability scoring, Stack Overflow has positioned itself as an essential component in the enterprise AI infrastructure. As AI systems become increasingly integral to software development, access to high-quality, verified programming knowledge may become the competitive differentiator that separates successful AI implementations from failed experiments. Frequently Asked Questions What is Stack Overflow’s new business model? Stack Overflow is transitioning from a public Q&A platform to an enterprise AI data provider, offering verified programming knowledge and reliability scoring for AI training. How does the reliability scoring work? The system analyzes metadata including answer authorship, timing, content tags, and internal coherence to generate trust scores that help AI agents prioritize accurate information. What are the financial implications of this shift? While specific figures aren’t disclosed, CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar compares the deals to Reddit’s $200M+ AI data licensing agreements. How does this integrate with existing enterprise systems? The tools use the model context protocol and can work with various AI systems, with CTO Jody Bailey emphasizing flexibility for different enterprise environments. What role does Microsoft play in this transformation? The announcement was made at Microsoft ‘s Ignite conference, indicating strategic partnership potential in the enterprise AI space.

On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-on-chain-risk-extreme-value-zone/,"Dogecoin is sitting at an inflection point where weakening market structure meets unusually compressed on-chain risk, according to new charts shared by analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica). The visuals juxtapose a multi-year DOGE/USDT price channel with Alphafractal’s Reserve Risk framework, raising the question of whether the move is a true breakdown or the formation of a long-term bottom. Dogecoin On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone In an X post, Cryptollica explains that the Dogecoin model “combines Reserve Risk with VOCDD/MVOCDD-style activity measures to assess long-term holder conviction versus market pricing.” The key metric is Reserve Risk itself, defined as: “Reserve Risk = Price / HODL Bank.” “HODL Bank” represents the cumulative opportunity cost long-term holders accepted by not selling in earlier rallies. When the current price is low relative to that bank of conviction, Reserve Risk prints low values; when price is high versus that bank, it spikes. Crucially, Cryptollica notes that “low readings historically align with attractive risk/reward (value zones), while high readings mark overheated conditions.” On the Alphafractal chart, this is rendered as a green lower band (value) and a red upper band (overheated). Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst Dogecoin’s past blow-off phases, including the 2021 surge toward roughly $0.76, coincided with Reserve Risk moving into the red zone. By contrast, long consolidation periods following major unwinds saw the indicator fall back into the green band. The latest data point, dated 17 November 2025, shows Reserve Risk again compressed in that lower green area, indicating that, relative to the accumulated HODL Bank, spot prices are historically cheap by this model’s standards. The chart does not predict direction, but it places current conditions firmly in what the framework defines as an “extreme value” environment. DOGE Faces Crash Towards $0.07 The second chart, a three-day DOGE/USDT view from Binance, focuses on price structure. Dogecoin trades within a broad ascending channel that has contained action since 2021. The lower boundary, labeled “Bottom Line,” currently tracks just above the $0.07 area; the upper “TopLine” extends toward about $1.30, with a central “Midline” near the $0.27 region acting repeatedly as resistance. A two-year moving average arcs through the middle of this channel. DOGE lost this average in the bear phase, reclaimed it into 2024–2025 and then rallied to a local high around $0.48, before being rejected at the Midline. A cluster of red arrows at roughly $0.27 marks multiple failed attempts to break higher. Related Reading: How Did The Dogecoin Price React To Elon Musk’s Latest Dog Post? Since then, price has rolled over, slipped back below the two-year MA and is now descending inside the channel. The latest three-day candle shows DOGE trading around $0.15, with an intraperiod spike lower that was partially bought back. DOGE is now trading at a last line of defence: the mid-line of the lower part of the channel around $0.15. If this support breaks, a steep drop towards the “Bottom Line” just above $0.07 could loom. Together, both charts frame Dogecoin’s position sharply. Structurally, DOGE is weakening below its long-term moving average and mid-channel resistance, leaving the lower boundary of the channel as the next major geometric reference. On-chain, however, the Reserve Risk and activity composite indicates that long-term holders’ cumulative conviction now stands against one of the lowest relative price levels seen since the previous cycle. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.157.

The deal still requires Federal Reserve Board approval, with closing targeted by year’s end, subject to remaining conditions. Regulatory Path and Deal Terms LevelField’s plan follows an earlier attempt to combine in early 2023 that was withdrawn after the Silvergate and Signature failures. The firm refiled in December 2024. The report said that LevelField agreed to pay up to $70 million, citing the company’s application to the Federal Reserve. Illinois has cleared the state-level hurdle. The proposed transaction now moves to the Federal Reserve for review. LevelField intends to maintain Burling’s community banking operations while adding digital asset capabilities within a state-regulated, full-service bank. The parties expect to close after all necessary approvals and standard conditions have been satisfied. Both organizations currently employ about 20 people each. If the deal closes, LevelField plans to hire roughly 100 additional staff in the first year. Chief Executive Officer Gene Grant II described the company’s approach to entering regulated banking through an acquisition rather than a narrow-purpose charter. “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” said Grant. https://t.co/YI2fqEqimy More detail on the LevelField Bank approval in our press release.

""First Seen Since November 2024, Data Warns!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-analysis-from-glassnode-first-seen-since-november-2024-data-warns/,"Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a major decline yesterday, falling below $90,000 for the first time in seven months. Altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum (ETH) also falling below $3,000 for the first time in a long time. In addition, XRP was undoubtedly one of the altcoins that experienced a significant decline in the recent decline. While XRP fell to $2.1, Glassnode shared interesting data about XRP. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode said in its latest analysis that over 41% of XRP holders are currently at a loss. According to Glassnode, XRP holders' share of profits dropped to 58.5%, leaving 41.5% in a loss position. This marks the lowest profitability level since November 2024, when XRP was trading at $0.53. According to the data, 26.5 billion XRP, equivalent to 41.5% of the total supply, was found to be in short supply. This suggests the market is “top-heavy,” with investors mostly buying at higher prices. The proportion of XRP supply in profit zones has fallen to 58.5%. This is the lowest level since last November. The current XRP price of $2.15 is nearly four times higher than last November ($0.53), yet still leaves 41.5% of the total supply at a loss. This means the market is dominated by late-entry investors.” Consequently, such a high level of outflows means that late investors who bought at higher price levels are under pressure. This structure could potentially put downward pressure on the price. Because many investors bought near the peak, if prices fall further, these investors may panic sell, increasing downward pressure. Glassnode therefore concludes that the current structure is structurally fragile. At this point, Glassnode notes that despite the current price of around $2.15, data points to an unstable market structure dominated by investors buying at higher prices. *This is not investment advice.

Ma cerchiamo di comprendere al meglio la situazione. Tanto per cominciare il termine mNAV sta per “ Multiple of Net Asset Value ”, ed è un rapporto che confronta il valore dell’azienda sul mercato con il valore delle criptovalute che possiede. Quando un’azienda ha un mNAV maggiore di uno significa sostanzialmente che questa vale più delle sue riserve in crypto, e che gli investitori vedono un modello di business sostenibile e promettente. Le Aziende con Tesoreria in Ethereum Sono in Difficoltà In un nuovo thread su X , Charles Edwards, fondatore di Capriole Investments, ha discusso alcune metriche relative alle aziende che detengono Ethereum in tesoreria. Una “treasury firm” è una società quotata che ha adottato un asset digitale come Bitcoin o Ethereum come strategia di riserva. L’idea è stata resa popolare dalla strategia di Michael Saylor (ex MicroStrategy) , che nel 2020 ha scelto di diventare una società con riserva in BTC. Da allora, è cresciuta fino a diventare di gran lunga il più grande detentore aziendale di asset digitali, con un investimento enorme di 47,54 miliardi di dollari . In passato, le aziende vedevano solo Bitcoin come un asset di riserva praticabile, ma quest’anno si è registrato un aumento dei detentori di ETH, la criptovaluta al secondo posto per capitalizzazione. La “frenesia” delle aziende verso Ethereum ha raggiunto il picco in agosto, ma da allora il ritmo di crescita ha mostrato un rallentamento, come evidenziato dal grafico condiviso da Edwards. Acquisti Istituzionali di Ethereum Dal grafico è chiaro che il tasso di variazione delle tesorerie ETH resta positivo nonostante il rallentamento, suggerendo che le aziende continuano ad accumulare. Ciò significa che, nonostante i recenti deflussi dagli ETF spot , gli acquisti istituzionali restano superiori – anche se di poco – alla crescita dell’offerta della criptovaluta. Il Modello di Business delle Tesorerie ETH Non Sta Funzionando per Molte Aziende Come sottolinea l’analista, la maggior parte delle aziende ha un valore mNAV inferiore a 1 . Come abbiamo già spiegato, il mNAV è una metrica che confronta la capitalizzazione di mercato di un’azienda con il valore totale dei suoi asset di riserva.Un valore inferiore a 1 implica che la valutazione della società è inferiore al valore delle sue riserve. Attualmente, circa il 64,3% delle aziende con tesoreria in Ethereum si trova in questa condizione , ergo il mercato non crede molto nella sostenibilità di queste società. Una sostenibilità resa sempre più precaria in una condizione di difficoltà di ETH. Edwards spiega: “Ciò significa che il quadro delle aziende con tesoreria in ETH è molto più debole rispetto a quello di Bitcoin.” Chiaramente, le tesorerie ETH stanno affrontando pressioni. Ma qualcuna sta vendendo?I dati suggeriscono che la maggior parte non lo sta facendo , poiché il rapporto netto acquisti/vendite rimane solido. Sebbene quasi tutti i detentori corporate di Ethereum siano ancora acquirenti netti, il rapporto buy/sell ha iniziato a scendere mentre il prezzo dell’asset sta vivendo un periodo ribassista. Attualmente ETH è scambiato per circa 3.000 dollari, in un mese ha perso circa il 21% del proprio valore.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-18 14:50:04
54573117,629932,1763477464,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54573117.jpeg,Dogecoin vs Bitcoin: A New Meme Coin Juggernaut Enters the Arena,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-vs-bitcoin-maxi-doge-presale-challenger/,"Quick Facts: The Dogecoin vs Bitcoin debate underscores a clash between long-term stability and high-risk, community-led speculation. Retail traders continue to hunt for low-cap tokens capable of delivering explosive growth reminiscent of Dogecoin’s early cycles. Stealing the spotlight from both $BTC and $DOGE, Maxi Doge introduces a utility-backed model built on competitive trading events and collective rewards. The long-running Dogecoin vs Bitcoin conversation has always split the crypto world into two distinct camps. For years, investors have weighed the differences between these philosophies, comparing Bitcoin’s slow-and-steady resilience with Dogecoin’s capacity for dramatic upside. Bitcoin sits atop the market as digital gold: scarce, secure, and designed for long-term value preservation. Dogecoin , created as a joke, evolved into a symbol of internet culture, fueled by community enthusiasm and viral momentum. This rivalry reflects a deeper tension within the market. Bitcoin offers stability, but its price point feels out of reach for smaller traders looking for monumental gains. Dogecoin once filled that void, as its early cycles delivered extraordinary returns. But its current size makes massive surges increasingly difficult. Recently, Bitcoin just gave the market a scary signal, a ‘Death Cross’ (where the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day one). This hasn’t happened since 2021, and historically, it puts some serious pressure on the whole crypto space. Dogecoin ($DOGE) saw a quick spike to $0.162, but then late-session selling basically wiped out those gains. The big takeaway? $DOGE is still super sensitive to whatever Bitcoin is doing. Traders are constantly scanning the horizon for the next crypto to explode : something culturally strong and priced low enough to deliver those once-in-a-cycle gains. That search has brought attention to new entrants that blend the excitement of early meme coins with modern utility. One of the most talked-about contenders, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , is shaping its identity around a “1000x leverage” mindset, pulling from high-adrenaline trading culture and layering it with community rewards. It marks a shift in the meme coin landscape, moving away from simple jokes and toward fully built ecosystems designed for ambitious participants. Maxi Doge Forges a New High-Leverage Trading Culture Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Doge’s bulky cousin, meant to represent the strength needed to thrive in a volatile market. His mantra, ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump,’ speaks to traders who see the market as a place to sharpen both financial instincts and discipline. Retail traders often struggle to match the confidence and capital of whales; Maxi Doge addresses that gap by cultivating a collective identity, backed by competitions and incentives that reward conviction. Maxi Doge also intentionally leans into the high-risk, high-reward mentality that defines leverage trading. Its ‘Leverage King Culture’ serves as the backbone of its brand, as a framework through which the entire project operates. The core philosophy of lift, trade, repeat mirrors the discipline required in fitness and in trading, creating a thematic bridge between the two worlds. In other words, the project brilliantly turns individual ambition into a coordinated movement, which makes it one of the best meme coins to buy now . This approach is clearly striking a chord. Maxi Doge’s presale has already surpassed $4 million, indicating strong early belief in its mission. Visit the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale for a closer look at the project . Could $MAXI be the Next Meme Coin to Explode? This fusion of meme-driven branding and engagement tools positions Maxi Doge as a fresh force in the Dogecoin vs Bitcoin conversation. It maintains the fun and virality of a meme coin while adding structure, incentives, and community tools. As part of boosting engagement, Maxi Doge will organize holder-exclusive trading competitions with real rewards, complete with leaderboards that encourage participation and growth. Another major component is the staking program. Holders can lock up $MAXI to earn attractive passive income, currently at 76% APY. And at the center of Maxi Doge’s sustainable meme coin model is the Maxi Fund – a treasury dedicated to maintaining liquidity, supporting partnerships, and fueling marketing campaigns. Together, these features present a compelling alternative for traders navigating the Dogecoin vs Bitcoin divide. So it wouldn’t be surprising to see $MAXI explode, as explained in our price forecasts for 2025, 2026, and 2030 . Built on the Ethereum network, Maxi Doge uses an ERC-20 smart contract for supply management and reward distribution. For detailed presale instructions, read our ‘How to Buy Maxi Doge’ guide .
