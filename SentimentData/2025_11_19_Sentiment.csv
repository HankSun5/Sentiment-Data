According to recent Bank of America reports, investors are rapidly reducing their short positions on the US dollar, creating ripple effects across global markets. Understanding the dollar positioning shift Bank of America’s latest analysis reveals significant changes in how institutional investors are approaching the US dollar. The current dollar positioning reflects a notable departure from recent trends, with hedge funds and large speculators scaling back their bearish bets. This shift in dollar positioning comes amid changing expectations about Federal Reserve policy and global economic conditions. Why investors reduce shorts now Several factors are driving why investors reduce shorts at this particular moment. The primary reasons include: Changing interest rate expectations Global economic uncertainty Technical market signals Risk management considerations When investors reduce shorts, it typically indicates a reassessment of market conditions and risk appetite. The current move suggests traders are becoming less confident about dollar weakness in the near term. Key insights from BofA reports The latest BofA reports provide crucial data points for understanding market sentiment. According to their analysis: Metric Previous Position Current Position Change Net Short Positions -$25.6B -$18.3B +$7.3B Long Positions $42.1B $48.9B +$6.8B Short Positions $67.7B $67.2B -$0.5B The BofA reports highlight that this isn’t just a minor adjustment but represents a meaningful change in market positioning. Impact on the broader forex market These positioning changes are creating significant waves throughout the forex market. Major currency pairs are experiencing increased volatility as market participants adjust their strategies. The forex market implications extend beyond just dollar pairs, affecting cross rates and emerging market currencies as well. What the currency outlook suggests The current currency outlook appears to be shifting toward dollar strength, at least in the short term. However, the longer-term currency outlook remains uncertain due to several competing factors: Diverging central bank policies Geopolitical tensions Inflation dynamics Growth differentials Actionable insights for traders For active traders and investors, these developments offer several important considerations. Monitoring dollar positioning changes can provide early signals about market direction. The fact that investors reduce shorts suggests caution may be warranted for those betting on continued dollar weakness. FAQs What does Bank of America track in their currency reports? Bank of America (BofA) monitors futures positions, options activity, and cash market flows to assess market positioning. How often do these positioning reports come out? Major banks including Bank of America typically provide weekly updates on futures positioning and monthly deeper analysis. What other institutions provide similar analysis? Other major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase also publish regular currency positioning analysis. How reliable are these positioning indicators? While not perfect predictors, positioning data from sources like Bank of America provide valuable context about market sentiment extremes. The dramatic shift in dollar positioning represents a crucial moment for currency markets. As investors reduce shorts and reassess their outlook, the implications could extend far beyond traditional forex trading into cryptocurrency markets and global risk assets. This repositioning suggests markets are entering a new phase where dollar strength may surprise many participants.

According to the latest report from Sky News on the matter, the agreement is set to be announced formally next week. Curve told its shareholders in recent days that it had signed a share sale and purchase contract with Lloyds, which could see the UK’s largest high street bank make its most significant step into digital payments yet. Yet, according to insiders’ understanding, the purchase has sparked a dispute among some of Curve’s top shareholders, who believe the valuation is significantly below what the platform is truly worth. Curve acquisition by UK bank not in the clear yet According to anonymous sources, the company, boasting over six million users, could exhaust its cash reserves this year if a buyer is not secured. In early September, Chief Executive Shachar Bialick admitted that Lloyds Banking Group offered a valuation that was low compared to its previous fundraising rounds, but insisted that Curve needs to secure its future regardless of the sale. Curve has raised more than £250 million ($289 million) since its launch, including a £37 million ($42.8 million) funding round that took place in March this year, led by Hanco Ventures. We see issuers looking to enter the market, and networks introducing innovative products such as Visa Flex and MasterCard One Credentials. This investment would allow us to invest further in our customer experience, bring new partnerships, and accelerate our path to profitability. Shachar Bialick. The current deal values the business at a fraction of those investments, a gap that has been blasted by Curve’s shareholders, now seeking legal means to stop its sale. IDC Ventures threatens Curve and Lloyds Banking Group Sky News reported that Curve’s early shareholders, including IDC Ventures, the company’s largest external investor with a 12% holding, have publicly rejected the deal and are threatening legal action. IDC Ventures issued a statement saying it is deeply worried about how Curve’s management and board handled the sale talks. A company spokesperson told Sky that governance issues and ownership questions were unresolved at the time of the agreement, and argued that the transaction was not in the company’s best interests. It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. IDC does not intend to support the proposed sale and does not believe that it is capable of being implemented without its support. IDC Curve, in its message to shareholders, acknowledged the disappointment around the valuation, adding that the offer failed to meet the expectations set beforehand. We recognise that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve, and we share the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome. Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve’s creditors and shareholders as a whole. Curve. IDC Ventures said last Friday it would defend its commercial interests and asked both Curve and Lloyds to address its concerns before moving ahead with the acquisition . Curve wallet is facing internal leadership and governance issues In July, IDC Ventures attempted to remove Lord Stanley Fink, the former Conservative Party treasurer and a high-profile City figure, from his position as chair of Curve. The fund propounded that the appointing shareholder had already removed him, only for the board to reinstall him two days later. During Curve’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in early October, opponents failed to remove both Fink and chief executive Bialick through a shareholder vote. IDC Ventures, represented by the London-based law firm Quinn Emanuel, has been involved with Curve for six years and has participated in several major funding rounds. In a statement shared with Sky News last month, the investor said it was troubled by the reappointment of Fink and by the lack of transparency around the board’s handling of the sale process.

Bitcoin’s price action has hovered in the mid-$90,000 range since the drop, but the past 24 hours have been highlighted by a break below $90,000. In the middle of this bearish volatility, a new technical outlook from Tony “The Bull” Severino suggests that Bitcoin’s next move may be more bullish than the recent weakness implies. A Death Cross Forms During The Bitcoin Price Downtrend Tony’s analysis highlights the developing death cross on the daily timeframe, where the 50-day moving average is now bending down toward the 200-day moving average. The pattern is generally viewed as bearish, but the placement of the moving averages and the slope of the short-term line show something different unfolding on Bitcoin’s chart. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? The green 50-day average has been gradually drifting lower after weeks of fading momentum, and the red 200-day average has begun flattening out from the long-term uptrend. As shown on the chart below, this death cross has formed around $110,000, and according to the analyst, Bitcoin might pump into this price level next week. The reason a pump remains possible at this stage is tied directly to how moving averages behave. After the breakdown beneath $100,000, Bitcoin found support just below $92,000 and has since been forming a series of smaller-bodied candles that reflect the early stages of a potential reversal. If buyers take control, a fast move toward the region between $103,000 and $110,000 becomes realistic. However, price action in the past 24 hours, which has seen Bitcoin break below $90,000, threatens this bullish outlook. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: @TonyTheBullCMT On X The Path To $110,000 This Week For Bitcoin to reach $110,000 in the coming days, the market would need to replay a pattern seen several times in past cycles: a strong relief rally just before or immediately after a death cross forms. These rallies happen because sentiment becomes overly pessimistic at the exact moment when shorts begin to pile in, leaving the price vulnerable to a sharp upside reaction. However, for that scenario to unfold now, Bitcoin would first need to push convincingly back above $90,000 and show that momentum is shifting away from the recent sell-off. Related Reading: This Analyst Called The Bitcoin Crash Below $20,000 In 2021, He’s Back With A Shocking Prediction For Solana Interestingly, other analysts have pointed to bullish primers for Bitcoin, despite the bearish price action. One such case is the Bitcoin SSR RSI, which was highlighted by a CryptoQuant community analyst called Maartunn, that shows rising stablecoin buying power relative to Bitcoin’s market cap. On the other hand, a bearish indicator has risen up with the SuperTrend indicator, which proposes a further 67% drop in the price of Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,760, down by 5.8% in the past 24 hours.

Fewer than 1.05 million BTC are left to be mined, and issuance will slow sharply as the network advances through future halvings. Permanently Lost and Unspendable BTC A portion of Bitcoin’s supply can never re-enter circulation. Roughly 230 BTC are unspendable due to the genesis block subsidy and early invalid scripts. Additional coins are believed lost through forgotten or unrecoverable private keys, further tightening the effective supply. How Bitcoin’s Halvings Cut Issuance Bitcoin’s supply halves every 210,000 blocks. The most recent halving on April 20, 2024, reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, lowering daily issuance from 900 BTC to about 450 BTC. Earlier halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 brought the subsidy down from 50 BTC to its current level, pushing annualized supply growth below 1%. The next halving is estimated for April 2028, and the final fractions of Bitcoin are expected to be mined around 2140. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Price Pullback Aligns With Technical Weakness Despite a tightening supply, price action has weakened. Bitcoin has fallen toward the mid-$80,000s, breaking below a long-term ascending trendline that supported most of the 2024 advance. BTC now trades under both the 20-EMA and 50-EMA on the daily chart, reinforcing bearish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart also reflects a completed ABCD pattern near the $115,000 high and a breakdown from a rising wedge, both common precursors to broader corrections. Price is approaching the $83,800–$74,500 demand zone, an area that previously generated strong buying interest. RSI near 28 shows oversold conditions, although a clear bullish divergence has not yet formed. TradingView’s projected path suggests BTC may drift slightly lower before forming a stabilization pattern within the demand zone. A hammer or bullish engulfing candle would signal buyer re-entry. Levels to Watch in the Weeks Ahead A recovery above $96,000 would be the first sign of stabilization. A move through $100,700 could open the way to a retest of $115,200, provided sentiment improves. Failure to hold the demand area would expose $74,500 as the next key level. For traders, current conditions resemble the early phase of an accumulation zone. If BTC reclaims its short-term EMAs and confirms support, the next rally could extend to major altcoins, including ETH, SOL, and XRP. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed.

However, it’s important to note that such investments come with both opportunities and challenges that require careful consideration.

Tether’s strategic investment in Ledn represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin lending services. Both companies share a common vision: creating robust financial infrastructure that allows users to unlock liquidity while maintaining their Bitcoin positions. This approach addresses one of the biggest challenges facing long-term crypto holders – how to access funds without sacrificing potential future gains from their digital assets. The collaboration brings together Tether’s massive stablecoin ecosystem with Ledn’s established Bitcoin lending platform. While the exact investment amount remains confidential, the strategic nature suggests deep integration and shared goals. This partnership could potentially transform how millions of cryptocurrency users interact with their digital wealth. How Does Bitcoin Lending Work in Practice? Bitcoin lending platforms like Ledn provide essential financial services that traditional banks often overlook. Here’s how the process typically works: Users deposit Bitcoin as collateral The platform provides loans in stablecoins or fiat currency Borrowers maintain ownership of their Bitcoin Interest rates are typically lower than traditional alternatives This system creates a win-win situation where investors can access liquidity for personal or business needs while their Bitcoin continues to appreciate in value. The Tether-Ledn partnership strengthens this ecosystem by combining expertise and resources from two industry leaders. Why Is This Strategic Investment So Important for Crypto Adoption?

Many potential investors hesitate to allocate significant funds to Bitcoin because they fear locking up capital that might be needed for emergencies or opportunities. Bitcoin lending solutions eliminate this concern by providing flexible access to liquidity. Moreover, this partnership demonstrates growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrency infrastructure. When major players like Tether invest in Bitcoin lending platforms, it signals maturity and stability in the sector. This validation could encourage more traditional investors to explore cryptocurrency opportunities. What Challenges Does Bitcoin Lending Face? Despite the exciting potential, Bitcoin lending still faces several hurdles that the Tether-Ledn partnership aims to address: Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions Market volatility affecting collateral values Security concerns around digital asset storage User education about responsible borrowing practices The combined expertise of both companies positions them well to navigate these challenges. Tether’s experience with regulatory compliance and Ledn’s proven track record in secure Bitcoin lending create a formidable alliance. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Lending? This strategic investment could catalyze significant innovation in the Bitcoin lending space. We might see new products and services emerge, such as: More flexible loan terms and conditions Integration with traditional financial services Enhanced risk management tools Global expansion of accessible lending markets The partnership represents a crucial step toward building comprehensive financial ecosystems around digital assets. As more users recognize the benefits of Bitcoin lending without selling, we can expect accelerated growth and innovation in this sector. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin lending? Bitcoin lending allows cryptocurrency holders to use their Bitcoin as collateral to secure loans without selling their digital assets, providing access to liquidity while maintaining investment exposure. How does Tether’s investment benefit Ledn users? Tether’s investment brings additional resources, stability, and industry expertise to Ledn, potentially leading to better services, improved security, and expanded lending options for users. Is Bitcoin lending safe? While all cryptocurrency activities carry some risk, established platforms like Ledn implement robust security measures.

In the past 24 hours, it sank below $90K. Despite its struggles, Bitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency. While its transaction speeds are notoriously slow and expensive, Layer-2 projects have cropped up to solve this. Bitcoin Hyper is the first Bitcoin Layer-2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine for high-speed transactions. Its presale has shown massive momentum, raising over $27.8M and attracting significant whale investment. It’s been a tough several months for Bitcoin ($BTC). Just last month, it reached an ATH of $126K, leading many traders to believe that it would continue to go up from there. And yet the market shared a collective sigh as Bitcoin dropped below $90K in the last 24 hours, a level that would’ve been close to unthinkable in October. Despite that, Bitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency in the market. Because of this, it’s also easy to overlook the fact that it isn’t perfect at all. Bitcoin’s core limitations are well-known: slow transactions, high fees, and a lack of smart contract functionality. While its security is unmatched, its utility has been constrained, pushing developers and decentralized applications to other, more flexible blockchains. This has created a massive opportunity for solutions that can expand Bitcoin’s capabilities without compromising its foundational strength. The race to build effective Bitcoin Layer-2 networks is heating up, and this is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. Bitcoin Hyper Unlocks DeFi on Bitcoin with Solana-Like Speed Transactions Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the first-ever Bitcoin Layer-2 solution that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . This innovative approach aims to solve Bitcoin’s scalability problem by bringing the high-speed, low-cost transaction processing of the Solana ecosystem directly to Bitcoin. By creating a modular blockchain that uses Bitcoin for settlement and a real-time SVM layer for execution, it promises to deliver performance that could even surpass Solana itself. Unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the SVM is renowned for its parallel transaction processing capabilities. This allows it to handle thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of other networks. This architecture is designed to finally enable a robust ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and complex dApps on Bitcoin, backed by its unparalleled security and liquidity. The market has responded with overwhelming enthusiasm, signaling strong belief in the project’s vision. Read our detailed Bitcoin Hyper review for a full lowdown on the project. By building a Layer-2 on top of Bitcoin that uses this engine, Bitcoin Hyper effectively bypasses Bitcoin’s native limitations. It creates an execution environment where developers can build sophisticated applications in Rust, a language known for safety and performance. This opens the door for a wave of new use cases previously impossible on Bitcoin. Imagine high-frequency trading, decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and NFT marketplaces operating with the speed of Solana but settling on the trust-minimized Bitcoin blockchain. The platform provides a Canonical Bridge for seamless $BTC transfers, ensuring liquidity can flow easily between the layers. This combination of speed, low fees, and security is what makes the Bitcoin Hyper proposition so powerful. $HYPER Presale Surges Past $27M as Whales Take Notice When the L2 launches, its native $HYPER tokens will power it. While you can use it to pay for transaction fees, holding it will also give you governance rights and access to exclusive features. Right now, you buy get these tokens via the official Bitcoin Hyper presale website . The market’s response to the project has been nothing short of explosive. The project’s presale has soared, raising an impressive $27.8M, with the $HYPER token currently priced at just $0.013295. It’s easy to get your share of $HYPER tokens. Check out our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper for more details. This powerful momentum indicates strong investor confidence in its mission to scale Bitcoin. Adding to the bullish sentiment, on-chain data shows significant interest from major players. A recent whale buy just north of $500K worth of tokens is the strongest proof yet of the attention it is getting. This smart money movement suggests that high-net-worth investors are recognizing the project’s long-term potential. The Bitcoin Hyper price is expected to climb as the presale progresses, rewarding early participants. Beyond the initial offering, the project incentivizes long-term holding through a robust staking program. You can stake your tokens immediately and enjoy 41% APY, although this can still change as more holders lock their tokens in the staking pool. With just a day before the next price increase, now’s the time to get your hands on tokens at a discounted price. Ready to jump in? Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

The company is more than well positioned to monetize their ambitious ""target of 250–500 MW critical IT load of new HPC lease signings annually,"" thanks to the growing HPC capacity. WULF's projected NOI margin of over ~70% is extremely impressive as well, compared to other data center REITs, with it implying its robust top/ bottom-line growth prospects. The meltdown has already triggered WULF's cheaper FY2027 EV/Sales valuations of ~4.44x, nearer to its hyperscaler/neocloud peers while triggering an improved margin of safety. With the bright long-term prospects outweighing the near-term noise surrounding the recent moderation in BTC spot prices, I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock. I previously covered TeraWulf Inc (NASDAQ: WULF ) in October 2025, discussing how its timely transition to HPC opportunities had been backed by the insatiable cloud demand and the higher data center-related capex trends. Combined with the strategic leveraging of its existing bitcoin mining infrastructure for HPC purposes, the strategic financing from Alphabet ( GOOG ), and the cheap FY2027 valuations, I had initiated my Buy rating upon a moderate retracement to the 50/100-day moving averages for a lower dollar cost average then. In this article, I shall discuss why I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock as it finally nears my Buy Zones, thanks to its robust AI monetization opportunities arising from the multi-year contracted backlog and the growing HPC capacity. I am of the opinion that its bright long-term prospects far outweigh the near-term headwinds arising from the higher debt reliance and the volatile Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) spot prices as well. WULF Reports Robust AI Monetization WULF 1Y Stock Price Trading View Since my last article, the early Q3'25 earnings season has finally brought forth "" stock valuation fears ,"" with it triggering notable corrections across the AI value chain and WULF similarly pulling back by -35.5% since the 52 week heights. This development was also why I previously urged readers to wait before adding, preferably after a moderate retracement to the 50/100-day moving averages, thanks to the potential volatility and capital losses arising from chasing overpriced stocks during an exuberant AI hype. This is especially since WULF is mostly a bitcoin miner, with the FQ3'25 digital asset revenues of $43.37M ( -8.9% QoQ /+60.3% YoY) comprising 85.7% of its overall revenues (-14.3 points QoQ/YoY). Thanks to the higher average BTC spot prices of $114.47K in Q3'25 (+15.9% QoQ/+87.5% YoY) along with the expanding mining capacity of 245 MW ( inline QoQ / +25.6% YoY ), it is unsurprising that the company has proved itself as a beneficiary of the cryptocurrency boom, as demand for alternative assets grow and the de-dollarization trends continue . WULF's Robust HPC Opportunities WULF Otherwise, while nascent, WULF has reported robust HPC lease revenues of $7.2M (NA QoQ/NA YoY), with further growth likely, based on the Lake Mariner Campus HPC leasing capacity of 22.5 MW in FQ3'25 along with the planned expansion to 522.5 MW through 2026 and up to 750 MW in maximum capacity . This is on top of the upcoming HPC leasing capacity of 168 MW in Abernathy from H2'26 onwards and 400 MW in Cayuga, New York from 2027 onwards, which naturally lend credence to the management's aggressive guidance of ~1.5 GW in critical IT load capacity over the next few years and the ambitious growth ""target of 250–500 MW critical IT load of new HPC lease signings annually."" These may allow WULF to report robust top-line growth prospects moving forward, allowing them to monetize their 100% pre-leased contracted backlog of 510 MW at favorable rates, based on the overall contracted revenues of $17.2B across: the 60 MW - Core42 lease, with projected NOI margin of 85%, the 366 MW - Fluidstack lease, with projected NOI margin of 85%, and the 168 MW - Fluidstack lease, with projected NOI margin of 70%. These profit margins are impressive as well, compared to numerous data center REITs, including Equinix ( EQIX ) at over ~60% over the LTM and Digital Realty Trust ( DLR ) at ~50%, allowing them to deliver highly profitable margins ahead. The Conse nsus Forward Estimates Seeking Alpha As a result of the robust insights offered by the contracted backlog and the projected expansion in its capacity, I can understand why the consensus forward estimates appear rather promising, with WULF expected to report an accelerated top-line growth at a CAGR of +99.7% through FY2027. On the other hand, given the supposed 2Y+ time lag between the typical booking and the revenue recognition arising from the tight supply environment, I am of the opinion that WULF is likely to intensify their debt reliance in the mean time, with it likely to trigger its mixed near-term prospects before things drastically lift once its HPC capacity is ramped up and its multi-year backlog is monetized. For reference, WULF has already reported numerous financing activities across the $3.2B from GOOG and the $2B in Convertible Notes 2030/2031 (pre-FQ3'25 earnings call) along with the new $3.2B in Convertible Notes 2030 (post FQ3'25 earnings call) and the new $1.02B in Convertible Notes 2032. The elevated HPC ramping up costs/higher interest expenses may also be why WULF continues to report negative net income performances, despite the growing adj EBITDA profitability by +203% YoY in FQ3'25. A similar trend has been observed in numerous neoclouds/hyperscalers in the recent Q3'25 earnings season, with it signaling the hefty and bottom-line/cash flow dilutive capex trends during the multi-year AI boom. WULF Is An Even Better Buy After The Correction WULF 5Y Stock Price Trading View Thanks to the market-wide AI-related meltdown, WULF has already lost part of its recent Q4'25 gains to retest the prior support levels of $10s ranges, with it also bringing the stock nearer to the prior Buy Zone discussed in my last article. WULF Valuations Seeking Alpha On the one hand, given the nascency of its HPC leasing opportunities, WULF may appear to be somewhat expensive at FWD EV/Sales valuations of 27.43x, compared to the sector median of 3.40x and its peers, including: hyperscaler - Amazon ( AMZN ) at FWD EV/Sales valuations of 3.60x, hyperscaler - Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) at 8.21x, hyperscaler - Microsoft ( MSFT ) at 11.66x, neocloud - DigitalOcean ( DOCN ) at 6.21x, neocloud - CoreWeave ( CRWV ) at 10.78x, neocloud - Nebius ( NBIS ) at 36.85x, and Bitcoin miner turned HPC provider - Core Scientific ( CORZ ) at 14.19x. On the other hand, with much of its capacity expected to be ramped up over the next few years, I am of the opinion that WULF appears rather compelling at my estimated FY2027 EV/Sales valuations of 4.44x, based on the current Enterprise Value of $4.98B and the consensus FY2027 revenue estimates of $1.12B. This is especially since WULF benefits from the firm multi-year backlog and the growing HPC compute capacity, albeit with lumpy near-term performance arising from the recent moderation in BTC spot prices. With the bright long-term prospects far outweighing the near-term noise, I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock.",WULF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-18 13:53:07
54571944,629527,1763474428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54571944.jpeg,"Crypto Market Is Structurally Rigged, Warns Wintermute CEO",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-structurally-rigged-wintermute-ceo/,"A fresh bout of soul-searching has gripped the crypto derivatives industry as leading market participants argue that the market’s structure is fundamentally flawed – not just unlucky. Wintermute founder and CEO Evgeny Gaevoy set the tone on X, arguing that the core problem is not perpetual futures themselves but the way key venues are architected. Posting under his handle @EvgenyGaevoy (wishful_cynic), he wrote that “the real issue is not the perp design but the centralized (and quadi [sic] decentralized) exchanges that are prime broker, CLOB and custodian all in one,” adding that traditional finance “solved all this stuff long time ago.” His critique targets the vertically integrated model that dominates both centralized exchanges and some so-called “decentralized” platforms, where custody, matching, risk management and prime brokerage-like functions are bundled into a single entity. In stress events, that consolidation can turn one venue into a systemic choke point. Structural Weakness Threatens The Crypto Market DeFiance Capital founder Arthur Cheong (@Arthur_0x) places the blame partly on derivatives product design. He argues that “crypto derivatives (mainly perps) product design and market structure that surround it remain the biggest problem the industry needs to tackle before it can grow to the next level in a sustainable manner.” He draws a straight line between the March 2020 crash and the recent 10 October (“10/10”) meltdown . In March 2020, he notes, Bitcoin’s 50–70% intraday plunge was exacerbated by BitMEX-style BTC-margined “quanto” perps, “which means BTC perps are collateralized by BTC not stablecoins thus you get the extreme reflexivity on the downside and there’s just very little way you can hedge this quanto perp exposure.” According to Arthur, most participants recognized this as a design flaw. As stablecoin usage grew, the market share of BTC-margined quanto perps on BitMEX fell from “>80% to less than 20% in one year,” and by mid-2021 “most people are using USDT margined BTC perps.” That collective shift, he argues, “have definitely improve[d] the resilience of market structure significantly” and reduced volatility in BTC, though he still “look[s] forward to a new product design significantly better than the current iteration of crypto perps.” If Gaevoy and Arthur focus on architecture and instruments, pseudonymous trader The White Whale (@TheWhiteWhaleV2) has put the human cost of recent failures front and center in a X post with 1.8 million views. In the widely shared thread explaining his “personal decision to step away from trading on HyperLiquid ,” he praises HyperLiquid founder Jeff Yan and the team for dragging “structural fairness into the spotlight,” but concludes that 10/10 exposed something deeper. “The fact that one centralized exchange can trigger a global liquidation cascade and force temporary price dislocations across every protocol? That’s not a ‘black swan.’ That’s a design flaw.” His recap of 10/10 is stark: Binance relied on its own oracle , which depegged a stablecoin and started “a smaller, but manageable, liquidation chain.” Then “their API mysteriously went offline.” Market makers who “operate largely delta-neutral” suddenly couldn’t hedge; they pulled quotes across CEXs and DEXs. “With no liquidity present, price falls off a cliff.” The industry’s reaction, he argues, revealed a misaligned set of priorities. “Victory laps” over “Zero bad debt!” and “Liquidations processed flawlessly!” may show protocols survived, but “Great. The protocol didn’t die. But users did.” He insists that “protecting the protocol IS important – obviously. But it is not the same thing as protecting traders.” As an alternative, White Whale points to Drift on Solana as one venue that has at least attempted to encode protection at the protocol level. Drift’s liquidation protection, he writes, “isn’t magic. It’s not flawless. But it exists – and more importantly, it worked.” A key rule is simple: “Is the oracle price diverging by more than 50% from the 5-minute TWAP?” If so, the system temporarily halts liquidations, filtering out “scam wicks” and pushing edge cases to the insurance fund. Across Gaevoy’s structural critique, Yan’s product-design history and White Whale’s exit from HyperLiquid, a common conclusion emerges: today’s crypto market is not just volatile – it is structurally biased against traders in moments of stress. Whether the industry now prioritizes circuit breakers, segregated roles and on-chain protections will determine if 10/10 becomes a turning point, or just another preventable disaster.

The November 17 order grants Dimensional exemptions that enable open-end management investment companies to operate both ETF classes and mutual fund classes within the same fund structure, positioning the firm as the first to deploy this model for actively managed products. Dimensional filed its initial application in July 2023 and submitted three amendments before receiving final approval. The SEC’s order exempts the firm from several provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, including sections governing share pricing, redemptions, and certain affiliated transactions. SEC issues approval order allowing Dimensional to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds… Becomes second asset manager after Vanguard w/ this capability & the first w/ ability to use for actively managed products. Some *90* other asset managers pursuing this as well. pic.twitter.com/AILGy0Y9K3 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 17, 2025 Ninety Firms Await Similar Approvals Nearly ninety other asset managers have filed applications seeking identical capabilities, according to several ETF analysts. The approval signals potential momentum for a broader wave of hybrid fund structures across the industry. Nate Geraci, co-founder of ETF Store, noted that Dimensional holds a competitive edge as the first firm authorized to apply this model to actively managed strategies. While Vanguard pioneered the structure, its primary focus remains passive index funds. Dimensional’s approval extends the framework into active management, where fund companies typically generate higher fees and maintain greater differentiation from competitors. BIG news for DFA. Congratulations to them for being first. Have to assume floodgates are going to open for those ~90 other firms vying for similar approvals. https://t.co/pCPA8KfACU — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 18, 2025 James Seyffart, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, predicted an imminent surge of approvals for firms awaiting similar authorizations. The hybrid model allows asset managers to offer lower-cost ETF shares alongside traditional mutual fund shares, which can potentially attract investors seeking tax efficiency and intraday trading without forcing existing mutual fund shareholders to convert. Solana ETF Competition Intensifies VanEck launched the third U.S. Solana staking ETF on Monday , entering a field where Bitwise and Grayscale have collectively captured over $380 million since late October. The VanEck Solana ETF, trading under the ticker VSOL, has waived its 0.3 percent management fee through February 17, or until assets reach $1 billion. Fidelity is set to debut its Solana ETF, ticker FSOL, on November 19 with a 25 basis point fee. Canary Funds will launch its Solana ETF, ticker SOLC, the same day, in partnership with Marinade Finance for on-chain staking. Balchunas emphasized Fidelity’s scale advantage as the largest asset manager competing in this category, noting BlackRock’s absence from the Solana market despite its dominance in Bitcoin ETFs. Fidelity Solana ETF $FSOL is slated to launch TOMORROW. Fee is 25bps. Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out. $BSOL got out first, has $450m, $VSOL launched today, Grayscale is in mix. Game on. pic.twitter.com/iCXMkAH9qe — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 17, 2025 Bitwise’s Solana ETF, ticker BSOL, currently leads with approximately $450 million in assets under management. Grayscale has also entered the Solana ETF lineup alongside the new entrants. Regulatory Shift Signals Broader Industry Integration The hybrid model addresses longstanding friction between mutual fund investors seeking tax efficiency and ETF investors requiring traditional share class options. The approval builds on the SEC’s September streamlining initiative that eliminated case-by-case reviews for crypto ETF applications, dramatically accelerating product launches across the digital asset space. Today, the SEC also removed crypto from its examination priorities for 2026, indicating that digital assets are no longer considered a special risk area requiring heightened supervisory focus.

SIGNALING IT’S NO LONGER CONSIDERED A SPECIAL RISK AREA. pic.twitter.com/LUP4suYJ7j — Crypto Rover (@cryptorover) November 18, 2025 Industry observers view the removal as a tacit acknowledgment that crypto markets have matured sufficiently to warrant treatment comparable to other established asset classes under the agency’s standard regulatory framework. Digital asset investment products have recently declined amid the general market bear that saw Bitcoin slip below $90K today from $126K October ATH . Last week, these investment products saw $2 billion in outflows , marking the heaviest weekly withdrawals since February. The three-week streak resulted in cumulative outflows of $3.2 billion amid sharp price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Total assets under management in digital asset ETPs dropped 27 percent from their early-October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion. U.S.-based products accounted for $1.97 billion of last week’s outflows, while others also recorded notable outflows.

Recent price predictions suggest a 300% pump for $SHIB if the token reaches two critical levels, which would set it up for an aggressive rally. Bitcoin Hyper introduces a Layer 2 solution that brings high-speed smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem via a Solana Virtual Machine integration. The $HYPER presale raised over $27.8M so far with a token price of $0.013295 and staking rewards currently at 41%. The altcoin market is at a fascinating crossroads. While speculative assets have dominated cycles past, a clear trend toward utility is emerging. Investors are looking past fleeting hype, demanding projects with sustainable technology and real-world use cases. This shift in sentiment is reshaping the altcoin market outlook for 2025, forcing a re-evaluation of long-term value. Take top altcoins like Shiba Inu, for instance, which is currently at a crossroads, showing clear-cut signs of consolidation and momentum buildup. Trader’s expectation of a 300% $SHIB pump long-term is no longer unrealistic, provided $SHIB can hold two critical levels. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently at the opposite end of the spectrum, after crashing below $90K today. The reasons are multiple, from bulk whale sells to dwindling investor participation and increased fear. But there’s another problem worth talking about. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, offers unparalleled security and trust but its slow transaction speeds, high fees, and lack of native smart contract capabilities, have hindered its investor appeal. Right now, Bitcoin ranks 30th in terms of TPS . A new contender, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve this trilemma directly. As the newest Bitcoin Layer 2 solution integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Hyper promises to unlock Bitcoin’s dormant potential. By creating a high-speed execution layer on top of Bitcoin’s secure settlement, Bitcoin Hyper introduces the programmability and performance needed for modern dApps. This approach could fundamentally alter the competitive dynamics of the blockchain space, bringing high-performance applications to the industry’s most trusted network. Bitcoin Hyper Redefines Speed and Programmability Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) tackles Bitcoin’s core limitations head-on. Its modular architecture uses Bitcoin’s Layer 1 for ultimate security and settlement while a real-time SVM-based Layer 2 handles transaction execution. This allows for extremely low-latency processing and high-speed, low-cost transactions. The project’s decentralized Canonical Bridge facilitates seamless and secure cross-minting of $BTC into its L2 environment. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper brings fast, scalable smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem. This move enables developers to build sophisticated DeFi applications, NFT platforms, and gaming dApps using familiar tools like the Rust programming language. This innovative approach is capturing significant attention. The ongoing presale for its native token, $HYPER, has already raised an impressive $27.8M+ at the time of writing, with $HYPER sitting at $0.013295. This strong demand signals major investor confidence in the project’s vision. If this type of hype continues, $HYPER could explode post release. Our price prediction for $HYPER , based on the project’s utility and community support, puts the token at $0.08625 by the end of 2026. In terms of ROI, we’re talking about potential profits of 548%. This is enough of an incentive for any crypto hunter looking for portfolio diversification. If this sounds like you, make sure you read our guide on how to buy $HYPER today. Check $HYPER’s live presale today. A New Ecosystem for DeFi, Gaming, and Payments The implications of bringing high-performance smart contracts to Bitcoin are massive. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) unlocks a wide range of use cases previously impossible on the network, creating a new ecosystem for developers and users alike. Developers can build swaps, lending platforms, and staking protocols that leverage Bitcoin’s liquidity with the speed of an SVM chain. For everyday traders, use cases range from high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC with minimal fees to comprehensive DeFi protocols. With presale tokens currently priced at $0.013295, early participants are getting in at the ground floor – an opportunity which won’t last long anymore. The project has a projected release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 so, if you want to invest, invest today. Secure your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing. Crypto is a high-risk market and presales have no success guarantee.

BGIN's core operations include mining smaller coins and developing mining machines, with expansion plans into bitcoin and Dogecoin mining by 1H26. Despite a low price/sales multiple, BGIN's revenue is forecasted to decline 62% in eFY25, driven by weak demand and market headwinds. I recommend a Sell rating on BGIN, targeting $2.93/share, as continued market challenges may further impact revenue and shareholder value. Bgin Blockchain Limited ( BGIN ) is a cryptocurrency miner and mining machine developer that primarily focuses on smaller coins like the Kaspa coin. The company came into the public markets at the end of October 2025 through an IPO during a period of significant declines across the cryptocurrency markets. With reported 1h25 sales experiencing a large decline in machine sales and mining pool revenue, Bgin may be facing significant pressure for the coming quarters if the cryptocurrency market continues to decline. Given the challenges faced in the market, I believe shares should be trading at 2.93/share at 1.52x eFY27 price/sales; I am recommending BGIN shares with a Sell rating. Bgin Blockchain Limited Operations Bgin, a Cayman Islands-based company, came to the public markets on October 22, 2025 through an initial public offering, issuing 5mm Class A ordinary shares at an IPO price of $6.00/share. Bgin raised roughly $30mm from the offering that is expected to be used to purchase and/or construct mining farms as well as invest in research and development of proprietary chips designed for cryptocurrency mining machines. Bgin’s lockup period expires 6 months following the IPO, which should land in April 2026. Corporate Filings Bgin is a holding company operating under Bgin HK, Bgin Trading, Bgin Trade HK, Bgin Singapore, Bgin SG, Bgin Infrastructure US, and Bgin Management. Bgin, through its subsidiaries, conducts operations in the US, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Primary operations include mining cryptocurrency and selling mining machines equipped with its 8nm or 12nm ASIC chips designed to mine KAS coins, ALPH coins, and RXD coins. As part of its mining operations, Bgin offers a miner hosting service in which Bgin manages mining machines on behalf of customers for a service fee. Since the release of the prospectus, Bgin has grown its mining fleet from 48,277 machines to 72,825 machines as of September 2025 . Accordingly, Bgin primarily mines KAS coins for revenue generation. Kaspa was launched in 2021 through mining rather than an initial coin offering [ICO] and uses the BlockDAG architecture. Kaspa has a maximum supply of 28.7b coins, building in scarcity for the high-throughput coin. Standard CPUs are capable of mining the coins, making them accessible for various miners. The basis for Kaspa is for faster transactions while remaining decentralized. TradingView Bgin is aiming to grow its operations by a significant measure. As of September 2025, Bgin had 47MW of power in use and is targeting 500 MW of capacity within the next two years. As part of its growth strategy, Bgin is aiming to mine large-cap coins like Bitcoin and Dogecoin beginning in 1h26. As part of this, Bgin is expecting to begin developing mining machines for these larger coins in 1h26, potentially to be both utilized for internal mining operations and for sale. Revenue for FY24 was largely concentrated in Hong Kong, China, at 33%, the United States at 23%, and Singapore at 16%. Corporate Filings Bgin Blockchain Limited Financial Position Corporate Filings Bgin faced a significant decline in revenue generation in 1h25 as a result of lower mining machine sales as well as the significant decline in the KAS coin price, falling from $0.1165/coin to $0.0755/coin. Accordingly, US tariff policies on Chinese imports may impact costs for Bgin as well as disrupt its supply chain for chip fabrication and manufacturing, as well as materials sourcing from China. Corporate Filings Modeling Bgin’s financials, I believe the firm may face continued pressure across its external services, which may be particularly sensitive to the coins mined by Bgin’s machines. This may result in challenging mining machine revenue for the coming quarters following the large drop-off in 1H25. At the top-line, I’m forecasting revenue to decline by -62% for eFY25 to $116mm, largely driven by the pressure on cryptocurrencies, particularly in recent months. TradingView Risks Related to Bgin Blockchain Limited Bull Case Bgin focuses on a niche corner of the cryptocurrency market, mining smaller coins that may offer differentiated and less competitive returns regarding Bitcoin mining companies. Bgin has historically realized strong margins through miner sales and may experience a sharp turnaround if sales volumes were to pick back up. Bear Case The cryptocurrency market may be going into another bear market, potentially resulting in a drop-off of interest by retail investors seeking liquidity and safety. This may result in a continued decline in mining machine sales as well as mining pool revenue going forward. The lower price of KAS coin may result in a substantial reduction of mining revenue going forward, offset by higher volumes mined. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Filings BGIN shares are currently trading at 1.53x price/sales, a relatively low premium for high-growth companies. Despite the low trading multiple, I believe shares may face continued pressure as the market Bgin participants are going through declining coin pricing, potentially impacting broader revenue generation for the company going forward. Using my revenue forecast for eFY27, I believe shares should be trading at 2.93/share at 1.52x eFY27 price/sales; I am recommending BGIN shares with a Sell rating.

Nasdaq-listed Onfolio Holdings has successfully raised a staggering $300 million specifically for crypto investments, signaling strong institutional confidence in digital assets. This monumental funding round represents one of the most significant corporate commitments to cryptocurrency this year. Why Are Major Institutions Making Crypto Investments Now? Onfolio’s decision to allocate $300 million toward crypto investments comes at a pivotal moment in digital asset evolution. The company secured these substantial funds through institutional investors and a convertible note facility, demonstrating sophisticated financial engineering. This move follows increasing institutional adoption trends, where traditional finance meets blockchain technology. The strategic crypto investments will focus on three major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC) – The original cryptocurrency and digital gold Ethereum (ETH) – The leading smart contract platform Solana (SOL) – The high-performance blockchain network How Will This Impact Crypto Investment Strategies? Onfolio’s massive crypto investments could create ripple effects throughout the entire digital asset ecosystem. When publicly-traded companies make substantial commitments to cryptocurrency, it often signals to other institutions that the asset class has matured sufficiently for serious consideration. Moreover, this level of crypto investment from a Nasdaq-listed entity adds credibility and legitimacy to the entire sector. The company’s approach to crypto investments appears carefully calculated. By targeting established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum while including emerging leaders like Solana, Onfolio balances stability with growth potential. This diversified strategy in crypto investments mirrors approaches taken by other institutional players entering the space. What Challenges Do Institutional Crypto Investments Face? While the $300 million crypto investment announcement generates excitement, institutional participation brings unique challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern for companies making substantial crypto investments. However, Onfolio’s Nasdaq listing suggests they’ve conducted thorough due diligence and compliance checks before committing to these significant crypto investments. Another consideration involves market volatility. Despite growing institutional interest, cryptocurrency markets can experience sharp price swings. The company’s crypto investments will need sophisticated risk management strategies to navigate these fluctuations successfully. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto Investments? Onfolio’s bold move could inspire similar crypto investments from other publicly-traded companies. As more traditional finance players observe successful crypto investments from peers, the barrier to entry lowers for others considering similar moves. This development in crypto investments might accelerate mainstream adoption and potentially stabilize markets through increased institutional participation. The timing of these crypto investments suggests confidence in the long-term viability of digital assets. Despite recent market corrections, sophisticated players continue making substantial crypto investments, indicating they see value beyond short-term price movements. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investments Onfolio’s $300 million commitment to crypto investments marks a significant milestone in digital asset maturation. This move demonstrates that serious institutional capital continues flowing into cryptocurrency, validating the asset class for conservative investors. As more companies follow suit with their own crypto investments, we may witness accelerated innovation and stability in blockchain markets. Frequently Asked Questions What is Onfolio Holdings? Onfolio Holdings is a Nasdaq-listed company that acquires and operates online businesses, now expanding into cryptocurrency investments. How did Onfolio raise $300 million? The company secured funds through institutional investors and a convertible note facility, which is a type of debt that can convert to equity. Which cryptocurrencies will Onfolio invest in? Onfolio plans direct investments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Why is this significant for crypto markets? This represents substantial institutional validation and could encourage other public companies to make similar crypto investments. When will these investments happen? The company hasn’t specified a timeline but typically executes such strategies promptly after funding completion. Could this affect cryptocurrency prices? Large institutional crypto investments can influence market sentiment and potentially impact prices through increased demand. Found this insight into institutional crypto investments valuable?

54572408,629920,1763476179,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54572408.jpeg,"Kazakhstan Expands Crypto Mining Framework, Setting Up $PEPENODE",https://bitcoinist.com/kazakhstan-expands-crypto-mining-framework-setting-up-pepenode/,"Quick Facts: 1️⃣ Kazakhstan is clarifying its crypto rules, creating a friendlier environment for regulated mining and digital-asset activity. 2️⃣Crypto assets can now circulate across Kazakhstan, no longer restricted to the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC). 3️⃣ PEPENODE introduces a hardware-free mine-to-earn structure that lets users access mining-style rewards through virtual nodes instead of rigs, making the experience accessible to retail users priced out of traditional mining The regulatory environment in the Central Asian crypto mining hub, Kazakhstan, is shifting from a grey area to an increasingly structured one. Recent reforms give clearer legal footing for digital-asset mining, exchange activity, and tokens. A recent amendments bill vastly expands the range of options for crypto miners and users within the country. Essentially, Kazakhstan is giving a green light to crypto mining and moving the crypto industry a bit more into the limelight. The new law: Expands circulation Allows mining by both individuals and entities Permits mined crypto to be traded on more exchanges Kazakhstan’s move also sends a signal to the rest of the world. As jurisdictions like Kazakhstan upgrade their frameworks, projects that lean on real-world utility or scalable models (rather than pure hype) may benefit. Against that backdrop enters PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a meme-coin presale combining gamified ‘mining’ mechanics with virtual nodes, built on the premise of lowering entry-barriers for everyday miners. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Meme-Coin Momentum with Innovative Mine-to-Earn Mechanism PepeNode proposes a novel ‘mine-to-earn’ structure: rather than acquiring expensive rigs or relying on intense energy consumption, users purchase virtual mining nodes inside a gamified dashboard. The node upgrades, leaderboard mechanics, and reward system aim to replicate mining engagement minus the hardware burden. In addition to generating earnings in $PEPENODE itself, the mine-to-earn play includes rewards in market-leading meme coins, such as $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. Presale highlights include: $0.0011546 token price $2.1M presale raise 596% staking rewards during the presale 210B token supply With low-barrier access to a mining-style experience, a catchy meme narrative, and early-stage entry with presale pricing, PEPENODE brings all the benefits of mining to the meme coin sector, but without the real-world costs of intensive equipment. Kazakhstan, PEPENODE Usher in New Mining Era Mining barriers, including cost, hardware, and electricity, have pushed many retail users out of traditional crypto mining. That forces them to new frontiers, like Kazakhstan, or to innovative models where participation can be virtualised or abstracted. That’s precisely where $PEPENODE comes in. In the meantime, there’s another trend emerging. Meme coins have matured beyond pure jokes. Projects integrating game-mechanics, community engagement, and reward loops are earning more serious attention. That trend supports our PEPENODE price prediction , which shows $PEPENODE climbing from its current price to $0.0072 by the end of 2026. That represents 523% gains if you bought at today’s $0.0011546 token price. Our prediction highlights the potential for the project to fit in perfectly with growing regulatory clarity (as in Kazakhstan). The trend signals that some jurisdictions are moving from the ‘wild west’ to more structured regimes. That creates both headwinds, with more oversight, and opportunities; legitimate mining and regulated frameworks. For participants, that means paying attention not just to token mechanics but to jurisdiction, compliance, and roadmap fulfilment. Any positive regulatory narrative tends to bolster confidence. Kazakhstan’s evolving crypto laws and mining-friendly yet regulated posture provide a contextual tailwind for mining-adjacent concepts. Within an increasingly pro-mining context, don’t miss $PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn opportunity.

54572520,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=220362,1763476215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary: Stack Overflow’s Bold Transformation into Premier AI Training Data Provider,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stack-overflow-ai-data-provider/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary: Stack Overflow’s Bold Transformation into Premier AI Training Data Provider In a groundbreaking move that could reshape how AI systems learn from human expertise, Stack Overflow is undergoing a dramatic transformation from coding Q&A platform to essential AI training data provider. This strategic pivot positions the company at the heart of the enterprise AI stack, leveraging its vast repository of programming knowledge to fuel the next generation of artificial intelligence. Stack Overflow AI Enterprise Evolution During Microsoft’s Ignite conference, Stack Overflow unveiled a suite of new products designed specifically for enterprise AI applications. The company’s CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar revealed that this direction was inspired by observing how enterprise customers were already using Stack Overflow’s API for AI training purposes. The core product, Stack Overflow Internal, represents an enterprise-grade version of the familiar forum, but with enhanced security controls and administrative features tailored for corporate environments. Enterprise AI Stack Integration The new tools are engineered to seamlessly integrate with internal AI agents using the model context protocol. What makes this particularly innovative is Stack Overflow’s development of specialized variations specifically designed for their platform. This approach allows enterprises to incorporate verified programming knowledge directly into their AI systems, creating more reliable and accurate AI assistants for development teams. Feature Benefit Enterprise Impact Reliability Scoring AI agents understand answer trustworthiness Reduced errors in code generation Knowledge Graph Connects programming concepts dynamically Faster problem resolution Custom Tagging Enterprise-specific categorization Better organizational knowledge capture AI Training Data Goldmine Stack Overflow has secured content deals with multiple AI labs, allowing them to train models on public Stack Overflow data in exchange for substantial fees. While specific figures remain confidential, Chandrasekar compared these arrangements to “the Reddit deals,” which reportedly generated over $200 million for that platform. This represents a significant revenue stream diversification for Stack Overflow beyond traditional advertising and subscription models. Advanced AI Agents Capabilities The most exciting development comes from CTO Jody Bailey’s vision for read-write functionality. Future AI agents will be able to create their own Stack Overflow queries when they encounter knowledge gaps or cannot answer questions. This represents a fundamental shift from passive knowledge consumption to active knowledge seeking by AI systems. Dynamic query generation by AI agents Automatic knowledge gap identification Reduced developer effort in knowledge capture Continuous organizational learning Model Context Protocol Implementation A critical innovation in Stack Overflow’s approach is the metadata layer exported alongside traditional question-answer pairs. This includes: Answer authorship and timing data Content categorization tags Internal coherence assessments Automated reliability scoring This metadata enables AI systems to make informed decisions about answer trustworthiness, significantly improving the quality of generated responses and reducing the risk of propagating incorrect information. What Does This Mean for Enterprise AI? While Stack Overflow is building the tools rather than the AI agents themselves, the implications are profound. Enterprises can now leverage decades of collective programming wisdom through their internal AI systems. The reliability scoring system means AI agents can prioritize verified solutions over experimental or outdated approaches, potentially saving companies millions in development time and error resolution. The transformation of Stack Overflow from community forum to AI data provider represents a strategic masterstroke in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. By monetizing their vast knowledge repository while maintaining quality through sophisticated reliability scoring, Stack Overflow has positioned itself as an essential component in the enterprise AI infrastructure. As AI systems become increasingly integral to software development, access to high-quality, verified programming knowledge may become the competitive differentiator that separates successful AI implementations from failed experiments. Frequently Asked Questions What is Stack Overflow’s new business model? Stack Overflow is transitioning from a public Q&A platform to an enterprise AI data provider, offering verified programming knowledge and reliability scoring for AI training. How does the reliability scoring work? The system analyzes metadata including answer authorship, timing, content tags, and internal coherence to generate trust scores that help AI agents prioritize accurate information. What are the financial implications of this shift? While specific figures aren’t disclosed, CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar compares the deals to Reddit’s $200M+ AI data licensing agreements. How does this integrate with existing enterprise systems? The tools use the model context protocol and can work with various AI systems, with CTO Jody Bailey emphasizing flexibility for different enterprise environments. What role does Microsoft play in this transformation? The announcement was made at Microsoft ‘s Ignite conference, indicating strategic partnership potential in the enterprise AI space.

On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-on-chain-risk-extreme-value-zone/,"Dogecoin is sitting at an inflection point where weakening market structure meets unusually compressed on-chain risk, according to new charts shared by analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica). The visuals juxtapose a multi-year DOGE/USDT price channel with Alphafractal’s Reserve Risk framework, raising the question of whether the move is a true breakdown or the formation of a long-term bottom. Dogecoin On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone In an X post, Cryptollica explains that the Dogecoin model “combines Reserve Risk with VOCDD/MVOCDD-style activity measures to assess long-term holder conviction versus market pricing.” The key metric is Reserve Risk itself, defined as: “Reserve Risk = Price / HODL Bank.” “HODL Bank” represents the cumulative opportunity cost long-term holders accepted by not selling in earlier rallies. When the current price is low relative to that bank of conviction, Reserve Risk prints low values; when price is high versus that bank, it spikes. Crucially, Cryptollica notes that “low readings historically align with attractive risk/reward (value zones), while high readings mark overheated conditions.” On the Alphafractal chart, this is rendered as a green lower band (value) and a red upper band (overheated). Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst Dogecoin’s past blow-off phases, including the 2021 surge toward roughly $0.76, coincided with Reserve Risk moving into the red zone. By contrast, long consolidation periods following major unwinds saw the indicator fall back into the green band. The latest data point, dated 17 November 2025, shows Reserve Risk again compressed in that lower green area, indicating that, relative to the accumulated HODL Bank, spot prices are historically cheap by this model’s standards. The chart does not predict direction, but it places current conditions firmly in what the framework defines as an “extreme value” environment. DOGE Faces Crash Towards $0.07 The second chart, a three-day DOGE/USDT view from Binance, focuses on price structure. Dogecoin trades within a broad ascending channel that has contained action since 2021. The lower boundary, labeled “Bottom Line,” currently tracks just above the $0.07 area; the upper “TopLine” extends toward about $1.30, with a central “Midline” near the $0.27 region acting repeatedly as resistance. A two-year moving average arcs through the middle of this channel. DOGE lost this average in the bear phase, reclaimed it into 2024–2025 and then rallied to a local high around $0.48, before being rejected at the Midline. A cluster of red arrows at roughly $0.27 marks multiple failed attempts to break higher. Related Reading: How Did The Dogecoin Price React To Elon Musk’s Latest Dog Post? Since then, price has rolled over, slipped back below the two-year MA and is now descending inside the channel. The latest three-day candle shows DOGE trading around $0.15, with an intraperiod spike lower that was partially bought back. DOGE is now trading at a last line of defence: the mid-line of the lower part of the channel around $0.15. If this support breaks, a steep drop towards the “Bottom Line” just above $0.07 could loom. Together, both charts frame Dogecoin’s position sharply. Structurally, DOGE is weakening below its long-term moving average and mid-channel resistance, leaving the lower boundary of the channel as the next major geometric reference. On-chain, however, the Reserve Risk and activity composite indicates that long-term holders’ cumulative conviction now stands against one of the lowest relative price levels seen since the previous cycle. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.157.

The deal still requires Federal Reserve Board approval, with closing targeted by year’s end, subject to remaining conditions. Regulatory Path and Deal Terms LevelField’s plan follows an earlier attempt to combine in early 2023 that was withdrawn after the Silvergate and Signature failures. The firm refiled in December 2024. The report said that LevelField agreed to pay up to $70 million, citing the company’s application to the Federal Reserve. Illinois has cleared the state-level hurdle. The proposed transaction now moves to the Federal Reserve for review. LevelField intends to maintain Burling’s community banking operations while adding digital asset capabilities within a state-regulated, full-service bank. The parties expect to close after all necessary approvals and standard conditions have been satisfied. Both organizations currently employ about 20 people each. If the deal closes, LevelField plans to hire roughly 100 additional staff in the first year. Chief Executive Officer Gene Grant II described the company’s approach to entering regulated banking through an acquisition rather than a narrow-purpose charter. “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” said Grant. https://t.co/YI2fqEqimy More detail on the LevelField Bank approval in our press release.

""First Seen Since November 2024, Data Warns!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-analysis-from-glassnode-first-seen-since-november-2024-data-warns/,"Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a major decline yesterday, falling below $90,000 for the first time in seven months. Altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum (ETH) also falling below $3,000 for the first time in a long time. In addition, XRP was undoubtedly one of the altcoins that experienced a significant decline in the recent decline. While XRP fell to $2.1, Glassnode shared interesting data about XRP. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode said in its latest analysis that over 41% of XRP holders are currently at a loss. According to Glassnode, XRP holders' share of profits dropped to 58.5%, leaving 41.5% in a loss position. This marks the lowest profitability level since November 2024, when XRP was trading at $0.53. According to the data, 26.5 billion XRP, equivalent to 41.5% of the total supply, was found to be in short supply. This suggests the market is “top-heavy,” with investors mostly buying at higher prices. The proportion of XRP supply in profit zones has fallen to 58.5%. This is the lowest level since last November. The current XRP price of $2.15 is nearly four times higher than last November ($0.53), yet still leaves 41.5% of the total supply at a loss. This means the market is dominated by late-entry investors.” Consequently, such a high level of outflows means that late investors who bought at higher price levels are under pressure. This structure could potentially put downward pressure on the price. Because many investors bought near the peak, if prices fall further, these investors may panic sell, increasing downward pressure. Glassnode therefore concludes that the current structure is structurally fragile. At this point, Glassnode notes that despite the current price of around $2.15, data points to an unstable market structure dominated by investors buying at higher prices. *This is not investment advice.

Ma cerchiamo di comprendere al meglio la situazione. Tanto per cominciare il termine mNAV sta per “ Multiple of Net Asset Value ”, ed è un rapporto che confronta il valore dell’azienda sul mercato con il valore delle criptovalute che possiede. Quando un’azienda ha un mNAV maggiore di uno significa sostanzialmente che questa vale più delle sue riserve in crypto, e che gli investitori vedono un modello di business sostenibile e promettente. Le Aziende con Tesoreria in Ethereum Sono in Difficoltà In un nuovo thread su X , Charles Edwards, fondatore di Capriole Investments, ha discusso alcune metriche relative alle aziende che detengono Ethereum in tesoreria. Una “treasury firm” è una società quotata che ha adottato un asset digitale come Bitcoin o Ethereum come strategia di riserva. L’idea è stata resa popolare dalla strategia di Michael Saylor (ex MicroStrategy) , che nel 2020 ha scelto di diventare una società con riserva in BTC. Da allora, è cresciuta fino a diventare di gran lunga il più grande detentore aziendale di asset digitali, con un investimento enorme di 47,54 miliardi di dollari . In passato, le aziende vedevano solo Bitcoin come un asset di riserva praticabile, ma quest’anno si è registrato un aumento dei detentori di ETH, la criptovaluta al secondo posto per capitalizzazione. La “frenesia” delle aziende verso Ethereum ha raggiunto il picco in agosto, ma da allora il ritmo di crescita ha mostrato un rallentamento, come evidenziato dal grafico condiviso da Edwards. Acquisti Istituzionali di Ethereum Dal grafico è chiaro che il tasso di variazione delle tesorerie ETH resta positivo nonostante il rallentamento, suggerendo che le aziende continuano ad accumulare. Ciò significa che, nonostante i recenti deflussi dagli ETF spot , gli acquisti istituzionali restano superiori – anche se di poco – alla crescita dell’offerta della criptovaluta. Il Modello di Business delle Tesorerie ETH Non Sta Funzionando per Molte Aziende Come sottolinea l’analista, la maggior parte delle aziende ha un valore mNAV inferiore a 1 . Come abbiamo già spiegato, il mNAV è una metrica che confronta la capitalizzazione di mercato di un’azienda con il valore totale dei suoi asset di riserva.Un valore inferiore a 1 implica che la valutazione della società è inferiore al valore delle sue riserve. Attualmente, circa il 64,3% delle aziende con tesoreria in Ethereum si trova in questa condizione , ergo il mercato non crede molto nella sostenibilità di queste società. Una sostenibilità resa sempre più precaria in una condizione di difficoltà di ETH. Edwards spiega: “Ciò significa che il quadro delle aziende con tesoreria in ETH è molto più debole rispetto a quello di Bitcoin.” Chiaramente, le tesorerie ETH stanno affrontando pressioni. Ma qualcuna sta vendendo?I dati suggeriscono che la maggior parte non lo sta facendo , poiché il rapporto netto acquisti/vendite rimane solido. Sebbene quasi tutti i detentori corporate di Ethereum siano ancora acquirenti netti, il rapporto buy/sell ha iniziato a scendere mentre il prezzo dell’asset sta vivendo un periodo ribassista. Attualmente ETH è scambiato per circa 3.000 dollari, in un mese ha perso circa il 21% del proprio valore.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-18 14:50:04
54573117,629932,1763477464,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54573117.jpeg,Dogecoin vs Bitcoin: A New Meme Coin Juggernaut Enters the Arena,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-vs-bitcoin-maxi-doge-presale-challenger/,"Quick Facts: The Dogecoin vs Bitcoin debate underscores a clash between long-term stability and high-risk, community-led speculation. Retail traders continue to hunt for low-cap tokens capable of delivering explosive growth reminiscent of Dogecoin’s early cycles. Stealing the spotlight from both $BTC and $DOGE, Maxi Doge introduces a utility-backed model built on competitive trading events and collective rewards. The long-running Dogecoin vs Bitcoin conversation has always split the crypto world into two distinct camps. For years, investors have weighed the differences between these philosophies, comparing Bitcoin’s slow-and-steady resilience with Dogecoin’s capacity for dramatic upside. Bitcoin sits atop the market as digital gold: scarce, secure, and designed for long-term value preservation. Dogecoin , created as a joke, evolved into a symbol of internet culture, fueled by community enthusiasm and viral momentum. This rivalry reflects a deeper tension within the market. Bitcoin offers stability, but its price point feels out of reach for smaller traders looking for monumental gains. Dogecoin once filled that void, as its early cycles delivered extraordinary returns. But its current size makes massive surges increasingly difficult. Recently, Bitcoin just gave the market a scary signal, a ‘Death Cross’ (where the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day one). This hasn’t happened since 2021, and historically, it puts some serious pressure on the whole crypto space. Dogecoin ($DOGE) saw a quick spike to $0.162, but then late-session selling basically wiped out those gains. The big takeaway? $DOGE is still super sensitive to whatever Bitcoin is doing. Traders are constantly scanning the horizon for the next crypto to explode : something culturally strong and priced low enough to deliver those once-in-a-cycle gains. That search has brought attention to new entrants that blend the excitement of early meme coins with modern utility. One of the most talked-about contenders, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , is shaping its identity around a “1000x leverage” mindset, pulling from high-adrenaline trading culture and layering it with community rewards. It marks a shift in the meme coin landscape, moving away from simple jokes and toward fully built ecosystems designed for ambitious participants. Maxi Doge Forges a New High-Leverage Trading Culture Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Doge’s bulky cousin, meant to represent the strength needed to thrive in a volatile market. His mantra, ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump,’ speaks to traders who see the market as a place to sharpen both financial instincts and discipline. Retail traders often struggle to match the confidence and capital of whales; Maxi Doge addresses that gap by cultivating a collective identity, backed by competitions and incentives that reward conviction. Maxi Doge also intentionally leans into the high-risk, high-reward mentality that defines leverage trading. Its ‘Leverage King Culture’ serves as the backbone of its brand, as a framework through which the entire project operates. The core philosophy of lift, trade, repeat mirrors the discipline required in fitness and in trading, creating a thematic bridge between the two worlds. In other words, the project brilliantly turns individual ambition into a coordinated movement, which makes it one of the best meme coins to buy now . This approach is clearly striking a chord. Maxi Doge’s presale has already surpassed $4 million, indicating strong early belief in its mission. Visit the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale for a closer look at the project . Could $MAXI be the Next Meme Coin to Explode? This fusion of meme-driven branding and engagement tools positions Maxi Doge as a fresh force in the Dogecoin vs Bitcoin conversation. It maintains the fun and virality of a meme coin while adding structure, incentives, and community tools. As part of boosting engagement, Maxi Doge will organize holder-exclusive trading competitions with real rewards, complete with leaderboards that encourage participation and growth. Another major component is the staking program. Holders can lock up $MAXI to earn attractive passive income, currently at 76% APY. And at the center of Maxi Doge’s sustainable meme coin model is the Maxi Fund – a treasury dedicated to maintaining liquidity, supporting partnerships, and fueling marketing campaigns. Together, these features present a compelling alternative for traders navigating the Dogecoin vs Bitcoin divide. So it wouldn’t be surprising to see $MAXI explode, as explained in our price forecasts for 2025, 2026, and 2030 . Built on the Ethereum network, Maxi Doge uses an ERC-20 smart contract for supply management and reward distribution. For detailed presale instructions, read our ‘How to Buy Maxi Doge’ guide . Since $MAXI has successfully passed smart contract audits by Coinsult and Solidproof , it significantly reduces the typical early-stage risks of code exploits or scam-related vulnerabilities. Join the $MAXI presale today for $0.0002685. But hurry, as a price increase is looming. This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The funds, which had been sitting dormant for nearly five years, vanished almost instantly during the massive swap. The incident raises alarm regarding the risks involved in using Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and the importance of understanding liquidity and slippage before executing large trades. Cardano Holder Loses Over $6 Million ADA In Minutes A new report from a famous on-chain sleuth , ZachXBT, revealed a jaw-dropping loss for a Cardano investor. The user had swapped 14.4 million ADA, valued at approximately $6.9 million, for 847,000 USDA, a stablecoin pegged to ADA . The transaction occurred just two hours before the report became public, revealing that the investor had lost approximately $6.05 million, wiping out more than 80% of his initial investment. ZachXBT has said that the dramatic loss was likely due to extremely thin liquidity in the trading pool, which caused the price of ADA to spike temporarily during the swap. Vladimir S., a threat researcher who shared ZachXBT’s findings on X from his Telegram group, speculated that the Decentralized Exchange interface where the transaction occurred probably did not provide clear, low-liquidity warnings for a swap of that magnitude. Vladimir suggested that an Over-The-Counter (OTC) deal would have been a much safer alternative for a $6.9 million ADA swap. Notably, this case highlights how even long-term crypto holders can suffer major losses when they do not fully understand how DEXs work. Community Weighs In On Liquidity Issues And Slippage Warnings ZachXBT’s report sparked extensive discussions among crypto traders and analysts, who pointed out that the $6.9 million ADA swap carried a staggering high price impact of 87.433%. Many in the community noted that the transaction was executed on the Minswap DEX , where users are required to actively acknowledge and consent to high slippage warnings to confirm trades. Some members argued that the $6.05 million loss could have been avoided if the user paid attention to the interface and the obvious warnings displayed for transactions exceeding typical slippage thresholds. Responding to Vladimir’s speculation about a lack of clear liquidity warnings, other community members confirmed that Minswap always provides visible alerts for low liquidity swaps. Large slippage percentages, typically above 3-5%, are displayed in bright red texts, making it almost impossible for traders to miss. Some observers suggested that the Cardano holder may have misunderstood the interface, possibly due to language barriers or a lack of familiarity with decentralized finance mechanisms. Regardless of the reasons, this incident serves as a clear reminder for crypto users to pay attention to liquidity and slippage alerts when executing high-value swaps.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Decentralized Exchanges|DEXs|Minswap DEX|OTC|Over-the-counter|stablecoin|Vladimir S.|ZachXBT,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 02:00:26
54587469,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=854996,1763517633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54587469.jpeg,"XRP, Bitcoin Now In “Good Buy Zone,” Says Analytics Firm",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-bitcoin-good-buy-zone-says-analytics-firm/,"On-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed how Bitcoin, XRP, and other cryptocurrencies have dropped into a “buy zone” on a popular metric. MVRV Ratio Shows High Degree Of Short-Term Pain In Bitcoin & Altcoins In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed how the various assets in the cryptocurrency sector are looking based on the 30-day MVRV Ratio. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is an on-chain indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap and Realized Cap for a given coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin SSR Flashes Buy Signal: Rebound Incoming? The Realized Cap here refers to a capitalization model that calculates the asset’s total value by assuming the value of each individual token is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In short, what this model captures is an estimation for the amount of capital that BTC investors as a whole have invested into the cryptocurrency. The usual market cap, on the other hand, represents the amount holders are carrying today. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the Realized Cap. In other words, the overall network is in a state of profit. On the other hand, an indicator below this threshold implies the dominance of losses among investors. In the context of the current topic, the version of the MVRV Ratio that’s of interest is the 30-day one, tracking the profit-loss balance of the traders who purchased their coins within the past month. Below is the chart for the metric shared by Santiment that shows the trend in its value for five major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, Chainlink, and Cardano: As is visible in the graph, the 30-day MVRV Ratio has witnessed a plunge recently as the sector has gone through a bearish shift. Recent Bitcoin buyers are now about 11.5% underwater, while XRP ones are around 10.2%. Both of these are beyond the threshold that the analytics firm classifies as the boundary for a “good buy zone.” The 30-day investors have suffered even worse losses in the case of Ethereum, Cardano, and Chainlink, being down 15.4%, 19.7%, and 16.8%, respectively. All of these fall inside Santiment’s “extreme buy zone.” “In a zero sum game, buy assets when average trade returns of your peers are in extreme negatives,” noted the analytics firm. “The lower MVRV’s go, the higher the probability is of a rapid recovery.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Dominance Hits 4-Month High: What It Means It now remains to be seen whether market pain has been enough for XRP and others to cause a market rebound, or if more drawdown is coming. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.18, down more than 11% over the last week.

AI developers have made it clear that they intend to significantly invest in the industry as more individuals begin to use their products. A Portfolio Manager and Client Solutions Investment Director at Fidelity International, Joseph Zhang, expressed his belief that the recent decline experienced in global semiconductor stocks is likely a short-term change. He also predicted that a bounce back will occur unless the use or spending on AI decreases. “The party is still just getting started,” said Zhang, adding that, “It would be a mistake to leave the party too soon.” Notably, reports from sources indicated that the Portfolio Manager was responsible for managing more than $10 billion in assets at Fidelity. Investors raise questions regarding the excitement around AI Analysts conducted research and discovered that market fears concerning a bubble have prompted some investors, such as Japanese multinational conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp., and Peter Thiel, who initially drew attention for his innovations in banking and financing startups, to withdraw their investments. However, the perspective shared by fund managers at Fidelity International and Allianz Global Investors highlights that optimistic investors remain composed, especially with substantial investments like Jeff Bezos’ new AI initiative. Supporters backed this claim, noting that they believe this growth represents a rare tech revolution, making it difficult to dismiss as just another passing trend. Hartwig Kos, head of growth multi-asset at Allianz Global Investors, also weighed in on the topic of discussion. Kos stated that few people really grasp the capabilities of AI at this point. Therefore, according to him, it is too early to conclude that it is a bubble. Fidelity’s Zhang, on the other hand, asserted that there are no clear indications of a real slowdown in AI, such as reduced usage, lowered capital spending, or a technological breakthrough that could lessen the demand for chips and data centers. He further pointed out that yields from AI firms and prices of memory chips continue to escalate. “We feel quite optimistic about the overall technology and AI trends in the medium term,” the director at Fidelity added. Meanwhile, after six months of increases, reports stated investors in the US enjoyed some profit gains from semiconductor stocks in November. This news followed the 9.4% drop in the US chip index this month. The index was on track for its poor performance since March, while that of a Bloomberg index tracking Asian counterparts decreased by about 7.3%. This situation prompted investors to raise questions about whether the excitement surrounding AI is waning. To address these concerns, Mark Boulton, lead portfolio manager at Pictet Asset Management, advised investors to adjust their expectations for AI, as they might become overly enthusiastic about the technology, leading to disappointment. Analysts noted that even before SoftBank and Thiel intervened in the situation, signs resembling those from the dot-com crash began to appear. According to them, to stay positive about AI, one will need to ignore such warning signs. Nvidia’s earnings report ignites debate among individuals The so-called “Magnificent Seven” — a group of major US tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., and Apple Inc. — represent a large portion of the S&P 500’s growth. Earlier this month, Nvidia was valued higher than the total stock markets of Italy, Spain, the UAE, and the Netherlands combined. Sources have observed that investing in this sector in Asia may require even greater trust in the technology to handle the region’s specific challenges, which include trade issues and China’s unstable economy. According to Zhang, part of the recent selling is due to hedging actions taken before Nvidia’s earnings report. Investors may have purchased put options for the security, which could be impacting the market, he explained. The director at Fidelity also predicted that if Nvidia’s results are strong, investors will exit their hedges, and the market is likely to bounce back. Currently, the global leader in AI trades at 29 times its earnings expected over the next year. However, Zhang thinks its valuation seems fair considering its strong growth. Additionally, its main Asian suppliers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., appear to be even more affordable. “As long as these core factors remain unchanged, corrections driven by liquidity often present buying opportunities,” he stated.

HTX DAO systematically broke free from traditional DAO limitations and completed the initial construction of a “Financial Free Port.” Both accelerating deflation and maturing on-chain governance profoundly validate its long-term value strategy of “sustainability and verifiability.” HTX DAO demonstrates to the global community a vibrant, user-centric, and mechanism-driven DAO ecosystem. A Breakthrough in Both Value and Scale In 2025, HTX DAO’s breakthrough performance across key metrics showed strong resilience and powerful community cohesion. These results also reflect the positive market reception of the Financial Free Port strategy: ● Market Cap & Global Presence : $HTX reached a total market capitalization of $1.841 billion and was listed on 28 cryptocurrency exchanges, solidifying its place among global mainstream assets. ● Surging Subscriptions : $HTX earning products reached more than $9 billion in total subscriptions, an annual increase of more than 90%, with nearly 500,000 participants. This reflects soaring confidence in long-term $HTX returns. ● User Rewards : Total user reward payouts exceeded $30 million, up 30% YoY, delivering real, sustainable value to holders and maturing community co-prosperity. ● Holder Base Expansion : Global $HTX holders reached 849,900, up 16.6%, demonstrating rising community basis and expanding ecosystem coverage. ● Accelerating Deflation : Across Q1-Q3 2025, HTX DAO burned 36.22 trillion $HTX, accounting for 42.2% of total burns. The continuous burns further drive scarcity and strengthen long-term appreciation. HTX DAO not only expanded its market footprint, but also achieved a qualitative leap in asset retention and user value distribution. Growth is no longer driven by user base alone, but by real returns and mechanisms that lock in high-quality capital, advancing steadily toward the vision of building a financial free port. Institutionalized Deflation: Embedding Scarcity Into Governance This year, HTX DAO resolutely carried out its burn plan. In any crypto economy, token burning is not merely a technical action, but an economic signal. HTX DAO’s burn data has become a concrete expression of community consensus. By Q3 2025, HTX DAO had cumulatively burned 85.88 trillion $HTX, worth approximately $163 million. The most recent burn alone exceeded 13.12 trillion tokens, marking one of the largest burn events in DAO history. Deflation efficiency has been rapidly accelerating: from 0.78% in Q2 2024 to 1.39% in Q3 2025, with an average growth rate of 33%. $HTX supply contraction has now entered a phase of stable acceleration. Unlike traditional projects where deflation depends on team discretion, HTX DAO embedded deflation into its governance structure, transforming burn from a passive decision into a form of long-term autonomous consensus. In July, HTX DAO upgraded its whitepaper, shifting the economic model from a liquidity pledge mechanism to a burn-based model. This evolution elevates deflation from a monetary adjustment tool into a structural value filter at the governance level. For HTX DAO, token burning is no longer a one-time or uncertain event, but a sustainable process, representing a rare model of financial autonomy in Web3 where value consistently flows back to the community. First Realization of the “People’s Exchange”: From Voting Rights to Economic Sovereignty 2025 was the year HTX DAO governance truly went into effect. On June 30, the DAO’s on-chain token listing system officially launched, marking a pivotal transition from community discussion to on-chain execution. Its significance is comparable to a Bretton Woods-level moment for DAO governance. The community not only gained voting rights, but also the right to determine resource allocation. Specifically, community votes now directly determine the listing of trading pairs and the allocation of liquidity incentives. This completes the structural shift of economic sovereignty from centralization to token holders. Since the launch, over 1.1916 trillion $HTX have been cast in on-chain votes, valued at more than $3 million, leading to six tokens being successfully recommended and listed on HTX Exchange. This governance activity had a measurable market impact, where $HTX price surged 44.3% at its monthly peak, over 12,000 new holding addresses were added, and TVL increased by $42 million. These achievements represent the first wave of positive feedback after the People’s Exchange mechanism went live. The breakthrough lies in the fact that HTX DAO has, for the first time, truly returned the listing decision power to the community, supporting the $HTX value. By leveraging community consensus to identify trending project tokens, HTX DAO enhances the market depth and fee income of the HTX exchange. 50% of this revenue is then used to repurchase and burn $HTX, thereby creating continuous deflation and sustained value support. This cycle of “voting, listing, trading, circulation, burning/redistribution” creates a decentralized paradigm where DAO governance directly maps to market efficiency, giving real economic meaning to the vision of the People’s Exchange. HTX DAO is now implementing its Listing Governance 2.0 initiative, which integrates on-chain voting directly with HTX’s voting system to maximize participant inclusion. More incentives, such as “voting subsidies,” are under exploration to attract wider governance participation. HTX DAO’s Second Evolution: Building a Coherent On-Chain Financial System In 2025, HTX DAO began transforming from a decentralized autonomous organization into a fully-fledged, self-sustaining, and extensible on-chain financial infrastructure. The updated whitepaper clarifies $HTX’s evolution in the three directions: governance credential, yield credential, and burning mechanism. This not only marks a systematic upgrade to the HTX DAO’s economic model but also signifies its pivot toward anchoring long-term value in real-world use cases and on-chain strategic returns. $HTX has evolved from just a governance token to a financial hub asset that unites trading, incentives, governance, and cross-chain integration. Key modules include: ● Staking: Establishes value anchoring with quantifiable governance rewards. ● Voting: Aligns decision-making power with dynamic incentives. ● Points System: Maps user behavior into measurable contribution value. ● Treasury: Handles fund inflows, allocation, and regeneration, giving HTX DAO long-term financial sustainability. Importantly, HTX DAO is expanding beyond internal governance and has launched a builder ecosystem. In September, the DAO initiated a global developer program to support builders with resources, applications, and governance access. This program focuses on integrating CeFi and DeFi and promoting the interoperability of decentralized exchanges and on-chain applications. Through these efforts, HTX DAO is turning on-chain governance into an economic infrastructure, injecting sustainable autonomy and growth momentum into the $HTX ecosystem. Anchoring Global Hubs: HTX DAO’s Web3 World Tour HTX DAO’s vision is not limited to the blockchain but also resonates in the physical world. In 2025, HTX DAO appeared across the world’s most influential Web3 stages, bringing decentralization from code to culture. From the Hong Kong Web3 Conference and HTX DAO x TRON Hong Kong Night, to the Blockchain Forum in CIS, to the HTX DAO Dubai Night and Istanbul Blockchain Week, and further to the Bitcoin 2025 and TOKEN2049 Singapore Afterparty, HTX DAO attended nearly every critical Web3 conference this year. On these global stages, HTX DAO demonstrated its ability to create a self-sustaining loop across governance, assets, and ecosystem collaboration, attracting builders worldwide into an open, user-driven financial system. This organic, bottom-up model is positioning HTX DAO as a global movement for decentralization. The world is watching as a truly user-driven financial and governance ecosystem takes shape on the blockchain. Toward a Sustainable Cycle of Autonomy and Growth Information released by HTX DAO outlines its next phase, a roadmap centered on continuous evolution. 1. Listing Governance as New Normal HTX DAO will continue optimizing its voting system to establish a consistent listing routine where outcomes directly shape HTX Exchange’s listing strategy and resource allocation. This will achieve a dynamic, collaborative model where the “community truly leads the market.” 2. Expanded DeFi Integration With staking and governance already in place, HTX DAO will expand $HTX’s utility across DeFi by rolling out on-chain Earn, staking yield aggregators, and other modules that form a visible, user-driven growth cycle. 3. Building Developer Ecosystem The DAO is preparing HTX Builder Grants and a global hackathon program to support builders, focusing on governance and data tools, liquidity/market-making infrastructure, risk management and trading analysis systems, mobile wallets, AI-driven trading, and DeFi solutions. Through funding, joint promotion, and ecosystem incubation, HTX DAO aims to enable more builders to directly participate in the co-construction of on-chain infrastructure and governance mechanisms. 4. CeFi and DeFi Integration Leveraging the HTX exchange as the entry point, the DAO will build seamless interoperability, where accounts become governance identities, assets become credentials, and all economic flows are on-chain verifiable. HTX DAO aims to merge CeFi’s security and liquidity with DeFi’s openness and transparency into a unified financial super gateway. It is not just refining an autonomous system, but building a free financial port where users share governance, value, and trust. In an era where trust is rewritten by algorithms and power shifts through voting rights, HTX DAO demonstrates a profound truth that autonomy is not the breakdown of order but the rebirth of order. From exchange infrastructure to financial architecture, HTX DAO is moving toward a future where everyone can participate, verify, and benefit. It is the future that may well represent Web3’s final destination.

A massive crypto fraud scheme in South Korea has exposed the dark side of digital investments, leaving hundreds of victims facing devastating financial losses. Police in Busan have uncovered one of the largest investment scams in recent history, revealing critical lessons for all cryptocurrency investors. What Made This Crypto Fraud Scheme So Effective? The perpetrators behind this sophisticated crypto fraud scheme used clever psychological tactics to lure investors. They promised guaranteed principal protection and unusually high returns, creating an illusion of safety while targeting vulnerable investors. This approach made their crypto fraud scheme particularly dangerous because it appealed to both cautious and ambitious investors simultaneously. Between October 2023 and April 2025, the group managed to convince 284 people to invest in their fraudulent scheme. The scale of this crypto fraud scheme reached an astonishing 24.5 billion won, equivalent to approximately $17.8 million. The operation demonstrates how organized criminal groups are evolving their methods to exploit the growing cryptocurrency market. How Did Authorities Uncover This Elaborate Crypto Fraud Scheme? South Korean police conducted an extensive investigation that led to the dramatic arrest of 118 individuals and detention of 28 key suspects. The breakthrough came after multiple victims reported suspicious activities and inconsistent returns from their investments. Law enforcement agencies employed advanced tracking methods to follow the digital money trail across various cryptocurrency platforms. The investigation revealed that the criminals operated a complex network targeting both cryptocurrency and unlisted stocks. This dual approach made the crypto fraud scheme appear more legitimate to potential investors. Authorities noted that the group used sophisticated marketing techniques and professional-looking materials to build trust with their victims. What Can Investors Learn From This Crypto Fraud Scheme? This case highlights several red flags that every investor should recognize. Understanding these warning signs can help you avoid falling victim to similar crypto fraud schemes in the future. Guaranteed returns: No legitimate investment can promise guaranteed profits, especially in volatile markets like cryptocurrency Unregistered investments: The scheme involved unlisted stocks, which typically lack proper regulatory oversight Pressure tactics: Victims reported being pressured to invest quickly before ‘opportunities disappeared’ Complex explanations: The operators used technical jargon to confuse investors about how returns were generated Moreover, this crypto fraud scheme demonstrates the importance of conducting thorough due diligence before investing. Always verify the credentials of investment advisors and check if they’re registered with financial regulatory authorities. Why Are Crypto Fraud Schemes Becoming More Common? The rising popularity of cryptocurrency investments has created fertile ground for fraudulent activities. Several factors contribute to the increasing prevalence of crypto fraud schemes worldwide. First, the relative anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions makes it easier for criminals to operate without immediate detection. Second, many new investors lack the experience to identify sophisticated scams. Third, the rapid growth and complexity of the crypto market create confusion that fraudsters exploit. This particular crypto fraud scheme in South Korea serves as a stark reminder that regulatory frameworks are still catching up with technological advancements in digital finance. However, authorities worldwide are strengthening their capabilities to detect and prevent such crimes. How Can You Protect Yourself From Crypto Fraud Schemes? Protecting yourself requires a combination of education, caution, and verification. Here are essential steps every investor should take. Research investment opportunities thoroughly before committing funds Verify the registration status of investment platforms with financial authorities Be skeptical of promises that seem too good to be true Consult with independent financial advisors before making significant investments Monitor your investments regularly and question unexpected changes Remember that legitimate investment opportunities never pressure you to make quick decisions. Take your time to understand exactly what you’re investing in and how returns are generated. The Bottom Line: Staying Safe in the Crypto World The South Korean crypto fraud scheme case demonstrates both the sophistication of modern financial crimes and the effectiveness of law enforcement response. While the arrests bring some justice to the victims, the financial losses highlight the permanent damage such schemes can cause. As cryptocurrency continues to evolve, so must our awareness and protective measures. By staying informed and cautious, investors can participate in the digital economy while minimizing their exposure to fraudulent activities. The key lesson from this crypto fraud scheme is clear: if an investment opportunity seems perfect, it probably isn’t real. Frequently Asked Questions What was the main tactic used in this crypto fraud scheme? The criminals promised guaranteed principal protection and high returns on investments in cryptocurrency and unlisted stocks, creating a false sense of security for investors. How many people were affected by this investment scam? Approximately 284 investors lost money in this scheme, with total losses reaching $17.8 million over an 18-month period. What should I do if I suspect a crypto fraud scheme? Immediately contact your local financial regulatory authority and law enforcement agencies. Also, cease all transactions and document all communications with the suspected fraudsters. Are cryptocurrency investments inherently risky? While all investments carry some risk, cryptocurrency markets are particularly volatile. However, legitimate crypto investments differ significantly from fraudulent schemes that promise guaranteed returns. How can I verify if an investment opportunity is legitimate? Check with financial regulatory authorities to confirm the registration status of the company and individuals involved. Also, research independent reviews and consult with licensed financial advisors. What penalties do perpetrators of crypto fraud schemes face? Convictions can result in severe penalties including imprisonment, substantial fines, and restitution payments to victims. The specific penalties vary by jurisdiction and the scale of the fraud.

Amid this decisive breakdown, the RSI is quietly flashing a bullish divergence, a subtle but meaningful early signal that momentum may be preparing to shift. The charts now paint a tense picture: bearish pressure remains dominant, but the first signs of a potential turnaround have appeared. Support Levels Crumble As Bitcoin Extends Its Downtrend According to an update shared by Crypto Candy on X, Bitcoin continues to break through support levels with little hesitation. The price held the $93,000–$95,000 zone for a brief period, but eventually failed to maintain that structure, triggering another move to the downside. The speed of each breakdown highlights how fragile market sentiment currently is. Related Reading: Bitcoin SSR Flashes Buy Signal: Rebound Incoming? With the most recent support now lost, Bitcoin has slipped to lower levels and remains under bearish pressure. If this momentum persists, Crypto Candy noted that the next area of interest lies between $86,000 and $87,500, a major support where buyers may attempt to slow or halt the decline. Should Bitcoin manage to hold within this $86,000–$87,500 range, a short-term reversal becomes possible. Even a modest bounce could provide temporary relief to the broader downtrend. However, such a reaction would still require confirmation before hinting at any sustainable shift in momentum. If that support fails to hold, Crypto Candy warns that the market could face another steep drop. A continued breakdown would reinforce the ongoing bearish narrative, opening the door for what he described as a “waterfall” scenario. Bullish Divergence Emerges On The 4H Chart Crypto analyst Chad recently noted in an X post that Bitcoin is showing a notable bullish divergence between its price action and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) on the 4-hour chart. This divergence is a technical signal where the price makes a lower low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: This Indicator Signals SELL, Could History Repeat With A 67% Drop? Chad acknowledges that the price is clearly in a short-term downtrend and will need to reverse at some point. While he admits he doesn’t know the exact timing of the reversal, he emphasizes that the bullish divergence is the first positive sign that sellers are losing control and a structural shift may be near. To officially switch the short-term market structure back to bullish, Chad outlines a simple progression: the price needs to first make a higher high to break the current downtrend, and then confirm that break by establishing a higher low. This sequence is necessary to confirm that buyers have successfully taken over directional control of the price.

A Kraken spokesperson confirmed the round to Fortune , calling it a strategic investment from the nearly 25-year-old market maker. This new cash comes only weeks after Kraken closed a separate $600m financing in September at a $15b valuation. That earlier round drew a roster of Wall Street and Silicon Valley names, including Jane Street, DRW, HSG, Oppenheimer, Tribe Capital and the family office of Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi. Sethi confirmed the funding round in an X post on Wednesday. Kraken Confirmed Its Earlier $600M Raise, Lifting Total Recent Funding To $800M Further, Kraken publicly confirmed the $600m raise for the first time, after Bloomberg reported in September that the exchange was eyeing a $20b valuation from a strategic backer. Citadel Securities plans to work with Kraken on risk management and market structure analysis among other initiatives, according to a statement Fortune shared. The deal marks a clear shift for Citadel. The Ken Griffin-founded firm had largely stayed away from making markets on crypto exchanges or investing directly in digital assets, citing regulatory uncertainty in the US. After Donald Trump took office in January, the company began preparing to transact on platforms such as Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com . Kraken Builds Balance Sheet Ahead of IPO as Citadel Expands Digital Asset Footprint Citadel’s latest moves go beyond Kraken. Earlier this month, Ripple said it raised $500m from Citadel, Fortress Investment Group and other investors, signalling broader interest from traditional finance in established crypto infrastructure. For Kraken, the two recent rounds, totaling $800m, significantly strengthen its balance sheet before an initial public offering targeted for next year. The exchange plans to use the capital to expand into markets outside North America and to build new payments products. The company has also been active on the acquisition front. Since January, Kraken has announced a string of deals, including its $1.5b purchase of futures trading platform NinjaTrader, reinforcing its push into derivatives and more sophisticated trading tools. Citadel’s Move Reflects Wall Street’s View That Crypto Trading Infrastructure Is Here to Stay Before these transactions, Kraken had raised only $27m in venture capital, relatively modest funding for one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. The latest capital injections move it into a different league and align it more closely with mainstream financial institutions. Kraken is now preparing for a public listing as early as 2026. Bloomberg reported that the company is working with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to lead the offering, positioning the Wyoming-based exchange as one of the next big crypto names to test public markets. For the digital asset industry, Citadel Securities’ $200m bet on Kraken signals that major market makers see lasting demand for regulated trading venues, even after a brutal bear market and a series of high-profile failures. The new valuation also shows that top-tier exchanges can still command double-digit billion price tags when they can demonstrate global scale and a clear path to profitability.

According to reports, the group says the effort is timed to influence lawmaking and political contests ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Key hires and early activity in several states mark a clear shift from Washington-focused lobbying to hands-on state work. State Network Targets Lawmakers And Local Groups The Network will be led in part by Anastasia Dellaccio , who has been named Executive Director Of State & Regional Affairs. Based on reports, Cody Carbone, the group’s CEO, said the aim is to educate elected officials and staff at state capitals. The program reportedly began activity in four states — New York, Arizona, Ohio, and New Hampshire — and will expand its reach through a planned 2026 Digital Asset Tour. Small grants are part of the plan; a micro-grants program is set to kick off in 2026 to fund state blockchain associations, university blockchain clubs, and community innovation groups. Partnerships And Political Timing Reports have disclosed that The Digital Chamber is partnering with the Future Caucus to reach younger and rising officials. The partnership is described as a way to introduce lawmakers to industry players and to provide training and materials on crypto policy. That timing matters because the initiative is explicitly tied to the 2026 midterms. Organizers say they want more lawmakers at every level to understand, and in many cases support, policies favorable to digital assets. The strategy blends education with political organizing. It also means the effort will operate in a political arena as much as a policy one. A Grassroots Funding Angle We’re thrilled to welcome our inaugural members: @Hedera , @Strategy , @Trondao , @InputOutputHK , and @Cryptocom . pic.twitter.com/Q2NJU9ZNm5 — The Digital Chamber (@DigitalChamber) November 17, 2025 Micro-grants aim to build local networks of supporters and educators. Reports indicate these grants will back small state groups and university teams that can speak about blockchain to lawmakers and communities. Organizers say this is about building capacity at the state level rather than just spending in national races. Some of the groups expected to benefit are grassroots associations and campus clubs that host public events or briefings. The Digital Chamber says the first members of the new network include Michael Saylor’s company Strategy , the Hedera network, which uses proof-of-stake, and Input Output, a company that works on blockchain research and infrastructure.

This marks the fifth consecutive day of withdrawals, raising questions about institutional confidence in Bitcoin ETFs during current market conditions. What’s Driving the Bitcoin ETFs Exodus? The outflow pattern shows significant movement away from major Bitcoin ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s IBIT, which experienced a staggering $513 million single-day withdrawal. This substantial movement represents one of the largest single-day outflows since these Bitcoin ETFs launched, indicating potential institutional repositioning. However, the situation isn’t entirely bleak. Grayscale’s GBTC provided some balance with a $139 million net inflow, while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw a modest $10 million inflow. These contrasting flows suggest that investors are being selective rather than abandoning Bitcoin ETFs entirely. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Facing Such Pressure? Several factors could explain the current outflow pattern from Bitcoin ETFs: Market volatility concerns affecting institutional risk appetite Portfolio rebalancing as year-end approaches Profit-taking following recent price movements Regulatory uncertainty impacting investment decisions The consecutive withdrawal days from Bitcoin ETFs highlight how sensitive these investment vehicles are to market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETFs Investors? For current investors in Bitcoin ETFs, these flows serve as important market indicators. The mixed activity—with some funds experiencing outflows while others see inflows—suggests that the Bitcoin ETFs market is maturing rather than collapsing. Investment professionals monitoring Bitcoin ETFs should consider: Diversification across multiple Bitcoin ETFs Long-term perspective despite short-term fluctuations Monitoring institutional sentiment through flow data Understanding each Bitcoin ETF’s unique characteristics Will Bitcoin ETFs Recover From This Outflow Trend? Historical data shows that Bitcoin ETFs often experience cyclical flow patterns. While five consecutive days of outflows might seem alarming, it’s important to remember that Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated resilience through previous market cycles. The presence of continued inflows into some Bitcoin ETFs, particularly GBTC, indicates that not all institutional investors are retreating. This mixed sentiment suggests that the future of Bitcoin ETFs remains promising, though potentially volatile. Key Takeaways for Bitcoin ETFs Market Participants The recent $363 million net outflow from Bitcoin ETFs serves as a crucial reminder about market dynamics. While BlackRock’s IBIT led the withdrawals, the partial offset by other Bitcoin ETFs shows that the market is finding its equilibrium. Investors should view these Bitcoin ETFs flows as part of normal market mechanics rather than panic indicators. The diversity of responses across different Bitcoin ETFs actually demonstrates market sophistication and varied investment strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the massive outflow from BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF? The $513 million outflow likely resulted from institutional rebalancing, profit-taking, or specific large investors adjusting their positions in response to market conditions. Are Bitcoin ETFs still a good investment despite these outflows? Yes, Bitcoin ETFs remain viable long-term investments. Short-term flows don’t necessarily reflect long-term value, and the presence of inflows into other Bitcoin ETFs shows continued interest. How often do Bitcoin ETFs experience such significant outflows? Significant outflows occur periodically, typically during market uncertainty or when large institutional investors rebalance their portfolios. These events are normal in evolving markets. Should I be concerned about investing in Bitcoin ETFs now? While due diligence is always important, these flows represent normal market activity rather than fundamental issues with Bitcoin ETFs as an investment vehicle. What’s the difference between the various Bitcoin ETFs mentioned? Different Bitcoin ETFs have varying fee structures, management approaches, and tracking methods, though they all provide exposure to Bitcoin’s price movement. How can I track Bitcoin ETFs flow data myself? Several financial data providers and cryptocurrency analytics platforms offer daily flow tracking for Bitcoin ETFs, allowing investors to monitor institutional sentiment.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The downtrend pressure is fading, but bulls must reclaim $0.0000599 to confirm recovery. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of November 19, the 1-day price chart shows Floki drifting along a soft downtrend. Today’s candle around $0.0000537 suggests sellers are losing strength. FLOKI’s price remains pinned beneath the mid-band at $0.0000599, indicating that bulls have not yet reclaimed control. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Overall, momentum remains fragile, with the MACD line hovering slightly below the signal line in a shallow negative zone. This signals fading bearish momentum rather than a fresh down-leg forming. The RSI at 38 indicates that Floki is recovering from oversold conditions. If the market reacts positively, the first profit-taking zone emerges at $0.0000595–$0.0000600, aligned with the middle Bollinger Band. A stronger move could extend toward $0.0000710, but only if price decisively reclaims the mid-band. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour time frame, Floki is showing mild consolidation after a brief bullish push that stalled at $0.0000544, the current upper alligator band resistance. The market is now drifting sideways near $0.0000537, reflecting indecision. The alligator lines are tightening, indicating a coiling phase that often precedes a directional breakout. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The Balance of Power remains negative at –0.32, confirming buyers are not fully committed. Yet PVT is stabilizing and no longer plunging, suggesting selling volume has tapered off. This mix produces an uncertain but cautiously constructive short-term environment.

Traders can expect sideways trading with a slight bullish bias if support holds, with a potential test of $0.0000595 in the coming sessions. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Recent data reveals a concerning trend as U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their sixth consecutive day of net outflows, totaling $74.68 million on November 18. This persistent withdrawal pattern raises important questions about the current state of Ethereum ETF investments and market sentiment. What’s Driving the Ethereum ETF Outflows? The primary driver behind these significant outflows appears to be BlackRock’s ETHA fund, which experienced a staggering $165.52 million in withdrawals. This massive exit from one of the largest Ethereum ETF providers indicates shifting investor confidence in the short-term prospects of Ethereum-based investment products. However, the story isn’t entirely negative across the board. Several other Ethereum ETF providers actually saw inflows during the same period, creating a more nuanced picture of the market. The outflows from BlackRock’s fund were partially offset by positive movements in other Ethereum ETF products, suggesting that while some investors are pulling back, others remain committed to Ethereum exposure through different vehicles. Which Ethereum ETFs Are Bucking the Trend? Despite the overall negative flow pattern, several Ethereum ETF products demonstrated resilience and even attracted new investments. Here are the key performers that managed to draw inflows: Grayscale’s Mini ETH : $62.39 million in inflows Bitwise’s ETHW : $19.10 million in new investments Franklin Templeton’s EZET : $4.76 million added VanEck’s ETHV : $4.59 million in positive flows These inflows indicate that while the overall Ethereum ETF market is experiencing pressure, specific products continue to maintain investor interest. The diversity in performance across different Ethereum ETF providers highlights the importance of fund-specific factors beyond just the underlying Ethereum asset. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? The six-day outflow streak for Ethereum ETFs represents the longest continuous withdrawal period since these products launched. This trend could signal several market dynamics at play. Some analysts suggest that investors might be rotating into other cryptocurrency opportunities or traditional assets amid market uncertainty. However, it’s crucial to recognize that Ethereum ETF flows don’t necessarily reflect the fundamental health of the Ethereum network itself. The underlying blockchain continues to see robust development activity and growing adoption across various sectors. The Ethereum ETF market movements might be more indicative of short-term trading strategies rather than long-term conviction in Ethereum’s value proposition. How Should You Approach Ethereum ETF Investing Now? For current and prospective Ethereum ETF investors, this period of outflows presents both challenges and opportunities. Consider these key factors when evaluating your Ethereum ETF strategy: Diversification matters : The varying performance across different Ethereum ETF products underscores the importance of not putting all your eggs in one basket Long-term perspective : Ethereum ETF investments should align with your overall investment horizon and risk tolerance Monitor fee structures : Different Ethereum ETF providers charge varying management fees that can impact returns Stay informed : Regular monitoring of flow data and market developments can help you make timely decisions The current Ethereum ETF outflow situation serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investments, even through regulated products like ETFs, remain subject to market volatility and shifting investor sentiment. While six days of outflows might seem alarming, it’s essential to view this within the broader context of Ethereum’s development trajectory and the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency investment products. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the Ethereum ETF outflows? The outflows were primarily driven by significant withdrawals from BlackRock’s ETHA fund, which saw $165.52 million exit. This suggests some institutional investors or large holders are reducing their Ethereum ETF exposure. Are all Ethereum ETFs experiencing outflows? No, while the overall market saw net outflows, several Ethereum ETF products actually experienced inflows, including Grayscale’s Mini ETH, Bitwise’s ETHW, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, and VanEck’s ETHV. How long has this outflow trend been happening? The data shows six consecutive trading days of net outflows, making this the longest continuous withdrawal period for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs since their launch. Should I be concerned about my Ethereum ETF investments? While the outflows warrant attention, they don’t necessarily indicate problems with Ethereum itself. Market flows can be influenced by many factors including profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or short-term market sentiment. What’s the difference between these Ethereum ETFs? Different Ethereum ETF providers offer varying fee structures, liquidity, and tracking methodologies. Some may use different strategies for managing the underlying Ethereum exposure. Where can I find updated Ethereum ETF flow data? Regular updates on Ethereum ETF flows are available through financial data providers, cryptocurrency news platforms, and the fund providers’ official websites.

In just 24 hours, the market saw massive shifts, with Bitcoin leading at $215 million in liquidations. This volatility highlights the risks and opportunities in crypto trading, making it crucial to understand how these events unfold and impact your portfolio. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Crypto futures liquidations occur when traders’ positions are forcibly closed due to insufficient margin. This happens during sharp price movements, amplifying market volatility. For instance, when Bitcoin’s price swings, leveraged positions can trigger a cascade of liquidations, affecting overall market sentiment. Understanding this process helps traders manage risk and avoid unexpected losses. Breaking Down the 24-Hour Crypto Futures Liquidations Data The recent data reveals staggering figures. Bitcoin faced $215 million in liquidations, with 77.71% of these being long positions. Ethereum followed with $89.05 million, evenly split between longs and shorts. Zecoin saw $15.65 million, slightly favoring longs. These numbers show how leveraged trading can lead to significant liquidations during market turbulence. Bitcoin: $215 million liquidated (77.71% longs) Ethereum: $89.05 million liquidated (50.95% longs) Zecoin: $15.65 million liquidated (51.84% longs) How Can Traders Navigate Crypto Futures Liquidations? To mitigate risks from crypto futures liquidations, traders should use stop-loss orders and monitor leverage ratios. Diversifying assets and staying updated on market news can also help. For example, setting tighter margins during high volatility periods reduces exposure to sudden price drops. Moreover, learning from past liquidation events provides actionable insights for future strategies. The Impact of Crypto Futures Liquidations on Market Trends Large-scale crypto futures liquidations often lead to increased selling pressure, driving prices lower. This can create buying opportunities for savvy investors. However, it also underscores the importance of risk management. By analyzing liquidation patterns, traders can anticipate market moves and adjust their positions accordingly. In summary, crypto futures liquidations are a critical aspect of market dynamics, offering both warnings and opportunities. Staying informed and proactive is key to navigating these volatile events successfully. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidations? They occur when a trader’s margin falls below the required level due to price movements, forcing automatic closure of positions. How can I avoid being liquidated in crypto futures? Use stop-loss orders, maintain adequate margin, and avoid excessive leverage during volatile periods. Why are long positions often liquidated more? In downtrends, falling prices hit long positions harder, as traders bet on price increases that don’t materialize. Do liquidations affect crypto prices? Yes, large liquidations can increase selling pressure, leading to further price declines in a cascading effect. What tools help monitor crypto futures liquidations? Platforms like CoinGlass provide real-time data on liquidations across exchanges. Is it safe to trade during high liquidation events? It carries higher risk; cautious traders may wait for stability, while others see it as a chance for strategic entries. Found this guide on crypto futures liquidations helpful?

According to crypto entrepreneur Mike Alfred, this scenario describes the current US approach to Bitcoin. The United States government appears reluctant to build its Bitcoin stockpile until international pressure forces its hand. This cautious stance could have significant implications for global financial dominance. Why Won’t the US Build a Bitcoin Stockpile Immediately? Mike Alfred recently shared his insights on the CoinStories podcast, explaining the US government’s hesitation. He believes America will only begin accumulating Bitcoin when other nations create sufficient external pressure. The current approach suggests a reactive rather than proactive strategy toward digital asset reserves. Several factors contribute to this cautious stance: Regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency classification Traditional financial system dominance creating complacency Political considerations affecting bold monetary moves Risk assessment favoring established reserve assets What Triggers Will Force US Bitcoin Accumulation? Alfred identifies clear catalysts that could push America toward building its Bitcoin stockpile. When other countries demonstrate significant BTC acquisition patterns, the US will face mounting pressure to respond. This global competition resembles a high-stakes game of financial chess where early movers gain strategic advantages. The timing remains uncertain, but the triggers are becoming increasingly visible. Nations like El Salvador have already made Bitcoin legal tender, while others are exploring central bank digital currencies. Each move by another country adds to the pressure on US policymakers to reconsider their Bitcoin stockpile strategy. How Does Global Adoption Affect Bitcoin’s Future? Alfred projects an ambitious future for Bitcoin, predicting it could reach $1 million by 2033. By that time, he expects most countries will hold the asset either directly or indirectly through various financial instruments. This widespread adoption would fundamentally reshape global finance and reserve currency dynamics. The path to this future involves several key developments: Institutional adoption accelerating mainstream acceptance Regulatory clarity emerging across major economies Technological infrastructure supporting secure storage Global economic shifts driving alternative reserve assets What Are the Risks of Delaying Bitcoin Acquisition? Waiting too long to build a national Bitcoin stockpile carries significant risks. Early-adopting nations could gain substantial financial advantages and influence in the emerging digital economy. The US might face higher acquisition costs and reduced geopolitical leverage if it delays its entry into the Bitcoin reserve market. Moreover, the window for strategic positioning is narrowing. As more countries announce their Bitcoin stockpile initiatives, the remaining available supply becomes increasingly scarce and expensive. This creates a first-mover advantage that latecomers cannot easily overcome. Conclusion: The Inevitable Shift Toward Bitcoin Reserves The US approach to Bitcoin reserves reflects a broader pattern in technological adoption—initial skepticism followed by reactive adaptation. However, in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, this cautious strategy might prove costly. As global pressure mounts and other nations accelerate their Bitcoin stockpile programs, America will likely find itself compelled to join the digital gold rush. The transition toward national Bitcoin holdings appears inevitable. The only question remains whether the US will lead this transformation or follow reluctantly. Either way, the coming decade will witness a fundamental reshaping of how nations store and protect their wealth. Frequently Asked Questions Why is the US hesitant to stockpile Bitcoin? The US maintains caution due to regulatory uncertainties, dominance of traditional financial systems, and political considerations that favor established reserve assets over emerging digital currencies. What countries are currently building Bitcoin reserves? Several nations have started accumulating Bitcoin, with El Salvador making it legal tender and other countries exploring central bank digital currency initiatives that incorporate Bitcoin exposure. How much Bitcoin could the US potentially acquire? While specific amounts remain speculative, a national Bitcoin stockpile could range from symbolic holdings to significant percentages of national reserves, depending on policy decisions and market conditions. What happens if the US delays Bitcoin acquisition too long? Delaying could result in higher acquisition costs, reduced geopolitical influence in digital finance, and missed opportunities for early-mover advantages in the evolving global financial system. How reliable are Bitcoin price predictions like the $1 million forecast? While expert predictions provide valuable insights, cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile. Price forecasts should be considered as informed speculation rather than guaranteed outcomes. Can other cryptocurrencies compete with Bitcoin for national reserves? While other digital assets exist, Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, network security, and widespread recognition make it the primary candidate for national reserve status among cryptocurrencies.

Despite that shock, he insisted that Ethereum’s core investment story remains intact. Will Ethereum Bottom This Week? For Lee, that story centers on Ethereum as neutral infrastructure for tokenization and stablecoins, increasingly relevant as Wall Street intensifies its on-chain ambitions. “There are stablecoin creations. Larry Fink and BlackRock and Wall Street want to tokenize assets, bring stocks, bonds, real estate onto the blockchain. And they have to find a neutral 100% uptime blockchain. That’s Ethereum. And that’s the fundamental story,” he said. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Historical Accumulation Level – Just 8% Away From LTH Cost Basis Lee framed crypto’s extreme volatility as structurally tied to how the market values long-term innovation rather than as a sign of fundamental weakness. “The price, of course, for Ethereum will fluctuate because crypto is hyper volatile. In fact, it’s kind of a… it’s sort of a feature of the blockchain itself,” he noted. “Crypto suffered from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and crypto discounts the future, that’s why it’s volatile, but it still looks pretty attractive here.” He placed the current move in the context of a broader risk-off environment and a continuing correction across digital assets. According to Lee, macro data remains a crucial driver of crypto cycles, particularly for Bitcoin. “The most correlated factor to Bitcoin prices when you see it… at a peak actually is the ISM,” he said, referring to US activity surveys. “So I think we’re still in a correction phase of crypto.” Asked specifically what underpins his bullish view on Ethereum now, Lee pointed to two structural “floor” mechanisms. First, he cited the value of assets locked on the Ethereum blockchain. “Ethereum kind of has several ways that it establishes a floor. One is the value of all the assets locked onto the blockchain, and that number is growing,” he said. “Historically, Ethereum bottoms when that ratio is about 50%. So I’d say we’re pretty close to that level. That’s why I think Ethereum is probably bottoming this week.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Rare Oversold Signal As Price Hits Demand Zone — Major Rebound Loading? Second, he highlighted Ethereum’s valuation relative to Bitcoin, using both price and network value. “The other way to look at Ethereum is really its price ratio or even its network value ratio to Bitcoin. It currently sits at 0.032,” Lee said. “The long-term average, like the eight-year average, if we were just to trade to that eight-year average, would put Ethereum at around $12,000.” On that basis, Lee characterized Ethereum as undervalued versus its historical relationship with Bitcoin. “So I think Ethereum is undervalued because number one, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year. But two, we’re getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain,” he argued. Summarizing Lee’s stance, the CNBC host concluded: “Tom Lee saying that Ethereum is bottoming this week.” Lee did not offer a specific price target or an exact day, but his message was clear: in his view, Ethereum is close to completing its correction as on-chain value and relative valuation metrics converge toward levels that have historically marked major bottoms. At press time, ETH traded at $3,018.

Bitcoin Spot ETFs Are Experiencing Their Second-Largest Drawdown Ever In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about how the holdings attached to the US Bitcoin spot ETFs are currently looking. Spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that allow an investor to gain exposure to an underlying asset’s price movements without having to directly own said asset. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this means that the ETF holder never has to interact with a digital asset exchange or make any transactions on the blockchain; the fund buys and holds the coin on their behalf. Spot ETFs are a relatively recent phenomenon in the sector, having received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) only in January of last year. Despite them being new, these investment vehicles have grown into one of the cornerstones of the market, tapping into the demand from traditional investors who were previously reluctant to trade on-chain. Given the relevance of the spot ETFs, the trend in their holdings can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may reflect the sentiment among institutional entities. One way to do so is by measuring where these funds stand relative to their ATH. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows how the drawdown from the ATH currently looks for the Bitcoin spot ETFs: From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin spot ETFs saw their USD holdings reach an ATH in October, but since then, they have been facing a sustained drawdown. Last month, the drawdown was still limited, but the outflows accompanying the price crash have meant ETF holdings are now significantly down compared to the peak. More specifically, spot ETF holdings are currently down a whopping $3.29 billion, the second-largest drawdown since last year’s launch. The only phase during which the metric’s value was higher was the bearish period between February and April. Back then, ETFs saw a peak drawdown of $4.8 billion. The latest decline in ETF holdings is still notably below this mark, so it only remains to be seen whether the drawdown will deepen in the near future. In some other news, Strategy made a large purchase on Monday, but the continued decline in the Bitcoin price has already pushed the treasury firm’s new acquisition significantly into the red. According to CryptoQuant , the combination of this move and the price drop has resulted in about 40% of the company’s reserves now sitting underwater. BTC Price Bitcoin slipped under $90,000 just earlier, but the coin has since bounced back to $91,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF Drawdown|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 04:00:29

Many investors believe Bitcoin serves as a leading indicator for stocks, but recent analysis reveals this might be a dangerous assumption. Let’s explore why the Bitcoin leading indicator theory doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Leading Indicator? A leading indicator typically predicts future economic trends. Some market watchers claim Bitcoin’s price movements foreshadow stock market performance. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has thoroughly debunked this popular misconception. His research shows that Bitcoin’s performance doesn’t reliably signal where stocks are headed. Why Bitcoin Isn’t Predicting Stock Market Moves Balchunas presents compelling evidence against the Bitcoin leading indicator theory. After examining historical data, he discovered something surprising. When Bitcoin declines for one month, the S&P 500 actually has a 62% probability of rising. This directly contradicts the idea that Bitcoin predicts stock market downturns. Consider these key findings: One-month Bitcoin declines don’t correlate with stock market drops The S&P 500 often moves independently of cryptocurrency trends Historical data shows stocks can rise while Bitcoin falls What This Means for Your Investment Strategy Understanding that Bitcoin isn’t a reliable leading indicator changes how you should approach market analysis. Don’t make the mistake of using Bitcoin price movements to predict stock performance. Each market operates with different drivers and influences. Key takeaways for investors: Diversify your analysis – Look at multiple indicators Understand market differences – Cryptocurrency and stocks have unique characteristics Avoid false correlations – Just because two assets move doesn’t mean they’re connected The Real Relationship Between Bitcoin and Stocks While Bitcoin and stocks sometimes move together during major market events, this doesn’t make Bitcoin a leading indicator. Both markets respond to broader economic factors, but their reactions can be completely different. The Bitcoin leading indicator theory oversimplifies a complex relationship. Remember these important points: Correlation doesn’t equal causation Short-term movements rarely predict long-term trends Market timing based on Bitcoin performance is risky Expert Insights: Why the Myth Persists Despite clear evidence against the Bitcoin leading indicator theory, why do so many investors still believe it? The answer lies in human psychology and confirmation bias. People tend to remember when Bitcoin and stocks move together while forgetting when they move apart. Balchunas emphasizes that investors need to base decisions on data, not popular myths. The Bitcoin leading indicator concept might sound appealing, but it doesn’t stand up to statistical analysis. Final Verdict: Separating Fact from Fiction The evidence is clear – Bitcoin is not a reliable leading indicator for stock market performance. While both markets can be influenced by similar macroeconomic factors, their relationship is far more complex than simple cause and effect. Smart investors should analyze each market independently rather than assuming Bitcoin movements predict stock trends. By understanding that the Bitcoin leading indicator theory is flawed, you can make more informed investment decisions and avoid costly mistakes based on false assumptions. Frequently Asked Questions What is a leading indicator in financial markets? A leading indicator is a measurable factor that changes before the economy starts to follow a particular pattern. It’s used to predict future economic activity. Why do people think Bitcoin predicts stock market moves? This belief stems from occasional correlations during market crises and the misconception that cryptocurrency markets move faster than traditional markets. How reliable is the data showing Bitcoin isn’t a leading indicator? Bloomberg’s analysis uses extensive historical data and statistical methods, making it highly reliable for understanding market relationships. Should I completely ignore Bitcoin when making stock investment decisions? While Bitcoin shouldn’t be used as a leading indicator, it’s still valuable to monitor as part of broader market sentiment and risk appetite assessment. What are better leading indicators for stock market performance? More reliable indicators include employment data, manufacturing indexes, consumer confidence surveys, and yield curve analysis. Could Bitcoin become a leading indicator in the future? As markets evolve, relationships can change. However, current data strongly suggests Bitcoin doesn’t function as a stock market leading indicator. Found this analysis revealing?

Bitcoin, which briefly slipped below $90,000 for the first time in seven months, has rebounded toward the $93,000 level as overall market sentiment steadies. At press time, Bitcoin was trading around $91,000. The global crypto market capitalization is up 1.3%, reaching $3.23 trillion, reflecting a broader return to risk assets after a turbulent morning. Bitcoin recovers following heavy liquidations Bitcoin’s slide to $89,000 earlier in the session sparked significant volatility, wiping out more than $620 million in leveraged positions over 24 hours. Analysts attribute the plunge to forced liquidations combined with investors pulling back from riskier assets amid wider market weakness. The move mirrored a sell-off in AI-linked tech equities, suggesting traders were responding to heightened macro uncertainty and shifting toward a “risk-off” posture. Despite the abrupt drop, Bitcoin stabilized quickly. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading near $91,640, up by 1.7% in the last 24 hours as dip buyers stepped in and derivatives markets reset after the liquidation wave. Market participants note that while volatility remains elevated, Bitcoin’s ability to rebound underscores the resilience of investor interest, even in the face of macro-driven pressure and regulatory speculation. Altcoins bounce as market sentiment improves The rebound in the crypto market extended beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum is trading near $3,071 after a roughly 1.8% gain over the past day. XRP has also moved higher, climbing more than 1.5% to around $2.18. XRP’s performance follows strong demand for the newly launched US spot XRP ETF, which recorded nearly $60 million in first-day trading volume, the highest opening for any ETF this year. Other major altcoins, including Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, and BNB, also turned positive following the morning turmoil. The swift recovery across large-cap tokens suggests that earlier selling pressure was driven more by liquidations and short-term uncertainty than a fundamental shift in investor appetite. Macroeconomic pressures and regulatory concerns drive volatility According to analysts, several factors drove the initial downturn. Markets broadly weakened as investors pulled out of speculative tech names and crypto assets. Political tension added an additional layer of uncertainty after US senators called for an investigation into World Liberty Financial over alleged token ties to North Korea and Russia. Rising token supply, a wave of new listings, and continued growth in memecoin markets also weighed on sentiment, contributing to price pressure across the board. Shifting expectations around potential US Federal Reserve rate cuts further complicated the outlook, as traders reassessed how much monetary policy easing may be on the table in the coming months. Despite these headwinds, the recovery points to persistent interest in digital assets, particularly as new investment products expand access to the market. Recently launched spot ETFs, including those tied to XRP and Litecoin, alongside upcoming Avalanche offerings, are providing both institutional and retail investors with more entry points. This growing ETF ecosystem is helping cushion the market during episodes of heightened volatility, offering a stabilizing force as crypto continues to mature within global finance.

That revolutionary vision just became reality in Europe as Ondo Finance secures regulatory approval for tokenized stocks and ETFs across the European Union. What Are Tokenized Stocks and Why Do They Matter? Tokenized stocks represent traditional securities like company shares or ETF units on blockchain networks. Think of them as digital versions of stocks that you can trade 24/7 with faster settlement times. This breakthrough eliminates many traditional barriers that have kept average investors from accessing global markets efficiently. Ondo Finance’s recent announcement via X confirms they received the green light from Liechtenstein’s Financial Market Authority (FMA). This regulatory milestone opens doors for millions of EU investors to access tokenized stocks through a trusted, regulated platform. How Will European Investors Benefit from Tokenized Stocks? The advantages of this development extend far beyond simple convenience. European investors now gain access to: 24/7 trading without market hour restrictions Lower transaction costs compared to traditional brokers Faster settlement times through blockchain efficiency Enhanced transparency with all transactions recorded on-chain Global accessibility to US and international markets This expansion represents a significant step toward democratizing investment opportunities. Moreover, it bridges the gap between traditional finance and the emerging digital asset ecosystem. What Challenges Does Tokenization Face in Traditional Markets? Despite the excitement, tokenized stocks face several hurdles. Regulatory compliance remains complex across different jurisdictions. Market liquidity needs development to match traditional exchanges. Additionally, investor education about blockchain technology requires ongoing effort. However, Ondo Finance’s approval from Liechtenstein’s FMA demonstrates that regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate innovation. This sets a positive precedent for other jurisdictions considering similar approvals. How Does Ondo Finance’s Platform Work for Tokenized Stocks? The platform converts traditional securities into digital tokens on blockchain networks. Each tokenized stock represents actual ownership in the underlying asset. Investors can trade these tokens peer-to-peer or through supported exchanges. Asset backing : Each token corresponds to real securities held in custody Regulatory compliance : Full adherence to EU financial regulations User-friendly interface : Designed for both crypto-native and traditional investors Security measures : Multi-layer protection for digital assets This approach combines the familiarity of traditional investing with the efficiency of blockchain technology. What Does This Mean for the Future of Investing? The approval of tokenized stocks in the EU signals a broader shift toward digital asset adoption. We’re witnessing the early stages of a transformation that could redefine how people access global markets. As more platforms follow Ondo Finance’s lead, we expect to see increased competition and innovation in the space. Traditional financial institutions are already exploring similar technologies. This validation from European regulators accelerates the mainstream acceptance of blockchain-based financial products. Conclusion: A New Era for European Investors Ondo Finance’s expansion into the EU marks a pivotal moment for both cryptocurrency and traditional finance. The availability of tokenized stocks and ETFs creates unprecedented opportunities for European investors to diversify their portfolios with familiar assets through modern technology. As regulatory barriers continue to fall, we anticipate rapid growth in tokenized real-world assets across global markets. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are tokenized stocks?

54593797,629820,1763528428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54593797.jpeg,"Analyst Suggests Selling Bitcoin To Buy Dogecoin, Here’s Why",https://bitcoinist.com/sell-bitcoin-buy-dogecoin/,"Bitcoin’s latest pullback has created an unexpected opportunity in one corner of the market, and it is not coming from BTC itself. Attention has shifted to the DOGE/BTC trading pair, which has quietly returned to a major support zone that proposes the start of strong outperformance for Dogecoin. One trader, known as Jimmy on X, has shared a chart that shows just how significant this support is, suggesting that the current structure may be preparing Dogecoin for a strong change in relative strength if the level continues to hold. DOGE/BTC Is Sitting On Very Strong Support Jimmy’s technical analysis highlights one fundamental idea: the DOGE/BTC pair is sitting on what he describes as a “very strong support.” As shown in the chart below, Dogecoin is currently consolidating at the same base level that preceded some of its largest outperformance phases against Bitcoin on the daily candlestick timeframe. A closer look at the chart shows that each touch of this support since 2024 has produced a steady and sometimes explosive upward move. This consistency is what makes the current retest important. The most memorable of these was the rally in mid-2024, when a similar retest sparked months of Dogecoin strength. That move carried the pair from roughly 0.00000170 to 0.00000450 before momentum finally cooled. At the time of writing, the DOGE/BTC pair is back to trading around 0.00000170. The gradual drift downward on the pair has slowed as it taps this demand region again, leaving the pair to decide whether another rebound is forming beneath the surface. The long-term pattern reflects exhaustion among sellers and a potential buildup similar to the early stretches of previous runs. Even the RSI on the chart sits in a neutral band but has begun curling upward from low-momentum regions. If this support continues to hold, it would reinforce the idea that Bitcoin’s dominance may be peaking while Dogecoin prepares for a rebound against the leading cryptocurrency. Whales Should “Sell Bitcoin And Buy Dogecoin” The most important part of Jimmy’s commentary was his remark that if he were a Bitcoin whale, he would jeet and buy DOGE. His point is tied to relative value. At this support, the DOGE/BTC ratio sits at one of its lowest points in years, meaning Dogecoin is cheap relative to Bitcoin. If a repeat of previous performance were to take place, Dogecoin could rebound from this support zone at 0.00000170 and push upwards against Bitcoin in the next few weeks. Dogecoin’s spot price is currently reflecting the broader market mood . At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1553, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours. The entire market is under pressure, with total crypto capitalization dropping by 5.1% over the same period.",Bitcoin|Dogecoin|bitcoin|btc|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|DOGE/BTC|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Jimmy|RSI,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 05:00:28

However, despite this downturn, altcoins have exhibited significant stability when compared to the performance of BTC. Analysts from the Bull Theory have provided insights into why altcoins are holding strong during this period. Bitcoin Dominance Falls In a recent social media post on social media site X (previously Twitter), the analysts asserted that the recent decline in BTC’s value was not characterized by typical selling pressure; instead, it is seen as a result of structured institutional selling. This was reflected in negative flows from Coinbase and the manner in which the candlestick patterns formed. Following this structured selling, panic selling ensued as traders who were already facing losses began to exit their positions hastily. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: This Indicator Signals SELL, Could History Repeat With A 67% Drop? This panic selling led to rapid declines in BTC’s price; however, altcoins, having already approached a state of seller exhaustion, did not experience significant drops. In previous scenarios where BTC has faced downturns, its dominance in the market typically surges as traders flock to Bitcoin for safety. Yet, the current situation is different. Bitcoin’s dominance remains below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and the market has recently seen a series of red candles. Such a decline in dominance while BTC is in a downward spiral is unusual, suggesting that altcoins are not being entirely abandoned by traders. Ethereum (ETH) has lost its 50-week EMA but is making attempts to reclaim it. Throughout this month, BTC and ETH have experienced nearly identical declines, yet ETH has shown quicker recovery patterns. The analysts highlighted that during previous cycles, whenever Ethereum holds its ground better than Bitcoin during similar downturns, altcoins tend to demonstrate strength as well. Altcoins Show Strength Amid BTC’s Decline The Bull Theory analysts also noted that many altcoin pairs against BTC have rebounded to levels seen before the significant crash that occurred on October 10th, with some even trading above those thresholds. This, according to their analysis, indicates a few key points: altcoins are outperforming BTC, the current pressure feels isolated rather than widespread, and the sell-off lacks broader implications across the market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash The Analysts suggest that this combination of factors is one of the strongest signals of a market bottom. When BTC is experiencing a downturn, dominance is declining, and alt/BTC pairs are on the rise, it often points to a capitulation phase for altcoins. As of this writing, Bitcoin has recovered above the $93,000 mark. However, the leading cryptocurrency has erased all of its year-to-date gains, while extending the gap to record levels by 26%.

With crucial US jobs data on the horizon, traders are repositioning portfolios amid growing uncertainty about interest rate trajectories and global economic stability. Why are Asian currencies weakening against the dollar? The persistent USD strength is creating headwinds for emerging market currencies across Asia. Several key factors are driving this trend: Heightened expectations of prolonged Federal Reserve hawkishness Risk aversion in global forex markets Capital outflows from emerging markets to safe-haven assets Diverging monetary policies between the Fed and Asian central banks Federal Reserve policy uncertainty weighs heavily Market participants are closely monitoring Federal Reserve communications for clues about future rate decisions. The central bank’s cautious approach has created volatility across forex markets , particularly affecting Asian currencies sensitive to US monetary policy shifts. Currency Recent Performance Key Support Levels Japanese Yen (JPY) -1.8% vs USD 152.00 Chinese Yuan (CNY) -0.9% vs USD 7.2500 Indian Rupee (INR) -0.7% vs USD 83.50 US jobs data: The market’s next major catalyst Upcoming US jobs data represents a critical inflection point for forex markets . Strong employment figures could reinforce the case for higher-for-longer interest rates, potentially accelerating the selloff in Asian currencies . Navigating USD strength in volatile conditions The current environment of USD strength presents both challenges and opportunities for traders. Key considerations include: Monitoring Federal Reserve commentary for policy signals Assessing technical support levels for major currency pairs Diversifying exposure across different Asian currencies Implementing risk management strategies for sudden moves What does this mean for global forex markets? The weakness in Asian currencies reflects broader concerns about global growth and monetary policy divergence. As the Federal Reserve maintains its cautious stance, the ripple effects are being felt across emerging markets and developed economies alike. FAQs How does Federal Reserve policy affect Asian currencies? The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions directly impact capital flows and currency valuations. Higher US rates typically strengthen the dollar and pressure emerging market currencies. What economic indicators should traders watch besides US jobs data? Key indicators include inflation data, manufacturing PMIs, retail sales figures, and central bank meeting minutes from both the Federal Reserve and Asian central banks. Which Asian currencies are most vulnerable to Federal Reserve policy changes? Currencies with large current account deficits and high external debt levels typically face greater pressure during periods of Federal Reserve tightening. The ongoing pressure on Asian currencies underscores the delicate balance central banks face in managing their economies amid global monetary policy shifts. As the Federal Reserve maintains its cautious approach, market participants must remain vigilant about upcoming US jobs data and its potential impact on USD strength across global forex markets . The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether current trends represent temporary adjustments or the beginning of a more sustained move.

The analyst shared a weekly price chart that annotates past and present sentiment readings alongside multi-year price action, asserting that current conditions resemble earlier periods that preceded major upward moves . The message is direct: short-term weakness should not be interpreted as the start of a sustained decline, and investors should be prepared for a strong recovery in XRP’s price. $XRP will bounce HARD. Don’t get fooled now! pic.twitter.com/jooEQgYh7t — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 15, 2025 Technical framing and evidence presented The chart presented by the analyst overlays weekly price candles with snapshots of the Fear & Greed Index showing readings in the extreme fear zone. The images on the chart highlight several historical moments where the index reached low values and were followed, according to the chart, by extended rallies. The most prominent annotations mark the 2021 market cycle and the 2025 price peak, while additional extreme-fear markers appear at earlier troughs. STEPH IS CRYPTO uses this visual comparison to argue that current sentiment metrics and price action mirror prior setups that ultimately resolved in strong upside moves. Interpretation of sentiment and market psychology The analyst’s commentary emphasizes that the prevailing sentiment indicator should be viewed as a contrarian signal. By pointing to repeated occurrences of extreme fear at historically low levels, the message suggests that panic-driven selling and short-term negative narratives have historically provided entry points for buyers. The analyst frames the present environment as one in which emotional reactions dominate price behavior, thereby increasing the likelihood of a countertrend bounce when selling pressure abates. Community response and broader implications In the replies to the post, one commenter suggested that institutional actors and incumbents may have an interest in pressuring retail holders to sell, and urged holders to maintain their positions. STEPH IS CRYPTO’s post, combined with that sentiment in the replies, reinforces a narrative among some community members that current weakness is temporary and that conviction will be rewarded. Whether this view will play out depends on broader market liquidity, macro conditions, and on-chain developments that could influence confidence in XRP. Investors considering this outlook should weigh the sentiment-based case alongside their own assessment of fundamentals and risk tolerance.

SOL price is now consolidating and faces hurdles near the $142 zone. SOL price started a decent recovery wave above $132 and $135 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $135 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $137 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to move up if it clears $142 and $145. Solana Price Eyes Steady Recovery Solana price remained stable and started a decent recovery wave from $128, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL was able to climb above the $132 pivot level. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $172 swing high to the $128 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $137 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $132 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $142 level. The next major resistance is near the $145 level. The main resistance could be $150 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $172 swing high to the $128 low. A successful close above the $150 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $162. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $142 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $135 zone. The first major support is near the $132 level. A break below the $132 level might send the price toward the $125 support zone.

The crypto asset fell by more than 11% over the past week as a result, and briefly touched the lows of $2.10 before stabilizing near the press time price of $2.20. Data now suggests that nearly half of the XRP supply sits in loss, indicating late buyers face a high risk. Fragile XRP Market Glassnode’s latest data shows that only 58.5% of XRP is currently in profit. This is the lowest level since November 2024, when the price was trading near $0.53. Despite XRP’s modest rebound near the current level, about 41.5% of the supply, which is roughly 26.5 billion tokens, remains underwater. The blockchain intelligence platform stated that this highlights a top-heavy market, with late buyers holding significant losses, as the market remains structurally fragile and vulnerable to sharp corrections. XRP’s price has remained largely unmoved despite a series of spot XRP ETF launches throughout November, offering US investors direct exposure to the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) native cryptocurrency. This includes Franklin Templeton’s EZRP, which debuted on November 18, followed by additional products from Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares, which are expected to roll out between November 19 and 22 on the Nasdaq Global Market. According to SoSoValue, Canary Capital’s XRPC, which is the first spot XRP ETF launched last week, has attracted almost $270 million in cumulative flows, with its Monday inflows being $25.41 million. Even so, the heightened interest has done little to shift the underlying crypto asset’s market trajectory. The asset is down 40% since hitting its all-time high of $3.65 in July this year. Crypto Searches Slump Zooming out, public interest in the crypto market as a whole has slipped to its lowest level since June, according to Google search trends by crypto analytics firm, Alphractal. As Bitcoin, XRP, and other crypto prices decline, people quickly lose motivation, which is evident in the searches for exchanges, altcoins, and market trends that have now dropped sharply. Alphractal explained that interest typically returns only when volatility picks up and prices start moving higher. Until then, attention remains subdued, even though such quiet phases often present strong opportunities for long-term investors.

Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest purchased $10 million in Bullish shares amid a crypto stock sell-off, while El Salvador defied IMF guidance with a fresh $100 million Bitcoin buy. These moves highlight growing long-term conviction despite short-term market weakness. ARK Invest Snaps Up $10M in Bullish Shares Amid Crypto Stock Rout Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest made a bold move on Monday, buying $10.2 million worth of shares in Bullish (BLSH) as crypto-linked stocks plunged. The investment was spread across ARK’s flagship ETFs, ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF, after Bullish’s stock tumbled 4.5% to $36.75, extending a six-month slide of nearly 46%. The purchase came just a day before Bullish’s Q3 earnings report, where the exchange previously posted weaker revenue but stronger net profits. The timing signals ARK’s confidence in a potential recovery despite short-term volatility in the sector. While the sell-off reflects short-term investor caution, ARK’s aggressive buying hints at growing conviction that the worst may be over, and that Bitcoin’s stabilization could soon restore confidence across crypto markets. El Salvador Buys $100M in Bitcoin, Raising IMF Concerns In spite of having previously agreed with the IMF to restrict Bitcoin purchases as part of a $1.4 billion loan arrangement El Salvador has purchased 1,090 additional Bitcoin valued more than $100 million. The nation now has over 7,474 BTC up from 5,968 BTC in December 2024 according to government data. The most recent information contradicts the IMF’s earlier this year claim that El Salvador has not purchased any new Bitcoin since the loan arrangement. The government was requested by the IMF to lower risks by restricting BTC publicity and minimizing the public sector’s involvement in the Chivo wallet. The country’s following the agreement is now under scrutiny due to this abrupt and substantial acquisition. El Salvador’s large purchase bolsters long-term trust in Bitcoin. The news boosts hope and may help calm BTC during market falls even though it might not result in an instant price increase. Bitcoin Price Prediction: ABCD Pattern Targets $83,800 Before Relief Rally Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remains under heavy selling pressure, trading near $91,000 as a bearish ABCD pattern unfolds on the daily chart. This harmonic structure, known for its symmetry between price swings, points to a potential completion near $83,800 — a key demand zone that previously triggered major rebounds in early 2024. The “AB” leg’s drop from $115,200 to $99,000 now mirrors the ongoing “CD” leg, signaling that downside momentum may soon reach exhaustion. The 20-day EMA crossing below the 50-day EMA confirms short-term bearish control, while the RSI hovering around 30 shows oversold conditions — often a precursor to relief bounces. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns are also hinting at a shift. Long lower wicks suggest dip buyers are beginning to step in near support, testing sentiment as BTC nears its technical floor. If bulls defend the $83,800 zone, a rebound toward $96,000 and possibly $99,000 could follow, with the broken trendline acting as new resistance. However, failure to hold above $83,000 would expose Bitcoin to deeper losses toward $74,500 — aligning with the lower boundary of the broader accumulation range. For traders, confirmation is key: a bullish engulfing or hammer candle at the demand zone could mark the turning point. Despite the current weakness, Bitcoin’s structure still supports a broader recovery heading into 2026, with the ABCD pattern potentially signaling the final leg of this correction before the next upward phase.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin traded slightly higher in Asia on Wednesday after briefly sinking below $90,000 to a seven-month low, as traders tiptoed back into the market while a fragile risk mood kept a lid on conviction. The token has now given up all of this year’s gains and sits about 26% below its October peak above $126,000. It was last up nearly 2.3% at $92,361, after dropping to $89,286.75. Across the wider market, about $1.2 trillion in crypto value has evaporated over the past six weeks. Market participants pointed to a mix of fading confidence in future US rate cuts and a broader risk-off tone after a long rally in global equities. Crypto, one of the purest expressions of risk appetite, has borne the brunt of that shift. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $90,970, up 0.8% Ether : $3,036, up 0.7% XRP : $2.16, down 0.5% Total crypto market cap: $3.20 trillion, up 0.8% ETF Outflows Deepen Pressure As Asia Struggles For Direction US spot Bitcoin ETFs have also turned into a drag. Since Oct. 10, when equity markets slumped on worries over US-China tariff tensions, about $3.7b has exited US spot Bitcoin ETFs, Morningstar data shows, with $2.3b of that in November alone. Those outflows have compounded selling pressure and reduced the depth of dip buying. Asian stock markets offered little support. Investors in the region struggled for direction as a bout of nerves over stretched AI valuations kept them cautious ahead of earnings from chip giant Nvidia. The tech heavy Nasdaq fell 1.2% cent overnight, logging a second straight loss and leaving it more than 6% below a record set in late October. In early Asian trade, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered around flat. Japan’s Nikkei managed an unsteady 0.4% gain, while South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.8%, reflecting the same reluctance to add risk that is weighing on Bitcoin. Doubts are also growing over another US rate cut in December. Investors worry that President Donald Trump’s falling approval rating could spur more fiscal spending and potentially stoke inflation, a mix that would make aggressive easing less likely and keep financial conditions tight for longer. Panic Signals Emerge With Fear Gauge Flashing Extreme Readings In crypto, sentiment has flipped. The Fear and Greed index has moved into “extreme fear” territory. Ignacio Aguirre, CMO at Bitget, said this level is a classic capitulation phase that often signals an impending market bottom, fostering opportunities for strategic accumulation and long-term growth in the crypto ecosystem. He pointed to recent forced selling as evidence of that shakeout. “The $800 million in BTC liquidations underscores crypto’s sensitivity to leveraged positions, contrasting with the S&P 500’s modest pullback and resilience, which reflects a calibrated risk appetite where equities benefit from diversified economic stability while crypto navigates its unique volatility,” he said. The firm argues that the combination of extreme sentiment and heavy liquidations is clearing out speculative excess, setting the stage for a rebuilding phase with cleaner positioning and, potentially, stronger institutional participation ahead. Bitcoin’s Short-Term Tech Correlation May Fade, Analyst Says Opportunity Looms Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co founder of The Coin Bureau, said that “when tech sneezes, it’s natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold.” He tied the latest moves in Bitcoin to the wobble in high growth tech shares that have dominated this year’s equity rally. “But it’s worth remembering that this correlation shifts, and BTC has a lot more going for it than its link to tech stocks. If and when the AI bubble does burst, Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value will be able to shine. And then, BTC under $100,000 may well seem like a missed buying opportunity.” The post Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Climbs Back From Sub-$90K Drop While Stocks Struggle For Traction appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Kraken,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-19 05:20:49

If adopted, the United States would join a group of countries committed to implementing the tax standards set out in the global Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). IRS Could Soon Monitor Offshore Crypto Transactions The Trump administration may soon allow the IRS to access information about Americans’ offshore crypto accounts, enabling the agency to tax foreign holdings. The Treasury Department’s proposed “Broker Digital Transaction Reporting” rule aims to bring the U.S. into alignment with the international crypto tax reporting framework and could discourage Americans from shifting assets to offshore exchanges. If approved, the US would formally join the international CARF and grant the IRS access to Americans’ foreign crypto account data for potential tax enforcement. According to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website, the proposal made its way to the White House on Friday, and President Trump’s advisors will now review the recommendation. The recommendation comes after the White House issued a report in July 2025, outlining recommendations for how digital assets should be regulated. The report forms part of an executive order issued by President Trump establishing the Working Group on Digital Assets Markets. The Working Group was tasked with producing recommendations for a regulatory framework that could act as a guide for the digital asset industry. In the report, the Working Group emphasised the potential of digital assets and blockchain technologies to transform the U.S. financial system, stating: “The Working Group, as the author of this report, endorses the notion that digital assets and blockchain technologies can revolutionize not just America’s financial system, but systems of ownership and governance economy-wide.” The further added: ""American entrepreneurs who pioneer new industries using these technologies deserve both clarity on the policies that affect their efforts and praise for the progress they have made."" Despite the IRS not classifying the proposed rule as “economically significant,” it would require Americans to be far more rigorous in reporting taxable gains from offshore crypto exchanges. United States Encouraged to Join the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework The president’s Working Group encouraged the Treasury Department and the IRS to introduce rules that would bring the U.S. into the CARF. Established in 2022 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the CARF is expected to be rolled out globally by 2027. CARF is a global agreement under which participating countries automatically share information about their citizens’ crypto asset holdings to combat tax evasion. Members include major crypto hubs such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

US Will Move Once Others Buy BTC The debate over whether the United States should begin accumulating Bitcoin for a national reserve is intensifying, with several people in the crypto industry warning that the country risks falling behind other nations. Crypto entrepreneur Mike Alfred said on a podcast that was released Tuesday that the US government is unlikely to take any meaningful action until other countries make the first move. This suggests that external pressure will be the catalyst for the United States to start buying Bitcoin in earnest. According to Alfred, the government will only accelerate its plans “when there is enough pressure externally,” as Washington tends to respond quickly when it sees geopolitical competitors gaining an advantage. His comments come as people in the crypto industry call on the US to speed up the formation of its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which is a framework that was initiated by President Donald Trump earlier this year via executive order. The goal of the initiative is to accumulate BTC using budget-neutral mechanisms, though the structure of the program remains undefined. Alfred said the timeline for full implementation is still unclear, but he believes progress has already been made, and pointed out that just a few years ago it “seemed impossible that the government would even acknowledge Bitcoin before Trump.” A growing chorus of analysts and executives argue that delaying accumulation could leave the US at a strategic disadvantage. Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn said in September that there is a “strong chance” the government will announce this year that it is formally holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Meanwhile, Jan3 founder Samson Mow repeatedly pushed for the US to act quickly, and warned that it could be “front-run” by countries like Pakistan that are preparing their own Bitcoin acquisition plans. Alfred also reiterated his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value by predicting the asset will reach $1 million per coin by 2033. While this estimate is more conservative than forecasts from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Alfred said that by the time Bitcoin reaches that level, “almost every government will have some direct or indirect exposure” and the asset will be widely viewed as a strategic reserve instrument. As momentum builds globally for Bitcoin adoption at the state level, pressure is mounting on the US government to define its role. For now, industry experts suggest that Washington may wait for another nation to make the first big move. Digital UBI Debuts in Marshall Islands Outside the US, the Republic of the Marshall Islands took a major step toward integrating digital assets into public services with the launch of Lomalo, a government-issued digital wallet that is designed to distribute Universal Basic Income (UBI) to citizens. The initiative will use USDM1 — a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar — to provide residents with access to their UBI funds starting in late November. Citizens will be able to receive their payments through the Lomalo wallet, via physical checks, or through direct deposits, ensuring both traditional and modern financial rails are available. Finance minister David Paul said that adding a digital option strengthens the country’s financial infrastructure and helps ensure that “no community is left behind.” The Marshall Islands joins other Pacific nations exploring blockchain-powered financial tools, following programs like Palau’s stablecoin pilot for government workers and the Solomon Islands’ Bokolo Cash, which supports everyday peer-to-peer transactions and retail purchases in the capital, Honiara. Marshall Islands According to the government, only citizens enrolled in the UBI program can currently create a Lomalo wallet, though they can transfer funds to other registered users. The rollout is the nation’s latest effort to modernize its financial system, but it also follows a series of warnings from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has long urged the Marshall Islands to scale back or delay its digital asset ambitions, particularly its earlier central bank digital currency proposal known as SOV. In a 2023 notice, the IMF said plans for a “digital sovereign bond” carried significant risks that could not be mitigated due to the country’s limited institutional capacity. The organization also warned that expanding digital initiatives — including DAOs, recognized as legal entities by the Marshall Islands in 2022 — could result in macroeconomic and financial stability concerns. It added that deploying the untested USDM1 for a nationwide UBI program could have “adverse macro-fiscal and financial integrity implications,” and recommended a more targeted approach focusing on citizens most in need. (Source: Republic of the Marshall Islands ) Responding to the IMF’s concerns, Paul said the government is still in active discussions with the fund about both the UBI rollout and the use of USDM1. He explained that the digital sovereign bond is issued under New York law and backed 1:1 by short-term US Treasuries held in a bankruptcy-remote account with a qualified US custodian. He argued that the structure aligns with IMF-supported frameworks for collateralized sovereign obligations and was intentionally designed to mirror historical mechanisms like Brady bonds rather than resemble privately issued crypto tokens. Despite the warnings, the Marshall Islands is continuing down a path toward digital asset integration.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-19 05:30:00

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $90,960.03 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most substantial single-day declines in recent weeks. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop So Suddenly? Market analysts point to several factors behind this sharp Bitcoin price movement. First, increased selling pressure from institutional investors contributed to the decline. Second, regulatory uncertainties in key markets created additional volatility. The current Bitcoin price reflects these combined market forces, though the long-term outlook remains positive for many experts. What This Bitcoin Price Movement Means for Investors Understanding the implications of this Bitcoin price drop is crucial for every crypto investor. Here are the key points to consider: Short-term volatility is normal in cryptocurrency markets Historical data shows Bitcoin price often recovers after corrections This could present buying opportunities for long-term investors Market sentiment often shifts quickly around key price levels How to Navigate Current Bitcoin Price Volatility When facing significant Bitcoin price movements, experienced traders recommend several strategies. Dollar-cost averaging helps mitigate timing risks during volatile periods. Setting clear entry and exit points prevents emotional decision-making. Monitoring trading volume provides additional context about the sustainability of price movements. Looking Beyond the Current Bitcoin Price Dip While the current Bitcoin price decline may concern some investors, market fundamentals remain strong. Adoption continues growing globally, with more institutions adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Technological developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem also progress steadily, supporting long-term value propositions. The recent Bitcoin price movement below $91,000 serves as a reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. However, seasoned investors understand that such corrections often create opportunities. The key is maintaining perspective and sticking to well-researched investment strategies rather than reacting to short-term price fluctuations. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to drop below $91,000? The Bitcoin price decline resulted from combined factors including institutional selling, regulatory concerns, and typical market correction patterns after recent gains. Should I buy Bitcoin at current prices? Investment decisions depend on your risk tolerance and strategy. Many analysts view price dips as potential entry points, but always conduct personal research first. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, key support levels to watch include $88,000 and $85,000 based on historical trading patterns and market structure. Is this the end of the Bitcoin bull market? Most analysts consider this a healthy correction within a broader upward trend rather than a market reversal, based on fundamental indicators. What’s the best strategy during Bitcoin price volatility? Dollar-cost averaging, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining a long-term perspective typically work better than trying to time the market perfectly. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin price movements often influence the broader crypto market, with many altcoins experiencing correlated price action during significant BTC moves. Found this analysis helpful?

Institutional adoption accelerated as the SEC approved generic crypto ETF listings and Europe and the UK normalized access, transforming digital assets from speculation to portfolio allocation. Stablecoins emerged as powerful instruments, and tokenized money markets gained traction, cementing crypto’s role as infrastructure for modern financial utility across global markets. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA, Ryan Louvar and Dovile Silenskyte By any reasonable standard, 2025 has been the most important year for digital-asset policy since Bitcoin's genesis block. For years, crypto investors operated in the twilight zone between regulatory indifference and selective enforcement. That era is ending. Across Washington, London and Brussels, policy makers are converging on something the industry has never really had: rules that can scale. The Clarity Act, 1 the Genius Act 2 and a new tone at the Securities and Exchange Commission 3 (SEC) have replaced the improvisational hostility of prior years with something far more consequential: predictable governance. And predictability, in markets, is a form of oxygen. Policy as Catalyst The Clarity Act began as a technical debate, an effort to draw a jurisdictional map between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). But in practice, it represents the first genuine attempt at a federal framework for digital assets. It classifies tokens, sets registration pathways and attempts to end a decade of turf wars. It even folds in provisions on central bank digital currencies, reflecting political anxiety that a state-issued token could one day crowd out the private sector. 4 The bill's trajectory has been messy. It sailed through the House with bipartisan support, stalled in the Senate Banking and Agriculture committees and was derailed by a government shutdown. Realistically, 2026 looks like the earliest date for passage. But markets trade on direction, not perfection, and the direction has clearly changed. In parallel came the Genius Act, which standardized the treatment of U.S. stablecoins and was signed into law. The law confines backing assets to short-duration Treasuries, repurchase agreements and SEC-registered money market funds investing in such assets and explicitly bars issuers from paying yield, closing the door on the most aggressive forms of ""stablecoin carry trade."" Yet the Act left a backdoor open: intermediaries such as exchanges may still pay yield or rewards on the coins they custody. 5 That loophole is likely to be the next policy front line, because it pits banks, who see a flight of deposits, against platforms that can pass Treasury yields through to their users almost frictionlessly. The outcome will determine whether stablecoins evolve into regulated yield-bearing cash or remain payment tokens. Either way, the U.S. has accepted that dollar-denominated stablecoins are here to stay. The debate has shifted from whether to how. The Institutional Turn The most underappreciated policy change of 2025 may be procedural, not legislative. The SEC's approval of generic listing standards for digital-asset exchange-traded products finally removed a decade-long bottleneck. It means that multi-asset or ""basket"" crypto ETFs can now list without bespoke approvals. Roughly a dozen assets qualify under the new template. 6 That simple rule change ends the one-off discretion that plagued prior applications. It also opens the door to broader indexes that could mirror the market-cap composition of the crypto universe. In other words, investors will soon be able to own digital assets the same way they own equities, bonds or commodities: through standardized, regulated wrappers. From Enforcement to Innovation Policy isn't just being written; it's being re-administered. The SEC's new leadership has rebranded its posture from enforcement to innovation. 7 The agencies have created a crypto task force staffed by veterans of both camps, including Mike Selig, now nominated to chair the CFTC. 8 The tone is pragmatic: invite issuers in early, identify friction points and adjust rules iteratively rather than through litigation. That cultural shift is subtle but revolutionary. In the previous cycle, engaging the regulator was a reputational risk; today, it's a requirement for institutional capital. Regulation by enforcement froze experimentation. Regulation by dialogue channels it. Europe's Running Start and the UK Catch-Up Crypto exchange-traded products have traded on European bourses for more than five years, giving the continent a functioning playbook for custody, audits and investor disclosure. 9 The UK's Financial Conduct Authority finally joined the mainstream in 2025 by allowing UK retail investors to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs that are listed on the London Stock Exchange and, crucially, hold them inside tax-advantaged ISA 10 accounts. 11 The rules are not laissez-faire. Retail investors must complete a comprehension exam, acknowledge risk disclosures and observe a 24-hour ""cool-off"" period before purchasing. 12 But that is precisely the point: regulation that feels procedural rather than punitive. The UK has turned crypto from a prohibited asset into a supervised one. Across Europe, investors are already treating digital assets as another building block of diversified portfolios. The standard approach begins with a broad crypto basket, a market-cap-weighted capped exposure to the largest coins, and then adds tilts toward specific narratives: Ethereum for tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure, Solana for retail-facing ecosystems or XRP and Stellar Lumens for cross-border settlement. This structure echoes traditional asset allocation logic: use a beta vehicle for exposure, apply alpha tilts where conviction exists. It's no longer speculation; it's portfolio construction. Stablecoins and the Yield Discussion The most powerful force in digital finance remains the same one that moves all finance: yield differentials. Stablecoins have quietly become high-efficiency wrappers around Treasury bills. That reality explains both the political heat and the innovation energy around the sector. Banks see stablecoins as unauthorized money-market funds that might siphon deposits. Legislators see them as new channels for monetary transmission. Technologists see them as programmable payment rails. The next evolutionary step is being realized via tokenized money market funds, regulated vehicles whose shares circulate on-chain, combining the yield of Treasuries with the settlement speed of crypto. Money market funds may be the tip of the iceberg for tokenization, though, as the combination of investor access to real-world assets combined with the benefits of blockchain, such as quicker settlement speed, provides a compelling combination for asset issuers and investors alike. Utility, Geography and the Two Worlds of Crypto The conversation about ""use cases"" has matured. Bitcoin functions as digital gold: a non-sovereign store of value, macro hedge and portfolio diversifier. But the growth frontier lies elsewhere. In emerging markets, XRP facilitates institutional cross-border payments, while Stellar Lumens (XLM) targets remittances for the unbanked. These tokens act as bridge currencies between local denominations, and Stellar even allows collapsing multi-step FX chains into single-step transfers and cutting transaction costs in half. For someone wiring money from one frontier economy to another, that efficiency is not a novelty; it's survival. In the developed world, the utility conversation centers on tokenization: moving Treasuries, money-market instruments and real-world assets onto programmable ledgers. Ethereum dominates that domain. As stablecoin supply scales toward multi-trillion levels by 2030, the underlying blockchains, primarily Ethereum and its roll-ups, capture the transaction volume and fee base. Different geographies, different motivations, one shared trend: crypto has become the infrastructure for money in motion. Gold, Dollars and the Meaning of ""Stable"" A lingering curiosity in 2025 is the rise of gold-backed stablecoins. Conceptually elegant, practically limited. Gold may hedge inflation risks, but it is not stable against the unit in which most liabilities are denominated: the dollar. The Genius Act's dollar-Treasury architecture reinforces that reality. Still, the experiment matters. In a world of fragmented trust, alternative anchors will attract interest. The question is not whether a gold-backed coin can exist - it can - but whether its volatility relative to consumer obligations makes it useful as a medium of exchange. For now, the market's verdict is clear: more than 99% of stablecoins remain dollar-based. 13 Stability, in practice, still means green paper and Treasury bills. The New Allocation Logic If 2020–2024 were the proof-of-concept years for crypto regulation, 2025 is the institutional onboarding year. Global crypto market capitalization sits near $4 trillion, 14 large enough that asset allocators must now decide whether ignoring it is defensible. Looking Ahead If 2025 is the year of clarity, 2026 will be the year of implementation. Investors who once viewed regulation as a headwind are beginning to see it as distribution. The analogy is apt: in equities, disclosure rules enabled mass ownership; in bonds, ratings and indexes enabled scale. Digital assets are approaching that same type of threshold. Clarity, it turns out, is not the end of the crypto story; it's the beginning of its institutional chapter. Source: F.

Important Risks Related to this Article Crypto assets, such as bitcoin and ether, are complex, generally exhibit extreme price volatility and unpredictability and should be viewed as highly speculative assets. Crypto assets are frequently referred to as crypto “currencies,” but they typically operate without central authority or banks, are not backed by any government or issuing entity (i.e., no right of recourse), have no government or insurance protections, are not legal tender and have limited or no usability as compared to fiat currencies. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use, transfer, exchange and value of crypto assets, and regulation in the U.S. and worldwide is still developing. Crypto asset exchanges and/or settlement facilities may stop operating, permanently shut down or experience issues due to security breaches, fraud, insolvency, market manipulation, market surveillance, KYC/AML (know your customer/anti-money laundering) procedures, noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations, technical glitches, hackers, malware or other reasons, which could negatively impact the price of any cryptocurrency traded on such exchanges or reliant on a settlement facility or otherwise may prevent access or use of the crypto asset. Crypto assets can experience unique events, such as forks or airdrops, which can impact the value and functionality of the crypto asset. Crypto asset transactions are generally irreversible, which means that a crypto asset may be unrecoverable in instances where: (i) it is sent to an incorrect address, (ii) the incorrect amount is sent or (iii) transactions are made fraudulently from an account. A crypto asset may decline in popularity, acceptance or use, thereby impairing its price, and the price of a crypto asset may also be impacted by the transactions of a small number of holders of such crypto asset. Crypto assets may be difficult to value, and valuations, even for the same crypto asset, may differ significantly by pricing source or otherwise be suspect due to market fragmentation, illiquidity, volatility and the potential for manipulation. Crypto assets generally rely on blockchain technology, and blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology that operates as a distributed ledger. Blockchain systems could be subject to internet connectivity disruptions, consensus failures or cybersecurity attacks, and the date or time that you initiate a transaction may be different than when it is recorded on the blockchain. Access to a given blockchain requires an individualized key, which, if compromised, could result in loss due to theft, destruction or inaccessibility. In addition, different crypto assets exhibit different characteristics, use cases and risk profiles.

This stunning development leaves many wondering about the future of large-scale institutional Ethereum investment strategies and what this means for the broader crypto market. Why Did the Ethereum Acquisition Project Get Suspended? According to reports from Wu Blockchain, the ambitious plan to create a dedicated firm for Ethereum acquisition has been completely halted. The project, which aimed to accumulate $1 billion worth of ETH, has returned all pledged capital to investors. This sudden suspension raises important questions about the challenges facing major cryptocurrency investment initiatives in today’s market environment. The decision to suspend this massive Ethereum acquisition endeavor comes at a time when institutional interest in cryptocurrency appears to be growing. However, the project’s termination suggests that even well-backed initiatives can face unexpected hurdles. The return of all committed funds indicates a clean break from the proposed investment strategy. What Challenges Face Large-Scale Ethereum Investment? Major cryptocurrency projects like this Ethereum acquisition firm often encounter several significant obstacles: Regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital asset investments Market volatility affecting long-term investment strategies Operational complexities of managing billion-dollar crypto portfolios Investor confidence fluctuations in the crypto space The suspension of this Ethereum acquisition project highlights how these challenges can impact even the most promising initiatives. Leon Li’s involvement had initially generated significant excitement, given his proven track record with Huobi exchange. How Does This Affect the Broader Crypto Market? When a major Ethereum acquisition project of this scale gets suspended, it sends ripples throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Institutional investors watch these developments closely, as they often signal broader market trends and investment appetite. The cancellation of this $1 billion Ethereum acquisition initiative may cause some investors to reconsider their exposure to digital assets. However, it’s important to remember that individual project outcomes don’t necessarily reflect the health of the entire cryptocurrency sector. The Ethereum network continues to operate normally, and many other investment vehicles remain active. What Can We Learn From This Suspension? This Ethereum acquisition project’s suspension teaches us several valuable lessons about cryptocurrency investing: Even experienced founders face challenges in executing large-scale crypto projects Proper due diligence remains crucial before committing to any investment The cryptocurrency market continues to mature and evolve rapidly Transparency in returning funds shows responsible project management The responsible handling of investor capital in this Ethereum acquisition project suspension demonstrates that the industry is developing more professional standards, even when projects don’t proceed as planned. Conclusion: Looking Beyond the Suspension While the suspension of this $1 billion Ethereum acquisition project is undoubtedly significant, it represents just one chapter in the ongoing story of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The crypto market has shown remarkable resilience through various challenges, and this development is unlikely to derail the broader trend toward digital asset integration. As the industry continues to mature, we can expect to see more sophisticated investment approaches and better risk management practices. The lessons learned from this Ethereum acquisition project suspension will likely inform future initiatives and contribute to a more stable, transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions Why was the Ethereum acquisition project suspended? The specific reasons haven’t been publicly disclosed, but the project led by Huobi founder Leon Li has been completely halted with all funds returned to investors. How much money was involved in this Ethereum acquisition project? The project aimed to raise $1 billion specifically for acquiring Ethereum, but all pledged capital has been returned following the suspension. Who was leading this Ethereum acquisition initiative? Leon Li, the founder of major cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, was leading the $1 billion Ethereum acquisition project. Will this suspension affect Ethereum’s price? While any major investment news can impact market sentiment, single project suspensions typically have limited long-term effects on established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Are there other similar Ethereum acquisition projects still active? Yes, numerous institutional investment vehicles and funds continue to operate in the cryptocurrency space, though specific details vary by project. Can investors get their money back after such suspensions? In this case, all pledged capital has been returned to investors, which demonstrates responsible project management despite the suspension.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Depositing To Exchanges At Loss As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, short-term holders (STHs) have just made another wave of underwater exchange deposits. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin Now In “Good Buy Zone,” Says Analytics Firm The STHs refer to the investors who purchased their Bitcoin during the past 155 days. This cohort is generally considered to include the weak hands of the market, who easily sell at the sight of market volatility. Recently, the market has been witnessing a bearish shift, which is exactly the type of event that STHs would be expected to react to. There are several ways to track the moves being made by these investors, with one such being the data of their exchange inflow transactions. Usually, the STHs transfer their coins to centralized exchanges when they are looking to sell, so a spike in exchange deposits from the group can be a sign of a selloff. During downtrends, loss selling is the most common type of distribution from the STHs due to the fact that their cost basis is at recent prices, which tend to be higher in bearish phases. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the 24-hour loss exchange inflows made by the STHs over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STHs made a large amount of loss deposits to exchanges when the cryptocurrency’s price crashed to $94,000 last week. The same appears to have followed during the latest downward move in the asset. In total, STHs have sent 65,200 underwater tokens to the exchanges over the last 24 hours. At the current exchange rate, this amount is worth a whopping $6.08 billion. This new wave of capitulation wave in the STHs came as BTC dropped toward $89,000. Interestingly, what has followed this FUD from the STHs has so far been a rebound for the asset. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has also shared data related to the STH capitulation in a new X post. Glassnode’s chart is for the amount of loss that the STHs as a whole are realizing through their transactions across the network. The 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) value of this metric is currently sitting at $427 million, which is the highest that it has been since November 2022, when the last bear market bottomed out.

The recent launch of Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF (XRPC) has quickly become one of those situations, prompting closer examination of how upcoming XRP-related institutional products may perform. A prominent crypto analyst, known as {x} (@unknowDLT), offered an estimate that has drawn renewed attention to the future of regulated XRP investment vehicles. Analyst Projects a Significant First-Day Inflow The analyst said the initial performance of XRPC as evidence that demand for an XRP exchange-traded product may be broader than projected. Based on this early response, the analyst stated that BlackRock’s forthcoming XRP ETF could attract approximately $2 billion in net inflows on its first day. While the number is substantial, the analyst argued that the distance between the performance potential of Canary Capital and a heavyweight issuer such as BlackRock may be smaller than many observers think. Another market participant, G C, expanded this perspective by suggesting that BlackRock may be allowing other spot products to establish their presence at current XRP valuations before introducing its own. This interpretation aligns with the tendency of major issuers to wait for precise conditions before launching new products. Strong Debut for Canary Capital’s XRPC According to a Times Tabloid report from November 13 , Canary Capital’s XRPC demonstrated notable momentum immediately after opening. Within its first 30 minutes of trading, the fund recorded over $916,000 in volume. For an ETF debut, this was a striking result that exceeded typical expectations and positioned XRPC as one of the most closely monitored launches of the year. The early performance signaled a level of investor readiness that has contributed to ongoing reassessments of the potential scale of demand for XRP-based products. Implications for Larger Institutional Issuers XRPC’s initial reception has become a key reference point for modeling the possible impact of a BlackRock-issued XRP ETF . If the early interest observed in Canary Capital’s offering reflects broader institutional and retail appetite, the possibility of a multibillion-dollar first-day inflow becomes a valid scenario. The emerging data and commentary surrounding these developments show how quickly expectations can evolve in the digital asset investment sector. As attention shifts toward the next major institutional moves, interest in regulated XRP investment products continues to grow, shaping new expectations for the market’s next stage.

Recent data reveals a fascinating trend that could signal important market movements ahead. Across the top three cryptocurrency exchanges by open interest, short positions are currently holding a slight but significant edge in Bitcoin perpetual futures trading. What Do Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Tell Us About Market Sentiment? The 24-hour long/short ratios for Bitcoin perpetual futures provide crucial insights into trader positioning. Currently, the aggregate data shows 48.06% long positions versus 51.94% short positions. This slight dominance of short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures suggests traders are becoming more cautious about immediate price appreciation. Understanding these Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios helps traders gauge market sentiment. When short positions outweigh longs, it often indicates expectations of potential price declines. However, the current margin is narrow, suggesting the market remains uncertain rather than overwhelmingly bearish. Breaking Down Exchange-Specific Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Data Let’s examine how different platforms are contributing to this trend in Bitcoin perpetual futures: Binance: 48.42% long / 51.58% short Bybit: 49.11% long / 50.89% short Gate.io: 48.59% long / 51.41% short Each exchange shows consistent patterns in their Bitcoin perpetual futures data. The uniformity across platforms strengthens the reliability of this short-dominated trend. Interestingly, Bybit shows the closest balance between long and short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures. Why Should You Care About Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Positioning? Bitcoin perpetual futures positioning serves as a valuable sentiment indicator. When shorts dominate, it can create potential buying opportunities if the market moves against these positions. However, traders should consider several factors when interpreting Bitcoin perpetual futures data: Market context and recent price action Overall trading volume and liquidity External market factors and news events Historical support and resistance levels The current Bitcoin perpetual futures data suggests traders are positioning cautiously. This could mean they expect some price consolidation or minor corrections in the near term. Actionable Insights From Current Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Trends What can you do with this information about Bitcoin perpetual futures? First, recognize that slight short dominance doesn’t guarantee price declines. Markets often move contrary to majority positioning. Second, monitor how these Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios evolve over time. Sharp changes can signal shifting sentiment.

Combine this information with technical analysis, fundamental factors, and risk management strategies for comprehensive trading decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? Bitcoin perpetual futures are derivative contracts that track Bitcoin’s price without an expiration date, allowing traders to speculate on price movements indefinitely. Why do short positions matter in Bitcoin perpetual futures? Short positions indicate traders expect price declines. When shorts dominate, it can signal bearish sentiment or create potential for short squeezes if prices rise instead. How often should I check Bitcoin perpetual futures data?

While not perfect predictors, they offer valuable sentiment indicators that, combined with other analysis, can improve trading decisions. What’s the difference between perpetual futures and regular futures? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets, unlike traditional futures with set settlement dates.

However, Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy remains unshaken even in the face of catastrophic drops. The MicroStrategy CEO recently revealed his company’s remarkable resilience plan that can withstand Bitcoin corrections of up to 90%. This bold approach comes as Bitcoin’s volatility shows consistent decline, signaling a maturing market that’s attracting serious institutional players. How Does This Bitcoin Strategy Actually Work? Michael Saylor’s confidence stems from careful planning and structural safeguards. During his Fox Business interview, he explained that MicroStrategy built its Bitcoin strategy with extreme market scenarios in mind. The company doesn’t just hope for the best; it prepares for the worst. This forward-thinking approach means they can maintain their position through even the most severe market downturns without compromising their long-term vision. The foundation of this robust Bitcoin strategy includes several key elements: Long-term holding perspective beyond short-term fluctuations Proper capital allocation that doesn’t risk core business operations Understanding Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition Structural safeguards against margin calls and forced liquidations Why Is Declining Volatility Crucial for Bitcoin’s Future? Saylor provided compelling data showing Bitcoin’s transformation from wild speculation to established asset class. When MicroStrategy began its Bitcoin strategy in 2020, annual volatility stood at approximately 80%. Today, that number has dropped to around 50%, representing significant market maturation. This decreasing volatility pattern creates a virtuous cycle. As Bitcoin becomes less volatile, more institutional investors feel comfortable allocating capital. This increased participation then further reduces volatility, creating stability that benefits all market participants. Saylor predicts this trend will continue, with volatility decreasing by about five percentage points every few years as market capitalization grows. What Makes This Approach Different From Other Investment Strategies? Unlike traditional investment approaches that might panic during corrections, Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy embraces volatility as part of the growth process. The key distinction lies in the unshakable belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value. Rather than reacting to price movements, the strategy focuses on Bitcoin’s underlying technology, network effects, and long-term adoption trajectory. This perspective allows MicroStrategy to maintain its position during downturns when weaker hands typically sell. The company views temporary price drops as opportunities rather than threats, understanding that Bitcoin’s historical performance shows strong recovery patterns after significant corrections. How Does Bitcoin Compare to Traditional Investments Long-Term? Saylor envisions a future where Bitcoin’s volatility and performance settle at about 1.5 times that of the S&P 500. This projection positions Bitcoin as a premium risk asset that offers higher potential returns than traditional stocks while maintaining manageable volatility levels. The evolving Bitcoin strategy recognizes that as adoption increases and market infrastructure improves, Bitcoin will naturally become less volatile. This maturation process mirrors what happened with other emerging asset classes throughout financial history, from early internet stocks to emerging market currencies. What Can Individual Investors Learn From This Approach? While individual investors may not have MicroStrategy’s resources, the core principles of Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy remain applicable. The most important lesson is developing a risk management framework that allows you to weather extreme market conditions without making emotional decisions. Key takeaways for individual investors include: Only invest what you can afford to lose completely Maintain a long-term perspective beyond daily price movements Understand Bitcoin’s fundamental value drivers Have a clear plan for different market scenarios Avoid leverage that could force premature selling Michael Saylor’s revelation about his crash-proof Bitcoin strategy provides valuable insights for both institutional and individual investors. The decreasing volatility combined with strategic planning creates a powerful combination that could redefine how serious investors approach cryptocurrency allocations. As Bitcoin continues maturing, this disciplined approach demonstrates how to participate in the digital asset revolution while managing extreme risk scenarios. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin volatility has decreased since 2020? Bitcoin’s annual volatility has dropped from approximately 80% in 2020 to about 50% today, representing significant market maturation according to Michael Saylor’s analysis. What percentage drop can MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy withstand? The company’s Bitcoin strategy is structured to withstand corrections of 80-90% without compromising their long-term position or business operations. Why is decreasing volatility important for Bitcoin?
