According to recent Bank of America reports, investors are rapidly reducing their short positions on the US dollar, creating ripple effects across global markets. Understanding the dollar positioning shift Bank of America’s latest analysis reveals significant changes in how institutional investors are approaching the US dollar. The current dollar positioning reflects a notable departure from recent trends, with hedge funds and large speculators scaling back their bearish bets. This shift in dollar positioning comes amid changing expectations about Federal Reserve policy and global economic conditions. Why investors reduce shorts now Several factors are driving why investors reduce shorts at this particular moment. The primary reasons include: Changing interest rate expectations Global economic uncertainty Technical market signals Risk management considerations When investors reduce shorts, it typically indicates a reassessment of market conditions and risk appetite. The current move suggests traders are becoming less confident about dollar weakness in the near term. Key insights from BofA reports The latest BofA reports provide crucial data points for understanding market sentiment. According to their analysis: Metric Previous Position Current Position Change Net Short Positions -$25.6B -$18.3B +$7.3B Long Positions $42.1B $48.9B +$6.8B Short Positions $67.7B $67.2B -$0.5B The BofA reports highlight that this isn’t just a minor adjustment but represents a meaningful change in market positioning. Impact on the broader forex market These positioning changes are creating significant waves throughout the forex market. Major currency pairs are experiencing increased volatility as market participants adjust their strategies. The forex market implications extend beyond just dollar pairs, affecting cross rates and emerging market currencies as well. What the currency outlook suggests The current currency outlook appears to be shifting toward dollar strength, at least in the short term. However, the longer-term currency outlook remains uncertain due to several competing factors: Diverging central bank policies Geopolitical tensions Inflation dynamics Growth differentials Actionable insights for traders For active traders and investors, these developments offer several important considerations. Monitoring dollar positioning changes can provide early signals about market direction. The fact that investors reduce shorts suggests caution may be warranted for those betting on continued dollar weakness. FAQs What does Bank of America track in their currency reports? Bank of America (BofA) monitors futures positions, options activity, and cash market flows to assess market positioning. How often do these positioning reports come out? Major banks including Bank of America typically provide weekly updates on futures positioning and monthly deeper analysis. What other institutions provide similar analysis? Other major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase also publish regular currency positioning analysis. How reliable are these positioning indicators? While not perfect predictors, positioning data from sources like Bank of America provide valuable context about market sentiment extremes. The dramatic shift in dollar positioning represents a crucial moment for currency markets. As investors reduce shorts and reassess their outlook, the implications could extend far beyond traditional forex trading into cryptocurrency markets and global risk assets. This repositioning suggests markets are entering a new phase where dollar strength may surprise many participants.

According to the latest report from Sky News on the matter, the agreement is set to be announced formally next week. Curve told its shareholders in recent days that it had signed a share sale and purchase contract with Lloyds, which could see the UK’s largest high street bank make its most significant step into digital payments yet. Yet, according to insiders’ understanding, the purchase has sparked a dispute among some of Curve’s top shareholders, who believe the valuation is significantly below what the platform is truly worth. Curve acquisition by UK bank not in the clear yet According to anonymous sources, the company, boasting over six million users, could exhaust its cash reserves this year if a buyer is not secured. In early September, Chief Executive Shachar Bialick admitted that Lloyds Banking Group offered a valuation that was low compared to its previous fundraising rounds, but insisted that Curve needs to secure its future regardless of the sale. Curve has raised more than £250 million ($289 million) since its launch, including a £37 million ($42.8 million) funding round that took place in March this year, led by Hanco Ventures. We see issuers looking to enter the market, and networks introducing innovative products such as Visa Flex and MasterCard One Credentials. This investment would allow us to invest further in our customer experience, bring new partnerships, and accelerate our path to profitability. Shachar Bialick. The current deal values the business at a fraction of those investments, a gap that has been blasted by Curve’s shareholders, now seeking legal means to stop its sale. IDC Ventures threatens Curve and Lloyds Banking Group Sky News reported that Curve’s early shareholders, including IDC Ventures, the company’s largest external investor with a 12% holding, have publicly rejected the deal and are threatening legal action. IDC Ventures issued a statement saying it is deeply worried about how Curve’s management and board handled the sale talks. A company spokesperson told Sky that governance issues and ownership questions were unresolved at the time of the agreement, and argued that the transaction was not in the company’s best interests. It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. IDC does not intend to support the proposed sale and does not believe that it is capable of being implemented without its support. IDC Curve, in its message to shareholders, acknowledged the disappointment around the valuation, adding that the offer failed to meet the expectations set beforehand. We recognise that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve, and we share the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome. Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve’s creditors and shareholders as a whole. Curve. IDC Ventures said last Friday it would defend its commercial interests and asked both Curve and Lloyds to address its concerns before moving ahead with the acquisition . Curve wallet is facing internal leadership and governance issues In July, IDC Ventures attempted to remove Lord Stanley Fink, the former Conservative Party treasurer and a high-profile City figure, from his position as chair of Curve. The fund propounded that the appointing shareholder had already removed him, only for the board to reinstall him two days later. During Curve’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in early October, opponents failed to remove both Fink and chief executive Bialick through a shareholder vote. IDC Ventures, represented by the London-based law firm Quinn Emanuel, has been involved with Curve for six years and has participated in several major funding rounds. In a statement shared with Sky News last month, the investor said it was troubled by the reappointment of Fink and by the lack of transparency around the board’s handling of the sale process.

Bitcoin’s price action has hovered in the mid-$90,000 range since the drop, but the past 24 hours have been highlighted by a break below $90,000. In the middle of this bearish volatility, a new technical outlook from Tony “The Bull” Severino suggests that Bitcoin’s next move may be more bullish than the recent weakness implies. A Death Cross Forms During The Bitcoin Price Downtrend Tony’s analysis highlights the developing death cross on the daily timeframe, where the 50-day moving average is now bending down toward the 200-day moving average. The pattern is generally viewed as bearish, but the placement of the moving averages and the slope of the short-term line show something different unfolding on Bitcoin’s chart. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Crashing Again, Can It Breach $3,000? The green 50-day average has been gradually drifting lower after weeks of fading momentum, and the red 200-day average has begun flattening out from the long-term uptrend. As shown on the chart below, this death cross has formed around $110,000, and according to the analyst, Bitcoin might pump into this price level next week. The reason a pump remains possible at this stage is tied directly to how moving averages behave. After the breakdown beneath $100,000, Bitcoin found support just below $92,000 and has since been forming a series of smaller-bodied candles that reflect the early stages of a potential reversal. If buyers take control, a fast move toward the region between $103,000 and $110,000 becomes realistic. However, price action in the past 24 hours, which has seen Bitcoin break below $90,000, threatens this bullish outlook. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: @TonyTheBullCMT On X The Path To $110,000 This Week For Bitcoin to reach $110,000 in the coming days, the market would need to replay a pattern seen several times in past cycles: a strong relief rally just before or immediately after a death cross forms. These rallies happen because sentiment becomes overly pessimistic at the exact moment when shorts begin to pile in, leaving the price vulnerable to a sharp upside reaction. However, for that scenario to unfold now, Bitcoin would first need to push convincingly back above $90,000 and show that momentum is shifting away from the recent sell-off. Related Reading: This Analyst Called The Bitcoin Crash Below $20,000 In 2021, He’s Back With A Shocking Prediction For Solana Interestingly, other analysts have pointed to bullish primers for Bitcoin, despite the bearish price action. One such case is the Bitcoin SSR RSI, which was highlighted by a CryptoQuant community analyst called Maartunn, that shows rising stablecoin buying power relative to Bitcoin’s market cap. On the other hand, a bearish indicator has risen up with the SuperTrend indicator, which proposes a further 67% drop in the price of Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,760, down by 5.8% in the past 24 hours.

Fewer than 1.05 million BTC are left to be mined, and issuance will slow sharply as the network advances through future halvings. Permanently Lost and Unspendable BTC A portion of Bitcoin’s supply can never re-enter circulation. Roughly 230 BTC are unspendable due to the genesis block subsidy and early invalid scripts. Additional coins are believed lost through forgotten or unrecoverable private keys, further tightening the effective supply. How Bitcoin’s Halvings Cut Issuance Bitcoin’s supply halves every 210,000 blocks. The most recent halving on April 20, 2024, reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, lowering daily issuance from 900 BTC to about 450 BTC. Earlier halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 brought the subsidy down from 50 BTC to its current level, pushing annualized supply growth below 1%. The next halving is estimated for April 2028, and the final fractions of Bitcoin are expected to be mined around 2140. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Price Pullback Aligns With Technical Weakness Despite a tightening supply, price action has weakened. Bitcoin has fallen toward the mid-$80,000s, breaking below a long-term ascending trendline that supported most of the 2024 advance. BTC now trades under both the 20-EMA and 50-EMA on the daily chart, reinforcing bearish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart also reflects a completed ABCD pattern near the $115,000 high and a breakdown from a rising wedge, both common precursors to broader corrections. Price is approaching the $83,800–$74,500 demand zone, an area that previously generated strong buying interest. RSI near 28 shows oversold conditions, although a clear bullish divergence has not yet formed. TradingView’s projected path suggests BTC may drift slightly lower before forming a stabilization pattern within the demand zone. A hammer or bullish engulfing candle would signal buyer re-entry. Levels to Watch in the Weeks Ahead A recovery above $96,000 would be the first sign of stabilization. A move through $100,700 could open the way to a retest of $115,200, provided sentiment improves. Failure to hold the demand area would expose $74,500 as the next key level. For traders, current conditions resemble the early phase of an accumulation zone. If BTC reclaims its short-term EMAs and confirms support, the next rally could extend to major altcoins, including ETH, SOL, and XRP. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed.

However, it’s important to note that such investments come with both opportunities and challenges that require careful consideration.

Tether’s strategic investment in Ledn represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin lending services. Both companies share a common vision: creating robust financial infrastructure that allows users to unlock liquidity while maintaining their Bitcoin positions. This approach addresses one of the biggest challenges facing long-term crypto holders – how to access funds without sacrificing potential future gains from their digital assets. The collaboration brings together Tether’s massive stablecoin ecosystem with Ledn’s established Bitcoin lending platform. While the exact investment amount remains confidential, the strategic nature suggests deep integration and shared goals. This partnership could potentially transform how millions of cryptocurrency users interact with their digital wealth. How Does Bitcoin Lending Work in Practice? Bitcoin lending platforms like Ledn provide essential financial services that traditional banks often overlook. Here’s how the process typically works: Users deposit Bitcoin as collateral The platform provides loans in stablecoins or fiat currency Borrowers maintain ownership of their Bitcoin Interest rates are typically lower than traditional alternatives This system creates a win-win situation where investors can access liquidity for personal or business needs while their Bitcoin continues to appreciate in value. The Tether-Ledn partnership strengthens this ecosystem by combining expertise and resources from two industry leaders. Why Is This Strategic Investment So Important for Crypto Adoption?

Many potential investors hesitate to allocate significant funds to Bitcoin because they fear locking up capital that might be needed for emergencies or opportunities. Bitcoin lending solutions eliminate this concern by providing flexible access to liquidity. Moreover, this partnership demonstrates growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrency infrastructure. When major players like Tether invest in Bitcoin lending platforms, it signals maturity and stability in the sector. This validation could encourage more traditional investors to explore cryptocurrency opportunities. What Challenges Does Bitcoin Lending Face? Despite the exciting potential, Bitcoin lending still faces several hurdles that the Tether-Ledn partnership aims to address: Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions Market volatility affecting collateral values Security concerns around digital asset storage User education about responsible borrowing practices The combined expertise of both companies positions them well to navigate these challenges. Tether’s experience with regulatory compliance and Ledn’s proven track record in secure Bitcoin lending create a formidable alliance. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Lending? This strategic investment could catalyze significant innovation in the Bitcoin lending space. We might see new products and services emerge, such as: More flexible loan terms and conditions Integration with traditional financial services Enhanced risk management tools Global expansion of accessible lending markets The partnership represents a crucial step toward building comprehensive financial ecosystems around digital assets. As more users recognize the benefits of Bitcoin lending without selling, we can expect accelerated growth and innovation in this sector. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin lending? Bitcoin lending allows cryptocurrency holders to use their Bitcoin as collateral to secure loans without selling their digital assets, providing access to liquidity while maintaining investment exposure. How does Tether’s investment benefit Ledn users? Tether’s investment brings additional resources, stability, and industry expertise to Ledn, potentially leading to better services, improved security, and expanded lending options for users. Is Bitcoin lending safe? While all cryptocurrency activities carry some risk, established platforms like Ledn implement robust security measures.

In the past 24 hours, it sank below $90K. Despite its struggles, Bitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency. While its transaction speeds are notoriously slow and expensive, Layer-2 projects have cropped up to solve this. Bitcoin Hyper is the first Bitcoin Layer-2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine for high-speed transactions. Its presale has shown massive momentum, raising over $27.8M and attracting significant whale investment. It’s been a tough several months for Bitcoin ($BTC). Just last month, it reached an ATH of $126K, leading many traders to believe that it would continue to go up from there. And yet the market shared a collective sigh as Bitcoin dropped below $90K in the last 24 hours, a level that would’ve been close to unthinkable in October. Despite that, Bitcoin remains the most valuable cryptocurrency in the market. Because of this, it’s also easy to overlook the fact that it isn’t perfect at all. Bitcoin’s core limitations are well-known: slow transactions, high fees, and a lack of smart contract functionality. While its security is unmatched, its utility has been constrained, pushing developers and decentralized applications to other, more flexible blockchains. This has created a massive opportunity for solutions that can expand Bitcoin’s capabilities without compromising its foundational strength. The race to build effective Bitcoin Layer-2 networks is heating up, and this is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. Bitcoin Hyper Unlocks DeFi on Bitcoin with Solana-Like Speed Transactions Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the first-ever Bitcoin Layer-2 solution that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . This innovative approach aims to solve Bitcoin’s scalability problem by bringing the high-speed, low-cost transaction processing of the Solana ecosystem directly to Bitcoin. By creating a modular blockchain that uses Bitcoin for settlement and a real-time SVM layer for execution, it promises to deliver performance that could even surpass Solana itself. Unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the SVM is renowned for its parallel transaction processing capabilities. This allows it to handle thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of other networks. This architecture is designed to finally enable a robust ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and complex dApps on Bitcoin, backed by its unparalleled security and liquidity. The market has responded with overwhelming enthusiasm, signaling strong belief in the project’s vision. Read our detailed Bitcoin Hyper review for a full lowdown on the project. By building a Layer-2 on top of Bitcoin that uses this engine, Bitcoin Hyper effectively bypasses Bitcoin’s native limitations. It creates an execution environment where developers can build sophisticated applications in Rust, a language known for safety and performance. This opens the door for a wave of new use cases previously impossible on Bitcoin. Imagine high-frequency trading, decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and NFT marketplaces operating with the speed of Solana but settling on the trust-minimized Bitcoin blockchain. The platform provides a Canonical Bridge for seamless $BTC transfers, ensuring liquidity can flow easily between the layers. This combination of speed, low fees, and security is what makes the Bitcoin Hyper proposition so powerful. $HYPER Presale Surges Past $27M as Whales Take Notice When the L2 launches, its native $HYPER tokens will power it. While you can use it to pay for transaction fees, holding it will also give you governance rights and access to exclusive features. Right now, you buy get these tokens via the official Bitcoin Hyper presale website . The market’s response to the project has been nothing short of explosive. The project’s presale has soared, raising an impressive $27.8M, with the $HYPER token currently priced at just $0.013295. It’s easy to get your share of $HYPER tokens. Check out our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper for more details. This powerful momentum indicates strong investor confidence in its mission to scale Bitcoin. Adding to the bullish sentiment, on-chain data shows significant interest from major players. A recent whale buy just north of $500K worth of tokens is the strongest proof yet of the attention it is getting. This smart money movement suggests that high-net-worth investors are recognizing the project’s long-term potential. The Bitcoin Hyper price is expected to climb as the presale progresses, rewarding early participants. Beyond the initial offering, the project incentivizes long-term holding through a robust staking program. You can stake your tokens immediately and enjoy 41% APY, although this can still change as more holders lock their tokens in the staking pool. With just a day before the next price increase, now’s the time to get your hands on tokens at a discounted price. Ready to jump in? Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

The company is more than well positioned to monetize their ambitious ""target of 250–500 MW critical IT load of new HPC lease signings annually,"" thanks to the growing HPC capacity. WULF's projected NOI margin of over ~70% is extremely impressive as well, compared to other data center REITs, with it implying its robust top/ bottom-line growth prospects. The meltdown has already triggered WULF's cheaper FY2027 EV/Sales valuations of ~4.44x, nearer to its hyperscaler/neocloud peers while triggering an improved margin of safety. With the bright long-term prospects outweighing the near-term noise surrounding the recent moderation in BTC spot prices, I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock. I previously covered TeraWulf Inc (NASDAQ: WULF ) in October 2025, discussing how its timely transition to HPC opportunities had been backed by the insatiable cloud demand and the higher data center-related capex trends. Combined with the strategic leveraging of its existing bitcoin mining infrastructure for HPC purposes, the strategic financing from Alphabet ( GOOG ), and the cheap FY2027 valuations, I had initiated my Buy rating upon a moderate retracement to the 50/100-day moving averages for a lower dollar cost average then. In this article, I shall discuss why I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock as it finally nears my Buy Zones, thanks to its robust AI monetization opportunities arising from the multi-year contracted backlog and the growing HPC capacity. I am of the opinion that its bright long-term prospects far outweigh the near-term headwinds arising from the higher debt reliance and the volatile Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) spot prices as well. WULF Reports Robust AI Monetization WULF 1Y Stock Price Trading View Since my last article, the early Q3'25 earnings season has finally brought forth "" stock valuation fears ,"" with it triggering notable corrections across the AI value chain and WULF similarly pulling back by -35.5% since the 52 week heights. This development was also why I previously urged readers to wait before adding, preferably after a moderate retracement to the 50/100-day moving averages, thanks to the potential volatility and capital losses arising from chasing overpriced stocks during an exuberant AI hype. This is especially since WULF is mostly a bitcoin miner, with the FQ3'25 digital asset revenues of $43.37M ( -8.9% QoQ /+60.3% YoY) comprising 85.7% of its overall revenues (-14.3 points QoQ/YoY). Thanks to the higher average BTC spot prices of $114.47K in Q3'25 (+15.9% QoQ/+87.5% YoY) along with the expanding mining capacity of 245 MW ( inline QoQ / +25.6% YoY ), it is unsurprising that the company has proved itself as a beneficiary of the cryptocurrency boom, as demand for alternative assets grow and the de-dollarization trends continue . WULF's Robust HPC Opportunities WULF Otherwise, while nascent, WULF has reported robust HPC lease revenues of $7.2M (NA QoQ/NA YoY), with further growth likely, based on the Lake Mariner Campus HPC leasing capacity of 22.5 MW in FQ3'25 along with the planned expansion to 522.5 MW through 2026 and up to 750 MW in maximum capacity . This is on top of the upcoming HPC leasing capacity of 168 MW in Abernathy from H2'26 onwards and 400 MW in Cayuga, New York from 2027 onwards, which naturally lend credence to the management's aggressive guidance of ~1.5 GW in critical IT load capacity over the next few years and the ambitious growth ""target of 250–500 MW critical IT load of new HPC lease signings annually."" These may allow WULF to report robust top-line growth prospects moving forward, allowing them to monetize their 100% pre-leased contracted backlog of 510 MW at favorable rates, based on the overall contracted revenues of $17.2B across: the 60 MW - Core42 lease, with projected NOI margin of 85%, the 366 MW - Fluidstack lease, with projected NOI margin of 85%, and the 168 MW - Fluidstack lease, with projected NOI margin of 70%. These profit margins are impressive as well, compared to numerous data center REITs, including Equinix ( EQIX ) at over ~60% over the LTM and Digital Realty Trust ( DLR ) at ~50%, allowing them to deliver highly profitable margins ahead. The Conse nsus Forward Estimates Seeking Alpha As a result of the robust insights offered by the contracted backlog and the projected expansion in its capacity, I can understand why the consensus forward estimates appear rather promising, with WULF expected to report an accelerated top-line growth at a CAGR of +99.7% through FY2027. On the other hand, given the supposed 2Y+ time lag between the typical booking and the revenue recognition arising from the tight supply environment, I am of the opinion that WULF is likely to intensify their debt reliance in the mean time, with it likely to trigger its mixed near-term prospects before things drastically lift once its HPC capacity is ramped up and its multi-year backlog is monetized. For reference, WULF has already reported numerous financing activities across the $3.2B from GOOG and the $2B in Convertible Notes 2030/2031 (pre-FQ3'25 earnings call) along with the new $3.2B in Convertible Notes 2030 (post FQ3'25 earnings call) and the new $1.02B in Convertible Notes 2032. The elevated HPC ramping up costs/higher interest expenses may also be why WULF continues to report negative net income performances, despite the growing adj EBITDA profitability by +203% YoY in FQ3'25. A similar trend has been observed in numerous neoclouds/hyperscalers in the recent Q3'25 earnings season, with it signaling the hefty and bottom-line/cash flow dilutive capex trends during the multi-year AI boom. WULF Is An Even Better Buy After The Correction WULF 5Y Stock Price Trading View Thanks to the market-wide AI-related meltdown, WULF has already lost part of its recent Q4'25 gains to retest the prior support levels of $10s ranges, with it also bringing the stock nearer to the prior Buy Zone discussed in my last article. WULF Valuations Seeking Alpha On the one hand, given the nascency of its HPC leasing opportunities, WULF may appear to be somewhat expensive at FWD EV/Sales valuations of 27.43x, compared to the sector median of 3.40x and its peers, including: hyperscaler - Amazon ( AMZN ) at FWD EV/Sales valuations of 3.60x, hyperscaler - Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) at 8.21x, hyperscaler - Microsoft ( MSFT ) at 11.66x, neocloud - DigitalOcean ( DOCN ) at 6.21x, neocloud - CoreWeave ( CRWV ) at 10.78x, neocloud - Nebius ( NBIS ) at 36.85x, and Bitcoin miner turned HPC provider - Core Scientific ( CORZ ) at 14.19x. On the other hand, with much of its capacity expected to be ramped up over the next few years, I am of the opinion that WULF appears rather compelling at my estimated FY2027 EV/Sales valuations of 4.44x, based on the current Enterprise Value of $4.98B and the consensus FY2027 revenue estimates of $1.12B. This is especially since WULF benefits from the firm multi-year backlog and the growing HPC compute capacity, albeit with lumpy near-term performance arising from the recent moderation in BTC spot prices. With the bright long-term prospects far outweighing the near-term noise, I am reiterating my Buy rating for the WULF stock.",WULF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-18 13:53:07
54571944,629527,1763474428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54571944.jpeg,"Crypto Market Is Structurally Rigged, Warns Wintermute CEO",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-structurally-rigged-wintermute-ceo/,"A fresh bout of soul-searching has gripped the crypto derivatives industry as leading market participants argue that the market’s structure is fundamentally flawed – not just unlucky. Wintermute founder and CEO Evgeny Gaevoy set the tone on X, arguing that the core problem is not perpetual futures themselves but the way key venues are architected. Posting under his handle @EvgenyGaevoy (wishful_cynic), he wrote that “the real issue is not the perp design but the centralized (and quadi [sic] decentralized) exchanges that are prime broker, CLOB and custodian all in one,” adding that traditional finance “solved all this stuff long time ago.” His critique targets the vertically integrated model that dominates both centralized exchanges and some so-called “decentralized” platforms, where custody, matching, risk management and prime brokerage-like functions are bundled into a single entity. In stress events, that consolidation can turn one venue into a systemic choke point. Structural Weakness Threatens The Crypto Market DeFiance Capital founder Arthur Cheong (@Arthur_0x) places the blame partly on derivatives product design. He argues that “crypto derivatives (mainly perps) product design and market structure that surround it remain the biggest problem the industry needs to tackle before it can grow to the next level in a sustainable manner.” He draws a straight line between the March 2020 crash and the recent 10 October (“10/10”) meltdown . In March 2020, he notes, Bitcoin’s 50–70% intraday plunge was exacerbated by BitMEX-style BTC-margined “quanto” perps, “which means BTC perps are collateralized by BTC not stablecoins thus you get the extreme reflexivity on the downside and there’s just very little way you can hedge this quanto perp exposure.” According to Arthur, most participants recognized this as a design flaw. As stablecoin usage grew, the market share of BTC-margined quanto perps on BitMEX fell from “>80% to less than 20% in one year,” and by mid-2021 “most people are using USDT margined BTC perps.” That collective shift, he argues, “have definitely improve[d] the resilience of market structure significantly” and reduced volatility in BTC, though he still “look[s] forward to a new product design significantly better than the current iteration of crypto perps.” If Gaevoy and Arthur focus on architecture and instruments, pseudonymous trader The White Whale (@TheWhiteWhaleV2) has put the human cost of recent failures front and center in a X post with 1.8 million views. In the widely shared thread explaining his “personal decision to step away from trading on HyperLiquid ,” he praises HyperLiquid founder Jeff Yan and the team for dragging “structural fairness into the spotlight,” but concludes that 10/10 exposed something deeper. “The fact that one centralized exchange can trigger a global liquidation cascade and force temporary price dislocations across every protocol? That’s not a ‘black swan.’ That’s a design flaw.” His recap of 10/10 is stark: Binance relied on its own oracle , which depegged a stablecoin and started “a smaller, but manageable, liquidation chain.” Then “their API mysteriously went offline.” Market makers who “operate largely delta-neutral” suddenly couldn’t hedge; they pulled quotes across CEXs and DEXs. “With no liquidity present, price falls off a cliff.” The industry’s reaction, he argues, revealed a misaligned set of priorities. “Victory laps” over “Zero bad debt!” and “Liquidations processed flawlessly!” may show protocols survived, but “Great. The protocol didn’t die. But users did.” He insists that “protecting the protocol IS important – obviously. But it is not the same thing as protecting traders.” As an alternative, White Whale points to Drift on Solana as one venue that has at least attempted to encode protection at the protocol level. Drift’s liquidation protection, he writes, “isn’t magic. It’s not flawless. But it exists – and more importantly, it worked.” A key rule is simple: “Is the oracle price diverging by more than 50% from the 5-minute TWAP?” If so, the system temporarily halts liquidations, filtering out “scam wicks” and pushing edge cases to the insurance fund. Across Gaevoy’s structural critique, Yan’s product-design history and White Whale’s exit from HyperLiquid, a common conclusion emerges: today’s crypto market is not just volatile – it is structurally biased against traders in moments of stress. Whether the industry now prioritizes circuit breakers, segregated roles and on-chain protections will determine if 10/10 becomes a turning point, or just another preventable disaster.

The November 17 order grants Dimensional exemptions that enable open-end management investment companies to operate both ETF classes and mutual fund classes within the same fund structure, positioning the firm as the first to deploy this model for actively managed products. Dimensional filed its initial application in July 2023 and submitted three amendments before receiving final approval. The SEC’s order exempts the firm from several provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, including sections governing share pricing, redemptions, and certain affiliated transactions. SEC issues approval order allowing Dimensional to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds… Becomes second asset manager after Vanguard w/ this capability & the first w/ ability to use for actively managed products. Some *90* other asset managers pursuing this as well. pic.twitter.com/AILGy0Y9K3 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 17, 2025 Ninety Firms Await Similar Approvals Nearly ninety other asset managers have filed applications seeking identical capabilities, according to several ETF analysts. The approval signals potential momentum for a broader wave of hybrid fund structures across the industry. Nate Geraci, co-founder of ETF Store, noted that Dimensional holds a competitive edge as the first firm authorized to apply this model to actively managed strategies. While Vanguard pioneered the structure, its primary focus remains passive index funds. Dimensional’s approval extends the framework into active management, where fund companies typically generate higher fees and maintain greater differentiation from competitors. BIG news for DFA. Congratulations to them for being first. Have to assume floodgates are going to open for those ~90 other firms vying for similar approvals. https://t.co/pCPA8KfACU — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 18, 2025 James Seyffart, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, predicted an imminent surge of approvals for firms awaiting similar authorizations. The hybrid model allows asset managers to offer lower-cost ETF shares alongside traditional mutual fund shares, which can potentially attract investors seeking tax efficiency and intraday trading without forcing existing mutual fund shareholders to convert. Solana ETF Competition Intensifies VanEck launched the third U.S. Solana staking ETF on Monday , entering a field where Bitwise and Grayscale have collectively captured over $380 million since late October. The VanEck Solana ETF, trading under the ticker VSOL, has waived its 0.3 percent management fee through February 17, or until assets reach $1 billion. Fidelity is set to debut its Solana ETF, ticker FSOL, on November 19 with a 25 basis point fee. Canary Funds will launch its Solana ETF, ticker SOLC, the same day, in partnership with Marinade Finance for on-chain staking. Balchunas emphasized Fidelity’s scale advantage as the largest asset manager competing in this category, noting BlackRock’s absence from the Solana market despite its dominance in Bitcoin ETFs. Fidelity Solana ETF $FSOL is slated to launch TOMORROW. Fee is 25bps. Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out. $BSOL got out first, has $450m, $VSOL launched today, Grayscale is in mix. Game on. pic.twitter.com/iCXMkAH9qe — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 17, 2025 Bitwise’s Solana ETF, ticker BSOL, currently leads with approximately $450 million in assets under management. Grayscale has also entered the Solana ETF lineup alongside the new entrants. Regulatory Shift Signals Broader Industry Integration The hybrid model addresses longstanding friction between mutual fund investors seeking tax efficiency and ETF investors requiring traditional share class options. The approval builds on the SEC’s September streamlining initiative that eliminated case-by-case reviews for crypto ETF applications, dramatically accelerating product launches across the digital asset space. Today, the SEC also removed crypto from its examination priorities for 2026, indicating that digital assets are no longer considered a special risk area requiring heightened supervisory focus.

SIGNALING IT’S NO LONGER CONSIDERED A SPECIAL RISK AREA. pic.twitter.com/LUP4suYJ7j — Crypto Rover (@cryptorover) November 18, 2025 Industry observers view the removal as a tacit acknowledgment that crypto markets have matured sufficiently to warrant treatment comparable to other established asset classes under the agency’s standard regulatory framework. Digital asset investment products have recently declined amid the general market bear that saw Bitcoin slip below $90K today from $126K October ATH . Last week, these investment products saw $2 billion in outflows , marking the heaviest weekly withdrawals since February. The three-week streak resulted in cumulative outflows of $3.2 billion amid sharp price declines across major cryptocurrencies. Total assets under management in digital asset ETPs dropped 27 percent from their early-October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion. U.S.-based products accounted for $1.97 billion of last week’s outflows, while others also recorded notable outflows.

Recent price predictions suggest a 300% pump for $SHIB if the token reaches two critical levels, which would set it up for an aggressive rally. Bitcoin Hyper introduces a Layer 2 solution that brings high-speed smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem via a Solana Virtual Machine integration. The $HYPER presale raised over $27.8M so far with a token price of $0.013295 and staking rewards currently at 41%. The altcoin market is at a fascinating crossroads. While speculative assets have dominated cycles past, a clear trend toward utility is emerging. Investors are looking past fleeting hype, demanding projects with sustainable technology and real-world use cases. This shift in sentiment is reshaping the altcoin market outlook for 2025, forcing a re-evaluation of long-term value. Take top altcoins like Shiba Inu, for instance, which is currently at a crossroads, showing clear-cut signs of consolidation and momentum buildup. Trader’s expectation of a 300% $SHIB pump long-term is no longer unrealistic, provided $SHIB can hold two critical levels. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently at the opposite end of the spectrum, after crashing below $90K today. The reasons are multiple, from bulk whale sells to dwindling investor participation and increased fear. But there’s another problem worth talking about. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, offers unparalleled security and trust but its slow transaction speeds, high fees, and lack of native smart contract capabilities, have hindered its investor appeal. Right now, Bitcoin ranks 30th in terms of TPS . A new contender, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve this trilemma directly. As the newest Bitcoin Layer 2 solution integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Hyper promises to unlock Bitcoin’s dormant potential. By creating a high-speed execution layer on top of Bitcoin’s secure settlement, Bitcoin Hyper introduces the programmability and performance needed for modern dApps. This approach could fundamentally alter the competitive dynamics of the blockchain space, bringing high-performance applications to the industry’s most trusted network. Bitcoin Hyper Redefines Speed and Programmability Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) tackles Bitcoin’s core limitations head-on. Its modular architecture uses Bitcoin’s Layer 1 for ultimate security and settlement while a real-time SVM-based Layer 2 handles transaction execution. This allows for extremely low-latency processing and high-speed, low-cost transactions. The project’s decentralized Canonical Bridge facilitates seamless and secure cross-minting of $BTC into its L2 environment. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper brings fast, scalable smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem. This move enables developers to build sophisticated DeFi applications, NFT platforms, and gaming dApps using familiar tools like the Rust programming language. This innovative approach is capturing significant attention. The ongoing presale for its native token, $HYPER, has already raised an impressive $27.8M+ at the time of writing, with $HYPER sitting at $0.013295. This strong demand signals major investor confidence in the project’s vision. If this type of hype continues, $HYPER could explode post release. Our price prediction for $HYPER , based on the project’s utility and community support, puts the token at $0.08625 by the end of 2026. In terms of ROI, we’re talking about potential profits of 548%. This is enough of an incentive for any crypto hunter looking for portfolio diversification. If this sounds like you, make sure you read our guide on how to buy $HYPER today. Check $HYPER’s live presale today. A New Ecosystem for DeFi, Gaming, and Payments The implications of bringing high-performance smart contracts to Bitcoin are massive. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) unlocks a wide range of use cases previously impossible on the network, creating a new ecosystem for developers and users alike. Developers can build swaps, lending platforms, and staking protocols that leverage Bitcoin’s liquidity with the speed of an SVM chain. For everyday traders, use cases range from high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC with minimal fees to comprehensive DeFi protocols. With presale tokens currently priced at $0.013295, early participants are getting in at the ground floor – an opportunity which won’t last long anymore. The project has a projected release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 so, if you want to invest, invest today. Secure your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing. Crypto is a high-risk market and presales have no success guarantee.

BGIN's core operations include mining smaller coins and developing mining machines, with expansion plans into bitcoin and Dogecoin mining by 1H26. Despite a low price/sales multiple, BGIN's revenue is forecasted to decline 62% in eFY25, driven by weak demand and market headwinds. I recommend a Sell rating on BGIN, targeting $2.93/share, as continued market challenges may further impact revenue and shareholder value. Bgin Blockchain Limited ( BGIN ) is a cryptocurrency miner and mining machine developer that primarily focuses on smaller coins like the Kaspa coin. The company came into the public markets at the end of October 2025 through an IPO during a period of significant declines across the cryptocurrency markets. With reported 1h25 sales experiencing a large decline in machine sales and mining pool revenue, Bgin may be facing significant pressure for the coming quarters if the cryptocurrency market continues to decline. Given the challenges faced in the market, I believe shares should be trading at 2.93/share at 1.52x eFY27 price/sales; I am recommending BGIN shares with a Sell rating. Bgin Blockchain Limited Operations Bgin, a Cayman Islands-based company, came to the public markets on October 22, 2025 through an initial public offering, issuing 5mm Class A ordinary shares at an IPO price of $6.00/share. Bgin raised roughly $30mm from the offering that is expected to be used to purchase and/or construct mining farms as well as invest in research and development of proprietary chips designed for cryptocurrency mining machines. Bgin’s lockup period expires 6 months following the IPO, which should land in April 2026. Corporate Filings Bgin is a holding company operating under Bgin HK, Bgin Trading, Bgin Trade HK, Bgin Singapore, Bgin SG, Bgin Infrastructure US, and Bgin Management. Bgin, through its subsidiaries, conducts operations in the US, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Primary operations include mining cryptocurrency and selling mining machines equipped with its 8nm or 12nm ASIC chips designed to mine KAS coins, ALPH coins, and RXD coins. As part of its mining operations, Bgin offers a miner hosting service in which Bgin manages mining machines on behalf of customers for a service fee. Since the release of the prospectus, Bgin has grown its mining fleet from 48,277 machines to 72,825 machines as of September 2025 . Accordingly, Bgin primarily mines KAS coins for revenue generation. Kaspa was launched in 2021 through mining rather than an initial coin offering [ICO] and uses the BlockDAG architecture. Kaspa has a maximum supply of 28.7b coins, building in scarcity for the high-throughput coin. Standard CPUs are capable of mining the coins, making them accessible for various miners. The basis for Kaspa is for faster transactions while remaining decentralized. TradingView Bgin is aiming to grow its operations by a significant measure. As of September 2025, Bgin had 47MW of power in use and is targeting 500 MW of capacity within the next two years. As part of its growth strategy, Bgin is aiming to mine large-cap coins like Bitcoin and Dogecoin beginning in 1h26. As part of this, Bgin is expecting to begin developing mining machines for these larger coins in 1h26, potentially to be both utilized for internal mining operations and for sale. Revenue for FY24 was largely concentrated in Hong Kong, China, at 33%, the United States at 23%, and Singapore at 16%. Corporate Filings Bgin Blockchain Limited Financial Position Corporate Filings Bgin faced a significant decline in revenue generation in 1h25 as a result of lower mining machine sales as well as the significant decline in the KAS coin price, falling from $0.1165/coin to $0.0755/coin. Accordingly, US tariff policies on Chinese imports may impact costs for Bgin as well as disrupt its supply chain for chip fabrication and manufacturing, as well as materials sourcing from China. Corporate Filings Modeling Bgin’s financials, I believe the firm may face continued pressure across its external services, which may be particularly sensitive to the coins mined by Bgin’s machines. This may result in challenging mining machine revenue for the coming quarters following the large drop-off in 1H25. At the top-line, I’m forecasting revenue to decline by -62% for eFY25 to $116mm, largely driven by the pressure on cryptocurrencies, particularly in recent months. TradingView Risks Related to Bgin Blockchain Limited Bull Case Bgin focuses on a niche corner of the cryptocurrency market, mining smaller coins that may offer differentiated and less competitive returns regarding Bitcoin mining companies. Bgin has historically realized strong margins through miner sales and may experience a sharp turnaround if sales volumes were to pick back up. Bear Case The cryptocurrency market may be going into another bear market, potentially resulting in a drop-off of interest by retail investors seeking liquidity and safety. This may result in a continued decline in mining machine sales as well as mining pool revenue going forward. The lower price of KAS coin may result in a substantial reduction of mining revenue going forward, offset by higher volumes mined. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Filings BGIN shares are currently trading at 1.53x price/sales, a relatively low premium for high-growth companies. Despite the low trading multiple, I believe shares may face continued pressure as the market Bgin participants are going through declining coin pricing, potentially impacting broader revenue generation for the company going forward. Using my revenue forecast for eFY27, I believe shares should be trading at 2.93/share at 1.52x eFY27 price/sales; I am recommending BGIN shares with a Sell rating.

Nasdaq-listed Onfolio Holdings has successfully raised a staggering $300 million specifically for crypto investments, signaling strong institutional confidence in digital assets. This monumental funding round represents one of the most significant corporate commitments to cryptocurrency this year. Why Are Major Institutions Making Crypto Investments Now? Onfolio’s decision to allocate $300 million toward crypto investments comes at a pivotal moment in digital asset evolution. The company secured these substantial funds through institutional investors and a convertible note facility, demonstrating sophisticated financial engineering. This move follows increasing institutional adoption trends, where traditional finance meets blockchain technology. The strategic crypto investments will focus on three major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC) – The original cryptocurrency and digital gold Ethereum (ETH) – The leading smart contract platform Solana (SOL) – The high-performance blockchain network How Will This Impact Crypto Investment Strategies? Onfolio’s massive crypto investments could create ripple effects throughout the entire digital asset ecosystem. When publicly-traded companies make substantial commitments to cryptocurrency, it often signals to other institutions that the asset class has matured sufficiently for serious consideration. Moreover, this level of crypto investment from a Nasdaq-listed entity adds credibility and legitimacy to the entire sector. The company’s approach to crypto investments appears carefully calculated. By targeting established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum while including emerging leaders like Solana, Onfolio balances stability with growth potential. This diversified strategy in crypto investments mirrors approaches taken by other institutional players entering the space. What Challenges Do Institutional Crypto Investments Face? While the $300 million crypto investment announcement generates excitement, institutional participation brings unique challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern for companies making substantial crypto investments. However, Onfolio’s Nasdaq listing suggests they’ve conducted thorough due diligence and compliance checks before committing to these significant crypto investments. Another consideration involves market volatility. Despite growing institutional interest, cryptocurrency markets can experience sharp price swings. The company’s crypto investments will need sophisticated risk management strategies to navigate these fluctuations successfully. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto Investments? Onfolio’s bold move could inspire similar crypto investments from other publicly-traded companies. As more traditional finance players observe successful crypto investments from peers, the barrier to entry lowers for others considering similar moves. This development in crypto investments might accelerate mainstream adoption and potentially stabilize markets through increased institutional participation. The timing of these crypto investments suggests confidence in the long-term viability of digital assets. Despite recent market corrections, sophisticated players continue making substantial crypto investments, indicating they see value beyond short-term price movements. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investments Onfolio’s $300 million commitment to crypto investments marks a significant milestone in digital asset maturation. This move demonstrates that serious institutional capital continues flowing into cryptocurrency, validating the asset class for conservative investors. As more companies follow suit with their own crypto investments, we may witness accelerated innovation and stability in blockchain markets. Frequently Asked Questions What is Onfolio Holdings? Onfolio Holdings is a Nasdaq-listed company that acquires and operates online businesses, now expanding into cryptocurrency investments. How did Onfolio raise $300 million? The company secured funds through institutional investors and a convertible note facility, which is a type of debt that can convert to equity. Which cryptocurrencies will Onfolio invest in? Onfolio plans direct investments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Why is this significant for crypto markets? This represents substantial institutional validation and could encourage other public companies to make similar crypto investments. When will these investments happen? The company hasn’t specified a timeline but typically executes such strategies promptly after funding completion. Could this affect cryptocurrency prices? Large institutional crypto investments can influence market sentiment and potentially impact prices through increased demand. Found this insight into institutional crypto investments valuable?

54572408,629920,1763476179,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54572408.jpeg,"Kazakhstan Expands Crypto Mining Framework, Setting Up $PEPENODE",https://bitcoinist.com/kazakhstan-expands-crypto-mining-framework-setting-up-pepenode/,"Quick Facts: 1️⃣ Kazakhstan is clarifying its crypto rules, creating a friendlier environment for regulated mining and digital-asset activity. 2️⃣Crypto assets can now circulate across Kazakhstan, no longer restricted to the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC). 3️⃣ PEPENODE introduces a hardware-free mine-to-earn structure that lets users access mining-style rewards through virtual nodes instead of rigs, making the experience accessible to retail users priced out of traditional mining The regulatory environment in the Central Asian crypto mining hub, Kazakhstan, is shifting from a grey area to an increasingly structured one. Recent reforms give clearer legal footing for digital-asset mining, exchange activity, and tokens. A recent amendments bill vastly expands the range of options for crypto miners and users within the country. Essentially, Kazakhstan is giving a green light to crypto mining and moving the crypto industry a bit more into the limelight. The new law: Expands circulation Allows mining by both individuals and entities Permits mined crypto to be traded on more exchanges Kazakhstan’s move also sends a signal to the rest of the world. As jurisdictions like Kazakhstan upgrade their frameworks, projects that lean on real-world utility or scalable models (rather than pure hype) may benefit. Against that backdrop enters PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a meme-coin presale combining gamified ‘mining’ mechanics with virtual nodes, built on the premise of lowering entry-barriers for everyday miners. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Meme-Coin Momentum with Innovative Mine-to-Earn Mechanism PepeNode proposes a novel ‘mine-to-earn’ structure: rather than acquiring expensive rigs or relying on intense energy consumption, users purchase virtual mining nodes inside a gamified dashboard. The node upgrades, leaderboard mechanics, and reward system aim to replicate mining engagement minus the hardware burden. In addition to generating earnings in $PEPENODE itself, the mine-to-earn play includes rewards in market-leading meme coins, such as $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. Presale highlights include: $0.0011546 token price $2.1M presale raise 596% staking rewards during the presale 210B token supply With low-barrier access to a mining-style experience, a catchy meme narrative, and early-stage entry with presale pricing, PEPENODE brings all the benefits of mining to the meme coin sector, but without the real-world costs of intensive equipment. Kazakhstan, PEPENODE Usher in New Mining Era Mining barriers, including cost, hardware, and electricity, have pushed many retail users out of traditional crypto mining. That forces them to new frontiers, like Kazakhstan, or to innovative models where participation can be virtualised or abstracted. That’s precisely where $PEPENODE comes in. In the meantime, there’s another trend emerging. Meme coins have matured beyond pure jokes. Projects integrating game-mechanics, community engagement, and reward loops are earning more serious attention. That trend supports our PEPENODE price prediction , which shows $PEPENODE climbing from its current price to $0.0072 by the end of 2026. That represents 523% gains if you bought at today’s $0.0011546 token price. Our prediction highlights the potential for the project to fit in perfectly with growing regulatory clarity (as in Kazakhstan). The trend signals that some jurisdictions are moving from the ‘wild west’ to more structured regimes. That creates both headwinds, with more oversight, and opportunities; legitimate mining and regulated frameworks. For participants, that means paying attention not just to token mechanics but to jurisdiction, compliance, and roadmap fulfilment. Any positive regulatory narrative tends to bolster confidence. Kazakhstan’s evolving crypto laws and mining-friendly yet regulated posture provide a contextual tailwind for mining-adjacent concepts. Within an increasingly pro-mining context, don’t miss $PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn opportunity.

54572520,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=220362,1763476215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary: Stack Overflow’s Bold Transformation into Premier AI Training Data Provider,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stack-overflow-ai-data-provider/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary: Stack Overflow’s Bold Transformation into Premier AI Training Data Provider In a groundbreaking move that could reshape how AI systems learn from human expertise, Stack Overflow is undergoing a dramatic transformation from coding Q&A platform to essential AI training data provider. This strategic pivot positions the company at the heart of the enterprise AI stack, leveraging its vast repository of programming knowledge to fuel the next generation of artificial intelligence. Stack Overflow AI Enterprise Evolution During Microsoft’s Ignite conference, Stack Overflow unveiled a suite of new products designed specifically for enterprise AI applications. The company’s CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar revealed that this direction was inspired by observing how enterprise customers were already using Stack Overflow’s API for AI training purposes. The core product, Stack Overflow Internal, represents an enterprise-grade version of the familiar forum, but with enhanced security controls and administrative features tailored for corporate environments. Enterprise AI Stack Integration The new tools are engineered to seamlessly integrate with internal AI agents using the model context protocol. What makes this particularly innovative is Stack Overflow’s development of specialized variations specifically designed for their platform. This approach allows enterprises to incorporate verified programming knowledge directly into their AI systems, creating more reliable and accurate AI assistants for development teams. Feature Benefit Enterprise Impact Reliability Scoring AI agents understand answer trustworthiness Reduced errors in code generation Knowledge Graph Connects programming concepts dynamically Faster problem resolution Custom Tagging Enterprise-specific categorization Better organizational knowledge capture AI Training Data Goldmine Stack Overflow has secured content deals with multiple AI labs, allowing them to train models on public Stack Overflow data in exchange for substantial fees. While specific figures remain confidential, Chandrasekar compared these arrangements to “the Reddit deals,” which reportedly generated over $200 million for that platform. This represents a significant revenue stream diversification for Stack Overflow beyond traditional advertising and subscription models. Advanced AI Agents Capabilities The most exciting development comes from CTO Jody Bailey’s vision for read-write functionality. Future AI agents will be able to create their own Stack Overflow queries when they encounter knowledge gaps or cannot answer questions. This represents a fundamental shift from passive knowledge consumption to active knowledge seeking by AI systems. Dynamic query generation by AI agents Automatic knowledge gap identification Reduced developer effort in knowledge capture Continuous organizational learning Model Context Protocol Implementation A critical innovation in Stack Overflow’s approach is the metadata layer exported alongside traditional question-answer pairs. This includes: Answer authorship and timing data Content categorization tags Internal coherence assessments Automated reliability scoring This metadata enables AI systems to make informed decisions about answer trustworthiness, significantly improving the quality of generated responses and reducing the risk of propagating incorrect information. What Does This Mean for Enterprise AI? While Stack Overflow is building the tools rather than the AI agents themselves, the implications are profound. Enterprises can now leverage decades of collective programming wisdom through their internal AI systems. The reliability scoring system means AI agents can prioritize verified solutions over experimental or outdated approaches, potentially saving companies millions in development time and error resolution. The transformation of Stack Overflow from community forum to AI data provider represents a strategic masterstroke in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. By monetizing their vast knowledge repository while maintaining quality through sophisticated reliability scoring, Stack Overflow has positioned itself as an essential component in the enterprise AI infrastructure. As AI systems become increasingly integral to software development, access to high-quality, verified programming knowledge may become the competitive differentiator that separates successful AI implementations from failed experiments. Frequently Asked Questions What is Stack Overflow’s new business model? Stack Overflow is transitioning from a public Q&A platform to an enterprise AI data provider, offering verified programming knowledge and reliability scoring for AI training. How does the reliability scoring work? The system analyzes metadata including answer authorship, timing, content tags, and internal coherence to generate trust scores that help AI agents prioritize accurate information. What are the financial implications of this shift? While specific figures aren’t disclosed, CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar compares the deals to Reddit’s $200M+ AI data licensing agreements. How does this integrate with existing enterprise systems? The tools use the model context protocol and can work with various AI systems, with CTO Jody Bailey emphasizing flexibility for different enterprise environments. What role does Microsoft play in this transformation? The announcement was made at Microsoft ‘s Ignite conference, indicating strategic partnership potential in the enterprise AI space.

On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-on-chain-risk-extreme-value-zone/,"Dogecoin is sitting at an inflection point where weakening market structure meets unusually compressed on-chain risk, according to new charts shared by analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica). The visuals juxtapose a multi-year DOGE/USDT price channel with Alphafractal’s Reserve Risk framework, raising the question of whether the move is a true breakdown or the formation of a long-term bottom. Dogecoin On-Chain Risk Hits Extreme Value Zone In an X post, Cryptollica explains that the Dogecoin model “combines Reserve Risk with VOCDD/MVOCDD-style activity measures to assess long-term holder conviction versus market pricing.” The key metric is Reserve Risk itself, defined as: “Reserve Risk = Price / HODL Bank.” “HODL Bank” represents the cumulative opportunity cost long-term holders accepted by not selling in earlier rallies. When the current price is low relative to that bank of conviction, Reserve Risk prints low values; when price is high versus that bank, it spikes. Crucially, Cryptollica notes that “low readings historically align with attractive risk/reward (value zones), while high readings mark overheated conditions.” On the Alphafractal chart, this is rendered as a green lower band (value) and a red upper band (overheated). Related Reading: One Slip And Dogecoin Could Plunge Back Into A Bear Market: Analyst Dogecoin’s past blow-off phases, including the 2021 surge toward roughly $0.76, coincided with Reserve Risk moving into the red zone. By contrast, long consolidation periods following major unwinds saw the indicator fall back into the green band. The latest data point, dated 17 November 2025, shows Reserve Risk again compressed in that lower green area, indicating that, relative to the accumulated HODL Bank, spot prices are historically cheap by this model’s standards. The chart does not predict direction, but it places current conditions firmly in what the framework defines as an “extreme value” environment. DOGE Faces Crash Towards $0.07 The second chart, a three-day DOGE/USDT view from Binance, focuses on price structure. Dogecoin trades within a broad ascending channel that has contained action since 2021. The lower boundary, labeled “Bottom Line,” currently tracks just above the $0.07 area; the upper “TopLine” extends toward about $1.30, with a central “Midline” near the $0.27 region acting repeatedly as resistance. A two-year moving average arcs through the middle of this channel. DOGE lost this average in the bear phase, reclaimed it into 2024–2025 and then rallied to a local high around $0.48, before being rejected at the Midline. A cluster of red arrows at roughly $0.27 marks multiple failed attempts to break higher. Related Reading: How Did The Dogecoin Price React To Elon Musk’s Latest Dog Post? Since then, price has rolled over, slipped back below the two-year MA and is now descending inside the channel. The latest three-day candle shows DOGE trading around $0.15, with an intraperiod spike lower that was partially bought back. DOGE is now trading at a last line of defence: the mid-line of the lower part of the channel around $0.15. If this support breaks, a steep drop towards the “Bottom Line” just above $0.07 could loom. Together, both charts frame Dogecoin’s position sharply. Structurally, DOGE is weakening below its long-term moving average and mid-channel resistance, leaving the lower boundary of the channel as the next major geometric reference. On-chain, however, the Reserve Risk and activity composite indicates that long-term holders’ cumulative conviction now stands against one of the lowest relative price levels seen since the previous cycle. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.157.

The deal still requires Federal Reserve Board approval, with closing targeted by year’s end, subject to remaining conditions. Regulatory Path and Deal Terms LevelField’s plan follows an earlier attempt to combine in early 2023 that was withdrawn after the Silvergate and Signature failures. The firm refiled in December 2024. The report said that LevelField agreed to pay up to $70 million, citing the company’s application to the Federal Reserve. Illinois has cleared the state-level hurdle. The proposed transaction now moves to the Federal Reserve for review. LevelField intends to maintain Burling’s community banking operations while adding digital asset capabilities within a state-regulated, full-service bank. The parties expect to close after all necessary approvals and standard conditions have been satisfied. Both organizations currently employ about 20 people each. If the deal closes, LevelField plans to hire roughly 100 additional staff in the first year. Chief Executive Officer Gene Grant II described the company’s approach to entering regulated banking through an acquisition rather than a narrow-purpose charter. “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” said Grant. https://t.co/YI2fqEqimy More detail on the LevelField Bank approval in our press release.

""First Seen Since November 2024, Data Warns!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-analysis-from-glassnode-first-seen-since-november-2024-data-warns/,"Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a major decline yesterday, falling below $90,000 for the first time in seven months. Altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum (ETH) also falling below $3,000 for the first time in a long time. In addition, XRP was undoubtedly one of the altcoins that experienced a significant decline in the recent decline. While XRP fell to $2.1, Glassnode shared interesting data about XRP. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode said in its latest analysis that over 41% of XRP holders are currently at a loss. According to Glassnode, XRP holders' share of profits dropped to 58.5%, leaving 41.5% in a loss position. This marks the lowest profitability level since November 2024, when XRP was trading at $0.53. According to the data, 26.5 billion XRP, equivalent to 41.5% of the total supply, was found to be in short supply. This suggests the market is “top-heavy,” with investors mostly buying at higher prices. The proportion of XRP supply in profit zones has fallen to 58.5%. This is the lowest level since last November. The current XRP price of $2.15 is nearly four times higher than last November ($0.53), yet still leaves 41.5% of the total supply at a loss. This means the market is dominated by late-entry investors.” Consequently, such a high level of outflows means that late investors who bought at higher price levels are under pressure. This structure could potentially put downward pressure on the price. Because many investors bought near the peak, if prices fall further, these investors may panic sell, increasing downward pressure. Glassnode therefore concludes that the current structure is structurally fragile. At this point, Glassnode notes that despite the current price of around $2.15, data points to an unstable market structure dominated by investors buying at higher prices. *This is not investment advice.

Ma cerchiamo di comprendere al meglio la situazione. Tanto per cominciare il termine mNAV sta per “ Multiple of Net Asset Value ”, ed è un rapporto che confronta il valore dell’azienda sul mercato con il valore delle criptovalute che possiede. Quando un’azienda ha un mNAV maggiore di uno significa sostanzialmente che questa vale più delle sue riserve in crypto, e che gli investitori vedono un modello di business sostenibile e promettente. Le Aziende con Tesoreria in Ethereum Sono in Difficoltà In un nuovo thread su X , Charles Edwards, fondatore di Capriole Investments, ha discusso alcune metriche relative alle aziende che detengono Ethereum in tesoreria. Una “treasury firm” è una società quotata che ha adottato un asset digitale come Bitcoin o Ethereum come strategia di riserva. L’idea è stata resa popolare dalla strategia di Michael Saylor (ex MicroStrategy) , che nel 2020 ha scelto di diventare una società con riserva in BTC. Da allora, è cresciuta fino a diventare di gran lunga il più grande detentore aziendale di asset digitali, con un investimento enorme di 47,54 miliardi di dollari . In passato, le aziende vedevano solo Bitcoin come un asset di riserva praticabile, ma quest’anno si è registrato un aumento dei detentori di ETH, la criptovaluta al secondo posto per capitalizzazione. La “frenesia” delle aziende verso Ethereum ha raggiunto il picco in agosto, ma da allora il ritmo di crescita ha mostrato un rallentamento, come evidenziato dal grafico condiviso da Edwards. Acquisti Istituzionali di Ethereum Dal grafico è chiaro che il tasso di variazione delle tesorerie ETH resta positivo nonostante il rallentamento, suggerendo che le aziende continuano ad accumulare. Ciò significa che, nonostante i recenti deflussi dagli ETF spot , gli acquisti istituzionali restano superiori – anche se di poco – alla crescita dell’offerta della criptovaluta. Il Modello di Business delle Tesorerie ETH Non Sta Funzionando per Molte Aziende Come sottolinea l’analista, la maggior parte delle aziende ha un valore mNAV inferiore a 1 . Come abbiamo già spiegato, il mNAV è una metrica che confronta la capitalizzazione di mercato di un’azienda con il valore totale dei suoi asset di riserva.Un valore inferiore a 1 implica che la valutazione della società è inferiore al valore delle sue riserve. Attualmente, circa il 64,3% delle aziende con tesoreria in Ethereum si trova in questa condizione , ergo il mercato non crede molto nella sostenibilità di queste società. Una sostenibilità resa sempre più precaria in una condizione di difficoltà di ETH. Edwards spiega: “Ciò significa che il quadro delle aziende con tesoreria in ETH è molto più debole rispetto a quello di Bitcoin.” Chiaramente, le tesorerie ETH stanno affrontando pressioni. Ma qualcuna sta vendendo?I dati suggeriscono che la maggior parte non lo sta facendo , poiché il rapporto netto acquisti/vendite rimane solido. Sebbene quasi tutti i detentori corporate di Ethereum siano ancora acquirenti netti, il rapporto buy/sell ha iniziato a scendere mentre il prezzo dell’asset sta vivendo un periodo ribassista. Attualmente ETH è scambiato per circa 3.000 dollari, in un mese ha perso circa il 21% del proprio valore.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-18 14:50:04
54573117,629932,1763477464,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54573117.jpeg,Dogecoin vs Bitcoin: A New Meme Coin Juggernaut Enters the Arena,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-vs-bitcoin-maxi-doge-presale-challenger/,"Quick Facts: The Dogecoin vs Bitcoin debate underscores a clash between long-term stability and high-risk, community-led speculation. Retail traders continue to hunt for low-cap tokens capable of delivering explosive growth reminiscent of Dogecoin’s early cycles. Stealing the spotlight from both $BTC and $DOGE, Maxi Doge introduces a utility-backed model built on competitive trading events and collective rewards. The long-running Dogecoin vs Bitcoin conversation has always split the crypto world into two distinct camps. For years, investors have weighed the differences between these philosophies, comparing Bitcoin’s slow-and-steady resilience with Dogecoin’s capacity for dramatic upside. Bitcoin sits atop the market as digital gold: scarce, secure, and designed for long-term value preservation. Dogecoin , created as a joke, evolved into a symbol of internet culture, fueled by community enthusiasm and viral momentum. This rivalry reflects a deeper tension within the market. Bitcoin offers stability, but its price point feels out of reach for smaller traders looking for monumental gains. Dogecoin once filled that void, as its early cycles delivered extraordinary returns. But its current size makes massive surges increasingly difficult. Recently, Bitcoin just gave the market a scary signal, a ‘Death Cross’ (where the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day one). This hasn’t happened since 2021, and historically, it puts some serious pressure on the whole crypto space. Dogecoin ($DOGE) saw a quick spike to $0.162, but then late-session selling basically wiped out those gains. The big takeaway? $DOGE is still super sensitive to whatever Bitcoin is doing. Traders are constantly scanning the horizon for the next crypto to explode : something culturally strong and priced low enough to deliver those once-in-a-cycle gains. That search has brought attention to new entrants that blend the excitement of early meme coins with modern utility. One of the most talked-about contenders, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , is shaping its identity around a “1000x leverage” mindset, pulling from high-adrenaline trading culture and layering it with community rewards. It marks a shift in the meme coin landscape, moving away from simple jokes and toward fully built ecosystems designed for ambitious participants. Maxi Doge Forges a New High-Leverage Trading Culture Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Doge’s bulky cousin, meant to represent the strength needed to thrive in a volatile market. His mantra, ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump,’ speaks to traders who see the market as a place to sharpen both financial instincts and discipline. Retail traders often struggle to match the confidence and capital of whales; Maxi Doge addresses that gap by cultivating a collective identity, backed by competitions and incentives that reward conviction. Maxi Doge also intentionally leans into the high-risk, high-reward mentality that defines leverage trading. Its ‘Leverage King Culture’ serves as the backbone of its brand, as a framework through which the entire project operates. The core philosophy of lift, trade, repeat mirrors the discipline required in fitness and in trading, creating a thematic bridge between the two worlds. In other words, the project brilliantly turns individual ambition into a coordinated movement, which makes it one of the best meme coins to buy now . This approach is clearly striking a chord. Maxi Doge’s presale has already surpassed $4 million, indicating strong early belief in its mission. Visit the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale for a closer look at the project . Could $MAXI be the Next Meme Coin to Explode? This fusion of meme-driven branding and engagement tools positions Maxi Doge as a fresh force in the Dogecoin vs Bitcoin conversation. It maintains the fun and virality of a meme coin while adding structure, incentives, and community tools. As part of boosting engagement, Maxi Doge will organize holder-exclusive trading competitions with real rewards, complete with leaderboards that encourage participation and growth. Another major component is the staking program. Holders can lock up $MAXI to earn attractive passive income, currently at 76% APY. And at the center of Maxi Doge’s sustainable meme coin model is the Maxi Fund – a treasury dedicated to maintaining liquidity, supporting partnerships, and fueling marketing campaigns. Together, these features present a compelling alternative for traders navigating the Dogecoin vs Bitcoin divide. So it wouldn’t be surprising to see $MAXI explode, as explained in our price forecasts for 2025, 2026, and 2030 . Built on the Ethereum network, Maxi Doge uses an ERC-20 smart contract for supply management and reward distribution. For detailed presale instructions, read our ‘How to Buy Maxi Doge’ guide . Since $MAXI has successfully passed smart contract audits by Coinsult and Solidproof , it significantly reduces the typical early-stage risks of code exploits or scam-related vulnerabilities. Join the $MAXI presale today for $0.0002685. But hurry, as a price increase is looming. This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

The funds, which had been sitting dormant for nearly five years, vanished almost instantly during the massive swap. The incident raises alarm regarding the risks involved in using Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and the importance of understanding liquidity and slippage before executing large trades. Cardano Holder Loses Over $6 Million ADA In Minutes A new report from a famous on-chain sleuth , ZachXBT, revealed a jaw-dropping loss for a Cardano investor. The user had swapped 14.4 million ADA, valued at approximately $6.9 million, for 847,000 USDA, a stablecoin pegged to ADA . The transaction occurred just two hours before the report became public, revealing that the investor had lost approximately $6.05 million, wiping out more than 80% of his initial investment. ZachXBT has said that the dramatic loss was likely due to extremely thin liquidity in the trading pool, which caused the price of ADA to spike temporarily during the swap. Vladimir S., a threat researcher who shared ZachXBT’s findings on X from his Telegram group, speculated that the Decentralized Exchange interface where the transaction occurred probably did not provide clear, low-liquidity warnings for a swap of that magnitude. Vladimir suggested that an Over-The-Counter (OTC) deal would have been a much safer alternative for a $6.9 million ADA swap. Notably, this case highlights how even long-term crypto holders can suffer major losses when they do not fully understand how DEXs work. Community Weighs In On Liquidity Issues And Slippage Warnings ZachXBT’s report sparked extensive discussions among crypto traders and analysts, who pointed out that the $6.9 million ADA swap carried a staggering high price impact of 87.433%. Many in the community noted that the transaction was executed on the Minswap DEX , where users are required to actively acknowledge and consent to high slippage warnings to confirm trades. Some members argued that the $6.05 million loss could have been avoided if the user paid attention to the interface and the obvious warnings displayed for transactions exceeding typical slippage thresholds. Responding to Vladimir’s speculation about a lack of clear liquidity warnings, other community members confirmed that Minswap always provides visible alerts for low liquidity swaps. Large slippage percentages, typically above 3-5%, are displayed in bright red texts, making it almost impossible for traders to miss. Some observers suggested that the Cardano holder may have misunderstood the interface, possibly due to language barriers or a lack of familiarity with decentralized finance mechanisms. Regardless of the reasons, this incident serves as a clear reminder for crypto users to pay attention to liquidity and slippage alerts when executing high-value swaps.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Decentralized Exchanges|DEXs|Minswap DEX|OTC|Over-the-counter|stablecoin|Vladimir S.|ZachXBT,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 02:00:26

MVRV Ratio Shows High Degree Of Short-Term Pain In Bitcoin & Altcoins In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed how the various assets in the cryptocurrency sector are looking based on the 30-day MVRV Ratio. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is an on-chain indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap and Realized Cap for a given coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin SSR Flashes Buy Signal: Rebound Incoming? The Realized Cap here refers to a capitalization model that calculates the asset’s total value by assuming the value of each individual token is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In short, what this model captures is an estimation for the amount of capital that BTC investors as a whole have invested into the cryptocurrency. The usual market cap, on the other hand, represents the amount holders are carrying today. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the Realized Cap. In other words, the overall network is in a state of profit. On the other hand, an indicator below this threshold implies the dominance of losses among investors. In the context of the current topic, the version of the MVRV Ratio that’s of interest is the 30-day one, tracking the profit-loss balance of the traders who purchased their coins within the past month. Below is the chart for the metric shared by Santiment that shows the trend in its value for five major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, Chainlink, and Cardano: As is visible in the graph, the 30-day MVRV Ratio has witnessed a plunge recently as the sector has gone through a bearish shift. Recent Bitcoin buyers are now about 11.5% underwater, while XRP ones are around 10.2%. Both of these are beyond the threshold that the analytics firm classifies as the boundary for a “good buy zone.” The 30-day investors have suffered even worse losses in the case of Ethereum, Cardano, and Chainlink, being down 15.4%, 19.7%, and 16.8%, respectively. All of these fall inside Santiment’s “extreme buy zone.” “In a zero sum game, buy assets when average trade returns of your peers are in extreme negatives,” noted the analytics firm. “The lower MVRV’s go, the higher the probability is of a rapid recovery.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Social Dominance Hits 4-Month High: What It Means It now remains to be seen whether market pain has been enough for XRP and others to cause a market rebound, or if more drawdown is coming. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.18, down more than 11% over the last week.

AI developers have made it clear that they intend to significantly invest in the industry as more individuals begin to use their products. A Portfolio Manager and Client Solutions Investment Director at Fidelity International, Joseph Zhang, expressed his belief that the recent decline experienced in global semiconductor stocks is likely a short-term change. He also predicted that a bounce back will occur unless the use or spending on AI decreases. “The party is still just getting started,” said Zhang, adding that, “It would be a mistake to leave the party too soon.” Notably, reports from sources indicated that the Portfolio Manager was responsible for managing more than $10 billion in assets at Fidelity. Investors raise questions regarding the excitement around AI Analysts conducted research and discovered that market fears concerning a bubble have prompted some investors, such as Japanese multinational conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp., and Peter Thiel, who initially drew attention for his innovations in banking and financing startups, to withdraw their investments. However, the perspective shared by fund managers at Fidelity International and Allianz Global Investors highlights that optimistic investors remain composed, especially with substantial investments like Jeff Bezos’ new AI initiative. Supporters backed this claim, noting that they believe this growth represents a rare tech revolution, making it difficult to dismiss as just another passing trend. Hartwig Kos, head of growth multi-asset at Allianz Global Investors, also weighed in on the topic of discussion. Kos stated that few people really grasp the capabilities of AI at this point. Therefore, according to him, it is too early to conclude that it is a bubble. Fidelity’s Zhang, on the other hand, asserted that there are no clear indications of a real slowdown in AI, such as reduced usage, lowered capital spending, or a technological breakthrough that could lessen the demand for chips and data centers. He further pointed out that yields from AI firms and prices of memory chips continue to escalate. “We feel quite optimistic about the overall technology and AI trends in the medium term,” the director at Fidelity added. Meanwhile, after six months of increases, reports stated investors in the US enjoyed some profit gains from semiconductor stocks in November. This news followed the 9.4% drop in the US chip index this month. The index was on track for its poor performance since March, while that of a Bloomberg index tracking Asian counterparts decreased by about 7.3%. This situation prompted investors to raise questions about whether the excitement surrounding AI is waning. To address these concerns, Mark Boulton, lead portfolio manager at Pictet Asset Management, advised investors to adjust their expectations for AI, as they might become overly enthusiastic about the technology, leading to disappointment. Analysts noted that even before SoftBank and Thiel intervened in the situation, signs resembling those from the dot-com crash began to appear. According to them, to stay positive about AI, one will need to ignore such warning signs. Nvidia’s earnings report ignites debate among individuals The so-called “Magnificent Seven” — a group of major US tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., and Apple Inc. — represent a large portion of the S&P 500’s growth. Earlier this month, Nvidia was valued higher than the total stock markets of Italy, Spain, the UAE, and the Netherlands combined. Sources have observed that investing in this sector in Asia may require even greater trust in the technology to handle the region’s specific challenges, which include trade issues and China’s unstable economy. According to Zhang, part of the recent selling is due to hedging actions taken before Nvidia’s earnings report. Investors may have purchased put options for the security, which could be impacting the market, he explained. The director at Fidelity also predicted that if Nvidia’s results are strong, investors will exit their hedges, and the market is likely to bounce back. Currently, the global leader in AI trades at 29 times its earnings expected over the next year. However, Zhang thinks its valuation seems fair considering its strong growth. Additionally, its main Asian suppliers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., appear to be even more affordable. “As long as these core factors remain unchanged, corrections driven by liquidity often present buying opportunities,” he stated.

HTX DAO systematically broke free from traditional DAO limitations and completed the initial construction of a “Financial Free Port.” Both accelerating deflation and maturing on-chain governance profoundly validate its long-term value strategy of “sustainability and verifiability.” HTX DAO demonstrates to the global community a vibrant, user-centric, and mechanism-driven DAO ecosystem. A Breakthrough in Both Value and Scale In 2025, HTX DAO’s breakthrough performance across key metrics showed strong resilience and powerful community cohesion. These results also reflect the positive market reception of the Financial Free Port strategy: ● Market Cap & Global Presence : $HTX reached a total market capitalization of $1.841 billion and was listed on 28 cryptocurrency exchanges, solidifying its place among global mainstream assets. ● Surging Subscriptions : $HTX earning products reached more than $9 billion in total subscriptions, an annual increase of more than 90%, with nearly 500,000 participants. This reflects soaring confidence in long-term $HTX returns. ● User Rewards : Total user reward payouts exceeded $30 million, up 30% YoY, delivering real, sustainable value to holders and maturing community co-prosperity. ● Holder Base Expansion : Global $HTX holders reached 849,900, up 16.6%, demonstrating rising community basis and expanding ecosystem coverage. ● Accelerating Deflation : Across Q1-Q3 2025, HTX DAO burned 36.22 trillion $HTX, accounting for 42.2% of total burns. The continuous burns further drive scarcity and strengthen long-term appreciation. HTX DAO not only expanded its market footprint, but also achieved a qualitative leap in asset retention and user value distribution. Growth is no longer driven by user base alone, but by real returns and mechanisms that lock in high-quality capital, advancing steadily toward the vision of building a financial free port. Institutionalized Deflation: Embedding Scarcity Into Governance This year, HTX DAO resolutely carried out its burn plan. In any crypto economy, token burning is not merely a technical action, but an economic signal. HTX DAO’s burn data has become a concrete expression of community consensus. By Q3 2025, HTX DAO had cumulatively burned 85.88 trillion $HTX, worth approximately $163 million. The most recent burn alone exceeded 13.12 trillion tokens, marking one of the largest burn events in DAO history. Deflation efficiency has been rapidly accelerating: from 0.78% in Q2 2024 to 1.39% in Q3 2025, with an average growth rate of 33%. $HTX supply contraction has now entered a phase of stable acceleration. Unlike traditional projects where deflation depends on team discretion, HTX DAO embedded deflation into its governance structure, transforming burn from a passive decision into a form of long-term autonomous consensus. In July, HTX DAO upgraded its whitepaper, shifting the economic model from a liquidity pledge mechanism to a burn-based model. This evolution elevates deflation from a monetary adjustment tool into a structural value filter at the governance level. For HTX DAO, token burning is no longer a one-time or uncertain event, but a sustainable process, representing a rare model of financial autonomy in Web3 where value consistently flows back to the community. First Realization of the “People’s Exchange”: From Voting Rights to Economic Sovereignty 2025 was the year HTX DAO governance truly went into effect. On June 30, the DAO’s on-chain token listing system officially launched, marking a pivotal transition from community discussion to on-chain execution. Its significance is comparable to a Bretton Woods-level moment for DAO governance. The community not only gained voting rights, but also the right to determine resource allocation. Specifically, community votes now directly determine the listing of trading pairs and the allocation of liquidity incentives. This completes the structural shift of economic sovereignty from centralization to token holders. Since the launch, over 1.1916 trillion $HTX have been cast in on-chain votes, valued at more than $3 million, leading to six tokens being successfully recommended and listed on HTX Exchange. This governance activity had a measurable market impact, where $HTX price surged 44.3% at its monthly peak, over 12,000 new holding addresses were added, and TVL increased by $42 million. These achievements represent the first wave of positive feedback after the People’s Exchange mechanism went live. The breakthrough lies in the fact that HTX DAO has, for the first time, truly returned the listing decision power to the community, supporting the $HTX value. By leveraging community consensus to identify trending project tokens, HTX DAO enhances the market depth and fee income of the HTX exchange. 50% of this revenue is then used to repurchase and burn $HTX, thereby creating continuous deflation and sustained value support. This cycle of “voting, listing, trading, circulation, burning/redistribution” creates a decentralized paradigm where DAO governance directly maps to market efficiency, giving real economic meaning to the vision of the People’s Exchange. HTX DAO is now implementing its Listing Governance 2.0 initiative, which integrates on-chain voting directly with HTX’s voting system to maximize participant inclusion. More incentives, such as “voting subsidies,” are under exploration to attract wider governance participation. HTX DAO’s Second Evolution: Building a Coherent On-Chain Financial System In 2025, HTX DAO began transforming from a decentralized autonomous organization into a fully-fledged, self-sustaining, and extensible on-chain financial infrastructure. The updated whitepaper clarifies $HTX’s evolution in the three directions: governance credential, yield credential, and burning mechanism. This not only marks a systematic upgrade to the HTX DAO’s economic model but also signifies its pivot toward anchoring long-term value in real-world use cases and on-chain strategic returns. $HTX has evolved from just a governance token to a financial hub asset that unites trading, incentives, governance, and cross-chain integration. Key modules include: ● Staking: Establishes value anchoring with quantifiable governance rewards. ● Voting: Aligns decision-making power with dynamic incentives. ● Points System: Maps user behavior into measurable contribution value. ● Treasury: Handles fund inflows, allocation, and regeneration, giving HTX DAO long-term financial sustainability. Importantly, HTX DAO is expanding beyond internal governance and has launched a builder ecosystem. In September, the DAO initiated a global developer program to support builders with resources, applications, and governance access. This program focuses on integrating CeFi and DeFi and promoting the interoperability of decentralized exchanges and on-chain applications. Through these efforts, HTX DAO is turning on-chain governance into an economic infrastructure, injecting sustainable autonomy and growth momentum into the $HTX ecosystem. Anchoring Global Hubs: HTX DAO’s Web3 World Tour HTX DAO’s vision is not limited to the blockchain but also resonates in the physical world. In 2025, HTX DAO appeared across the world’s most influential Web3 stages, bringing decentralization from code to culture. From the Hong Kong Web3 Conference and HTX DAO x TRON Hong Kong Night, to the Blockchain Forum in CIS, to the HTX DAO Dubai Night and Istanbul Blockchain Week, and further to the Bitcoin 2025 and TOKEN2049 Singapore Afterparty, HTX DAO attended nearly every critical Web3 conference this year. On these global stages, HTX DAO demonstrated its ability to create a self-sustaining loop across governance, assets, and ecosystem collaboration, attracting builders worldwide into an open, user-driven financial system. This organic, bottom-up model is positioning HTX DAO as a global movement for decentralization. The world is watching as a truly user-driven financial and governance ecosystem takes shape on the blockchain. Toward a Sustainable Cycle of Autonomy and Growth Information released by HTX DAO outlines its next phase, a roadmap centered on continuous evolution. 1. Listing Governance as New Normal HTX DAO will continue optimizing its voting system to establish a consistent listing routine where outcomes directly shape HTX Exchange’s listing strategy and resource allocation. This will achieve a dynamic, collaborative model where the “community truly leads the market.” 2. Expanded DeFi Integration With staking and governance already in place, HTX DAO will expand $HTX’s utility across DeFi by rolling out on-chain Earn, staking yield aggregators, and other modules that form a visible, user-driven growth cycle. 3. Building Developer Ecosystem The DAO is preparing HTX Builder Grants and a global hackathon program to support builders, focusing on governance and data tools, liquidity/market-making infrastructure, risk management and trading analysis systems, mobile wallets, AI-driven trading, and DeFi solutions. Through funding, joint promotion, and ecosystem incubation, HTX DAO aims to enable more builders to directly participate in the co-construction of on-chain infrastructure and governance mechanisms. 4. CeFi and DeFi Integration Leveraging the HTX exchange as the entry point, the DAO will build seamless interoperability, where accounts become governance identities, assets become credentials, and all economic flows are on-chain verifiable. HTX DAO aims to merge CeFi’s security and liquidity with DeFi’s openness and transparency into a unified financial super gateway. It is not just refining an autonomous system, but building a free financial port where users share governance, value, and trust. In an era where trust is rewritten by algorithms and power shifts through voting rights, HTX DAO demonstrates a profound truth that autonomy is not the breakdown of order but the rebirth of order. From exchange infrastructure to financial architecture, HTX DAO is moving toward a future where everyone can participate, verify, and benefit. It is the future that may well represent Web3’s final destination.

A massive crypto fraud scheme in South Korea has exposed the dark side of digital investments, leaving hundreds of victims facing devastating financial losses. Police in Busan have uncovered one of the largest investment scams in recent history, revealing critical lessons for all cryptocurrency investors. What Made This Crypto Fraud Scheme So Effective? The perpetrators behind this sophisticated crypto fraud scheme used clever psychological tactics to lure investors. They promised guaranteed principal protection and unusually high returns, creating an illusion of safety while targeting vulnerable investors. This approach made their crypto fraud scheme particularly dangerous because it appealed to both cautious and ambitious investors simultaneously. Between October 2023 and April 2025, the group managed to convince 284 people to invest in their fraudulent scheme. The scale of this crypto fraud scheme reached an astonishing 24.5 billion won, equivalent to approximately $17.8 million. The operation demonstrates how organized criminal groups are evolving their methods to exploit the growing cryptocurrency market. How Did Authorities Uncover This Elaborate Crypto Fraud Scheme? South Korean police conducted an extensive investigation that led to the dramatic arrest of 118 individuals and detention of 28 key suspects. The breakthrough came after multiple victims reported suspicious activities and inconsistent returns from their investments. Law enforcement agencies employed advanced tracking methods to follow the digital money trail across various cryptocurrency platforms. The investigation revealed that the criminals operated a complex network targeting both cryptocurrency and unlisted stocks. This dual approach made the crypto fraud scheme appear more legitimate to potential investors. Authorities noted that the group used sophisticated marketing techniques and professional-looking materials to build trust with their victims. What Can Investors Learn From This Crypto Fraud Scheme? This case highlights several red flags that every investor should recognize. Understanding these warning signs can help you avoid falling victim to similar crypto fraud schemes in the future. Guaranteed returns: No legitimate investment can promise guaranteed profits, especially in volatile markets like cryptocurrency Unregistered investments: The scheme involved unlisted stocks, which typically lack proper regulatory oversight Pressure tactics: Victims reported being pressured to invest quickly before ‘opportunities disappeared’ Complex explanations: The operators used technical jargon to confuse investors about how returns were generated Moreover, this crypto fraud scheme demonstrates the importance of conducting thorough due diligence before investing. Always verify the credentials of investment advisors and check if they’re registered with financial regulatory authorities. Why Are Crypto Fraud Schemes Becoming More Common? The rising popularity of cryptocurrency investments has created fertile ground for fraudulent activities. Several factors contribute to the increasing prevalence of crypto fraud schemes worldwide. First, the relative anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions makes it easier for criminals to operate without immediate detection. Second, many new investors lack the experience to identify sophisticated scams. Third, the rapid growth and complexity of the crypto market create confusion that fraudsters exploit. This particular crypto fraud scheme in South Korea serves as a stark reminder that regulatory frameworks are still catching up with technological advancements in digital finance. However, authorities worldwide are strengthening their capabilities to detect and prevent such crimes. How Can You Protect Yourself From Crypto Fraud Schemes? Protecting yourself requires a combination of education, caution, and verification. Here are essential steps every investor should take. Research investment opportunities thoroughly before committing funds Verify the registration status of investment platforms with financial authorities Be skeptical of promises that seem too good to be true Consult with independent financial advisors before making significant investments Monitor your investments regularly and question unexpected changes Remember that legitimate investment opportunities never pressure you to make quick decisions. Take your time to understand exactly what you’re investing in and how returns are generated. The Bottom Line: Staying Safe in the Crypto World The South Korean crypto fraud scheme case demonstrates both the sophistication of modern financial crimes and the effectiveness of law enforcement response. While the arrests bring some justice to the victims, the financial losses highlight the permanent damage such schemes can cause. As cryptocurrency continues to evolve, so must our awareness and protective measures. By staying informed and cautious, investors can participate in the digital economy while minimizing their exposure to fraudulent activities. The key lesson from this crypto fraud scheme is clear: if an investment opportunity seems perfect, it probably isn’t real. Frequently Asked Questions What was the main tactic used in this crypto fraud scheme? The criminals promised guaranteed principal protection and high returns on investments in cryptocurrency and unlisted stocks, creating a false sense of security for investors. How many people were affected by this investment scam? Approximately 284 investors lost money in this scheme, with total losses reaching $17.8 million over an 18-month period. What should I do if I suspect a crypto fraud scheme? Immediately contact your local financial regulatory authority and law enforcement agencies. Also, cease all transactions and document all communications with the suspected fraudsters. Are cryptocurrency investments inherently risky? While all investments carry some risk, cryptocurrency markets are particularly volatile. However, legitimate crypto investments differ significantly from fraudulent schemes that promise guaranteed returns. How can I verify if an investment opportunity is legitimate? Check with financial regulatory authorities to confirm the registration status of the company and individuals involved. Also, research independent reviews and consult with licensed financial advisors. What penalties do perpetrators of crypto fraud schemes face? Convictions can result in severe penalties including imprisonment, substantial fines, and restitution payments to victims. The specific penalties vary by jurisdiction and the scale of the fraud.

Amid this decisive breakdown, the RSI is quietly flashing a bullish divergence, a subtle but meaningful early signal that momentum may be preparing to shift. The charts now paint a tense picture: bearish pressure remains dominant, but the first signs of a potential turnaround have appeared. Support Levels Crumble As Bitcoin Extends Its Downtrend According to an update shared by Crypto Candy on X, Bitcoin continues to break through support levels with little hesitation. The price held the $93,000–$95,000 zone for a brief period, but eventually failed to maintain that structure, triggering another move to the downside. The speed of each breakdown highlights how fragile market sentiment currently is. Related Reading: Bitcoin SSR Flashes Buy Signal: Rebound Incoming? With the most recent support now lost, Bitcoin has slipped to lower levels and remains under bearish pressure. If this momentum persists, Crypto Candy noted that the next area of interest lies between $86,000 and $87,500, a major support where buyers may attempt to slow or halt the decline. Should Bitcoin manage to hold within this $86,000–$87,500 range, a short-term reversal becomes possible. Even a modest bounce could provide temporary relief to the broader downtrend. However, such a reaction would still require confirmation before hinting at any sustainable shift in momentum. If that support fails to hold, Crypto Candy warns that the market could face another steep drop. A continued breakdown would reinforce the ongoing bearish narrative, opening the door for what he described as a “waterfall” scenario. Bullish Divergence Emerges On The 4H Chart Crypto analyst Chad recently noted in an X post that Bitcoin is showing a notable bullish divergence between its price action and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) on the 4-hour chart. This divergence is a technical signal where the price makes a lower low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: This Indicator Signals SELL, Could History Repeat With A 67% Drop? Chad acknowledges that the price is clearly in a short-term downtrend and will need to reverse at some point. While he admits he doesn’t know the exact timing of the reversal, he emphasizes that the bullish divergence is the first positive sign that sellers are losing control and a structural shift may be near. To officially switch the short-term market structure back to bullish, Chad outlines a simple progression: the price needs to first make a higher high to break the current downtrend, and then confirm that break by establishing a higher low. This sequence is necessary to confirm that buyers have successfully taken over directional control of the price.

A Kraken spokesperson confirmed the round to Fortune , calling it a strategic investment from the nearly 25-year-old market maker. This new cash comes only weeks after Kraken closed a separate $600m financing in September at a $15b valuation. That earlier round drew a roster of Wall Street and Silicon Valley names, including Jane Street, DRW, HSG, Oppenheimer, Tribe Capital and the family office of Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi. Sethi confirmed the funding round in an X post on Wednesday. Kraken Confirmed Its Earlier $600M Raise, Lifting Total Recent Funding To $800M Further, Kraken publicly confirmed the $600m raise for the first time, after Bloomberg reported in September that the exchange was eyeing a $20b valuation from a strategic backer. Citadel Securities plans to work with Kraken on risk management and market structure analysis among other initiatives, according to a statement Fortune shared. The deal marks a clear shift for Citadel. The Ken Griffin-founded firm had largely stayed away from making markets on crypto exchanges or investing directly in digital assets, citing regulatory uncertainty in the US. After Donald Trump took office in January, the company began preparing to transact on platforms such as Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com . Kraken Builds Balance Sheet Ahead of IPO as Citadel Expands Digital Asset Footprint Citadel’s latest moves go beyond Kraken. Earlier this month, Ripple said it raised $500m from Citadel, Fortress Investment Group and other investors, signalling broader interest from traditional finance in established crypto infrastructure. For Kraken, the two recent rounds, totaling $800m, significantly strengthen its balance sheet before an initial public offering targeted for next year. The exchange plans to use the capital to expand into markets outside North America and to build new payments products. The company has also been active on the acquisition front. Since January, Kraken has announced a string of deals, including its $1.5b purchase of futures trading platform NinjaTrader, reinforcing its push into derivatives and more sophisticated trading tools. Citadel’s Move Reflects Wall Street’s View That Crypto Trading Infrastructure Is Here to Stay Before these transactions, Kraken had raised only $27m in venture capital, relatively modest funding for one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. The latest capital injections move it into a different league and align it more closely with mainstream financial institutions. Kraken is now preparing for a public listing as early as 2026. Bloomberg reported that the company is working with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to lead the offering, positioning the Wyoming-based exchange as one of the next big crypto names to test public markets. For the digital asset industry, Citadel Securities’ $200m bet on Kraken signals that major market makers see lasting demand for regulated trading venues, even after a brutal bear market and a series of high-profile failures. The new valuation also shows that top-tier exchanges can still command double-digit billion price tags when they can demonstrate global scale and a clear path to profitability.

According to reports, the group says the effort is timed to influence lawmaking and political contests ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Key hires and early activity in several states mark a clear shift from Washington-focused lobbying to hands-on state work. State Network Targets Lawmakers And Local Groups The Network will be led in part by Anastasia Dellaccio , who has been named Executive Director Of State & Regional Affairs. Based on reports, Cody Carbone, the group’s CEO, said the aim is to educate elected officials and staff at state capitals. The program reportedly began activity in four states — New York, Arizona, Ohio, and New Hampshire — and will expand its reach through a planned 2026 Digital Asset Tour. Small grants are part of the plan; a micro-grants program is set to kick off in 2026 to fund state blockchain associations, university blockchain clubs, and community innovation groups. Partnerships And Political Timing Reports have disclosed that The Digital Chamber is partnering with the Future Caucus to reach younger and rising officials. The partnership is described as a way to introduce lawmakers to industry players and to provide training and materials on crypto policy. That timing matters because the initiative is explicitly tied to the 2026 midterms. Organizers say they want more lawmakers at every level to understand, and in many cases support, policies favorable to digital assets. The strategy blends education with political organizing. It also means the effort will operate in a political arena as much as a policy one. A Grassroots Funding Angle We’re thrilled to welcome our inaugural members: @Hedera , @Strategy , @Trondao , @InputOutputHK , and @Cryptocom . pic.twitter.com/Q2NJU9ZNm5 — The Digital Chamber (@DigitalChamber) November 17, 2025 Micro-grants aim to build local networks of supporters and educators. Reports indicate these grants will back small state groups and university teams that can speak about blockchain to lawmakers and communities. Organizers say this is about building capacity at the state level rather than just spending in national races. Some of the groups expected to benefit are grassroots associations and campus clubs that host public events or briefings. The Digital Chamber says the first members of the new network include Michael Saylor’s company Strategy , the Hedera network, which uses proof-of-stake, and Input Output, a company that works on blockchain research and infrastructure.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,150 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next key resistance is near the $3,220 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. A clear move above the $3,250 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,150 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,065 level.

This marks the fifth consecutive day of withdrawals, raising questions about institutional confidence in Bitcoin ETFs during current market conditions. What’s Driving the Bitcoin ETFs Exodus? The outflow pattern shows significant movement away from major Bitcoin ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s IBIT, which experienced a staggering $513 million single-day withdrawal. This substantial movement represents one of the largest single-day outflows since these Bitcoin ETFs launched, indicating potential institutional repositioning. However, the situation isn’t entirely bleak. Grayscale’s GBTC provided some balance with a $139 million net inflow, while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw a modest $10 million inflow. These contrasting flows suggest that investors are being selective rather than abandoning Bitcoin ETFs entirely. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Facing Such Pressure? Several factors could explain the current outflow pattern from Bitcoin ETFs: Market volatility concerns affecting institutional risk appetite Portfolio rebalancing as year-end approaches Profit-taking following recent price movements Regulatory uncertainty impacting investment decisions The consecutive withdrawal days from Bitcoin ETFs highlight how sensitive these investment vehicles are to market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETFs Investors? For current investors in Bitcoin ETFs, these flows serve as important market indicators. The mixed activity—with some funds experiencing outflows while others see inflows—suggests that the Bitcoin ETFs market is maturing rather than collapsing. Investment professionals monitoring Bitcoin ETFs should consider: Diversification across multiple Bitcoin ETFs Long-term perspective despite short-term fluctuations Monitoring institutional sentiment through flow data Understanding each Bitcoin ETF’s unique characteristics Will Bitcoin ETFs Recover From This Outflow Trend? Historical data shows that Bitcoin ETFs often experience cyclical flow patterns. While five consecutive days of outflows might seem alarming, it’s important to remember that Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated resilience through previous market cycles. The presence of continued inflows into some Bitcoin ETFs, particularly GBTC, indicates that not all institutional investors are retreating. This mixed sentiment suggests that the future of Bitcoin ETFs remains promising, though potentially volatile. Key Takeaways for Bitcoin ETFs Market Participants The recent $363 million net outflow from Bitcoin ETFs serves as a crucial reminder about market dynamics. While BlackRock’s IBIT led the withdrawals, the partial offset by other Bitcoin ETFs shows that the market is finding its equilibrium. Investors should view these Bitcoin ETFs flows as part of normal market mechanics rather than panic indicators. The diversity of responses across different Bitcoin ETFs actually demonstrates market sophistication and varied investment strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the massive outflow from BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF? The $513 million outflow likely resulted from institutional rebalancing, profit-taking, or specific large investors adjusting their positions in response to market conditions. Are Bitcoin ETFs still a good investment despite these outflows? Yes, Bitcoin ETFs remain viable long-term investments. Short-term flows don’t necessarily reflect long-term value, and the presence of inflows into other Bitcoin ETFs shows continued interest. How often do Bitcoin ETFs experience such significant outflows? Significant outflows occur periodically, typically during market uncertainty or when large institutional investors rebalance their portfolios. These events are normal in evolving markets. Should I be concerned about investing in Bitcoin ETFs now? While due diligence is always important, these flows represent normal market activity rather than fundamental issues with Bitcoin ETFs as an investment vehicle. What’s the difference between the various Bitcoin ETFs mentioned? Different Bitcoin ETFs have varying fee structures, management approaches, and tracking methods, though they all provide exposure to Bitcoin’s price movement. How can I track Bitcoin ETFs flow data myself? Several financial data providers and cryptocurrency analytics platforms offer daily flow tracking for Bitcoin ETFs, allowing investors to monitor institutional sentiment.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The downtrend pressure is fading, but bulls must reclaim $0.0000599 to confirm recovery. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of November 19, the 1-day price chart shows Floki drifting along a soft downtrend. Today’s candle around $0.0000537 suggests sellers are losing strength. FLOKI’s price remains pinned beneath the mid-band at $0.0000599, indicating that bulls have not yet reclaimed control. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Overall, momentum remains fragile, with the MACD line hovering slightly below the signal line in a shallow negative zone. This signals fading bearish momentum rather than a fresh down-leg forming. The RSI at 38 indicates that Floki is recovering from oversold conditions. If the market reacts positively, the first profit-taking zone emerges at $0.0000595–$0.0000600, aligned with the middle Bollinger Band. A stronger move could extend toward $0.0000710, but only if price decisively reclaims the mid-band. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour time frame, Floki is showing mild consolidation after a brief bullish push that stalled at $0.0000544, the current upper alligator band resistance. The market is now drifting sideways near $0.0000537, reflecting indecision. The alligator lines are tightening, indicating a coiling phase that often precedes a directional breakout. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The Balance of Power remains negative at –0.32, confirming buyers are not fully committed. Yet PVT is stabilizing and no longer plunging, suggesting selling volume has tapered off. This mix produces an uncertain but cautiously constructive short-term environment.

Traders can expect sideways trading with a slight bullish bias if support holds, with a potential test of $0.0000595 in the coming sessions. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Recent data reveals a concerning trend as U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their sixth consecutive day of net outflows, totaling $74.68 million on November 18. This persistent withdrawal pattern raises important questions about the current state of Ethereum ETF investments and market sentiment. What’s Driving the Ethereum ETF Outflows? The primary driver behind these significant outflows appears to be BlackRock’s ETHA fund, which experienced a staggering $165.52 million in withdrawals. This massive exit from one of the largest Ethereum ETF providers indicates shifting investor confidence in the short-term prospects of Ethereum-based investment products. However, the story isn’t entirely negative across the board. Several other Ethereum ETF providers actually saw inflows during the same period, creating a more nuanced picture of the market. The outflows from BlackRock’s fund were partially offset by positive movements in other Ethereum ETF products, suggesting that while some investors are pulling back, others remain committed to Ethereum exposure through different vehicles. Which Ethereum ETFs Are Bucking the Trend? Despite the overall negative flow pattern, several Ethereum ETF products demonstrated resilience and even attracted new investments. Here are the key performers that managed to draw inflows: Grayscale’s Mini ETH : $62.39 million in inflows Bitwise’s ETHW : $19.10 million in new investments Franklin Templeton’s EZET : $4.76 million added VanEck’s ETHV : $4.59 million in positive flows These inflows indicate that while the overall Ethereum ETF market is experiencing pressure, specific products continue to maintain investor interest. The diversity in performance across different Ethereum ETF providers highlights the importance of fund-specific factors beyond just the underlying Ethereum asset. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? The six-day outflow streak for Ethereum ETFs represents the longest continuous withdrawal period since these products launched. This trend could signal several market dynamics at play. Some analysts suggest that investors might be rotating into other cryptocurrency opportunities or traditional assets amid market uncertainty. However, it’s crucial to recognize that Ethereum ETF flows don’t necessarily reflect the fundamental health of the Ethereum network itself. The underlying blockchain continues to see robust development activity and growing adoption across various sectors. The Ethereum ETF market movements might be more indicative of short-term trading strategies rather than long-term conviction in Ethereum’s value proposition. How Should You Approach Ethereum ETF Investing Now? For current and prospective Ethereum ETF investors, this period of outflows presents both challenges and opportunities. Consider these key factors when evaluating your Ethereum ETF strategy: Diversification matters : The varying performance across different Ethereum ETF products underscores the importance of not putting all your eggs in one basket Long-term perspective : Ethereum ETF investments should align with your overall investment horizon and risk tolerance Monitor fee structures : Different Ethereum ETF providers charge varying management fees that can impact returns Stay informed : Regular monitoring of flow data and market developments can help you make timely decisions The current Ethereum ETF outflow situation serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investments, even through regulated products like ETFs, remain subject to market volatility and shifting investor sentiment. While six days of outflows might seem alarming, it’s essential to view this within the broader context of Ethereum’s development trajectory and the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency investment products. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the Ethereum ETF outflows? The outflows were primarily driven by significant withdrawals from BlackRock’s ETHA fund, which saw $165.52 million exit. This suggests some institutional investors or large holders are reducing their Ethereum ETF exposure. Are all Ethereum ETFs experiencing outflows? No, while the overall market saw net outflows, several Ethereum ETF products actually experienced inflows, including Grayscale’s Mini ETH, Bitwise’s ETHW, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, and VanEck’s ETHV. How long has this outflow trend been happening? The data shows six consecutive trading days of net outflows, making this the longest continuous withdrawal period for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs since their launch. Should I be concerned about my Ethereum ETF investments? While the outflows warrant attention, they don’t necessarily indicate problems with Ethereum itself. Market flows can be influenced by many factors including profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or short-term market sentiment. What’s the difference between these Ethereum ETFs? Different Ethereum ETF providers offer varying fee structures, liquidity, and tracking methodologies. Some may use different strategies for managing the underlying Ethereum exposure. Where can I find updated Ethereum ETF flow data? Regular updates on Ethereum ETF flows are available through financial data providers, cryptocurrency news platforms, and the fund providers’ official websites.

In just 24 hours, the market saw massive shifts, with Bitcoin leading at $215 million in liquidations. This volatility highlights the risks and opportunities in crypto trading, making it crucial to understand how these events unfold and impact your portfolio. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Crypto futures liquidations occur when traders’ positions are forcibly closed due to insufficient margin. This happens during sharp price movements, amplifying market volatility. For instance, when Bitcoin’s price swings, leveraged positions can trigger a cascade of liquidations, affecting overall market sentiment. Understanding this process helps traders manage risk and avoid unexpected losses. Breaking Down the 24-Hour Crypto Futures Liquidations Data The recent data reveals staggering figures. Bitcoin faced $215 million in liquidations, with 77.71% of these being long positions. Ethereum followed with $89.05 million, evenly split between longs and shorts. Zecoin saw $15.65 million, slightly favoring longs. These numbers show how leveraged trading can lead to significant liquidations during market turbulence. Bitcoin: $215 million liquidated (77.71% longs) Ethereum: $89.05 million liquidated (50.95% longs) Zecoin: $15.65 million liquidated (51.84% longs) How Can Traders Navigate Crypto Futures Liquidations? To mitigate risks from crypto futures liquidations, traders should use stop-loss orders and monitor leverage ratios. Diversifying assets and staying updated on market news can also help. For example, setting tighter margins during high volatility periods reduces exposure to sudden price drops. Moreover, learning from past liquidation events provides actionable insights for future strategies. The Impact of Crypto Futures Liquidations on Market Trends Large-scale crypto futures liquidations often lead to increased selling pressure, driving prices lower. This can create buying opportunities for savvy investors. However, it also underscores the importance of risk management. By analyzing liquidation patterns, traders can anticipate market moves and adjust their positions accordingly. In summary, crypto futures liquidations are a critical aspect of market dynamics, offering both warnings and opportunities. Staying informed and proactive is key to navigating these volatile events successfully. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidations? They occur when a trader’s margin falls below the required level due to price movements, forcing automatic closure of positions. How can I avoid being liquidated in crypto futures? Use stop-loss orders, maintain adequate margin, and avoid excessive leverage during volatile periods. Why are long positions often liquidated more? In downtrends, falling prices hit long positions harder, as traders bet on price increases that don’t materialize. Do liquidations affect crypto prices? Yes, large liquidations can increase selling pressure, leading to further price declines in a cascading effect. What tools help monitor crypto futures liquidations? Platforms like CoinGlass provide real-time data on liquidations across exchanges. Is it safe to trade during high liquidation events? It carries higher risk; cautious traders may wait for stability, while others see it as a chance for strategic entries. Found this guide on crypto futures liquidations helpful?

Injective just dropped a major announcement that’s set to revolutionize their ecosystem. The much-anticipated INJ community buyback program officially launches on November 20, marking a significant milestone for token holders and the entire Injective community. What Exactly is the INJ Community Buyback? The INJ community buyback represents a strategic initiative where Injective systematically purchases INJ tokens from the open market. This approach directly benefits the community by reducing circulating supply while increasing token scarcity. Moreover, it demonstrates the project’s commitment to long-term value creation and ecosystem stability. Why Should You Care About This Buyback Program? This innovative INJ community buyback program offers multiple advantages for investors and ecosystem participants. First, it creates natural buying pressure in the market. Second, it reinforces confidence in the project’s fundamentals. Third, it aligns perfectly with decentralized governance principles that Injective champions. The program’s timing couldn’t be better. With the crypto market showing renewed vigor, this strategic move positions INJ for potential upward momentum. The November 20 start date gives community members ample time to understand the mechanics and implications. How Does the Buyback Process Actually Work? Understanding the INJ community buyback mechanics is crucial for every stakeholder. The process involves several key steps: Regular market purchases of INJ tokens Transparent reporting of all transactions Community involvement in decision-making Strategic timing to maximize impact This systematic approach ensures the buyback serves its intended purpose without causing market disruptions. The transparency aspect is particularly important, as it builds trust and demonstrates the project’s commitment to fair practices. What Makes This Buyback Different From Others? Unlike traditional corporate buybacks, the INJ community buyback emphasizes decentralized participation. The community plays an active role in guiding the process, making it truly revolutionary in the cryptocurrency space. This approach aligns with Web3 principles while delivering tangible value to token holders. The program’s structure also considers long-term sustainability. Rather than being a one-time event, it’s designed as an ongoing initiative that adapts to market conditions and community needs. This flexibility ensures the buyback remains effective regardless of market volatility. What Does This Mean for INJ’s Future? The INJ community buyback signals strong fundamental strength and project confidence. It demonstrates that Injective has sufficient treasury resources to execute such programs while continuing ecosystem development.

According to crypto entrepreneur Mike Alfred, this scenario describes the current US approach to Bitcoin. The United States government appears reluctant to build its Bitcoin stockpile until international pressure forces its hand. This cautious stance could have significant implications for global financial dominance. Why Won’t the US Build a Bitcoin Stockpile Immediately? Mike Alfred recently shared his insights on the CoinStories podcast, explaining the US government’s hesitation. He believes America will only begin accumulating Bitcoin when other nations create sufficient external pressure. The current approach suggests a reactive rather than proactive strategy toward digital asset reserves. Several factors contribute to this cautious stance: Regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency classification Traditional financial system dominance creating complacency Political considerations affecting bold monetary moves Risk assessment favoring established reserve assets What Triggers Will Force US Bitcoin Accumulation? Alfred identifies clear catalysts that could push America toward building its Bitcoin stockpile. When other countries demonstrate significant BTC acquisition patterns, the US will face mounting pressure to respond. This global competition resembles a high-stakes game of financial chess where early movers gain strategic advantages. The timing remains uncertain, but the triggers are becoming increasingly visible. Nations like El Salvador have already made Bitcoin legal tender, while others are exploring central bank digital currencies. Each move by another country adds to the pressure on US policymakers to reconsider their Bitcoin stockpile strategy. How Does Global Adoption Affect Bitcoin’s Future? Alfred projects an ambitious future for Bitcoin, predicting it could reach $1 million by 2033. By that time, he expects most countries will hold the asset either directly or indirectly through various financial instruments. This widespread adoption would fundamentally reshape global finance and reserve currency dynamics. The path to this future involves several key developments: Institutional adoption accelerating mainstream acceptance Regulatory clarity emerging across major economies Technological infrastructure supporting secure storage Global economic shifts driving alternative reserve assets What Are the Risks of Delaying Bitcoin Acquisition? Waiting too long to build a national Bitcoin stockpile carries significant risks. Early-adopting nations could gain substantial financial advantages and influence in the emerging digital economy. The US might face higher acquisition costs and reduced geopolitical leverage if it delays its entry into the Bitcoin reserve market. Moreover, the window for strategic positioning is narrowing. As more countries announce their Bitcoin stockpile initiatives, the remaining available supply becomes increasingly scarce and expensive. This creates a first-mover advantage that latecomers cannot easily overcome. Conclusion: The Inevitable Shift Toward Bitcoin Reserves The US approach to Bitcoin reserves reflects a broader pattern in technological adoption—initial skepticism followed by reactive adaptation. However, in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, this cautious strategy might prove costly. As global pressure mounts and other nations accelerate their Bitcoin stockpile programs, America will likely find itself compelled to join the digital gold rush. The transition toward national Bitcoin holdings appears inevitable. The only question remains whether the US will lead this transformation or follow reluctantly. Either way, the coming decade will witness a fundamental reshaping of how nations store and protect their wealth. Frequently Asked Questions Why is the US hesitant to stockpile Bitcoin? The US maintains caution due to regulatory uncertainties, dominance of traditional financial systems, and political considerations that favor established reserve assets over emerging digital currencies. What countries are currently building Bitcoin reserves? Several nations have started accumulating Bitcoin, with El Salvador making it legal tender and other countries exploring central bank digital currency initiatives that incorporate Bitcoin exposure. How much Bitcoin could the US potentially acquire? While specific amounts remain speculative, a national Bitcoin stockpile could range from symbolic holdings to significant percentages of national reserves, depending on policy decisions and market conditions. What happens if the US delays Bitcoin acquisition too long? Delaying could result in higher acquisition costs, reduced geopolitical influence in digital finance, and missed opportunities for early-mover advantages in the evolving global financial system. How reliable are Bitcoin price predictions like the $1 million forecast? While expert predictions provide valuable insights, cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile. Price forecasts should be considered as informed speculation rather than guaranteed outcomes. Can other cryptocurrencies compete with Bitcoin for national reserves? While other digital assets exist, Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, network security, and widespread recognition make it the primary candidate for national reserve status among cryptocurrencies.

Despite that shock, he insisted that Ethereum’s core investment story remains intact. Will Ethereum Bottom This Week? For Lee, that story centers on Ethereum as neutral infrastructure for tokenization and stablecoins, increasingly relevant as Wall Street intensifies its on-chain ambitions. “There are stablecoin creations. Larry Fink and BlackRock and Wall Street want to tokenize assets, bring stocks, bonds, real estate onto the blockchain. And they have to find a neutral 100% uptime blockchain. That’s Ethereum. And that’s the fundamental story,” he said. Related Reading: Ethereum Approaches Historical Accumulation Level – Just 8% Away From LTH Cost Basis Lee framed crypto’s extreme volatility as structurally tied to how the market values long-term innovation rather than as a sign of fundamental weakness. “The price, of course, for Ethereum will fluctuate because crypto is hyper volatile. In fact, it’s kind of a… it’s sort of a feature of the blockchain itself,” he noted. “Crypto suffered from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and crypto discounts the future, that’s why it’s volatile, but it still looks pretty attractive here.” He placed the current move in the context of a broader risk-off environment and a continuing correction across digital assets. According to Lee, macro data remains a crucial driver of crypto cycles, particularly for Bitcoin. “The most correlated factor to Bitcoin prices when you see it… at a peak actually is the ISM,” he said, referring to US activity surveys. “So I think we’re still in a correction phase of crypto.” Asked specifically what underpins his bullish view on Ethereum now, Lee pointed to two structural “floor” mechanisms. First, he cited the value of assets locked on the Ethereum blockchain. “Ethereum kind of has several ways that it establishes a floor. One is the value of all the assets locked onto the blockchain, and that number is growing,” he said. “Historically, Ethereum bottoms when that ratio is about 50%. So I’d say we’re pretty close to that level. That’s why I think Ethereum is probably bottoming this week.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Rare Oversold Signal As Price Hits Demand Zone — Major Rebound Loading? Second, he highlighted Ethereum’s valuation relative to Bitcoin, using both price and network value. “The other way to look at Ethereum is really its price ratio or even its network value ratio to Bitcoin. It currently sits at 0.032,” Lee said. “The long-term average, like the eight-year average, if we were just to trade to that eight-year average, would put Ethereum at around $12,000.” On that basis, Lee characterized Ethereum as undervalued versus its historical relationship with Bitcoin. “So I think Ethereum is undervalued because number one, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year. But two, we’re getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain,” he argued. Summarizing Lee’s stance, the CNBC host concluded: “Tom Lee saying that Ethereum is bottoming this week.” Lee did not offer a specific price target or an exact day, but his message was clear: in his view, Ethereum is close to completing its correction as on-chain value and relative valuation metrics converge toward levels that have historically marked major bottoms. At press time, ETH traded at $3,018.

Bitcoin Spot ETFs Are Experiencing Their Second-Largest Drawdown Ever In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about how the holdings attached to the US Bitcoin spot ETFs are currently looking. Spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that allow an investor to gain exposure to an underlying asset’s price movements without having to directly own said asset. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this means that the ETF holder never has to interact with a digital asset exchange or make any transactions on the blockchain; the fund buys and holds the coin on their behalf. Spot ETFs are a relatively recent phenomenon in the sector, having received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) only in January of last year. Despite them being new, these investment vehicles have grown into one of the cornerstones of the market, tapping into the demand from traditional investors who were previously reluctant to trade on-chain. Given the relevance of the spot ETFs, the trend in their holdings can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may reflect the sentiment among institutional entities. One way to do so is by measuring where these funds stand relative to their ATH. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows how the drawdown from the ATH currently looks for the Bitcoin spot ETFs: From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin spot ETFs saw their USD holdings reach an ATH in October, but since then, they have been facing a sustained drawdown. Last month, the drawdown was still limited, but the outflows accompanying the price crash have meant ETF holdings are now significantly down compared to the peak. More specifically, spot ETF holdings are currently down a whopping $3.29 billion, the second-largest drawdown since last year’s launch. The only phase during which the metric’s value was higher was the bearish period between February and April. Back then, ETFs saw a peak drawdown of $4.8 billion. The latest decline in ETF holdings is still notably below this mark, so it only remains to be seen whether the drawdown will deepen in the near future. In some other news, Strategy made a large purchase on Monday, but the continued decline in the Bitcoin price has already pushed the treasury firm’s new acquisition significantly into the red. According to CryptoQuant , the combination of this move and the price drop has resulted in about 40% of the company’s reserves now sitting underwater. BTC Price Bitcoin slipped under $90,000 just earlier, but the coin has since bounced back to $91,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF Drawdown|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 04:00:29

Many investors believe Bitcoin serves as a leading indicator for stocks, but recent analysis reveals this might be a dangerous assumption. Let’s explore why the Bitcoin leading indicator theory doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Leading Indicator? A leading indicator typically predicts future economic trends. Some market watchers claim Bitcoin’s price movements foreshadow stock market performance. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has thoroughly debunked this popular misconception. His research shows that Bitcoin’s performance doesn’t reliably signal where stocks are headed. Why Bitcoin Isn’t Predicting Stock Market Moves Balchunas presents compelling evidence against the Bitcoin leading indicator theory. After examining historical data, he discovered something surprising. When Bitcoin declines for one month, the S&P 500 actually has a 62% probability of rising. This directly contradicts the idea that Bitcoin predicts stock market downturns. Consider these key findings: One-month Bitcoin declines don’t correlate with stock market drops The S&P 500 often moves independently of cryptocurrency trends Historical data shows stocks can rise while Bitcoin falls What This Means for Your Investment Strategy Understanding that Bitcoin isn’t a reliable leading indicator changes how you should approach market analysis. Don’t make the mistake of using Bitcoin price movements to predict stock performance. Each market operates with different drivers and influences. Key takeaways for investors: Diversify your analysis – Look at multiple indicators Understand market differences – Cryptocurrency and stocks have unique characteristics Avoid false correlations – Just because two assets move doesn’t mean they’re connected The Real Relationship Between Bitcoin and Stocks While Bitcoin and stocks sometimes move together during major market events, this doesn’t make Bitcoin a leading indicator. Both markets respond to broader economic factors, but their reactions can be completely different. The Bitcoin leading indicator theory oversimplifies a complex relationship. Remember these important points: Correlation doesn’t equal causation Short-term movements rarely predict long-term trends Market timing based on Bitcoin performance is risky Expert Insights: Why the Myth Persists Despite clear evidence against the Bitcoin leading indicator theory, why do so many investors still believe it? The answer lies in human psychology and confirmation bias. People tend to remember when Bitcoin and stocks move together while forgetting when they move apart. Balchunas emphasizes that investors need to base decisions on data, not popular myths. The Bitcoin leading indicator concept might sound appealing, but it doesn’t stand up to statistical analysis. Final Verdict: Separating Fact from Fiction The evidence is clear – Bitcoin is not a reliable leading indicator for stock market performance. While both markets can be influenced by similar macroeconomic factors, their relationship is far more complex than simple cause and effect. Smart investors should analyze each market independently rather than assuming Bitcoin movements predict stock trends. By understanding that the Bitcoin leading indicator theory is flawed, you can make more informed investment decisions and avoid costly mistakes based on false assumptions. Frequently Asked Questions What is a leading indicator in financial markets? A leading indicator is a measurable factor that changes before the economy starts to follow a particular pattern. It’s used to predict future economic activity. Why do people think Bitcoin predicts stock market moves? This belief stems from occasional correlations during market crises and the misconception that cryptocurrency markets move faster than traditional markets. How reliable is the data showing Bitcoin isn’t a leading indicator? Bloomberg’s analysis uses extensive historical data and statistical methods, making it highly reliable for understanding market relationships. Should I completely ignore Bitcoin when making stock investment decisions? While Bitcoin shouldn’t be used as a leading indicator, it’s still valuable to monitor as part of broader market sentiment and risk appetite assessment. What are better leading indicators for stock market performance? More reliable indicators include employment data, manufacturing indexes, consumer confidence surveys, and yield curve analysis. Could Bitcoin become a leading indicator in the future? As markets evolve, relationships can change. However, current data strongly suggests Bitcoin doesn’t function as a stock market leading indicator. Found this analysis revealing?

Bitcoin, which briefly slipped below $90,000 for the first time in seven months, has rebounded toward the $93,000 level as overall market sentiment steadies. At press time, Bitcoin was trading around $91,000. The global crypto market capitalization is up 1.3%, reaching $3.23 trillion, reflecting a broader return to risk assets after a turbulent morning. Bitcoin recovers following heavy liquidations Bitcoin’s slide to $89,000 earlier in the session sparked significant volatility, wiping out more than $620 million in leveraged positions over 24 hours. Analysts attribute the plunge to forced liquidations combined with investors pulling back from riskier assets amid wider market weakness. The move mirrored a sell-off in AI-linked tech equities, suggesting traders were responding to heightened macro uncertainty and shifting toward a “risk-off” posture. Despite the abrupt drop, Bitcoin stabilized quickly. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading near $91,640, up by 1.7% in the last 24 hours as dip buyers stepped in and derivatives markets reset after the liquidation wave. Market participants note that while volatility remains elevated, Bitcoin’s ability to rebound underscores the resilience of investor interest, even in the face of macro-driven pressure and regulatory speculation. Altcoins bounce as market sentiment improves The rebound in the crypto market extended beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum is trading near $3,071 after a roughly 1.8% gain over the past day. XRP has also moved higher, climbing more than 1.5% to around $2.18. XRP’s performance follows strong demand for the newly launched US spot XRP ETF, which recorded nearly $60 million in first-day trading volume, the highest opening for any ETF this year. Other major altcoins, including Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, and BNB, also turned positive following the morning turmoil. The swift recovery across large-cap tokens suggests that earlier selling pressure was driven more by liquidations and short-term uncertainty than a fundamental shift in investor appetite. Macroeconomic pressures and regulatory concerns drive volatility According to analysts, several factors drove the initial downturn. Markets broadly weakened as investors pulled out of speculative tech names and crypto assets. Political tension added an additional layer of uncertainty after US senators called for an investigation into World Liberty Financial over alleged token ties to North Korea and Russia. Rising token supply, a wave of new listings, and continued growth in memecoin markets also weighed on sentiment, contributing to price pressure across the board. Shifting expectations around potential US Federal Reserve rate cuts further complicated the outlook, as traders reassessed how much monetary policy easing may be on the table in the coming months. Despite these headwinds, the recovery points to persistent interest in digital assets, particularly as new investment products expand access to the market. Recently launched spot ETFs, including those tied to XRP and Litecoin, alongside upcoming Avalanche offerings, are providing both institutional and retail investors with more entry points. This growing ETF ecosystem is helping cushion the market during episodes of heightened volatility, offering a stabilizing force as crypto continues to mature within global finance.

That revolutionary vision just became reality in Europe as Ondo Finance secures regulatory approval for tokenized stocks and ETFs across the European Union. What Are Tokenized Stocks and Why Do They Matter? Tokenized stocks represent traditional securities like company shares or ETF units on blockchain networks. Think of them as digital versions of stocks that you can trade 24/7 with faster settlement times. This breakthrough eliminates many traditional barriers that have kept average investors from accessing global markets efficiently. Ondo Finance’s recent announcement via X confirms they received the green light from Liechtenstein’s Financial Market Authority (FMA). This regulatory milestone opens doors for millions of EU investors to access tokenized stocks through a trusted, regulated platform. How Will European Investors Benefit from Tokenized Stocks? The advantages of this development extend far beyond simple convenience. European investors now gain access to: 24/7 trading without market hour restrictions Lower transaction costs compared to traditional brokers Faster settlement times through blockchain efficiency Enhanced transparency with all transactions recorded on-chain Global accessibility to US and international markets This expansion represents a significant step toward democratizing investment opportunities. Moreover, it bridges the gap between traditional finance and the emerging digital asset ecosystem. What Challenges Does Tokenization Face in Traditional Markets? Despite the excitement, tokenized stocks face several hurdles. Regulatory compliance remains complex across different jurisdictions. Market liquidity needs development to match traditional exchanges. Additionally, investor education about blockchain technology requires ongoing effort. However, Ondo Finance’s approval from Liechtenstein’s FMA demonstrates that regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate innovation. This sets a positive precedent for other jurisdictions considering similar approvals. How Does Ondo Finance’s Platform Work for Tokenized Stocks? The platform converts traditional securities into digital tokens on blockchain networks. Each tokenized stock represents actual ownership in the underlying asset. Investors can trade these tokens peer-to-peer or through supported exchanges. Asset backing : Each token corresponds to real securities held in custody Regulatory compliance : Full adherence to EU financial regulations User-friendly interface : Designed for both crypto-native and traditional investors Security measures : Multi-layer protection for digital assets This approach combines the familiarity of traditional investing with the efficiency of blockchain technology. What Does This Mean for the Future of Investing? The approval of tokenized stocks in the EU signals a broader shift toward digital asset adoption. We’re witnessing the early stages of a transformation that could redefine how people access global markets. As more platforms follow Ondo Finance’s lead, we expect to see increased competition and innovation in the space. Traditional financial institutions are already exploring similar technologies. This validation from European regulators accelerates the mainstream acceptance of blockchain-based financial products. Conclusion: A New Era for European Investors Ondo Finance’s expansion into the EU marks a pivotal moment for both cryptocurrency and traditional finance. The availability of tokenized stocks and ETFs creates unprecedented opportunities for European investors to diversify their portfolios with familiar assets through modern technology. As regulatory barriers continue to fall, we anticipate rapid growth in tokenized real-world assets across global markets. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are tokenized stocks?

54593797,629820,1763528428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54593797.jpeg,"Analyst Suggests Selling Bitcoin To Buy Dogecoin, Here’s Why",https://bitcoinist.com/sell-bitcoin-buy-dogecoin/,"Bitcoin’s latest pullback has created an unexpected opportunity in one corner of the market, and it is not coming from BTC itself. Attention has shifted to the DOGE/BTC trading pair, which has quietly returned to a major support zone that proposes the start of strong outperformance for Dogecoin. One trader, known as Jimmy on X, has shared a chart that shows just how significant this support is, suggesting that the current structure may be preparing Dogecoin for a strong change in relative strength if the level continues to hold. DOGE/BTC Is Sitting On Very Strong Support Jimmy’s technical analysis highlights one fundamental idea: the DOGE/BTC pair is sitting on what he describes as a “very strong support.” As shown in the chart below, Dogecoin is currently consolidating at the same base level that preceded some of its largest outperformance phases against Bitcoin on the daily candlestick timeframe. A closer look at the chart shows that each touch of this support since 2024 has produced a steady and sometimes explosive upward move. This consistency is what makes the current retest important. The most memorable of these was the rally in mid-2024, when a similar retest sparked months of Dogecoin strength. That move carried the pair from roughly 0.00000170 to 0.00000450 before momentum finally cooled. At the time of writing, the DOGE/BTC pair is back to trading around 0.00000170. The gradual drift downward on the pair has slowed as it taps this demand region again, leaving the pair to decide whether another rebound is forming beneath the surface. The long-term pattern reflects exhaustion among sellers and a potential buildup similar to the early stretches of previous runs. Even the RSI on the chart sits in a neutral band but has begun curling upward from low-momentum regions. If this support continues to hold, it would reinforce the idea that Bitcoin’s dominance may be peaking while Dogecoin prepares for a rebound against the leading cryptocurrency. Whales Should “Sell Bitcoin And Buy Dogecoin” The most important part of Jimmy’s commentary was his remark that if he were a Bitcoin whale, he would jeet and buy DOGE. His point is tied to relative value. At this support, the DOGE/BTC ratio sits at one of its lowest points in years, meaning Dogecoin is cheap relative to Bitcoin. If a repeat of previous performance were to take place, Dogecoin could rebound from this support zone at 0.00000170 and push upwards against Bitcoin in the next few weeks. Dogecoin’s spot price is currently reflecting the broader market mood . At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1553, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours. The entire market is under pressure, with total crypto capitalization dropping by 5.1% over the same period.",Bitcoin|Dogecoin|bitcoin|btc|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|DOGE/BTC|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Jimmy|RSI,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 05:00:28

However, despite this downturn, altcoins have exhibited significant stability when compared to the performance of BTC. Analysts from the Bull Theory have provided insights into why altcoins are holding strong during this period. Bitcoin Dominance Falls In a recent social media post on social media site X (previously Twitter), the analysts asserted that the recent decline in BTC’s value was not characterized by typical selling pressure; instead, it is seen as a result of structured institutional selling. This was reflected in negative flows from Coinbase and the manner in which the candlestick patterns formed. Following this structured selling, panic selling ensued as traders who were already facing losses began to exit their positions hastily. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: This Indicator Signals SELL, Could History Repeat With A 67% Drop? This panic selling led to rapid declines in BTC’s price; however, altcoins, having already approached a state of seller exhaustion, did not experience significant drops. In previous scenarios where BTC has faced downturns, its dominance in the market typically surges as traders flock to Bitcoin for safety. Yet, the current situation is different. Bitcoin’s dominance remains below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and the market has recently seen a series of red candles. Such a decline in dominance while BTC is in a downward spiral is unusual, suggesting that altcoins are not being entirely abandoned by traders. Ethereum (ETH) has lost its 50-week EMA but is making attempts to reclaim it. Throughout this month, BTC and ETH have experienced nearly identical declines, yet ETH has shown quicker recovery patterns. The analysts highlighted that during previous cycles, whenever Ethereum holds its ground better than Bitcoin during similar downturns, altcoins tend to demonstrate strength as well. Altcoins Show Strength Amid BTC’s Decline The Bull Theory analysts also noted that many altcoin pairs against BTC have rebounded to levels seen before the significant crash that occurred on October 10th, with some even trading above those thresholds. This, according to their analysis, indicates a few key points: altcoins are outperforming BTC, the current pressure feels isolated rather than widespread, and the sell-off lacks broader implications across the market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash The Analysts suggest that this combination of factors is one of the strongest signals of a market bottom. When BTC is experiencing a downturn, dominance is declining, and alt/BTC pairs are on the rise, it often points to a capitulation phase for altcoins. As of this writing, Bitcoin has recovered above the $93,000 mark. However, the leading cryptocurrency has erased all of its year-to-date gains, while extending the gap to record levels by 26%.

With crucial US jobs data on the horizon, traders are repositioning portfolios amid growing uncertainty about interest rate trajectories and global economic stability. Why are Asian currencies weakening against the dollar? The persistent USD strength is creating headwinds for emerging market currencies across Asia. Several key factors are driving this trend: Heightened expectations of prolonged Federal Reserve hawkishness Risk aversion in global forex markets Capital outflows from emerging markets to safe-haven assets Diverging monetary policies between the Fed and Asian central banks Federal Reserve policy uncertainty weighs heavily Market participants are closely monitoring Federal Reserve communications for clues about future rate decisions. The central bank’s cautious approach has created volatility across forex markets , particularly affecting Asian currencies sensitive to US monetary policy shifts. Currency Recent Performance Key Support Levels Japanese Yen (JPY) -1.8% vs USD 152.00 Chinese Yuan (CNY) -0.9% vs USD 7.2500 Indian Rupee (INR) -0.7% vs USD 83.50 US jobs data: The market’s next major catalyst Upcoming US jobs data represents a critical inflection point for forex markets . Strong employment figures could reinforce the case for higher-for-longer interest rates, potentially accelerating the selloff in Asian currencies . Navigating USD strength in volatile conditions The current environment of USD strength presents both challenges and opportunities for traders. Key considerations include: Monitoring Federal Reserve commentary for policy signals Assessing technical support levels for major currency pairs Diversifying exposure across different Asian currencies Implementing risk management strategies for sudden moves What does this mean for global forex markets? The weakness in Asian currencies reflects broader concerns about global growth and monetary policy divergence. As the Federal Reserve maintains its cautious stance, the ripple effects are being felt across emerging markets and developed economies alike. FAQs How does Federal Reserve policy affect Asian currencies? The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions directly impact capital flows and currency valuations. Higher US rates typically strengthen the dollar and pressure emerging market currencies. What economic indicators should traders watch besides US jobs data? Key indicators include inflation data, manufacturing PMIs, retail sales figures, and central bank meeting minutes from both the Federal Reserve and Asian central banks. Which Asian currencies are most vulnerable to Federal Reserve policy changes? Currencies with large current account deficits and high external debt levels typically face greater pressure during periods of Federal Reserve tightening. The ongoing pressure on Asian currencies underscores the delicate balance central banks face in managing their economies amid global monetary policy shifts. As the Federal Reserve maintains its cautious approach, market participants must remain vigilant about upcoming US jobs data and its potential impact on USD strength across global forex markets . The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether current trends represent temporary adjustments or the beginning of a more sustained move.

The analyst shared a weekly price chart that annotates past and present sentiment readings alongside multi-year price action, asserting that current conditions resemble earlier periods that preceded major upward moves . The message is direct: short-term weakness should not be interpreted as the start of a sustained decline, and investors should be prepared for a strong recovery in XRP’s price. $XRP will bounce HARD. Don’t get fooled now! pic.twitter.com/jooEQgYh7t — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 15, 2025 Technical framing and evidence presented The chart presented by the analyst overlays weekly price candles with snapshots of the Fear & Greed Index showing readings in the extreme fear zone. The images on the chart highlight several historical moments where the index reached low values and were followed, according to the chart, by extended rallies. The most prominent annotations mark the 2021 market cycle and the 2025 price peak, while additional extreme-fear markers appear at earlier troughs. STEPH IS CRYPTO uses this visual comparison to argue that current sentiment metrics and price action mirror prior setups that ultimately resolved in strong upside moves. Interpretation of sentiment and market psychology The analyst’s commentary emphasizes that the prevailing sentiment indicator should be viewed as a contrarian signal. By pointing to repeated occurrences of extreme fear at historically low levels, the message suggests that panic-driven selling and short-term negative narratives have historically provided entry points for buyers. The analyst frames the present environment as one in which emotional reactions dominate price behavior, thereby increasing the likelihood of a countertrend bounce when selling pressure abates. Community response and broader implications In the replies to the post, one commenter suggested that institutional actors and incumbents may have an interest in pressuring retail holders to sell, and urged holders to maintain their positions. STEPH IS CRYPTO’s post, combined with that sentiment in the replies, reinforces a narrative among some community members that current weakness is temporary and that conviction will be rewarded. Whether this view will play out depends on broader market liquidity, macro conditions, and on-chain developments that could influence confidence in XRP. Investors considering this outlook should weigh the sentiment-based case alongside their own assessment of fundamentals and risk tolerance.

SOL price is now consolidating and faces hurdles near the $142 zone. SOL price started a decent recovery wave above $132 and $135 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $135 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $137 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to move up if it clears $142 and $145. Solana Price Eyes Steady Recovery Solana price remained stable and started a decent recovery wave from $128, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL was able to climb above the $132 pivot level. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $172 swing high to the $128 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $137 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $132 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $142 level. The next major resistance is near the $145 level. The main resistance could be $150 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $172 swing high to the $128 low. A successful close above the $150 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $162. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $142 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $135 zone. The first major support is near the $132 level. A break below the $132 level might send the price toward the $125 support zone.

The crypto asset fell by more than 11% over the past week as a result, and briefly touched the lows of $2.10 before stabilizing near the press time price of $2.20. Data now suggests that nearly half of the XRP supply sits in loss, indicating late buyers face a high risk. Fragile XRP Market Glassnode’s latest data shows that only 58.5% of XRP is currently in profit. This is the lowest level since November 2024, when the price was trading near $0.53. Despite XRP’s modest rebound near the current level, about 41.5% of the supply, which is roughly 26.5 billion tokens, remains underwater. The blockchain intelligence platform stated that this highlights a top-heavy market, with late buyers holding significant losses, as the market remains structurally fragile and vulnerable to sharp corrections. XRP’s price has remained largely unmoved despite a series of spot XRP ETF launches throughout November, offering US investors direct exposure to the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) native cryptocurrency. This includes Franklin Templeton’s EZRP, which debuted on November 18, followed by additional products from Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares, which are expected to roll out between November 19 and 22 on the Nasdaq Global Market. According to SoSoValue, Canary Capital’s XRPC, which is the first spot XRP ETF launched last week, has attracted almost $270 million in cumulative flows, with its Monday inflows being $25.41 million. Even so, the heightened interest has done little to shift the underlying crypto asset’s market trajectory. The asset is down 40% since hitting its all-time high of $3.65 in July this year. Crypto Searches Slump Zooming out, public interest in the crypto market as a whole has slipped to its lowest level since June, according to Google search trends by crypto analytics firm, Alphractal. As Bitcoin, XRP, and other crypto prices decline, people quickly lose motivation, which is evident in the searches for exchanges, altcoins, and market trends that have now dropped sharply. Alphractal explained that interest typically returns only when volatility picks up and prices start moving higher. Until then, attention remains subdued, even though such quiet phases often present strong opportunities for long-term investors.

Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest purchased $10 million in Bullish shares amid a crypto stock sell-off, while El Salvador defied IMF guidance with a fresh $100 million Bitcoin buy. These moves highlight growing long-term conviction despite short-term market weakness. ARK Invest Snaps Up $10M in Bullish Shares Amid Crypto Stock Rout Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest made a bold move on Monday, buying $10.2 million worth of shares in Bullish (BLSH) as crypto-linked stocks plunged. The investment was spread across ARK’s flagship ETFs, ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF, after Bullish’s stock tumbled 4.5% to $36.75, extending a six-month slide of nearly 46%. The purchase came just a day before Bullish’s Q3 earnings report, where the exchange previously posted weaker revenue but stronger net profits. The timing signals ARK’s confidence in a potential recovery despite short-term volatility in the sector. While the sell-off reflects short-term investor caution, ARK’s aggressive buying hints at growing conviction that the worst may be over, and that Bitcoin’s stabilization could soon restore confidence across crypto markets. El Salvador Buys $100M in Bitcoin, Raising IMF Concerns In spite of having previously agreed with the IMF to restrict Bitcoin purchases as part of a $1.4 billion loan arrangement El Salvador has purchased 1,090 additional Bitcoin valued more than $100 million. The nation now has over 7,474 BTC up from 5,968 BTC in December 2024 according to government data. The most recent information contradicts the IMF’s earlier this year claim that El Salvador has not purchased any new Bitcoin since the loan arrangement. The government was requested by the IMF to lower risks by restricting BTC publicity and minimizing the public sector’s involvement in the Chivo wallet. The country’s following the agreement is now under scrutiny due to this abrupt and substantial acquisition. El Salvador’s large purchase bolsters long-term trust in Bitcoin. The news boosts hope and may help calm BTC during market falls even though it might not result in an instant price increase. Bitcoin Price Prediction: ABCD Pattern Targets $83,800 Before Relief Rally Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remains under heavy selling pressure, trading near $91,000 as a bearish ABCD pattern unfolds on the daily chart. This harmonic structure, known for its symmetry between price swings, points to a potential completion near $83,800 — a key demand zone that previously triggered major rebounds in early 2024. The “AB” leg’s drop from $115,200 to $99,000 now mirrors the ongoing “CD” leg, signaling that downside momentum may soon reach exhaustion. The 20-day EMA crossing below the 50-day EMA confirms short-term bearish control, while the RSI hovering around 30 shows oversold conditions — often a precursor to relief bounces. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns are also hinting at a shift. Long lower wicks suggest dip buyers are beginning to step in near support, testing sentiment as BTC nears its technical floor. If bulls defend the $83,800 zone, a rebound toward $96,000 and possibly $99,000 could follow, with the broken trendline acting as new resistance. However, failure to hold above $83,000 would expose Bitcoin to deeper losses toward $74,500 — aligning with the lower boundary of the broader accumulation range. For traders, confirmation is key: a bullish engulfing or hammer candle at the demand zone could mark the turning point. Despite the current weakness, Bitcoin’s structure still supports a broader recovery heading into 2026, with the ABCD pattern potentially signaling the final leg of this correction before the next upward phase.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin traded slightly higher in Asia on Wednesday after briefly sinking below $90,000 to a seven-month low, as traders tiptoed back into the market while a fragile risk mood kept a lid on conviction. The token has now given up all of this year’s gains and sits about 26% below its October peak above $126,000. It was last up nearly 2.3% at $92,361, after dropping to $89,286.75. Across the wider market, about $1.2 trillion in crypto value has evaporated over the past six weeks. Market participants pointed to a mix of fading confidence in future US rate cuts and a broader risk-off tone after a long rally in global equities. Crypto, one of the purest expressions of risk appetite, has borne the brunt of that shift. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $90,970, up 0.8% Ether : $3,036, up 0.7% XRP : $2.16, down 0.5% Total crypto market cap: $3.20 trillion, up 0.8% ETF Outflows Deepen Pressure As Asia Struggles For Direction US spot Bitcoin ETFs have also turned into a drag. Since Oct. 10, when equity markets slumped on worries over US-China tariff tensions, about $3.7b has exited US spot Bitcoin ETFs, Morningstar data shows, with $2.3b of that in November alone. Those outflows have compounded selling pressure and reduced the depth of dip buying. Asian stock markets offered little support. Investors in the region struggled for direction as a bout of nerves over stretched AI valuations kept them cautious ahead of earnings from chip giant Nvidia. The tech heavy Nasdaq fell 1.2% cent overnight, logging a second straight loss and leaving it more than 6% below a record set in late October. In early Asian trade, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered around flat. Japan’s Nikkei managed an unsteady 0.4% gain, while South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.8%, reflecting the same reluctance to add risk that is weighing on Bitcoin. Doubts are also growing over another US rate cut in December. Investors worry that President Donald Trump’s falling approval rating could spur more fiscal spending and potentially stoke inflation, a mix that would make aggressive easing less likely and keep financial conditions tight for longer. Panic Signals Emerge With Fear Gauge Flashing Extreme Readings In crypto, sentiment has flipped. The Fear and Greed index has moved into “extreme fear” territory. Ignacio Aguirre, CMO at Bitget, said this level is a classic capitulation phase that often signals an impending market bottom, fostering opportunities for strategic accumulation and long-term growth in the crypto ecosystem. He pointed to recent forced selling as evidence of that shakeout. “The $800 million in BTC liquidations underscores crypto’s sensitivity to leveraged positions, contrasting with the S&P 500’s modest pullback and resilience, which reflects a calibrated risk appetite where equities benefit from diversified economic stability while crypto navigates its unique volatility,” he said. The firm argues that the combination of extreme sentiment and heavy liquidations is clearing out speculative excess, setting the stage for a rebuilding phase with cleaner positioning and, potentially, stronger institutional participation ahead. Bitcoin’s Short-Term Tech Correlation May Fade, Analyst Says Opportunity Looms Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co founder of The Coin Bureau, said that “when tech sneezes, it’s natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold.” He tied the latest moves in Bitcoin to the wobble in high growth tech shares that have dominated this year’s equity rally. “But it’s worth remembering that this correlation shifts, and BTC has a lot more going for it than its link to tech stocks. If and when the AI bubble does burst, Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value will be able to shine. And then, BTC under $100,000 may well seem like a missed buying opportunity.” The post Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Climbs Back From Sub-$90K Drop While Stocks Struggle For Traction appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Kraken,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-19 05:20:49

If adopted, the United States would join a group of countries committed to implementing the tax standards set out in the global Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). IRS Could Soon Monitor Offshore Crypto Transactions The Trump administration may soon allow the IRS to access information about Americans’ offshore crypto accounts, enabling the agency to tax foreign holdings. The Treasury Department’s proposed “Broker Digital Transaction Reporting” rule aims to bring the U.S. into alignment with the international crypto tax reporting framework and could discourage Americans from shifting assets to offshore exchanges. If approved, the US would formally join the international CARF and grant the IRS access to Americans’ foreign crypto account data for potential tax enforcement. According to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website, the proposal made its way to the White House on Friday, and President Trump’s advisors will now review the recommendation. The recommendation comes after the White House issued a report in July 2025, outlining recommendations for how digital assets should be regulated. The report forms part of an executive order issued by President Trump establishing the Working Group on Digital Assets Markets. The Working Group was tasked with producing recommendations for a regulatory framework that could act as a guide for the digital asset industry. In the report, the Working Group emphasised the potential of digital assets and blockchain technologies to transform the U.S. financial system, stating: “The Working Group, as the author of this report, endorses the notion that digital assets and blockchain technologies can revolutionize not just America’s financial system, but systems of ownership and governance economy-wide.” The further added: ""American entrepreneurs who pioneer new industries using these technologies deserve both clarity on the policies that affect their efforts and praise for the progress they have made."" Despite the IRS not classifying the proposed rule as “economically significant,” it would require Americans to be far more rigorous in reporting taxable gains from offshore crypto exchanges. United States Encouraged to Join the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework The president’s Working Group encouraged the Treasury Department and the IRS to introduce rules that would bring the U.S. into the CARF. Established in 2022 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the CARF is expected to be rolled out globally by 2027. CARF is a global agreement under which participating countries automatically share information about their citizens’ crypto asset holdings to combat tax evasion. Members include major crypto hubs such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

US Will Move Once Others Buy BTC The debate over whether the United States should begin accumulating Bitcoin for a national reserve is intensifying, with several people in the crypto industry warning that the country risks falling behind other nations. Crypto entrepreneur Mike Alfred said on a podcast that was released Tuesday that the US government is unlikely to take any meaningful action until other countries make the first move. This suggests that external pressure will be the catalyst for the United States to start buying Bitcoin in earnest. According to Alfred, the government will only accelerate its plans “when there is enough pressure externally,” as Washington tends to respond quickly when it sees geopolitical competitors gaining an advantage. His comments come as people in the crypto industry call on the US to speed up the formation of its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which is a framework that was initiated by President Donald Trump earlier this year via executive order. The goal of the initiative is to accumulate BTC using budget-neutral mechanisms, though the structure of the program remains undefined. Alfred said the timeline for full implementation is still unclear, but he believes progress has already been made, and pointed out that just a few years ago it “seemed impossible that the government would even acknowledge Bitcoin before Trump.” A growing chorus of analysts and executives argue that delaying accumulation could leave the US at a strategic disadvantage. Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn said in September that there is a “strong chance” the government will announce this year that it is formally holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Meanwhile, Jan3 founder Samson Mow repeatedly pushed for the US to act quickly, and warned that it could be “front-run” by countries like Pakistan that are preparing their own Bitcoin acquisition plans. Alfred also reiterated his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value by predicting the asset will reach $1 million per coin by 2033. While this estimate is more conservative than forecasts from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Alfred said that by the time Bitcoin reaches that level, “almost every government will have some direct or indirect exposure” and the asset will be widely viewed as a strategic reserve instrument. As momentum builds globally for Bitcoin adoption at the state level, pressure is mounting on the US government to define its role. For now, industry experts suggest that Washington may wait for another nation to make the first big move. Digital UBI Debuts in Marshall Islands Outside the US, the Republic of the Marshall Islands took a major step toward integrating digital assets into public services with the launch of Lomalo, a government-issued digital wallet that is designed to distribute Universal Basic Income (UBI) to citizens. The initiative will use USDM1 — a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar — to provide residents with access to their UBI funds starting in late November. Citizens will be able to receive their payments through the Lomalo wallet, via physical checks, or through direct deposits, ensuring both traditional and modern financial rails are available. Finance minister David Paul said that adding a digital option strengthens the country’s financial infrastructure and helps ensure that “no community is left behind.” The Marshall Islands joins other Pacific nations exploring blockchain-powered financial tools, following programs like Palau’s stablecoin pilot for government workers and the Solomon Islands’ Bokolo Cash, which supports everyday peer-to-peer transactions and retail purchases in the capital, Honiara. Marshall Islands According to the government, only citizens enrolled in the UBI program can currently create a Lomalo wallet, though they can transfer funds to other registered users. The rollout is the nation’s latest effort to modernize its financial system, but it also follows a series of warnings from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has long urged the Marshall Islands to scale back or delay its digital asset ambitions, particularly its earlier central bank digital currency proposal known as SOV. In a 2023 notice, the IMF said plans for a “digital sovereign bond” carried significant risks that could not be mitigated due to the country’s limited institutional capacity. The organization also warned that expanding digital initiatives — including DAOs, recognized as legal entities by the Marshall Islands in 2022 — could result in macroeconomic and financial stability concerns. It added that deploying the untested USDM1 for a nationwide UBI program could have “adverse macro-fiscal and financial integrity implications,” and recommended a more targeted approach focusing on citizens most in need. (Source: Republic of the Marshall Islands ) Responding to the IMF’s concerns, Paul said the government is still in active discussions with the fund about both the UBI rollout and the use of USDM1. He explained that the digital sovereign bond is issued under New York law and backed 1:1 by short-term US Treasuries held in a bankruptcy-remote account with a qualified US custodian. He argued that the structure aligns with IMF-supported frameworks for collateralized sovereign obligations and was intentionally designed to mirror historical mechanisms like Brady bonds rather than resemble privately issued crypto tokens. Despite the warnings, the Marshall Islands is continuing down a path toward digital asset integration.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-19 05:30:00

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $90,960.03 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most substantial single-day declines in recent weeks. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop So Suddenly? Market analysts point to several factors behind this sharp Bitcoin price movement. First, increased selling pressure from institutional investors contributed to the decline. Second, regulatory uncertainties in key markets created additional volatility. The current Bitcoin price reflects these combined market forces, though the long-term outlook remains positive for many experts. What This Bitcoin Price Movement Means for Investors Understanding the implications of this Bitcoin price drop is crucial for every crypto investor. Here are the key points to consider: Short-term volatility is normal in cryptocurrency markets Historical data shows Bitcoin price often recovers after corrections This could present buying opportunities for long-term investors Market sentiment often shifts quickly around key price levels How to Navigate Current Bitcoin Price Volatility When facing significant Bitcoin price movements, experienced traders recommend several strategies. Dollar-cost averaging helps mitigate timing risks during volatile periods. Setting clear entry and exit points prevents emotional decision-making. Monitoring trading volume provides additional context about the sustainability of price movements. Looking Beyond the Current Bitcoin Price Dip While the current Bitcoin price decline may concern some investors, market fundamentals remain strong. Adoption continues growing globally, with more institutions adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Technological developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem also progress steadily, supporting long-term value propositions. The recent Bitcoin price movement below $91,000 serves as a reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. However, seasoned investors understand that such corrections often create opportunities. The key is maintaining perspective and sticking to well-researched investment strategies rather than reacting to short-term price fluctuations. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to drop below $91,000? The Bitcoin price decline resulted from combined factors including institutional selling, regulatory concerns, and typical market correction patterns after recent gains. Should I buy Bitcoin at current prices? Investment decisions depend on your risk tolerance and strategy. Many analysts view price dips as potential entry points, but always conduct personal research first. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, key support levels to watch include $88,000 and $85,000 based on historical trading patterns and market structure. Is this the end of the Bitcoin bull market? Most analysts consider this a healthy correction within a broader upward trend rather than a market reversal, based on fundamental indicators. What’s the best strategy during Bitcoin price volatility? Dollar-cost averaging, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining a long-term perspective typically work better than trying to time the market perfectly. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin price movements often influence the broader crypto market, with many altcoins experiencing correlated price action during significant BTC moves. Found this analysis helpful?

Institutional adoption accelerated as the SEC approved generic crypto ETF listings and Europe and the UK normalized access, transforming digital assets from speculation to portfolio allocation. Stablecoins emerged as powerful instruments, and tokenized money markets gained traction, cementing crypto’s role as infrastructure for modern financial utility across global markets. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA, Ryan Louvar and Dovile Silenskyte By any reasonable standard, 2025 has been the most important year for digital-asset policy since Bitcoin's genesis block. For years, crypto investors operated in the twilight zone between regulatory indifference and selective enforcement. That era is ending. Across Washington, London and Brussels, policy makers are converging on something the industry has never really had: rules that can scale. The Clarity Act, 1 the Genius Act 2 and a new tone at the Securities and Exchange Commission 3 (SEC) have replaced the improvisational hostility of prior years with something far more consequential: predictable governance. And predictability, in markets, is a form of oxygen. Policy as Catalyst The Clarity Act began as a technical debate, an effort to draw a jurisdictional map between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). But in practice, it represents the first genuine attempt at a federal framework for digital assets. It classifies tokens, sets registration pathways and attempts to end a decade of turf wars. It even folds in provisions on central bank digital currencies, reflecting political anxiety that a state-issued token could one day crowd out the private sector. 4 The bill's trajectory has been messy. It sailed through the House with bipartisan support, stalled in the Senate Banking and Agriculture committees and was derailed by a government shutdown. Realistically, 2026 looks like the earliest date for passage. But markets trade on direction, not perfection, and the direction has clearly changed. In parallel came the Genius Act, which standardized the treatment of U.S. stablecoins and was signed into law. The law confines backing assets to short-duration Treasuries, repurchase agreements and SEC-registered money market funds investing in such assets and explicitly bars issuers from paying yield, closing the door on the most aggressive forms of ""stablecoin carry trade."" Yet the Act left a backdoor open: intermediaries such as exchanges may still pay yield or rewards on the coins they custody. 5 That loophole is likely to be the next policy front line, because it pits banks, who see a flight of deposits, against platforms that can pass Treasury yields through to their users almost frictionlessly. The outcome will determine whether stablecoins evolve into regulated yield-bearing cash or remain payment tokens. Either way, the U.S. has accepted that dollar-denominated stablecoins are here to stay. The debate has shifted from whether to how. The Institutional Turn The most underappreciated policy change of 2025 may be procedural, not legislative. The SEC's approval of generic listing standards for digital-asset exchange-traded products finally removed a decade-long bottleneck. It means that multi-asset or ""basket"" crypto ETFs can now list without bespoke approvals. Roughly a dozen assets qualify under the new template. 6 That simple rule change ends the one-off discretion that plagued prior applications. It also opens the door to broader indexes that could mirror the market-cap composition of the crypto universe. In other words, investors will soon be able to own digital assets the same way they own equities, bonds or commodities: through standardized, regulated wrappers. From Enforcement to Innovation Policy isn't just being written; it's being re-administered. The SEC's new leadership has rebranded its posture from enforcement to innovation. 7 The agencies have created a crypto task force staffed by veterans of both camps, including Mike Selig, now nominated to chair the CFTC. 8 The tone is pragmatic: invite issuers in early, identify friction points and adjust rules iteratively rather than through litigation. That cultural shift is subtle but revolutionary. In the previous cycle, engaging the regulator was a reputational risk; today, it's a requirement for institutional capital. Regulation by enforcement froze experimentation. Regulation by dialogue channels it. Europe's Running Start and the UK Catch-Up Crypto exchange-traded products have traded on European bourses for more than five years, giving the continent a functioning playbook for custody, audits and investor disclosure. 9 The UK's Financial Conduct Authority finally joined the mainstream in 2025 by allowing UK retail investors to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs that are listed on the London Stock Exchange and, crucially, hold them inside tax-advantaged ISA 10 accounts. 11 The rules are not laissez-faire. Retail investors must complete a comprehension exam, acknowledge risk disclosures and observe a 24-hour ""cool-off"" period before purchasing. 12 But that is precisely the point: regulation that feels procedural rather than punitive. The UK has turned crypto from a prohibited asset into a supervised one. Across Europe, investors are already treating digital assets as another building block of diversified portfolios. The standard approach begins with a broad crypto basket, a market-cap-weighted capped exposure to the largest coins, and then adds tilts toward specific narratives: Ethereum for tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure, Solana for retail-facing ecosystems or XRP and Stellar Lumens for cross-border settlement. This structure echoes traditional asset allocation logic: use a beta vehicle for exposure, apply alpha tilts where conviction exists. It's no longer speculation; it's portfolio construction. Stablecoins and the Yield Discussion The most powerful force in digital finance remains the same one that moves all finance: yield differentials. Stablecoins have quietly become high-efficiency wrappers around Treasury bills. That reality explains both the political heat and the innovation energy around the sector. Banks see stablecoins as unauthorized money-market funds that might siphon deposits. Legislators see them as new channels for monetary transmission. Technologists see them as programmable payment rails. The next evolutionary step is being realized via tokenized money market funds, regulated vehicles whose shares circulate on-chain, combining the yield of Treasuries with the settlement speed of crypto. Money market funds may be the tip of the iceberg for tokenization, though, as the combination of investor access to real-world assets combined with the benefits of blockchain, such as quicker settlement speed, provides a compelling combination for asset issuers and investors alike. Utility, Geography and the Two Worlds of Crypto The conversation about ""use cases"" has matured. Bitcoin functions as digital gold: a non-sovereign store of value, macro hedge and portfolio diversifier. But the growth frontier lies elsewhere. In emerging markets, XRP facilitates institutional cross-border payments, while Stellar Lumens (XLM) targets remittances for the unbanked. These tokens act as bridge currencies between local denominations, and Stellar even allows collapsing multi-step FX chains into single-step transfers and cutting transaction costs in half. For someone wiring money from one frontier economy to another, that efficiency is not a novelty; it's survival. In the developed world, the utility conversation centers on tokenization: moving Treasuries, money-market instruments and real-world assets onto programmable ledgers. Ethereum dominates that domain. As stablecoin supply scales toward multi-trillion levels by 2030, the underlying blockchains, primarily Ethereum and its roll-ups, capture the transaction volume and fee base. Different geographies, different motivations, one shared trend: crypto has become the infrastructure for money in motion. Gold, Dollars and the Meaning of ""Stable"" A lingering curiosity in 2025 is the rise of gold-backed stablecoins. Conceptually elegant, practically limited. Gold may hedge inflation risks, but it is not stable against the unit in which most liabilities are denominated: the dollar. The Genius Act's dollar-Treasury architecture reinforces that reality. Still, the experiment matters. In a world of fragmented trust, alternative anchors will attract interest. The question is not whether a gold-backed coin can exist - it can - but whether its volatility relative to consumer obligations makes it useful as a medium of exchange. For now, the market's verdict is clear: more than 99% of stablecoins remain dollar-based. 13 Stability, in practice, still means green paper and Treasury bills. The New Allocation Logic If 2020–2024 were the proof-of-concept years for crypto regulation, 2025 is the institutional onboarding year. Global crypto market capitalization sits near $4 trillion, 14 large enough that asset allocators must now decide whether ignoring it is defensible. Looking Ahead If 2025 is the year of clarity, 2026 will be the year of implementation. Investors who once viewed regulation as a headwind are beginning to see it as distribution. The analogy is apt: in equities, disclosure rules enabled mass ownership; in bonds, ratings and indexes enabled scale. Digital assets are approaching that same type of threshold. Clarity, it turns out, is not the end of the crypto story; it's the beginning of its institutional chapter. Source: F.

Important Risks Related to this Article Crypto assets, such as bitcoin and ether, are complex, generally exhibit extreme price volatility and unpredictability and should be viewed as highly speculative assets. Crypto assets are frequently referred to as crypto “currencies,” but they typically operate without central authority or banks, are not backed by any government or issuing entity (i.e., no right of recourse), have no government or insurance protections, are not legal tender and have limited or no usability as compared to fiat currencies. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use, transfer, exchange and value of crypto assets, and regulation in the U.S. and worldwide is still developing. Crypto asset exchanges and/or settlement facilities may stop operating, permanently shut down or experience issues due to security breaches, fraud, insolvency, market manipulation, market surveillance, KYC/AML (know your customer/anti-money laundering) procedures, noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations, technical glitches, hackers, malware or other reasons, which could negatively impact the price of any cryptocurrency traded on such exchanges or reliant on a settlement facility or otherwise may prevent access or use of the crypto asset. Crypto assets can experience unique events, such as forks or airdrops, which can impact the value and functionality of the crypto asset. Crypto asset transactions are generally irreversible, which means that a crypto asset may be unrecoverable in instances where: (i) it is sent to an incorrect address, (ii) the incorrect amount is sent or (iii) transactions are made fraudulently from an account. A crypto asset may decline in popularity, acceptance or use, thereby impairing its price, and the price of a crypto asset may also be impacted by the transactions of a small number of holders of such crypto asset. Crypto assets may be difficult to value, and valuations, even for the same crypto asset, may differ significantly by pricing source or otherwise be suspect due to market fragmentation, illiquidity, volatility and the potential for manipulation. Crypto assets generally rely on blockchain technology, and blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology that operates as a distributed ledger. Blockchain systems could be subject to internet connectivity disruptions, consensus failures or cybersecurity attacks, and the date or time that you initiate a transaction may be different than when it is recorded on the blockchain. Access to a given blockchain requires an individualized key, which, if compromised, could result in loss due to theft, destruction or inaccessibility. In addition, different crypto assets exhibit different characteristics, use cases and risk profiles.

This stunning development leaves many wondering about the future of large-scale institutional Ethereum investment strategies and what this means for the broader crypto market. Why Did the Ethereum Acquisition Project Get Suspended? According to reports from Wu Blockchain, the ambitious plan to create a dedicated firm for Ethereum acquisition has been completely halted. The project, which aimed to accumulate $1 billion worth of ETH, has returned all pledged capital to investors. This sudden suspension raises important questions about the challenges facing major cryptocurrency investment initiatives in today’s market environment. The decision to suspend this massive Ethereum acquisition endeavor comes at a time when institutional interest in cryptocurrency appears to be growing. However, the project’s termination suggests that even well-backed initiatives can face unexpected hurdles. The return of all committed funds indicates a clean break from the proposed investment strategy. What Challenges Face Large-Scale Ethereum Investment? Major cryptocurrency projects like this Ethereum acquisition firm often encounter several significant obstacles: Regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital asset investments Market volatility affecting long-term investment strategies Operational complexities of managing billion-dollar crypto portfolios Investor confidence fluctuations in the crypto space The suspension of this Ethereum acquisition project highlights how these challenges can impact even the most promising initiatives. Leon Li’s involvement had initially generated significant excitement, given his proven track record with Huobi exchange. How Does This Affect the Broader Crypto Market? When a major Ethereum acquisition project of this scale gets suspended, it sends ripples throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Institutional investors watch these developments closely, as they often signal broader market trends and investment appetite. The cancellation of this $1 billion Ethereum acquisition initiative may cause some investors to reconsider their exposure to digital assets. However, it’s important to remember that individual project outcomes don’t necessarily reflect the health of the entire cryptocurrency sector. The Ethereum network continues to operate normally, and many other investment vehicles remain active. What Can We Learn From This Suspension? This Ethereum acquisition project’s suspension teaches us several valuable lessons about cryptocurrency investing: Even experienced founders face challenges in executing large-scale crypto projects Proper due diligence remains crucial before committing to any investment The cryptocurrency market continues to mature and evolve rapidly Transparency in returning funds shows responsible project management The responsible handling of investor capital in this Ethereum acquisition project suspension demonstrates that the industry is developing more professional standards, even when projects don’t proceed as planned. Conclusion: Looking Beyond the Suspension While the suspension of this $1 billion Ethereum acquisition project is undoubtedly significant, it represents just one chapter in the ongoing story of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The crypto market has shown remarkable resilience through various challenges, and this development is unlikely to derail the broader trend toward digital asset integration. As the industry continues to mature, we can expect to see more sophisticated investment approaches and better risk management practices. The lessons learned from this Ethereum acquisition project suspension will likely inform future initiatives and contribute to a more stable, transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions Why was the Ethereum acquisition project suspended? The specific reasons haven’t been publicly disclosed, but the project led by Huobi founder Leon Li has been completely halted with all funds returned to investors. How much money was involved in this Ethereum acquisition project? The project aimed to raise $1 billion specifically for acquiring Ethereum, but all pledged capital has been returned following the suspension. Who was leading this Ethereum acquisition initiative? Leon Li, the founder of major cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, was leading the $1 billion Ethereum acquisition project. Will this suspension affect Ethereum’s price? While any major investment news can impact market sentiment, single project suspensions typically have limited long-term effects on established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Are there other similar Ethereum acquisition projects still active? Yes, numerous institutional investment vehicles and funds continue to operate in the cryptocurrency space, though specific details vary by project. Can investors get their money back after such suspensions? In this case, all pledged capital has been returned to investors, which demonstrates responsible project management despite the suspension.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Depositing To Exchanges At Loss As explained by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, short-term holders (STHs) have just made another wave of underwater exchange deposits. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin Now In “Good Buy Zone,” Says Analytics Firm The STHs refer to the investors who purchased their Bitcoin during the past 155 days. This cohort is generally considered to include the weak hands of the market, who easily sell at the sight of market volatility. Recently, the market has been witnessing a bearish shift, which is exactly the type of event that STHs would be expected to react to. There are several ways to track the moves being made by these investors, with one such being the data of their exchange inflow transactions. Usually, the STHs transfer their coins to centralized exchanges when they are looking to sell, so a spike in exchange deposits from the group can be a sign of a selloff. During downtrends, loss selling is the most common type of distribution from the STHs due to the fact that their cost basis is at recent prices, which tend to be higher in bearish phases. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the 24-hour loss exchange inflows made by the STHs over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STHs made a large amount of loss deposits to exchanges when the cryptocurrency’s price crashed to $94,000 last week. The same appears to have followed during the latest downward move in the asset. In total, STHs have sent 65,200 underwater tokens to the exchanges over the last 24 hours. At the current exchange rate, this amount is worth a whopping $6.08 billion. This new wave of capitulation wave in the STHs came as BTC dropped toward $89,000. Interestingly, what has followed this FUD from the STHs has so far been a rebound for the asset. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has also shared data related to the STH capitulation in a new X post. Glassnode’s chart is for the amount of loss that the STHs as a whole are realizing through their transactions across the network. The 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) value of this metric is currently sitting at $427 million, which is the highest that it has been since November 2022, when the last bear market bottomed out.

The recent launch of Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF (XRPC) has quickly become one of those situations, prompting closer examination of how upcoming XRP-related institutional products may perform. A prominent crypto analyst, known as {x} (@unknowDLT), offered an estimate that has drawn renewed attention to the future of regulated XRP investment vehicles. Analyst Projects a Significant First-Day Inflow The analyst said the initial performance of XRPC as evidence that demand for an XRP exchange-traded product may be broader than projected. Based on this early response, the analyst stated that BlackRock’s forthcoming XRP ETF could attract approximately $2 billion in net inflows on its first day. While the number is substantial, the analyst argued that the distance between the performance potential of Canary Capital and a heavyweight issuer such as BlackRock may be smaller than many observers think. Another market participant, G C, expanded this perspective by suggesting that BlackRock may be allowing other spot products to establish their presence at current XRP valuations before introducing its own. This interpretation aligns with the tendency of major issuers to wait for precise conditions before launching new products. Strong Debut for Canary Capital’s XRPC According to a Times Tabloid report from November 13 , Canary Capital’s XRPC demonstrated notable momentum immediately after opening. Within its first 30 minutes of trading, the fund recorded over $916,000 in volume. For an ETF debut, this was a striking result that exceeded typical expectations and positioned XRPC as one of the most closely monitored launches of the year. The early performance signaled a level of investor readiness that has contributed to ongoing reassessments of the potential scale of demand for XRP-based products. Implications for Larger Institutional Issuers XRPC’s initial reception has become a key reference point for modeling the possible impact of a BlackRock-issued XRP ETF . If the early interest observed in Canary Capital’s offering reflects broader institutional and retail appetite, the possibility of a multibillion-dollar first-day inflow becomes a valid scenario. The emerging data and commentary surrounding these developments show how quickly expectations can evolve in the digital asset investment sector. As attention shifts toward the next major institutional moves, interest in regulated XRP investment products continues to grow, shaping new expectations for the market’s next stage.

Recent data reveals a fascinating trend that could signal important market movements ahead. Across the top three cryptocurrency exchanges by open interest, short positions are currently holding a slight but significant edge in Bitcoin perpetual futures trading. What Do Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Tell Us About Market Sentiment? The 24-hour long/short ratios for Bitcoin perpetual futures provide crucial insights into trader positioning. Currently, the aggregate data shows 48.06% long positions versus 51.94% short positions. This slight dominance of short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures suggests traders are becoming more cautious about immediate price appreciation. Understanding these Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios helps traders gauge market sentiment. When short positions outweigh longs, it often indicates expectations of potential price declines. However, the current margin is narrow, suggesting the market remains uncertain rather than overwhelmingly bearish. Breaking Down Exchange-Specific Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Data Let’s examine how different platforms are contributing to this trend in Bitcoin perpetual futures: Binance: 48.42% long / 51.58% short Bybit: 49.11% long / 50.89% short Gate.io: 48.59% long / 51.41% short Each exchange shows consistent patterns in their Bitcoin perpetual futures data. The uniformity across platforms strengthens the reliability of this short-dominated trend. Interestingly, Bybit shows the closest balance between long and short positions in Bitcoin perpetual futures. Why Should You Care About Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Positioning? Bitcoin perpetual futures positioning serves as a valuable sentiment indicator. When shorts dominate, it can create potential buying opportunities if the market moves against these positions. However, traders should consider several factors when interpreting Bitcoin perpetual futures data: Market context and recent price action Overall trading volume and liquidity External market factors and news events Historical support and resistance levels The current Bitcoin perpetual futures data suggests traders are positioning cautiously. This could mean they expect some price consolidation or minor corrections in the near term. Actionable Insights From Current Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Trends What can you do with this information about Bitcoin perpetual futures? First, recognize that slight short dominance doesn’t guarantee price declines. Markets often move contrary to majority positioning. Second, monitor how these Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios evolve over time. Sharp changes can signal shifting sentiment.

Combine this information with technical analysis, fundamental factors, and risk management strategies for comprehensive trading decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? Bitcoin perpetual futures are derivative contracts that track Bitcoin’s price without an expiration date, allowing traders to speculate on price movements indefinitely. Why do short positions matter in Bitcoin perpetual futures? Short positions indicate traders expect price declines. When shorts dominate, it can signal bearish sentiment or create potential for short squeezes if prices rise instead. How often should I check Bitcoin perpetual futures data?

While not perfect predictors, they offer valuable sentiment indicators that, combined with other analysis, can improve trading decisions. What’s the difference between perpetual futures and regular futures? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets, unlike traditional futures with set settlement dates.

However, Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy remains unshaken even in the face of catastrophic drops. The MicroStrategy CEO recently revealed his company’s remarkable resilience plan that can withstand Bitcoin corrections of up to 90%. This bold approach comes as Bitcoin’s volatility shows consistent decline, signaling a maturing market that’s attracting serious institutional players. How Does This Bitcoin Strategy Actually Work? Michael Saylor’s confidence stems from careful planning and structural safeguards. During his Fox Business interview, he explained that MicroStrategy built its Bitcoin strategy with extreme market scenarios in mind. The company doesn’t just hope for the best; it prepares for the worst. This forward-thinking approach means they can maintain their position through even the most severe market downturns without compromising their long-term vision. The foundation of this robust Bitcoin strategy includes several key elements: Long-term holding perspective beyond short-term fluctuations Proper capital allocation that doesn’t risk core business operations Understanding Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition Structural safeguards against margin calls and forced liquidations Why Is Declining Volatility Crucial for Bitcoin’s Future? Saylor provided compelling data showing Bitcoin’s transformation from wild speculation to established asset class. When MicroStrategy began its Bitcoin strategy in 2020, annual volatility stood at approximately 80%. Today, that number has dropped to around 50%, representing significant market maturation. This decreasing volatility pattern creates a virtuous cycle. As Bitcoin becomes less volatile, more institutional investors feel comfortable allocating capital. This increased participation then further reduces volatility, creating stability that benefits all market participants. Saylor predicts this trend will continue, with volatility decreasing by about five percentage points every few years as market capitalization grows. What Makes This Approach Different From Other Investment Strategies? Unlike traditional investment approaches that might panic during corrections, Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy embraces volatility as part of the growth process. The key distinction lies in the unshakable belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value. Rather than reacting to price movements, the strategy focuses on Bitcoin’s underlying technology, network effects, and long-term adoption trajectory. This perspective allows MicroStrategy to maintain its position during downturns when weaker hands typically sell. The company views temporary price drops as opportunities rather than threats, understanding that Bitcoin’s historical performance shows strong recovery patterns after significant corrections. How Does Bitcoin Compare to Traditional Investments Long-Term? Saylor envisions a future where Bitcoin’s volatility and performance settle at about 1.5 times that of the S&P 500. This projection positions Bitcoin as a premium risk asset that offers higher potential returns than traditional stocks while maintaining manageable volatility levels. The evolving Bitcoin strategy recognizes that as adoption increases and market infrastructure improves, Bitcoin will naturally become less volatile. This maturation process mirrors what happened with other emerging asset classes throughout financial history, from early internet stocks to emerging market currencies. What Can Individual Investors Learn From This Approach? While individual investors may not have MicroStrategy’s resources, the core principles of Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy remain applicable. The most important lesson is developing a risk management framework that allows you to weather extreme market conditions without making emotional decisions. Key takeaways for individual investors include: Only invest what you can afford to lose completely Maintain a long-term perspective beyond daily price movements Understand Bitcoin’s fundamental value drivers Have a clear plan for different market scenarios Avoid leverage that could force premature selling Michael Saylor’s revelation about his crash-proof Bitcoin strategy provides valuable insights for both institutional and individual investors. The decreasing volatility combined with strategic planning creates a powerful combination that could redefine how serious investors approach cryptocurrency allocations. As Bitcoin continues maturing, this disciplined approach demonstrates how to participate in the digital asset revolution while managing extreme risk scenarios. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin volatility has decreased since 2020? Bitcoin’s annual volatility has dropped from approximately 80% in 2020 to about 50% today, representing significant market maturation according to Michael Saylor’s analysis. What percentage drop can MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy withstand? The company’s Bitcoin strategy is structured to withstand corrections of 80-90% without compromising their long-term position or business operations. Why is decreasing volatility important for Bitcoin? Lower volatility makes Bitcoin more attractive to institutional investors, which in turn brings more capital and further reduces volatility, creating a positive cycle of market maturation. How does Saylor see Bitcoin comparing to the S&P 500 long-term? He predicts Bitcoin’s volatility and performance will eventually settle at about 1.5 times that of the S&P 500, positioning it as a premium risk asset with higher potential returns. Can individual investors apply similar strategies? While resources differ, the core principles of long-term perspective, risk management, and understanding fundamentals apply to investors of all sizes. What drives Bitcoin’s fundamental value according to Saylor? He emphasizes Bitcoin’s technology, network effects, scarcity, and growing adoption as the key fundamental value drivers beyond short-term price movements.

A fresh lineup of ETFs is rolling out across NYSE Arca as major firms move fast to lock in early demand. Fidelity’s spot Solana ETF, the highly anticipated FSOL, goes live on November 19, marking one of the biggest launches yet for the network. And it’s not launching alone. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart confirmed the timeline earlier this week, noting that FSOL will hit the market with a 25 bps fee. BlackRock is staying out for now, but that’s not slowing the momentum. Bitwise already pulled in $450 million into its BSOL fund. VanEck has VSOL live. And Grayscale is officially joining the Solana ETF pack. A new challenger has also stepped forward: Canary Funds. The firm is launching its own staking-enabled Solana ETF, SOLC, on the same day as FSOL, built in partnership with Marinade Finance. The Solana ETF era is no longer “incoming.” It’s here. Fidelity Solana Trust Gets the Green Light NYSE Arca has officially certified the Fidelity Solana Trust ETF, clearing the last regulatory step before trading begins. The approval signals the exchange’s confidence in Solana’s liquidity, market depth, and institutional readiness. FSOL is Fidelity’s first staking-enabled crypto ETF inside its digital assets lineup. The product targets professional-grade access to the Solana ecosystem. Investors gain exposure to native SOL, and the staking yields that come with it, without touching wallets or handling private keys. Fidelity’s entrance sends a message. The firm rarely moves early in emerging asset classes. When it does, the move is deliberate and strategic. FSOL is expected to open with strong flows. Dominant brand, low fee, and first-mover advantage in traditional finance, all aligned with Solana’s strongest market momentum in years. Bitwise Leads With a $450 Million Head Start Fidelity may draw the news cycle, but Bitwise already holds the early lead. Its spot Solana ETF BSOL launched ahead of the crowd and has rapidly attracted $450 million in inflows. BSOL lists first among the new ETFs. The fund’s swift capital attraction signals growing institutional appetite for Solana exposure, particularly among allocators who previously leaned heavily toward Ethereum. With staking yields and cheaper network activity, Solana is positioning itself as the faster, leaner alternative for asset managers seeking diversification inside the crypto basket. Bitwise’s success created a sense of urgency across the ETF field. Every major issuer now wants a Solana footprint. VanEck and Grayscale Enter the Race VanEck launched VSOL earlier today, adding another competitive entrant to the expanding Solana ETF class. The firm has leaned heavily into crypto products this year, but its Solana offering arrives at a crowded moment. Its early trading activity will help determine whether brand recognition or yield incentives drive investor choice. Grayscale is also stepping into the arena. The asset manager, known for GBTC and ETHE, is preparing its Solana ETF entry as it continues repositioning away from closed-end products and into ETFs with more competitive fee structures. The Solana ETF race now resembles the early days of spot Bitcoin ETFs: multiple issuers, fierce competition, and an audience ready to deploy capital. Canary Funds Unveils Staking-Enabled SOLC One of the most striking launches comes from Canary Funds. NYSE Arca approved the listing of the system’s Solana Marinade ETF (SOLC) under the 1934 Act, a detail that signals a fully compliant structure and long-term regulatory alignment. SOLC launches on the same day as FSOL. But the twist lies in its design: Canary partnered with Marinade Finance, one of Solana’s largest liquid staking protocols, to build an ETF that captures on-chain yields natively. The move pushes ETF design forward. It blends traditional market structure with Solana’s high-speed staking economy. If the product gains traction, it could pressure other issuers to integrate direct staking models rather than off-chain approximations. This is the clearest sign yet that legacy finance is beginning to embrace on-chain mechanics rather than merely tokenize exposure. A New Chapter for Solana on Wall Street Market timing couldn’t be more aligned. Solana is testing yearly highs. Developer activity is accelerating. New consumer apps and payment rails are expanding. And institutional research desks increasingly cite Solana as a credible multiyear infrastructure bet. The wave of ETFs solidifies that thesis. With Fidelity, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Funds entering the arena, Solana now has one of the deepest ETF pipelines outside Bitcoin. It places SOL directly in front of pension funds, RIAs, wealth managers, and global macro investors, groups that do not hold self-custody and rely on ETF markets for exposure. The inflows could reshape Solana’s liquidity profile. It may also accelerate staking demand, validator growth, and protocol revenue. For now, all eyes are on November 19. Social Confirmation: Seyffart Signals the Launch Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart broke the story early, confirming the launch schedule on X. ALSO. @CanaryFunds will be launching their Solana ETF — $SOLC — tomorrow too. It’s in partnership with @MarinadeFinance who will be doing the staking. https://t.co/DKsDY3xymg — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 18, 2025 His update triggered immediate attention across the ETF community. Seyffart’s coverage has become the unofficial indicator for institutional timelines in crypto markets. When he posts, the industry listens. The Solana ETF landscape is forming fast. Large issuers are competing on fees, staking yields, and market timing. FSOL’s launch marks a milestone, but the real story is bigger: Wall Street now sees Solana as a core digital asset, not an experiment. The next phase begins this week. And with $450M already flowing into early products, the race is only getting started. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Michael Saylor says Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased despite rising institutional involvement. Bitcoin has fallen 12% this week to $91,616, pulling Strategy’s mNAV and MSTR shares down with it. Saylor remains confident in Bitcoin’s long-term strength, even as analysts warn of deeper downside risks. Speaking to Fox Business on Tuesday , Saylor argued that Bitcoin’s price swings have actually narrowed over time, even as institutional adoption accelerates. “We are getting a lot less volatility,” he said. Bitcoin Drops 12%, Wiping Out 2025 Gains Saylor’s comments come during a turbulent stretch for the market. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 12% over the past week to $91,616, erasing its gains for 2025, according to CoinMarketCap. Saylor noted that when Strategy first began accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, the cryptocurrency carried an annualized volatility near 80%. Today, he estimates that figure has declined to roughly 50%. He projected that Bitcoin’s volatility will continue to fall as the asset matures, eventually settling at around 1.5 times the volatility of the S&P 500, and at “1.5 times better performing.” Despite the recent market pullback, Saylor remained upbeat. “Bitcoin is stronger than ever,” he said. Strategy now holds 649,870 BTC, valued at $59.59 billion at the time of writing, per SaylorTracker. Still, the downturn has dented the company’s metrics. Strategy’s mNAV multiple has slipped to 1.11x, down from 1.52x when Bitcoin reached its $125,100 all-time high on October 5. The firm’s shares (MSTR), which often trade at a premium or discount relative to Bitcoin, closed at $206.80 on Tuesday, marking an 11.50% decline over the past five days, according to Google Finance. Saylor said he remains unfazed by further downside. “The company is engineered to take an 80 to 90% drawdown and keep on ticking,” he said. “We’re pretty indestructible.” Not everyone shares his confidence. Veteran trader Peter Brandt cautioned that Strategy could end up “underwater” if Bitcoin’s chart continues to mirror the soybean bubble pattern of the 1970s, a comparison he has repeatedly highlighted. For now, Saylor continues to dismiss those concerns, insisting that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains intact despite short-term pressure. Bitcoin Crashes Below $90K as ETF Investors Face First Losses Bitcoin plunged under $90,000 on Tuesday for the first time since April, erasing its entire 2025 rally and sending the average spot ETF investor into the red. The drop pushed Bitcoin more than 30% below its early-October record, marking the first time ETF inflows, now sitting at a flow-weighted cost basis of about $89,600, have collectively turned negative . The downturn triggered a wave of ETF outflows, with November 17 alone seeing $254 million exit US Bitcoin funds, led by large redemptions from BlackRock’s IBIT and GBTC. Bitcoin dominance also slipped below 60% as Ether fell under $3,000 and major altcoins, including XRP, BNB, and Solana, posted losses of up to 5.6%, signaling broad market stress.

Senators Question WLFI’s Token Sale On Tuesday, CNBC News reported that Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jack Reed expressed concerns about potential national security risks related to one of the Trump family’s crypto ventures, World Liberty Financial. In a letter seen by the news media outlet, the senators requested that Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent investigate claims that the Trump-backed company had allegedly sold tokens to sanctioned entities or individuals with ties to illicit actors in Russia and North Korea. Warren and Reed reportedly argued that WLFI “lacks adequate safeguards to prevent bad actors from moving funds or gaining influence over its governance,” raising concerns over a potential conflict of interest. According to CNBC, the letter cited a recent report from the non-profit corporate watchdog Accountable.US, which affirmed that World Liberty Financial sold its WLFI token to “various highly suspicious entities,” including traders with ties to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, or using Russia’s A7A5 ruble-backed stablecoin, and Iran’s largest crypto exchange, Nobitex. To the senators, the reported token sales to individuals with “open and obvious connections to enemies of the U.S.” indicate “an absence of robust sanctions and anti-money laundering controls.” Additionally, they consider that the company “risks supercharging illicit finance activity” and raises national security risks by giving bad actors “a seat at the table” to influence the firm’s governance. The letter added that the Trump family’s ties with the crypto venture “create a financial conflict of interest for Trump Administration officials that report to the President: prioritizing token sales will directly enrich the Trump family — while compliance activities may interfere with this wealth creation.” Conflict Of Interest Claims Mount A spokesperson for World Liberty Financial rejected any misconduct , stating, “There is no conflict of interest between World Liberty Financial, a private crypto company with zero political power, and the U.S. government.” Moreover, the representative told CNBC that “World Liberty Financial conducted rigorous AML/KYC checks on every pre-sale purchaser of the $WLFI governance token — the highest standard in the industry — and turned down millions of dollars from potential purchasers who failed the tests.” It’s worth noting that the Democratic lawmakers have pressed multiple government officials, including the US Special Envoy for peace missions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s former acting chairman, and the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), about Trump’s crypto ventures and potential conflicts of interest. Most recently, they have questioned the recently granted pardon to Binance’s co-founder and former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. As reported by Bitcoinist, the US president denied allegations of potential corruption, alleging that he is not actively involved in the Trump family’s crypto businesses. Nonetheless, the Democratic senators argued that the timing of their request is essential ahead of Congress’s efforts to develop new crypto regulation that could protect governance tokens like WLFI from current US oversight. “As Congress considers legislation on the market structure for digital assets, we must ensure that crypto interests do not profit at the expense of U.S. national security and that illicit actors are not handed the keys to financial platforms that they can later exploit,” the letter added. Ultimately, the senators requested that the DOJ and the Treasury provide the pertinent information against World Liberty Financial by December 1.",Crypto News|crypto market regulation|Donald Trump|Donald Trump crypto|Senator Warren|Trump Family|US Congress|US Senators|WLFI|WLFIUSDT|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 07:00:21

As a new group of investment products based on the altcoin hits the market and SOL’s price starts to recover, some suggest that a rebound could be underway. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Worst-Case Scenario For Bitcoin (BTC) As Price Shows Concerning Signs Solana ETFs Take Over The second wave of Solana ETFs has arrived in the market after the successful launch of SOL-based investment products. On Monday, VanEck debuted its Solana ETF (VSOL) on Nasdaq, becoming the third investment product based on the altcoin to launch over the past month. According to the announcement, the firm is waiving its 0.30% fee on the first $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) or until February 17, 2026. Meanwhile, its third-party staking provider will also waive its fee for staking services under the same conditions. Adding to the momentum, Fidelity and Canary Capital launched their FSOL and SOLC ETFs on Tuesday, after recently filing 8-A forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Fidelity is “easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” adding that it is “Game on” with the other launches. Meanwhile, Nate Geraci also highlighted the new launch, but expressed surprise that BlackRock is “sitting this one out” as many anticipate a successful performance. Notably, Bitwise and Grayscale debuted their BSOL and GSOL ETFs at the end of October, registering a record-breaking performance since their launch. Farside Invest data shows that SOL-based investment products have recorded over $390 million in inflows, with 15 consecutive trading days of positive net flows, signaling strong institutional demand for the products. In a Tuesday X post, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, noted BSOL’s positive performance despite the market correction, affirming that “prices are in the eye of the beholder.” “ETF investors continue to buy the dip. Grateful for the trust in Bitwise to steward investor assets,” he added. Institutional Demand To Fuel SOL’s Rebound? Amid the Tuesday launches, SOL’s price bounced 8.4% from its five-month low of $128, recorded on Monday. The cryptocurrency has declined 12% over the past month, losing crucial levels during the market correction. However, Bybit recently suggested that the newly launched investment products could reshape “its price trajectory and market structure for years to come.” In a recent report, the crypto exchange’s analysts noted that the altcoin joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as one of the few digital assets with regulated brokerage access in the US. This “represents a structural shift in how SOL is accessed, traded and perceived,” significantly expanding SOL’s investor base and confidence. “If historical patterns hold, Solana could be on the cusp of a multi-quarter rally that redefines its position in the crypto hierarchy,” the exchange affirmed. Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out SOL’s price action, calling it “one of the worst-performing large caps recently.” However, he argued that, because of this, most of its downside liquidity has already been taken out, with “decent liquidity clusters around the $170-$200 level.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash To analysts, if the market starts to recover and stabilizes, Solana could rally 20%-40% to retest this area. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades affirmed that SOL is “putting in quite the reversal relative to its BTC pair,” as the cryptocurrency has broken out of a three-week downtrend against Bitcoin after some failed attempts. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $141, a 25.3% decline in the monthly timeframe.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: This Indicator Signals SELL, Could History Repeat With A 67% Drop? Jim Esposito, president of Citadel Securities, highlighted their commitment to collaborating with Kraken on risk management and market structure analysis, among other strategic initiatives. This capital infusion comes on the heels of a previous financing round back in September of this year, during which the digital asset platform successfully raised $600 million at a $15 billion valuation. Investors in this earlier round included Wall Street entities such as Jane Street, DRW, HSG (formerly known as Sequoia Capital China), Oppenheimer, Tribe Capital, and the family office of Arjun Sethi, who serves as the exchange’s co-CEO. IPO Plans Unhurried Despite Strong Figures Kraken’s fundraising efforts, totaling $800 million across its two recent financing rounds, have significantly strengthened the company’s financial position ahead of its planned initial public offering (IPO) in the upcoming year.

In a Yahoo Finance interview, Sethi stated, “We have enough capital on our balance sheet as a private company. We don’t race to the door as quickly as possible.” Arjun Sethi previously emphasized the importance of maintaining a prudent approach, ensuring that the company’s financial foundation remains robust and poised for sustainable growth. In the wake of the recent funding, Sethi stated: This investment represents long-term conviction in Kraken’s mission to build trusted, regulated infrastructure for the open financial system. Our focus has always been straightforward: to create a platform where anyone can trade any asset, anytime, anywhere. The exchange also disclosed substantial revenue growth in the third quarter of the year, reaching $648 million. Yet, its closest competitor, Coinbase—the largest exchange in the country—reported revenue growth of $1.9 billion. Kraken’s recent acquisitions, including its $1.5 billion purchase of the futures trading platform NinjaTrader, are further examples of the exchange’s strategic expansion efforts this year. Looking ahead, the exchange revealed in a blog post: We plan to enter new markets across Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA, while broadening our offerings beyond crypto to include additional asset classes, advanced trading tools and staking solutions, expanded payment services and enhanced institutional capabilities.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/top-investors-xrp-shakeout-has-begun-supply-shock-incoming-heres-why/,"A recent statement from crypto investor TheXRPguy has drawn renewed focus to what he describes as a critical phase in XRP’s market cycle. His message centers on the idea that the current environment is defined by weakening retail sentiment, growing institutional interest, and a narrowing timeline toward reduced market availability. The remarks have generated notable reactions from community members who view this period as an opportunity to strengthen their positions ahead of anticipated changes in supply dynamics. Market Conditions and Retail Behavior According to TheXRPguy, the ongoing decline in retail confidence is a predictable development that aligns with trends often observed during extended consolidation phases. He asserts that many individual holders lack the durability to remain committed through prolonged periods of low volatility or declining prices. In his view, this behavior benefits larger market participants who prefer to accumulate during phases of reduced enthusiasm from smaller investors. His assessment suggests that present conditions may reflect a broader repositioning within the market, with retail outflows creating space for institutional accumulation . Institutional Positioning and Anticipated Scarcity TheXRPguy emphasizes that institutional buyers may be preparing for what he identifies as an approaching scarcity event. He places this projected shift roughly nine months away, implying a timeline in which circulating supply could tighten substantially and measurably. This prediction is built on the assumption that institutional demand will continue to rise while available liquidity gradually declines. He further states that such circumstances could lead to a significant supply shock , a point he considers central to his broader outlook on XRP’s long-term value trajectory. Community Reactions Reinforce Accumulation Narrative The comments responding to his message reflect a shared sentiment among some XRP supporters who believe the current period should be used to increase holdings. One user, Free Films on X, stated that he takes additional daily work shifts—three hours with Amazon Flex and two hours with DoorDash—earning an extra $100 to $180 per day, which he uses to buy market dips. He described this phase as the appropriate moment to accumulate, even as prices continue to fall. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community participant, XRP Legend, framed the situation as a process that removes holders who are unable to withstand pressure. He argued that retail impatience benefits those who plan to remain long-term participants. He referenced the nine-month projection for scarcity and affirmed that he intends to continue increasing his XRP holdings. He also reiterated his view that patience remains essential during this period. TheXRPguy’s message presents a clear perspective on the current XRP market environment, focusing on retail sentiment, institutional intentions, and expectations of reduced supply in the months ahead. The responses from community members demonstrate strong confidence in accumulation strategies and reflect a belief that present conditions represent a strategic entry window ahead of a potential supply shock.

Recent data reveals a surprising trend that could signal important changes ahead for cryptocurrency investors. According to CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin miners executed a net purchase of 777 BTC over the past seven days, marking a significant shift in their behavior patterns. What Does This Bitcoin Miners Activity Really Mean? When Bitcoin miners change their strategy, the entire market pays attention. These network participants hold substantial influence over supply dynamics. The recent net purchase of 777 BTC represents more than just numbers – it indicates a calculated approach to market conditions. Over the past month, these Bitcoin miners demonstrated balanced behavior, selling 6,048 BTC across 11 days while accumulating 6,467 BTC during the remaining 19 days. Why Are Bitcoin Miners Suddenly Buying? The shift from selling to accumulation during price declines suggests several important factors: Miners may believe current prices represent good value Operational costs have become more manageable Long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamentals remains strong Strategic positioning for potential future price increases This behavior from Bitcoin miners contrasts sharply with panic selling, instead reflecting a measured, strategic approach to portfolio management. How Could This Impact Bitcoin Prices? When Bitcoin miners reduce selling pressure, several positive effects can emerge. First, decreased selling from major holders helps stabilize prices. Second, accumulation signals confidence to other market participants. Third, reduced circulating supply can create better conditions for price appreciation. The actions of these Bitcoin miners often serve as leading indicators for market sentiment. What Challenges Do Bitcoin Miners Face? Despite the optimistic signals, Bitcoin miners operate in a complex environment. They must balance: Energy costs and operational efficiency Market volatility and price swings Network difficulty adjustments Regulatory considerations across jurisdictions The fact that Bitcoin miners are net buying despite these challenges underscores their strategic outlook. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Understanding Bitcoin miners behavior provides valuable clues for your investment strategy. Consider these points: Monitor miner outflow metrics regularly Compare miner activity with price trends Look for sustained patterns rather than one-off movements Combine miner data with other fundamental indicators The current accumulation by Bitcoin miners suggests they see value at current levels, which could inform your own positioning. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Bitcoin? The strategic net purchase by Bitcoin miners represents more than just numbers – it signals potential market stabilization. While caution remains warranted in bearish conditions, the reduction in selling pressure from these key market participants could mark an important inflection point. As Bitcoin miners shift from distribution to accumulation, investors should watch this trend closely for clues about future price direction. Frequently Asked Questions Why do Bitcoin miners’ activities matter? Bitcoin miners control significant portions of new supply and their buying or selling decisions directly impact market liquidity and price stability. How often should I monitor Bitcoin miners behavior? Weekly tracking provides good insight, but focus on sustained trends rather than daily fluctuations for more reliable signals. Can miner activity predict Bitcoin prices? While not perfect predictors, miner accumulation patterns often correlate with medium-term price movements and market sentiment shifts. What other metrics should I watch alongside miner activity? Combine miner data with exchange flows, institutional activity, and on-chain metrics for comprehensive analysis. Does net buying always mean prices will rise? Not necessarily – while positive, miner activity should be considered alongside broader market conditions and fundamental factors. How can retail investors access miner data? Platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and other analytics services provide regular updates on Bitcoin miners activities. Found this analysis helpful?

The rollout started Tuesday, and it’s open to people who sign up through the Zoox Explorer program using the Zoox app. Riders can take free trips around SoMa, Mission, and the Design District, either by entering a destination or choosing one of Zoox’s suggested spots. The company began operating this service in Las Vegas back in September, but San Francisco isn’t new territory. “Zoox has been testing our autonomous technology in San Francisco since 2017,” said CEO Aicha Evans. She called it the company’s “home,” saying the team is eager to expand its footprint and make the service more available across the city. Amazon’s Zoox brings its own vehicle design What makes Zoox different from other players like Waymo or Tesla is that its robotaxis aren’t retrofitted sedans or SUVs. These are purpose-built from the chassis up. No steering wheels. No pedals. Just two bench seats facing each other in a square-shaped vehicle that looks more like a mini living room than a car. There’s no front or back. The thing can drive both ways, and switches its lights depending on which direction it’s headed. This setup also packs a wall of sensors and cameras all around the vehicle. If the system runs into a weird or dangerous situation it doesn’t know how to handle, human operators from Zoox’s control center can step in remotely to take over. That’s exactly what happened during a recent CES 2025 demo in Las Vegas. The vehicle cruised past heavy traffic outside the Raiders’ stadium, but once it reached a narrow construction zone, it stalled. A remote safety driver took over, reversed the car out, and then set it back to autonomous mode. This type of fallback isn’t new, but Zoox’s approach to mobility clearly isn’t built on just copying what’s out there. It’s also not limited to a single direction of travel or constrained by the usual car hardware layout, which puts it in a very different lane compared to Tesla’s invite-only pilot in Austin or Waymo’s larger deployment across cities. Competition expands across U.S. cities Still, Zoox isn’t the only game in town. Waymo, owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, is already live in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta. It’s now preparing to add Miami and Washington D.C., and has started testing in New York City. Just last week, Waymo confirmed it’s letting its cars operate on highways, signaling a more aggressive expansion beyond city centers. Tesla, meanwhile, is still in limited testing. Its service is only open by invitation and operates primarily in Austin, though it recently expanded to parts of Arizona, with plans to grow further. On another front, Uber is trying to build its own robotaxi pipeline by partnering with Lucid Motors and Nuro, a self-driving tech firm.In July, Uber said they plan to deploy 20,000+ Lucid Gravity SUVs fitted with Nuro’s Level 4 autonomous software on its platform. These vehicles would run on Uber’s existing network and management systems, with the first deployments scheduled across the next six years.

As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325.

Accordingly, the United States state of New Hampshire has approved the issuance of a Bitcoin (BTC)-backed municipal bond. A First-of-its-Kind Bitcoin Move in the US! The New Hampshire Business Finance Authority (BFA) has approved a $100 million Bitcoin-backed municipal bond, the first of its kind in the United States, according to Crypto in America, a cryptocurrency-focused media outlet. This was the first instance of a US state government using Bitcoin as collateral for such a financial instrument. Fees and returns from the BTC collateral will fund the state's Bitcoin Economic Development Fund to support innovation and entrepreneurship. The collateral will be held by the custodian BitGo. According to details, municipal bonds are designed to allow a company to raise funds without selling its Bitcoin holdings. The collateral ratio is set at approximately 160% of the bond amount, and if the Bitcoin price declines and collateralization falls below 130%, an automatic collateral liquidation mechanism will be activated to protect investors. New Hampshire's move, the first example of a digital asset being linked to the traditional bond market, raises the possibility of opening the doors to a new structure for the $140 trillion global debt market. This decision follows the state's previous decision to allocate up to 5% of its treasury to digital assets. *This is not investment advice.

These investors are turning their attention to low-cap coins with great fundamentals and are novelties ready for their first major price movement. Currently, the attention of top investors is centered around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With a price of $0.035, it has a presale that is attracting whales to the hefty technology and solid fundamentals that will drive price to the top of the market. This is the top crypto that multiple well-experienced investors with advanced portfolios are counting on. Presale Transforms into a Strategic Opting The presale for Mutuum Finance has now become a sign of trust by institutions and large-scale investors and is enticing the participation of retail investors. The presale has raised nearly $18.8 million from over 18.8k holders and currently. The 6th phase is over 90% filled. Given this, it is only a matter of time before the price goes up. You can get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens for $0.035 now before phase 7 turns the price up by nearly 20% to $0.040. With this clearly defined, orderly, and transparent presale model, it was only a matter of time before significant capital is raised and it became apparent that these whales were not betting and gambling with the hype. Rather, they are placing themselves, along with the other investors, in a project with clear vision that and a defined trajectory, with a $0.06 valuation scheduled for listing. Top investors might not like to waste any time, especially with this Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale stage closing very rapidly. Investors are buying the best cheap crypto before it is listed on major exchanges. Stablecoin Security Anchors Ecosystem Confidence Mutuum Finance seeks to balance stability with profitability through their native, over-collateralized stablecoin, diffusing stability for long-term gains. The protocol ensures that any dollar-pegged asset that is issued is simply synthed by the protocol’s lending pools, reducing the overall volatility merchants face. This is a stark contrast to how algorithmic stablecoins work as this model simply fails. The stablecoin will serve as a central asset in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) two lending markets, improving collateral diversification and providing a consistent reference currency. Prioritizing the construction of a stable, yield-bearing ecosystem turns the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token into the best crypto to buy for long-term for stable wealth accumulation rather than a short-term speculative vehicle. Grabbing Massive Opportunities The difference in investment strategy is becoming more evident. Some are running after the quick pumps of meme coins, while more rational investors are securing their positions in projects with solid, executable roadmaps and real utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is exactly this kind of investment with the right presale growing rapidly and with first-rate, security-focused architecture that is destined to set new standards in DeFi. The presale whale activity on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a solid sign of the value they believe the project will bring. The low entry price may fool some but make no mistake, this is a developing new cryptocurrency that is built to make massive price breakouts and it is the last chance for smart investors to position themselves ahead of the next phase. For smart investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only the crypto to buy but the crypto that guarantees high ROI for investors.

That’s exactly what happened to Malaysia’s state power company, as illegal crypto mining operations systematically drained the national grid. The staggering scale of this electricity theft reveals a dark side of cryptocurrency that affects everyone from taxpayers to legitimate investors. How Did Illegal Crypto Mining Cause Such Massive Losses? Between 2020 and August this year, Tenaga Nasional (TNB) discovered an alarming pattern. Illegal miners had been stealing electricity through sophisticated methods that bypassed standard monitoring systems. The company identified nearly 14,000 unauthorized mining facilities operating across the country. These operations used several techniques to avoid detection: Tampering with electricity meters to underreport usage Making direct, unauthorized connections to power lines Operating during off-peak hours to avoid suspicion Using residential and commercial properties as fronts What Makes Crypto Mining So Electricity-Intensive? Cryptocurrency mining requires enormous amounts of power because it involves solving complex mathematical problems. The process validates transactions and secures the network, but it comes with a massive energy cost. This creates a powerful incentive for illegal crypto mining operations to steal electricity rather than pay legitimate costs. The energy consumption of a single Bitcoin transaction could power an average household for weeks. When multiplied by thousands of mining rigs operating 24/7, the cumulative effect becomes staggering. How Is Malaysia Fighting Back Against Illegal Mining? Malaysian authorities have launched a coordinated crackdown that brings together multiple agencies. The government formed special task forces combining TNB experts, police units, telecommunications regulators, and anti-corruption officials. These joint raids have yielded significant results: Seizure of thousands of mining rigs and equipment Identification of sophisticated bypass techniques Prosecution of organized crime rings Implementation of better detection technology Why Should Legitimate Crypto Investors Care? Illegal crypto mining creates multiple problems for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It distorts energy markets, increases costs for legitimate users, and damages the industry’s reputation. When people associate cryptocurrency with theft and corruption, it becomes harder for honest projects to gain mainstream acceptance. Moreover, the environmental impact of unauthorized mining operations is often worse than regulated facilities. They typically use older, less efficient equipment and have no incentive to consider their carbon footprint. What Does This Mean for Global Crypto Regulation? The Malaysia case demonstrates why governments worldwide are tightening cryptocurrency regulations. As illegal crypto mining becomes more sophisticated, authorities must develop equally advanced detection methods. This incident will likely influence how other countries approach cryptocurrency oversight and energy management. Key regulatory trends emerging include: Stricter energy consumption reporting Enhanced monitoring of industrial power usage International cooperation on enforcement Technology upgrades for utility companies Frequently Asked Questions How do illegal crypto miners steal electricity? They typically tamper with meters or make direct connections to power lines, bypassing billing systems entirely. Why is cryptocurrency mining so energy-intensive? Mining requires solving complex mathematical problems that demand massive computing power, which translates to high electricity consumption. Can illegal mining affect cryptocurrency prices? While not directly, it can influence market sentiment and regulatory decisions that ultimately impact prices. What penalties do illegal miners face? They can face criminal charges, heavy fines, equipment confiscation, and imprisonment depending on local laws. How can utilities detect illegal mining operations? Through unusual power consumption patterns, thermal imaging, community reports, and advanced metering technology. Is this problem unique to Malaysia? No, illegal crypto mining occurs worldwide, though the scale in Malaysia is particularly notable.

Key Takeaways: Leaked screenshots show Coinbase developing a prediction markets platform built on Kalshi’s regulated infrastructure. The interface appears to support USDC or USD trading across categories like economics, politics, and sports. Coinbase would join rivals such as Crypto.com and Gemini in moving aggressively into the booming prediction market sector. The images show Coinbase developing a dedicated website for the service, which will operate through Kalshi, the federally regulated prediction market approved by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Coinbase Prediction Market Built Through Kalshi Wong, known for uncovering unreleased features across major tech platforms, posted multiple screenshots to X showing Coinbase-branded prediction market pages, an FAQ section, and onboarding guides. One screenshot states that the product is offered by Coinbase Financial Markets, the exchange’s derivatives arm, “through Kalshi,” indicating the service will rely on Kalshi’s regulatory framework. Coinbase has signaled its interest in prediction markets before. In July, the company told CNBC that it intends to add prediction capabilities as part of its plan to evolve into an “everything exchange.” That direction became clearer on Nov. 13 when Coinbase and Kalshi announced a partnership allowing the exchange to serve as custodian for Kalshi’s USDC-based event contracts. The leaked images show a standard prediction market interface featuring Coinbase’s branding, seemingly allowing users to participate using USDC or US dollars. The menu includes categories such as economics, sports, science, politics, and technology, with language suggesting that new markets would be added frequently. Prediction markets have seen explosive growth in 2024 and 2025, with platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket posting record volumes as users turn to event-based trading ahead of major political, economic, and cultural moments. Exchanges have been quick to take notice. Crypto.com recently launched its own prediction market product in partnership with Trump Media, while Gemini said last week that it is building a similar platform as part of its upcoming “super app.” Gemini also filed to become a designated contract market with the CFTC, a key step toward offering regulated event contracts. If the screenshots prove accurate, Coinbase would become the latest major exchange to enter the fast-expanding prediction market sector. Coinbase Launches Singapore Business Platform As reported, Coinbase has launched Coinbase Business in Singapore , marking the crypto exchange’s first international rollout of its business-focused operating platform. The move gives local startups and small businesses access to instant USDC payments, global transfers, automated accounting integrations, and a suite of tools designed for companies that manage digital assets day to day. The debut builds on Coinbase’s collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore through the BLOOM Initiative, which focuses on improving compliant cross-border digital payments. The platform offers USDC-based global payouts, lower-cost international transactions, and an API for automated payroll and vendor management, all backed by real-time SGD banking rails via Standard Chartered. Coinbase said the launch supports Singapore’s fast-growing innovation economy by offering a full financial stack that blends fiat and crypto under clear regulatory standards.

The two senators told Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday that the firm could pose a national‑security problem because of how it handled its early token buyers and how much control those buyers now hold. The company is run and owned by the Trump family, and the senators argue that the firm failed to stop suspicious buyers from getting access to the token that lets holders vote on decisions inside the company. The watchdog Accountable.US said the firm sold to “various highly suspicious entities,” and the senators said these sales put people with hostile ties “at the table” inside a company connected to the White House. Senators demand answers and question who bought the $WLFI tokens Elizabeth said the report showed that World Liberty sold $10,000 worth of $WLFI in January to traders who had been moving funds with a wallet now sanctioned for ties to North Korea’s Lazarus Group . The same watchdog said the company moved tokens to a sanctioned Russian ruble‑backed evasion tool, an Iranian crypto exchange, and Tornado Cash. Jack and Elizabeth wrote that these connections show weak checks and that the company failed to stop risky buyers. World Liberty denied the accusations. A spokesperson told CNBC there was “no conflict of interest between World Liberty Financial, a private crypto company with zero political power, and the U.S. government.” The spokesperson also allegedly said the company “conducted rigorous AML/KYC checks” on everyone in the presale and said it turned down “millions of dollars” from people who failed the checks. AML refers to anti‑money‑laundering rules, and KYC is meant to verify identities. The senators said the watchdog’s findings show the opposite. The company lists Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Barron Trump as co‑founders on its site, and Donald Trump is listed as “Co‑Founder Emeritus.” One entity tied to the family, DT Marks DEFI LLC, holds 22.5 billion tokens worth more than $3 billion and gets 75% of the money from every token sale. Jack and Elizabeth wrote, “That means every time a governance token is sold, three‑quarters of that money goes directly to President Trump and his family, even for sales to entities linked to North Korea and Russia.” Lawmakers widen the scrutiny to stablecoins, Binance links, and MGX investment Another report from August estimated that $11.6 billion, or 73% of Trump’s wealth, is now tied to crypto, including his $TRUMP memecoin. Reuters said his federal financial disclosures show that crypto added a large amount to his personal wealth last year. Jack and Elizabeth said the timing of their letter matters because Congress is looking at new crypto rules that might exempt governance tokens like $WLFI from oversight and from record‑keeping requirements. World Liberty plans to grow by launching a new debit card and tokenized commodities, but the senators said the token sales show “an absence of robust sanctions and anti‑money‑laundering controls” and that the company “risks supercharging illicit finance activity.” They also said the Trump family’s role creates a conflict because government officials report to a president who benefits from the token’s sales. Elizabeth has pressed the company before, including on its stablecoin USD1 , which is backed by dollars and short‑term U.S. Treasuries. USD1 was used by the UAE‑backed fund MGX for a $2 billion investment into Binance, a move that increased the token’s volume. The New York Times said the UAE secured a large chip agreement from the U.S. soon after the MGX deal went through. On Oct. 23, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, who had admitted to allowing money laundering at the exchange. Days later, Trump told CBS “60 Minutes” he did not know Zhao, even though he had issued the pardon. The Wall Street Journal said Binance helped MGX settle its USD1 deal and helped build the tech used for the stablecoin. Richard Teng, the CEO of Binance, denied that Binance played any part in MGX’s choice to use USD1. Donald Trump Jr. and Zach Witkoff, the CEO of World Liberty and the son of U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, told CNBC the concern about conflicts was “complete nonsense.” Zach said, “Don and my World Liberty mission is big, but our dads’ mission is much bigger. They’re not focused on stablecoins, nor are they involved in a stablecoin business.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Regulation|AED|IRR|KPW|RUB|USD|usd1|WLFI,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-19 07:32:33

The team said : When the event concludes, all INJ commitments are exchanged for the revenue collected that month. This revenue, made up of multiple different tokens, is distributed pro rata to all participants. Meanwhile, the October buyback round was the inaugural event that replaced the inheritance burn auction with a community-driven and more open mechanism. Now, the second round, which opens tomorrow, serves as the first true cycle for Injective’s monthly buybacks. How does the Injective community buyback work? The L1 reserves limited slots for participants on the Injective Hub, using the first-come, first-served approach. Eligible holders can commit their INJ assets for a month. After the buyback round, Injective burns all committed tokens and shares a portion of the revenue generated during that month, including assets like USDT and INJ. The best thing is that the initiative guarantees transparency, with all commitments, burns, and revenue distribution publicly visible. Meanwhile, the upcoming deflationary event comes as the INJ price trades at a crucial technical region, adding uncertainty, pressure, and opportunity at a go. INJ price outlook The altcoin trades at $6.42 with a mere 0.64% increase in the last 24 hours. Chart by Coinmarketcap Injective dropped over 17% of its value in the past week amid overwhelming broader selling momentum. While the 15% slump in 24-hour trading volume confirms weakness, tomorrow’s buyback event could influence INJ’s price action in the near term. The digital token is trading above the crucial support barrier of $5 – $6, which has held during extended drawdowns. A lucrative turnout tomorrow, with commitments exceeding expectations, might fuel recoveries for Injective. If people commit a substantial amount of tokens, the subsequent burn could offer a structural and psychological catalyst for a rebound. Bulls will target $10 – $12, with a move above $14 shifting short-term trends. INJ can push toward $20 on an improved broader market outlook. On the other hand, minimal participation in tomorrow’s buyback could signal dwindling trust in Injective’s growth plans and incentives. That can see INJ plummeting to the support at $5, with a possible capitulation to sub-$3.

Binance to Remove Multiple Spot Trading Pairs on November 21, 2025 Following the final review, it was announced that four spot trading pairs will be delisted on November 21, 2025. According to the statement made by Binance, the LA/FDUSD, SAHARA/BNB, SAHARA/FDUSD and TOWNS/BNB trading pairs will be removed from trading as of 21-11-2025 06:00 and trading in these pairs will be completely suspended.

Meanwhile, Spot Trading Bot services related to these pairs will also be terminated on the same date.

54599865,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=863814,1763538340,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54599865.jpeg,New Hampshire issues first municipal bond tied to Bitcoin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/new-hampshire-launches-bitcoin-bond/,"New Hampshire has launched a Bitcoin-backed municipal bond, paving the way for crypto to enter the $140 trillion global debt market. The Business Finance Authority (BFA) approved the $100 million Bitcoin-pegged conduit bond, allowing firms to borrow against over-collateralized Bitcoin in private custody. However, the BFA stated that while it is itself a state entity, the bond is neither covered by the taxpayer nor the government. The state-level organization supporting New Hampshire’s business growth is only acting as a mediator. The BFA said it is approving and overseeing the deal and will not assume repayment risk. Bitcoin held by BitGo will cover the investors. The development comes a few weeks after New Hampshire became the first state to allow its treasury to invest up to 5% of public funds in crypto. That effectively created the first U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. New Hampshire’s Ayotte celebrates historic Bitcoin-backed bond New Hampshire’s Governor Kelly Ayotte celebrated the milestone, touting that the state is once again first in the nation to embrace new technologies with the historic Bitcoin-pegged bond. She pointed out that this move would open new avenues to bring more investment to the state. Ayotte signed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill into law in May. GOP Rep. Keith Ammon explained that the bond serves as a testing ground for Bitcoin’s functionality as high-grade collateral in government finance. He pointed out that the self-funded BFA could partner on this venture, prove out the concept, and possibly lead to a true Bitcoin bond issued by the state treasury. Orion Mountain Spring, a partner at Orrick, also supported New Hampshire in launching the first municipal security backed by crypto. He emphasized that this is a game-changer for the crypto and municipal finance sectors. Orrick, a muni bond law firm, is backing the bond, and it played a significant role in helping the Granite State set up the deal. Ammon mentioned that borrowers under the proposed deal will post nearly 160% of the bond’s value in Bitcoin as collateral. A liquidation mechanism will ensure bondholders are fully compensated if Bitcoin drops below 130%. He emphasized that this setup allows borrowers to unlock capital without unnecessary attention from the IRS or the need to sell their Bitcoin. Key-Wallace says proceeds will go to the state’s business growth Fund James Key-Wallace, BFA’s executive director, said fees from the bond transactions and any other gains in the Bitcoin collateral deal will be redirected into the Bitcoin Economic Development Fund. The program supports the state’s entrepreneurship and business growth. Les Borsai, the Co-founder of Wave Digital Assets, said this is not just one transaction; it is the opening of a new debt market. Wave Digital Assets reportedly partnered with muni bond specialist Rosemawr Management to design the bond that bridges crypto and traditional debt markets. Bitcoin will be used as collateral under the same rules that govern corporate and municipal bonds. If New Hampshire’s model succeeds, other states could follow the blueprint. Borsai claims that this structure demonstrates how the private and public sectors can collaborate to unlock the value of cryptocurrencies and their reserves in a responsible manner. The U.S. bond market alone is valued at $58.2 trillion, making it the world’s largest fixed-income market. Meanwhile, the Wave Digital Assets executive noted that many crypto reserves today maintain idle vaults rather than using them as active financial tools. He says the BFA Bitcoin-pegged bond is a model for how crypto can be safely integrated with traditional finance and help grow the economy. Borsai sees issuers using these reserves to earn yield, support economic projects, and back loans—all within a regulated environment. He also believes that institutional participation is required to make this possible. Retirement plans or pension funds can take cautious exposure to crypto without increasing overall risk.

The report delivers both reassuring news and sobering warnings about one of the most prominent corporate Bitcoin holders in the market today. Why Won’t MicroStrategy Sell Its Bitcoin Holdings? Matrixport’s comprehensive analysis indicates that MicroStrategy faces low probability of being forced to liquidate its substantial Bitcoin portfolio. The company’s current financial structure and convertible bond maturity schedule create a protective buffer against immediate selling pressure. This means the massive Bitcoin reserves accumulated by MicroStrategy remain secure for the foreseeable future. The report highlights several key factors supporting this conclusion: Strategic debt management through convertible bonds Long-term maturity schedules that avoid immediate liquidity crises Corporate commitment to Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset Financial flexibility to manage obligations without Bitcoin liquidation Who Bears the Real Burden in This MicroStrategy Bitcoin Story? While the company’s Bitcoin strategy appears stable, Matrixport identifies a different group facing significant challenges. Investors who purchased MSTR stock near its historical peak of $474 now confront substantial losses. These high-entry investors bought during a period when the company’s fundraising activities and net asset value per share reached their maximum levels. The subsequent decline in both NAV and its premium has driven MSTR’s stock price down dramatically from $474 to approximately $200. This represents one of the most challenging scenarios for investors who timed their entry poorly. The MicroStrategy Bitcoin exposure that once seemed like a brilliant investment has turned painful for those who bought at the top. What Does This Mean for Future MicroStrategy Bitcoin Investments? The Matrixport analysis provides valuable lessons for investors considering exposure to Bitcoin through corporate vehicles. While MicroStrategy’s core Bitcoin strategy remains intact, the stock price volatility demonstrates the risks of indirect cryptocurrency exposure. Investors must understand that buying MSTR stock involves different risk factors than purchasing Bitcoin directly. Key considerations for investors include: Timing of entry relative to NAV premiums Understanding the leverage effect of stock vs. direct Bitcoin ownership Monitoring convertible bond maturity schedules Assessing management’s long-term Bitcoin strategy commitment How Can Investors Navigate MicroStrategy Bitcoin Exposure Safely? The Matrixport report serves as a crucial reminder about investment timing and risk management. While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings appear secure, the stock’s performance highlights the importance of entry points and valuation awareness. Investors should approach corporate Bitcoin exposure with the same caution they apply to direct cryptocurrency investments. Successful navigation requires: Dollar-cost averaging rather than lump-sum investments at peaks Regular monitoring of NAV premiums and discounts Understanding the relationship between Bitcoin price and MSTR stock performance Maintaining realistic expectations about volatility and potential returns Conclusion: Balancing Opportunity and Risk in Corporate Bitcoin Strategies The Matrixport analysis delivers a clear message: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy remains fundamentally sound, but investor outcomes depend heavily on entry timing. The company’s ability to maintain its Bitcoin holdings provides stability, while the stock’s dramatic decline from highs serves as a warning about valuation risks. As corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to evolve, investors must balance the potential rewards against the very real risks of poor timing and excessive premiums. Frequently Asked Questions Why is MicroStrategy unlikely to sell its Bitcoin soon? Matrixport’s analysis shows the company has structured its debt and financial obligations in a way that doesn’t require immediate Bitcoin liquidation. The convertible bond maturity schedule provides sufficient time to manage obligations without forced selling. What caused MSTR stock to drop from $474 to $200? The decline resulted from decreasing net asset value per share and the premium investors were willing to pay for Bitcoin exposure through MSTR stock. As Bitcoin prices corrected and market sentiment shifted, both NAV and its premium contracted. Should investors avoid MicroStrategy stock completely? Not necessarily, but investors should be cautious about entry points and understand they’re buying both a company and Bitcoin exposure. The Matrixport report suggests careful timing and awareness of NAV premiums are crucial. How does MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy compare to direct Bitcoin ownership? Direct Bitcoin ownership eliminates the stock premium/discount factor and corporate execution risk. However, MSTR stock provides leveraged exposure to Bitcoin price movements, which can work both for and against investors. What warning signs should investors watch for regarding MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings? Key indicators include changes in convertible bond terms, significant Bitcoin price declines that threaten collateral requirements, and alterations to the company’s stated Bitcoin strategy. Can MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy survive a prolonged bear market? According to Matrixport’s analysis, the current structure appears resilient for the medium term. However, extended severe market conditions could test the strategy’s sustainability. Found this analysis helpful?

Yet, blockchain networks like Bitcoin remain resilient. Blockchain Stays Online Even As Cloudflare Experiences Outage Today, Cloudflare suffered a global network issue, causing major services connected to it to slow down or outright stop working. According to the website’s status tracker , it began looking into the issue around noon, UTC. Cloudflare noted it was “experiencing an internal service degradation.” Cloudflare provides a range of internet and cybersecurity-related services, being most known for its “Checking your browser…” DDoS protection page that has become a familiar sight when navigating to some popular websites. About 20% of the global traffic passes through the company, so any issues related to it can have widespread impacts. The outage today clearly showcased it, as it caused issues for thousands of users around the world. Dane Knecht, Cloudflare CTO, posted a statement on X: I won’t mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader Internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us. The sites, businesses, and organizations that rely on Cloudflare depend on us being available and I apologize for the impact that we caused. Some of the biggest names impacted by the issue included ChatGPT, X, Uber, and McDonald’s. Ironically, even Downdetector, a website that helps users track outages around the internet, itself went down during the event. It took Cloudflare a few hours to get the issue sorted. At 14:42 UTC, the status page reported, “A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved.” There were some hiccups post this patch, but they were resolved by 17:44 UTC, as the website updated with, “We are no longer observing elevated errors or latency across the network.” The market initially reacted to the event, as Cloudflare’s stock dropped to $194, but once the company restored services, its price jumped back to $199. While Cloudflare was dealing with the outage, Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao posted on X: “Blockchain kept working.” The remark highlighted the fact that even when 20% of the internet suffered from issues, blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum kept operating normally. Unlike the usual networks that usually have some point of centralization, blockchain networks run in a completely decentralized manner. This means that even if some nodes go offline, the network isn’t affected. Earlier in the year, Amazon’s AWS also experienced a major outage, causing disruption in large parts of the internet. Even then, blockchain networks remained stalwart. As for what caused the latest Cloudflare outage, Knecht has said it was a latent bug in a service related to the company’s bot mitigation capability. It started to crash, cascading into a broad degradation of Cloudflare services. “This was not an attack,” clarified Knecht. The CTO has also shared that an investigation report is on the way, with transparent details related to what happened during the event included. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $93,300, down 9.5% over the last week.",Blockchain|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|BTCUSDT|Chengpeng Zhao (CZ)|cloudflare|Cloudflare Outage|CZ|CZ Blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|FLR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-19 08:00:15
54600101,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90038,1763539325,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Links XRP to Warren Buffett’s Cash Position,https://timestabloid.com/expert-links-xrp-to-warren-buffetts-cash-position/,"A recent remark from ex-London banker Lord Belgrave outlined a view on Warren Buffett’s record cash reserve and the type of infrastructure that such capital is likely to pursue. In response, crypto enthusiast Stellar Rippler presented a detailed interpretation of Buffett’s positioning, connecting Berkshire Hathaway’s activity in Japan with the broader development of enterprise-grade settlement systems. The remark does not rely on speculation; instead, it draws from publicly known corporate relationships and documented institutional partnerships. Buffett’s capital position and the implied direction of future flows Belgrave highlighted Buffett’s exceptional liquidity and his expectation that part of that capital will eventually move toward scalable systems capable of supporting institutional requirements. His view focused on settlement infrastructure that operates efficiently in a global digital environment. He noted that only a limited number of assets and technologies demonstrate the capacity to support institutional volume, real utility, and operational scale, and he placed XRP within that category. Belgrave added that large cash reserves will be deployed once market conditions shift, indicating that future capital may enter settlement rails built for high-volume institutional usage. Link between Berkshire, Japan, and enterprise adoption Stellar Rippler expanded on this perspective by drawing attention to Berkshire Hathaway’s continued investment in Japan, specifically its increased stake in Sumitomo Corporation in 2023. He emphasized that Sumitomo is a central part of the SBI ecosystem, and SBI maintains an established institutional partnership with Ripple through SBI Ripple Asia. He argues that Buffett’s well-known disinterest in speculative crypto does not apply to financial infrastructure, where he has historically positioned capital when long-term utility can be demonstrated. Stellar Rippler also noted that Japan’s regulatory environment, financial institutions, and parliamentary support place the country ahead of Western markets in integrating enterprise blockchain solutions for cross-border settlement. He referenced public statements from SBI leadership describing Ripple’s future role in the broader blockchain sector. He also highlighted that Japan has already moved toward large-scale institutional adoption, making it one of the most advanced markets for this technology. Interpretation of institutional settlement The comment frames a straightforward sequence. Berkshire increases its exposure to Japanese conglomerates. Those conglomerates are closely tied to SBI, while SBI maintains a well-established relationship with Ripple . Ripple’s enterprise solutions rely on deep liquidity and scalable settlement mechanisms. The conclusion presented is that Japan’s financial ecosystem is positioned to lead in the implementation of these rails, and future institutional settlement could naturally draw on the liquidity solutions associated with XRP. The exchange does not make definitive predictions about Berkshire’s future allocations but outlines a coherent interpretation of observable activity, corporate relationships, and strategic positioning within Japan’s financial sector.

In its latest post, the analytics platform outlined several digital assets that have captured the crowd’s attention for different reasons. In this article, we will focus on Ripple’s XRP and why it has been gathering steam. Why So Trendy, XRP? Perhaps the most notable development in the cryptocurrency market for the past week or so is the overall correction that brought it to its knees, especially BTC, which dumped to a seven-month low. XRP has fared rather well compared to the market leader, but it’s still down by 10% weekly, even though its price has calmed at around $2.15. Naturally, such moves are always discussed among retail investors on social media, but the analytics platform said it’s not the main culprit. Instead, Santiment data shows that the crowd has focused on the recent developments on the ETF front. It all began with the spot XRP ETF launched by Canary Capital last week, which became the first such financial vehicle with 100% exposure to the asset to hit the US markets. “The texts highlight the launch of XRP-based ETFs, including the first XRP option income ETF by Amplify, and debates on whether ETFs aid XRP adoption or just serve as speculative investment vehicles.” Other reasons Ripple’s token has been trending lately include discussions about its potential use in pension funds and as a settlement mechanism. ETF Update As reported last week, Canary Capital’s XRPC cleared all hurdles after the Nasdaq published the official listing notice on November 12. A day later, the fund went live for trading and broke the 2025 record for trading volume, surpassing even Bitwise’s SOL debut. Data from SoSoValue shows that the product has attracted $277.82 million as of November 18. This means that the actual net inflows have slowed down after the impressive launch. On day 1, XRPC attracted a whopping $243.05 million, followed by a more modest $25.41 million on the next trading day (November 17). Although the data for November 18 hasn’t been updated yet, it’s likely to be a lot lower than the opening day.

In 2027, it will range between $0.71 and $0.86, with an average price of $0.73. In 2030, it will range between $2.02 and $2.48, with an average price of $2.08. The parallel stack, a robust, open-source framework designed for crafting rollups and layer 2s that harness parallel processing, is now on SEI V2. The stack enhances Ethereum ’s performance by targeting most bottlenecks that Layer 2 blockchains face. Such developments are anticipated to drive SEI value over the long term. Regarding price performance, SEI shows signs of trading higher; however, it remains affected by the general market sentiment. How high will SEI go? Is SEI a good investment? What will SEI’s value be in 2025? Will SEI rise? Read on and discover the SEI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Sei Ticker SEI Current price $0.1490 Market cap $949.55M Trading volume $110.52M Circulating supply 6.37B All-time high $1.14 on Mar 16, 2024 All-time low $0.007989 on Aug 15, 2023 24-hour high $0.1532 24-hour low $0.1456 SEI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 8.63% 50-day SMA $0.2132 200-day SMA $0.2571 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Fear and Greed Index 15 (Extreme Fear) SEI price analysis On November 19, SEI’s price fell by 0.89% over the past 24 hours to $0.1482 and by 26.78% over the past 30 days. Its trading volume dropped by 15.65% over 24 hours. Looking back, SEI declined steeply in the last 7 days after bouncing off resistance at $0.20. SEI 1-day chart analysis SEIUSD chart by TradingView SEI trades along support at $0.14 after breaking below the critical $0.18 level this week. The coin now trades below all major SMA and EMA levels, signaling poor performance. The MACD histogram (-0.0004) confirms negative momentum, while the RSI (34.18) is in neutral territory. It is oversold when the value drops below 30. SEI price 4-hour chart price analysis SEIUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart indicates that SEI is exhibiting negative momentum and that its volatility is rising. The recent red candles indicate a bearish market. The MACD histogram shows that its momentum has dropped SEI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 0.2002 SELL SMA 5 0.1879 SELL SMA 10 0.1866 SELL SMA 21 0.1831 SELL SMA 50 0.2132 SELL SMA 100 0.2572 SELL SMA 200 0.2571 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 0.1854 SELL EMA 5 0.2049 SELL EMA 10 0.2361 SELL EMA 21 0.2660 SELL EMA 50 0.2852 SELL EMA 100 0.2801 SELL EMA 200 0.2826 SELL What to expect from SEI price analysis next? SEI is caught in a broader risk-off rotation. However, Ethereum L2s like Mantle show resilience, suggesting SEI’s performance is not chain-specific. Why is SEI down? SEI’s decline reflects a blend of technical triggers, sector-wide caution, and delayed price recognition of ecosystem growth as network activity grew – $699M in bridge inflows (30 days) and $8.98B stablecoin market cap Recent news DefiLlama data shows ~1B SEI ($148M) unstaked in November – the largest monthly withdrawal since 2023. This follows Aquiline Capital Partners’ $120M acquisition of SEI’s Archway platform, which may have prompted institutional profit-taking. Will SEI reach $1? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI will rise above $1 in 2028, when the coin will reach a high of $1.21. Can Sei Coin reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Will SEI reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Does SEI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, SEI will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory Is SEI a good investment? SEI has growing utility, and its EVM compatibility helps it steal a share of Ethereum’s dominance. While the technical analysis is bearish, price predictions paint a different picture.

The coin will achieve a high of $0.38 before the end of 2025. In 2027, it will range between $0.71 and $0.86, with an average of $0.73. However, you should note that SEI is still highly volatile.

As BTC rises above $92,000, many investors wonder about the sustainability of this price point. Historical data suggests that Bitcoin often consolidates after breaking major resistance levels.

The $92,000 level represents a significant achievement, though Bitcoin has experienced higher prices during previous market cycles under different market conditions. What should I watch for after this price breakthrough? Monitor trading volume, market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technical indicators to gauge the sustainability of this price level and potential future movements. Could Bitcoin drop significantly from this level? Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and price corrections are normal. However, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong according to many analysts. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often leads the broader crypto market.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s Composite Index has dropped to 0.72, signaling a deeper correction and raising the risk of a fall toward $87,500. Weak liquidity and fading expectations of a December Fed rate cut are amplifying selling pressure. A break above 1.0 on the Composite Index would flip momentum bullish again. The market’s Composite Index, a blend of multiple on-chain and sentiment indicators, has fallen to 0.72, its lowest reading since April 2025. That level places Bitcoin squarely in the “Pessimism/Correction” band, a zone that historically precedes sharper pullbacks, especially when liquidity conditions are weak. Bitcoin Risks Drop to $87.5K as Fed Cut Bets Fade, Analyst Warns The shift comes as traders scale back expectations of a December Federal Reserve rate cut and risk appetite thins across crypto. GugaOnChain notes that if the ratio drops below 0.75, short-term holders are likely to take profits aggressively, opening the door to a slide toward $87,500, a level that previously acted as strong support in March. “Selling pressure combined with weak liquidity confirmed a broader downtrend over the weekend,” the analyst wrote. For now, Bitcoin remains stuck between key zones. A ratio between 0.8 and 1.0 would signal consolidation inside the $90,000–$110,000 range, suggesting traders are holding but not adding fresh exposure. Composite Index Pointing to a Deeper Correction: $87,500 Support Back on the Radar “If the ratio falls below 0.75, short-term holders will take profits, and the price may correct to $87,500 — a support level dating back to March.” – By @GugaOnChain pic.twitter.com/qQ9Rpdsn0H — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 18, 2025 A decisive break back above 1.0, however, would flip the outlook bullish again, with the Composite Index pointing to potential targets in the $150,000–$175,000 range, consistent with patterns from the 2017 and 2021 cycles. Bitcoin traded near $92,600 at the time of the report, with the analyst warning that the market remains vulnerable but not without opportunities. A clear reversal signal, stronger liquidity, or improving macro conditions could stabilize the trend. Bitcoin Drops Below $90K as Whales Sell and ETF Outflows Deepen As reported, Cameron Winklevoss has called the recent pullback in Bitcoin price a potential “last chance” to buy the dip. “This is the last time you’ll ever be able to buy bitcoin below $90k!” he wrote on X. The drop from October’s $126,000 peak has wiped roughly $600 billion in market value and revived both bullish and bearish arguments across trading desks. Macro pressure, including a prolonged US government shutdown, trade tensions, and weak liquidity, has weighed on all risk assets. Bitcoin’s steep slide accelerated after $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated last month, while large holders have begun selling into the weakness. On-chain data shows whale short positions now outweigh longs, and Bitcoin ETFs have seen several consecutive weeks of net outflows. Traders are watching whether heavy selling, from whales, ETFs and long-term holders, continues to overwhelm thin liquidity. Options markets show strong demand for downside protection, while analysts point to $93,000 as a critical support level. Despite the turbulence, institutional buyers like MicroStrategy remain active, reinforcing the recurring belief that deep pullbacks often precede new highs when liquidity conditions eventually improve.

Cloud mining continues to be a popular option for earning passive income without the need for expensive hardware or dealing with electricity costs. But which platform truly stands out in terms of profitability, reliability, and ease of use? In this comparison, we’ll examine key features of both platforms, explore their strengths and weaknesses, and help you decide which is the best fit for your crypto mining journey. Is Crypto Mining Profitable in 2025? Crypto mining can still be profitable, but success depends on factors like: Mining Difficulty: Increased network competition raises difficulty. Cryptocurrency Prices: Fluctuating prices impact returns. Platform Fees: Different platforms have varying fees. Contract Terms: Short-term contracts offer flexibility; long-term contracts provide stability. With cloud mining, beginners can start earning passive income without needing expensive hardware or technical expertise.

The former vice chair, Michael Barr, has criticized the new guidance, warning that they will weaken supervision. According to the Federal Reserve agency, the updated guidelines are aimed at streamlining examinations and focusing supervisory resources more effectively. The new framework has been welcomed by the vice chair, saying it streamlines oversight and reduces unnecessary regulatory burdens. Bowman says the guidelines will improve transparency and accountability The guidelines were released to Federal Reserve employees on October 29 before being distributed to the public on Tuesday. According to the Fed’s set rules, the examination process has been aligned with core threats to banking safety, such as credit quality, liquidity pressures, governance failures, and operational weakness. Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve Vice Chair, said that the rules are intended to improve the reserve’s supervisory work and strengthen transparency and accountability. She added that putting oversight in material financial risk would empower the banking system’s foundation without limiting the agency’s core responsibilities. Examiners have been directed to focus on financial conditions that present meaningful risk to banks’ portfolios or long-term viability. The set rules show that supervisors should avoid diverting attention to non-material issues such as repetitive documentation requirements or procedural exercises. According to the new guidelines, banks will also be allowed to self-certify compliance in certain limited, non-material areas. The Federal Reserve confirmed that the self-certification will reduce duplication between supervisory bodies and enable examiners to focus on significant risks instead of administrative reviews. According to the guidelines, supervisors are directed to collaborate closely with other federal and state regulators, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and to defer examination. Based on a recent Cryptopolitan report , the OCC issued similar changes to its own oversight practices, such as the elimination of reputational risk from its evaluation metrics. The new guidelines form part of the Trump administration’s overhaul of several financial rules that were implemented during the Biden era after the 2008 crisis. Furthermore, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is currently operating in a limited form and has canceled several regulations that were in place before. Barr says the guidelines represent a moment of inflection for financial stability Greg Baer, President and CEO of the Bank Policy Institute, responded positively with broad support to the Federal Reserve’s announcement. Baer noted that banks are most resilient when oversight prioritizes material financial risks rather than administrative compliance tasks. He added that industry groups have maintained a push for a supervisory structure that they say better communicates actual risks within banking operations. Despite the support from industry groups, the former Federal Reserve Chair and current governor of the Reserve Board, Michael Barr. He warned that the new guidelines across multiple agencies represent a moment of inflection, according to his description of financial stability. Barr noted that the cumulative weakening of supervisory standards would make it difficult for regulators to intervene early when banks begin taking excessive risks. According to Barr, multiple vulnerabilities across the banking system arise gradually and may require broad supervisory authority to detect. He argued that narrowing the scope of examinations may cause examiners to overlook arising threats that do not initially appear material. Barr also said that the changes may result in fewer chances for examiners to spot problems before they spread across the financial system. Bowman, the current vice chair, has also directed a reduction of approximately 30% in the Federal Reserve workforce, mainly by attrition. Barr criticized the directive, saying it risks limiting the agency’s speed and agility in responding to bank issues. He revealed that fewer staff members represent fewer findings, slower remediations, and diminished capacity to conduct forward-looking assessments.

What’s Happening?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-rose-to-90-on-this-major-exchange-whats-happening/,"XRP just shocked the crypto ecosystem, as CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) reported that the asset touched $90 on Kraken. Exchange data from Kraken shows a sharp vertical move at 05:15 UTC+1. That moment stood out because nothing in the market had hinted at such a surge. The chart displayed normal activity before the spike. It then showed a wick that reached far above the current range. Traders who saw it tried to understand how the price could shift from the $2 range to that level, and many community members confirmed the unusual activity. How High Did XRP Climb? XRP opened the trading session near $2.18. It then recorded a high of $91.6299 before falling back toward the earlier range. The spike sat alone on the feed. No surrounding candles supported the move. The asset is now trading at $2.18. XRP has remained relatively quiet over the past few days despite major spot ETF launches. The spike showed no prior buildup. The drop back to the normal range came fast, giving the chart an unusual shape. What a Sustained Price Could Have Meant If XRP had held its position at over $90, the market would have shifted dramatically. A stable price at that level would have pushed XRP into a new valuation tier, making it the largest asset in the crypto space. A lasting price near $90 would have also created new interest from large holders who track the asset. A stable move to that range would have impacted sentiment across multiple assets that track XRP movement, especially as the XRP community grows through spot ETFs . Possible Cause of the Spike Several factors can explain a move like this. The most plausible cause points to a glitch . Trading platforms occasionally show brief errors when they load large amounts of data. A single mispriced trade can create a flash wick. The shape of the candle supports that idea because it ran straight up and straight down with no buildup. XRP has also experienced multiple glitches in the past , as exchanges displayed much higher prices. The quiet period shown on the chart does not match the behavior of a genuine breakout. A glitch aligns with the speed of the correction. The price returned to the normal range before traders could react.

54602802,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=220603,1763544310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical MASA Investment Warning: Coinone’s Urgent Alert for Crypto Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinone-masa-investment-warning/,"BitcoinWorld Critical MASA Investment Warning: Coinone’s Urgent Alert for Crypto Investors South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinone has issued a critical MASA investment warning that every crypto investor needs to hear. This urgent alert comes as the exchange identifies significant risks associated with Masa token’s upcoming supply changes. But what does this MASA investment warning mean for your portfolio, and should you be concerned? Why Did Coinone Issue This MASA Investment Warning? Coinone’s decision to flag MASA stems from scheduled changes to the token’s total supply. The exchange explicitly stated that these modifications could trigger substantial price volatility. When a cryptocurrency’s supply dynamics shift, it directly impacts market stability and investor returns. This MASA investment warning serves as a protective measure for traders who might otherwise face unexpected losses. The timing of this announcement is crucial. Investors often overlook supply change announcements, focusing instead on price movements. However, supply alterations can dramatically affect token valuation. Coinone’s proactive approach demonstrates their commitment to investor protection in the volatile crypto space. What Makes Supply Changes So Risky? Cryptocurrency supply modifications create several potential challenges for investors. Understanding these risks helps explain why this MASA investment warning matters: Price instability – Sudden supply changes can cause rapid price swings Liquidity concerns – Market depth may decrease during transition periods Uncertain valuation – Traditional pricing models become less reliable Market sentiment shifts – Investor confidence may waver during changes These factors combine to create the perfect storm for volatility. The MASA investment warning specifically addresses these concerns, giving investors time to adjust their strategies accordingly. How Should Investors Respond to This Warning? When facing a formal MASA investment warning from a major exchange like Coinone, prudent investors should take specific actions. First, review your current MASA holdings and assess your risk tolerance. Second, monitor official announcements from both Coinone and the MASA development team regarding the supply change timeline. Consider diversifying your portfolio if MASA represents a significant portion of your investments. The MASA investment warning doesn’t necessarily mean you should sell immediately, but it does suggest increased caution and closer monitoring. Remember that exchange warnings typically precede periods of heightened market activity. What Does This Mean for Crypto Safety? Coinone’s MASA investment warning represents a positive trend in cryptocurrency regulation and investor protection. Exchanges are increasingly taking responsibility for alerting users about potential risks. This development benefits the entire crypto ecosystem by promoting transparency and informed decision-making. The MASA investment warning sets an important precedent. It shows that reputable exchanges are willing to prioritize user safety over trading volume. As the crypto market matures, we can expect more exchanges to follow Coinone’s lead in issuing timely alerts about potential market disruptions. Key Takeaways from Coinone’s Alert This MASA investment warning teaches us several valuable lessons about cryptocurrency investing. Always pay attention to exchange announcements, particularly those involving token economics. Understand that supply changes can significantly impact price stability. Most importantly, recognize that professional exchanges like Coinone issue warnings for valid reasons that deserve serious consideration. The crypto market continues evolving, and investor protection mechanisms are improving. The MASA investment warning demonstrates how the industry is developing safer trading environments through transparent communication and proactive risk management. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is the MASA investment warning about? Coinone issued the MASA investment warning due to scheduled changes in the token’s total supply, which are expected to cause significant price volatility and market instability. Should I immediately sell my MASA tokens? While the warning suggests caution, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should panic sell. Assess your risk tolerance and investment strategy before making decisions. How long will this investment warning remain in effect? Investment warnings typically remain until the identified risk factors stabilize. Monitor Coinone’s official channels for updates on the warning status. Can I still trade MASA on Coinone during this warning? Yes, trading typically continues during investment warnings, but with increased risk awareness recommended for all participants. Are other exchanges likely to issue similar warnings? Other exchanges may follow Coinone’s lead if they identify similar risks, though each platform makes independent decisions about warnings.

Currently, BTC has fallen to a seven-month low below $90,000. While this decline fuels bearish rhetoric and increased expectations of further declines, cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision has published its updated analysis for Bitcoin (BTC). Analysts noted that Bitcoin has failed to break above the prominent red trend line for months, leading to further selling and decline. MakroVision, outlining its Bitcoin expectations, stated that the failure to break the trend line and the recent declines are signs that weakness will continue in the medium term. Analysts pointed to the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $95.9,000 for the upside potential, stating that a rapid recovery above this level soon would be an important signal that the upward momentum is renewed. Analysts also stated that a rapid recovery above $102,000 is crucial for the uptrend, but on the other hand, they think that Bitcoin could decline as long as it remains below the red trend line, which is around $106,000. “…Only a sudden recovery of the $102,000 level can temper the decline. However, as long as the price remains below the red trend line, bearish pressure will clearly continue to prevail.” Bitcoin remains weak. The decline from the trend line confirms the bears' strength, and unless the $102,000 zone is reclaimed, the lower supports at $91,700 and $85,600 remain quite important. Bitcoin has seen a minor recovery in the last 24 hours, rising above $90,000 once again. #Bitcoin Chart Update BTC konnte sich nicht über die rote Trendlinie erholen, welche seit Monaten immer wieder sehr markant ist.

Before XRP can address the current selling pressure from its long-term holders, the space is getting captured by the new wave of DeFi innovations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto coin, having recently began its presale and is due to capture the most value due to its community mechanics and high level of security. Investors are searching for new tokens to capture value and in the coming years, the potential will be exponential. This makes Mutuum Finance the potential leading for all other tokens in the market. This is what makes the debate for what crypto to buy near the high 2026, to be focused solely on Mutuum Finance. XRP Suffers High Structural Selling Pressure Given the current on-chain data and the price performance of XRP, the short term holds a grim outlook. There are short term buyers attempting to purchase the market downturn; however, there has been a significant increase of long-term investors selling and leaving the market. The Hodler Net Position Change shows that in the last two weeks, there has been a 77% increase in long-term selling pressure, with 181.50 million XRP that has exited its top 50 wallets. This chronic market exit is acting as a price anchored resistance. Also, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator is currently below a downward sloping trendline and is well below the zero baseline. This is indicative of large players withdrawing capital at an increasing pace. XRP has a market cap of $126.64 billion with resistance at $2.26 and support at $2.06. Therefore, the current market conditions are, to say the least, unfavorable. This is forcing investors to move on from XRP to other potential opportunities that are appearing in the market. A Presale that Defines Market Phenomenon Unlike XRP, Mutuum Finance is showing what real market demand looks like. The ongoing presale has been a phenomenon, almost selling out Phase 6 at the current price of $0.035. Phase 6 is the last chance for investors to buy into the presale before the price increases by 20% at Phase 7. The presale has raised a considerable amount, and the community continues to grow, showing that the community has faith in the project. Those making a list for the best crypto to buy for 2026 must note the rapidly closing window for investors to purchase at the ground price. The demand for the presale has been unprecedented. The presale has been the best available cryptocurrency and has elevated the claim for MUTM to the best crypto to complete your portfolio with. Daily Leaderboard Fuels Competitive Investment Outside of the metrics for money management, Mutuum Finance maintains user commitment through a one of a kind invention, their leaderboard which operates on a 24 hour cycle. This automates the ranking of the top 50 holders daily and introduces a competitive aspect that incentivizes ongoing engagement. The user that finishes the cycle with the top position, provided they make a transaction, gets a $500 MUTM bonus each day. This structure both enhances the inflow of capital and creates an ecosystem with engagement that differentiates the token from other investments. For the user looking to actively participate in a community or ecosystem, the structure of MUTM solves the investment problem. Security Foundations Built on Trust With plenty of new projects in the crypto space, Mutuum Finance continues to maintain security and has undergone audits with CertiK to ensure their system is running optimally with no security defects, receiving the top score for their token scan. Mutuum Finance has also implemented a bug bounty program costing $50,000 where participants are paid to find security flaws in the system. Completely synergistically, this will aim to strengthen the potential risks in the system before it is fully deployed in the mainnet. The Verdict Concerning The Next Major Crypto Asset Unlike Ripple, whose volatility is strictly internal with no bull runs in sight, Mutuum Finance is currently on a solid trajectory with an almost sold-out pre-sale phase 6. Their security is also top flight with an active system and no vulnerabilities. There is a limited entry point for the Mutuum Finance ecosystem. The price of $0.035 for the Mutuum Token (MUTM) will quickly be surpassed as the project progresses to the next stages. Investors looking to pre-empt the most profitable crypto assets for 2026, this is their opportunity to switch from a passive to an active stance in the crypto markets. Mutuum Finance has irreversibly changed the potential for active market participants in the crypto ecosystem.

The MoneyShow Chart of the Day compares the total return of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) to the State Street SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL), the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), and the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). Some holders got scared out of crypto by the liquidation event back in mid-October. Others are trading crypto as a tech stock-adjacent asset, so recent selling in Nasdaq and AI names has spilled over into the crypto world. By Mike Larson You might want to sit down for this one. As of this week, Treasury Bills are outperforming Bitcoin on the year! The bigger question for cryptocurrency traders, of course, is what happens next ? Take a look at the MoneyShow Chart of the Day, which compares the total return of the State Street SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF ( BIL ) to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). There it is in purple and orange - a gain of 3.6% vs. a loss of 1.7%. Bitcoin's relative performance looks a little worse against the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT ), up 5.7%. And it looks hideous when compared to the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ), up 53.4%. BIL, IBIT, GLD, TLT (YTD Total Return) (Data by YCharts) What’s happening? As this Bloomberg story notes : “Once promoted as a high-growth play, an inflation hedge, and a portfolio diversifier, the world’s largest cryptocurrency now faces the prospect of ending the year in the red - without fulfilling any of those roles.” Some holders got scared out of crypto by the liquidation event back in mid-October. Others are trading crypto as a tech stock-adjacent asset, so recent selling in Nasdaq and AI names has spilled over into the crypto world. Plus, the euphoria surrounding a lighter regulatory touch in Washington and broad-based ETF inflows has faded. Can anything turn the ship around? It’ll likely take a broader stabilization in the tech sector to rekindle risk-on trading in crypto. If Federal Reserve rate cut forecasts pick up, and the US dollar rolls back over, that could help, too. The passage of time and some sideways chop could also set the stage for a fresh leg up by weeding out the weak hands. At some point before long, though, I’d venture that Bitcoin will find its footing - and outperform T-Bills. Not by a small margin, either!

This is according to his most recent transaction report, filed on November 18, with the Clerk of the House of Representatives. This follows a 27% plunge in Bitcoin from a record high above $126k last month. The purchase comes amid heightened volatility and renewed investor interest in digital assets despite the sharp decline. Gill, a former investment banker and close ally of President Donald Trump, bought between $100,000 and $250,000 in Bitcoin on October 20, and nine days later acquired $15,001 to $50,000 in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Periodic House transaction disclosures report investment ranges rather than exact amounts. Meanwhile, reports from the House showed a diverse range of investments in figures rather than a specific amount. Gill’s cryptocurrency disclosures ignite discussions As a first-term lawmaker serving on the House Budget Committee, Gill has actively engaged with the Bitcoin world, making significant investments in the ecosystem since assuming his role in January. The representative’s overall holding in BTC totaled roughly $2.6 million, based on House transaction reports. The data also outlined that Gill invested up to $150,000 in IBIT this year. When reporters contacted Gill’s office for further comments on the matter, they declined to respond. According to reports from CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin is currently trading at $91,600.74, reflecting a 1.87% increase in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT oversees over $74 billion in assets. This amount is more than three times larger than the next largest spot Bitcoin fund, according to CoinGlass. Gill’s cryptocurrency disclosures revealed that the representative purchased up to $1.5 million in Bitcoin through three separate transactions over three weeks starting in late June. This move involved an investment of up to $1 million on June 20. Additionally, he received $850,000 in BTC in four separate transactions that commenced in late January. This purchase spree has drawn scrutiny. The government transparency group OpenSecrets raised concerns about Gill’s purchases. They declared that the representative failed to properly report up to $500,000 of his previous Bitcoin purchases. The law required him to report within the 45-day timeframe set by federal law. According to sources close to the situation, Gill reported a purchase of between $100,001 and $250,000 in the digital asset on January 29 and February 27, only to disclose these trades on June 2. At this time, the deadline set by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act had already expired. Approved in 2012, the STOCK Act aims to eliminate insider trading and ensure lawmakers are accountable by mandating them to report their stock trades promptly and regularly, including those related to digital assets. Despite these efforts in place, sources have still raised concerns about how lawbreakers are fined. Based on the argument, the $200 fine they received is a relatively small amount, and congressional ethics committees frequently overlook this fine, highlighting the need to establish tougher measures in this sector. Rep. Gill proves to be a strong Bitcoin supporter Reports indicate that Gill is a strong proponent of cryptocurrencies, and his trade in January occurred days after Trump signed an executive order to loosen regulations on digital assets. For the February purchase, the sources highlighted that it occurred just ahead of Trump’s announcement of his strategic Bitcoin reserve program on March 6. In May, Gill made two more Bitcoin purchases, which he reported on time. His move led analysts to research and discover that US representatives for congressional districts embrace the cryptocurrency world. To support this claim, they mentioned that Georgia’s state representative, Marjorie Taylor, bought approximately $60,000 in IBIT this year, as reported by the House. Additionally, representative Guy Reschenthaler, who has represented Pennsylvania’s 14th congressional district, sold his Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana holdings earlier in the year. Gill also invests in the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF, a technology-focused ETF closely following the Nasdaq David Meyers, who is the director of communications and marketing at OpenSecrets, shared an email stating that “crypto transactions are just as ethical—or unethical—as stock transactions.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|BTC|IBIT|SOL|USD|XRP,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-19 09:30:48

The token has seen bearish sentiment in line with broader cryptocurrency market trends. According to insights from crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if bulls fail to defend current support levels, XRP could retrace significantly amid weakening momentum. In an X post on November 29, Martinez based his outlook on the latest UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) data from Glassnode , which shows that XRP is now trading in a zone with thinning buyer support, increasing the risk of a deeper pullback. XRP UTXO chart. Source: Glassnode The data highlighted a dense concentration of previously realized prices around the $2.15 region, a level XRP recently slipped below, suggesting many traders may now be sitting on unrealized losses that could accelerate selling. If XRP continues to struggle beneath $2.15, the next major support zones identified by on-chain signals sit at $1.91 and $1.73. These areas reflect strong historical activity and could act as stabilizing levels if downward pressure intensifies. Long term investors signal more XRP collapse Another concerning factor for XRP is the behavior of long-term holders. Data shared by Martinez suggested a significant shift in sentiment among this cohort. Metrics from Glassnode’s Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicate a transition from earlier phases of euphoria and denial to rising anxiety as the market price approaches the critical $2 threshold. XRP long-term holder NUPL. Source: Glassnode Throughout 2025, long-term holders have mirrored overall market volatility, with sentiment rising and falling alongside price swings. The latest downturn, however, points to weakening confidence among investors typically viewed as XRP’s most stable base. A drop below $2 would deepen this anxiety phase and signal a broader reassessment of XRP’s long-term value. While NUPL doesn’t forecast price movements, its psychological framing helps explain investor behavior. The current shift underscores growing pressure on XRP as the market waits for clearer direction. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.15, down about 1.6% in the past 24 hours and roughly 11% on the week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP also hovers below its 50-day SMA at $2.55 and 200-day SMA at $2.60, signaling short-term weakness as the asset remains under key moving averages that now act as dynamic resistance. This setup suggests ongoing downward pressure, with the price needing to reclaim the 50-day SMA to hint at a bullish reversal. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI at 38.73 remains in neutral territory, neither oversold (below 30) nor overbought (above 70), indicating stabilized momentum without signs of immediate exhaustion.

After the latest market downturn, 42% of the XRP supply is in the red. XRP holders, especially short-term buyers, are challenged to hold through a precarious period. As of November 19, only 58% of holders have unrealized gains, with 42% of the supply underwater. XRP retained some of its earnings since 2024, but the supply turnover moved coins to new holders. Only 58% of holders have unrealized gains, down from 90% in October. | Source: CoinGecko . The metric suffered a rapid shift, as XRP holders were quite confident in October. At that time, over 90% of the XRP supply was in the green, suggesting a potential rally to a higher range. XRP fell to $2.19, after weeks of trading sideways. Currently, XRP sentiment remains low for retail traders. One of the major sources of pressure for XRP was the ongoing whale selling . While holders were confident about XRP, older whales and traders shed a significant part of their holdings, especially during periods of bullish sentiment. This allowed whales to cash out during the stronger market times, leaving other holders with losses. XRP saw holder turnover in the past year For XRP, the percentage of supply in profit returned to levels not seen since November 2024. At that time, XRP made its first hike from $0.50 to over $1, before an even stronger year-end rally. XRP peaked above $3 in 2025, but has not fulfilled expectations of a higher price range. In the past year, the available supply saw a turnover from whales to new holders, which acquired the asset at a much higher range. The main expectation for XRP was a climb to $10 during a more significant bull market. With the current correction, XRP is becoming riskier to hold, recalling previous waiting periods of years in a bear market. The current wave of holders continued to support XRP with expectations of a hike to over $6, fueling the buying during the year’s peak valuations. XRP open interest also remains relatively high, with more traders attempting to go long. However, XRP remains risky, with $3.9M in long liquidations for the past day. David Portnoy buys the dip on XRP Amid the recent price drop for XRP, an unexpected whale moved in. David Portnoy, known for his forays into meme tokens , announced an XRP purchase as part of pouring $2M into several crypto assets. Portnoy announced he bought $500K worth of XRP, among other assets, including ETH. The purchase was too small to boost XRP, and was not a sufficient driver for social media hype, due to generally low sentiment. XRP retains relatively high mindshare, due to its legacy status and the ‘Ripple army’ of posters, influencers, and early holders. Based on Messari data, mindshare expanded by 12% to a total of 1.2% , surpassing even more active assets. For now, XRP is seen as risky, potentially sinking into another years-long bear market, as mass adoption of the XRPL is still slow, with the protocol only carrying $73M in value locked.

Kraken just pulled off the kind of move the market has been begging for. The US-based exchange has raised $800M across two funding rounds , locking in a fresh $20B valuation and a clear mandate: global expansion, deeper regulation-ready products, and more aggressive growth even as prices wobble. The raise was led by heavyweight trading and investment firms and included a $200M strategic check from Citadel Securities. That is not ‘degens in the comments’ money. It is institutional capital effectively saying that, despite choppy prices and scary candles, crypto infrastructure is worth backing at scale. For the broader market, this does two things. First, it reinforces that regulated exchanges are here to stay. Secondly, it hints at a coming wave of new products and listings as platforms like Kraken push into Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. Historically, big exchange war chests have tended to front-run the next wave of adoption and altcoin rotation. That’s where narrative-driven sectors come in. AI tokens are already hot, the creator economy is a multi-billion-dollar beast, and capital is hunting for projects with real revenue and sticky users rather than pure meme froth. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , sitting at the intersection of AI and the creator economy, is positioning itself as one of the presales ready to absorb that renewed risk-on appetite. How Kraken’s $20B War Chest Helps The $SUBBD Narrative Kraken’s new capital is earmarked for scaling global operations, strengthening its regulated footprint, and expanding its product suite, including derivatives and structured products. More regulated venues and deeper liquidity usually mean easier onramps for retail and institutions, tighter spreads, and more room for smaller-cap narratives to run once they finally list. In past cycles, the pattern has been simple: first Bitcoin and the majors get bid, then big exchanges raise fresh capital and roll out new products, and only after that does serious liquidity rotate into higher-beta sectors like AI, gaming, and creator tokens. Kraken’s $800M raise is exactly the kind of mid-cycle infrastructure signal that often precedes that rotation. SUBBD is lined up in one of the most obvious beneficiaries of such a rotation: the Web3 creator economy. That’s what SUBBD is for : an AI-integrated creator platform on Ethereum, targeting the traditional subscription and paywalled-content market that has historically taken punitive cuts from creators. Instead of surrendering up to 70% of their revenue, influencers can use SUBBD to gate content, run subscriptions, and automate engagement directly on-chain. The platform already claims it’s ready to onboard 2,000 creators and more than 250M combined followers. That kind of embedded audience is what turns a speculative token into something with at least a shot at real cash flow. In a world where big exchanges are becoming more comfortable listing revenue-generating altcoins, tokens backed by active platforms and subscription streams have a cleaner story than pure memes. The $SUBBD token itself sits at the core of this system. It powers subscription payments, unlocks exclusive content and drops, grants access to proprietary AI creator tools, and plugs into governance and on-platform staking. As the ecosystem grows, more creator-fan interactions route through the token rather than fiat rails. Learn more on SUBBD’s presale page. $SUBBD Token Presale Turns AI Creator Fans Into Stakeholders The SUBBD presale is where the AI narrative becomes actionable. The ICO has already raised more than $1.35M, with the token currently priced at $0.056975 in its latest stage. At this level, the fully diluted valuation sits in the mid–$50M range, leaving plenty of theoretical headroom if the more optimistic price projections ever come close. Our $SUBBD price forecast , for example, puts the token at a 8.4x potential ROI in 2026, and over 40x by 2030. Learn how to buy $SUBBD at the current low price. What sets this presale apart from a random flyer is the clear tie to an existing platform and its monetization model. SUBBD’s business is simple to grasp: fans pay to access creators; creators keep more of the revenue. SUBBD, sitting in the middle, routes much of the activity through the $SUBBD token. That creates a direct link between platform usage and token demand that many AI narratives simply don’t have. On top of that, the token includes fixed 20% staking rewards, giving early holders an immediate incentive to lock their allocation and support network security and liquidity. In a market where many tokens rely purely on ‘number go up’ to keep people interested, a predictable staking yield can help smooth out volatility and encourage longer holding periods. Kraken’s $20B flex tells you the rails are being built. SUBBD’s presale is effectively a bet that a chunk of the next adoption wave will run through AI-powered creator economies rather than purely speculative memes. Visit the official $SUBBD presale.

And now two premium indicators are plunging so deeply into the red that traders are asking who — or what — is unloading so much BTC. Coinbase Premium Slumps as Analyst Claims 18 Days of Continuous Bitcoin Selling A closely watched Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index has flipped deep into negative territory as one market commentator claims the U.S. exchange has seen “zero buys” on the gauge for nearly a full day and selling pressure for more than two weeks. In a post on X, the account Against Wall Street urged traders to “take a look at the Coinbase Premium Index 1m chart,” saying the data show uninterrupted selling for 18 straight days and no recorded buy signals in the past 19 hours. The attached chart from Coinglass displays the premium rate in red below the zero line while Bitcoin’s price fluctuates in the mid-$90,000 range. Coinbase Premium Index Chart. Source: Coinglass / X The Coinbase Premium Index tracks whether Bitcoin trades at a higher or lower price on Coinbase compared with other major venues. When the metric turns negative, it suggests weaker spot demand from U.S. buyers relative to offshore markets. Extended negative readings can therefore point to sustained selling or an absence of aggressive dip-buying on the exchange. The post’s author described the pattern as “dumping nonstop” and questioned who might be behind the selling, asking why “they are unloading so much Bitcoin.” However, the tweet did not provide additional on-chain or order-book evidence to identify specific players, and Coinbase has not commented on the claim. Even so, the move in the premium index adds another signal for traders already tracking liquidity conditions across major exchanges. Bitcoin’s Coinbase Premium Gap Drops to Minus $90, Matching Earlier Stress Signal Meanwhile, a key liquidity gauge on CryptoQuant show s Coinbase ’s Bitcoin premium gap sliding to about minus $90, signaling a sharp discount versus other venues. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Chart. Source: CryptoQuant / X Analyst NekoZ highlighted the reading on X, calling it “a shift in market power” as the U.S. exchange’s spot price trades well below offshore markets. The premium gap tracks the difference between Bitcoin prices on Coinbase and those on other major platforms, offering a window into relative buying or selling pressure. The latest drop marks one of the deepest negative readings of the year. According to NekoZ, the last comparable move came in February 2025, when the premium gap fell to roughly minus $138. At that time, institutional investors were already pulling back, and the discount pointed to weaker demand on Coinbase.

Trump mentioned that there exists the possibility of achieving AI developments in a way that protects children and prevents censorship. He also highlighted that China will overtake the U.S. in the AI race if America over-regulates the sector. Trump advised lawmakers to pass a separate bill and place a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to address the issues at hand. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia Corp., also made similar remarks, saying that China boasts streamlined regulations that give Beijing a competitive advantage in the AI race over the United States. He also noted that China has advanced AI technology, with its AI researchers accounting for approximately 50% of the world’s AI researchers. OpenAI warns that state regulations could bury AI companies The news comes amid concerns from AI companies based in the U.S. over state regulations of the sector. Cryptopolitan previously reported in mid-March that leading AI companies, such as OpenAI, support federal regulation over state regulation of AI legislation. OpenAI urged the Trump administration to block state AI regulations in exchange for access to its AI model. OpenAI argued that fragmented regulations at the state level raise serious concerns about the possibility of damaging America’s position as the leading AI hub. OpenAI’s concerns arose at a time when hundreds of AI-related bills were under review across the U.S. The AI company cautioned that state regulations will hinder both small and large AI corporations, thereby limiting their growth. The company highlighted its concerns in a 15-page policy document released in response to a request from the White House for public feedback on AI policy. Steve Scalise, House Majority Leader and a Louisiana Republican, said earlier this week that Republican leaders were “looking at” adding the language into the National Defense Authorization Act. The regulation, which sets the Pentagon’s budget and expenditures, often becomes a vehicle for other policy measures. The bill is set to ban state regulation of AI development effectively. Bloomberg reported that several proposals are currently being discussed, including the exemption of AI companies from state regulation if they agree to federal standards in other areas, such as child safety. Despite the AI race gaining traction, investors have expressed fears that the AI bubble is about to burst. Global financial markets have fallen sharply in the U.S., Asia, and Europe amid concerns that the surge in valuations of artificial intelligence (AI) companies could be declining rapidly. Cryptopolitan reported in early November that Tech and AI stocks on Wall Street had their worst week since April as investors slowed down on high‑risk trades. AI companies Palantir and Oracle were among the stocks that were heavily hit. The crypto market also pulled back significantly, sending Bitcoin below $100k for the first time since June.

Organizations evaluating long-term digital infrastructure often prioritize systems that combine controlled execution environments with transparent supply models and compatibility with existing workflows. Bitcoin Munari introduces an architecture designed around these requirements. The system applies a fixed-supply model derived from Bitcoin while expanding operational scope through a Solana launch phase and a dedicated Layer-1 chain that supports validator participation, smart contracts, privacy tools, and governance. This combination has drawn interest from institutions that monitor developments across programmable blockchains and controlled execution networks. Enterprise Context in the Current Blockchain Landscape Several platforms form the core of today’s enterprise blockchain sector, each addressing specific operational and regulatory needs. Ethereum Ethereum provides a public smart-contract network used for tokenization, automated settlement, and application development. Enterprises rely on Ethereum’s established developer ecosystem, standardized tooling, and compatibility with private or permissioned variants supported by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Its programmable environment enables organizations to test and deploy workflows that require automation, asset issuance, or complex transaction logic. Hyperledger Fabric Hyperledger Fabric uses a modular, permissioned design under the Linux Foundation. Its identity-driven architecture, channel-based data segregation, and configurable consensus mechanisms support deployments in sectors such as supply chain, government, and healthcare. Enterprises use Fabric for applications that require controlled participation, detailed audit trails, and reliable transaction throughput. IBM Blockchain Platform The IBM Blockchain Platform extends Fabric with managed hosting, governance tools, and enterprise connectors. Organizations adopt this environment for cross-organization data sharing, supply chain automation, and financial documentation workflows. Its design supports integrated monitoring, identity management, and lifecycle control for networks that need direct compatibility with existing enterprise software. Hedera Hedera operates as a public ledger using Proof-of-Stake and hashgraph consensus. Its governance council, which includes global corporations, oversees network parameters and operational policy. Enterprises use Hedera for tokenization, supply chain data, and identity systems requiring predictable fees, consistent throughput, and clear governance structures. These platforms illustrate the characteristics institutions consistently evaluate: programmability, identity frameworks, predictable execution, and operational clarity. Bitcoin Munari’s Position Within This Institutional Framework Bitcoin Munari applies a fixed-supply monetary model while providing infrastructure suited for programmable applications. The initial Solana deployment introduces an operational environment with high throughput, low transaction fees, and established wallet and DEX compatibility. This phase enables BTCM to function immediately within an existing network rather than remaining inert during development. To support institutional due-diligence standards, Bitcoin Munari’s presale contracts and Solana-phase infrastructure have undergone independent verification. The project completed the Solidproof Smart Contract Audit along with the Spy Wolf Smart Contract Audit , both evaluating operational integrity and contract reliability. Team identity validation was conducted through the Spy Wolf KYC Verification , providing additional transparency typically required by enterprise participants assessing early-stage blockchain systems. The forthcoming Munari mainnet adds capabilities relevant to institutional use cases. The chain uses delegated Proof-of-Stake for validator participation, integrates an EVM-compatible execution layer for contract deployment, and includes optional privacy settings for transaction visibility control. Governance mechanisms allow BTCM holders to participate in protocol decisions, forming a structured environment for long-term operation. Technical Architecture Built for Multi-Layer Execution The Munari architecture incorporates components designed for sustained utility across several development stages: Delegated Proof-of-Stake validator framework Staking and delegation mechanisms tied to BTCM EVM-compatible smart-contract engine Privacy configuration options On-chain governance functions 1:1 migration bridge between Solana and the mainnet These components form an execution environment suitable for decentralized applications, programmable financial systems, and controlled transaction logic. BTCM functions as the unit for transaction fees, validator staking, and contract execution, maintaining consistent utility from the Solana phase through mainnet deployment. Fixed-Supply Allocation Providing Defined Economic Parameters The BTCM supply is capped at 21,000,000 tokens , divided into categories supporting public access, validator rewards, liquidity, development activity, and ecosystem expansion. Allocation: Public presale: 11,130,000 BTCM Validator rewards: 6,090,000 BTCM Liquidity reserves: 1,680,000 BTCM Team under vesting: 1,050,000 BTCM Marketing and ecosystem: 1,050,000 BTCM The presale introduces the first access stage. Round 1 is priced at $0.35 , with a launch reference of $6.00 , producing a modeled 1,614% ROI for the opening tier. Presale tokens have no vesting period and activate upon BTCM’s release on Solana. The ten-round progression aligns early distribution with the platform’s multi-phase development cycle. Phased Integration Path from Solana to the Mainnet Bitcoin Munari’s roadmap links each stage to operational outcomes. The Solana phase delivers fast transfers, liquidity access, and early integration with decentralized tools. The migration bridge transitions BTCM to the mainnet on a 1:1 basis, maintaining supply consistency. The mainnet then introduces staking, contract deployment, governance participation, privacy settings, and application development. Additional stages include wallets, enterprise integrations, DeFi modules, and developer grant programs. This progression aligns BTCM with the functional categories institutions use when assessing blockchain systems.

These currency movements create both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency traders navigating the interconnected world of digital and traditional finance. What’s Driving the Dollar Strength in Current Markets? The US dollar continues to show impressive dollar strength against major currencies as investors position themselves ahead of the non-farm payrolls report. Market participants are closely watching for signals about the Federal Reserve’s next moves on interest rates. The dollar index has climbed 0.8% this week, reflecting growing confidence in the US economic outlook compared to other major economies. Why Payrolls Data Matters for Currency Traders The upcoming payrolls data represents one of the most significant economic indicators for forex markets. Strong employment numbers could signal continued economic resilience, potentially supporting further dollar appreciation. However, unexpectedly weak figures might trigger a reversal in recent gains. Traders are monitoring several key factors: Non-farm payrolls growth expectations Unemployment rate projections Average hourly earnings data Labor force participation rates Sterling Decline Accelerates After CPI Disappointment The British pound has experienced a sharp sterling decline following the latest Consumer Price Index release. UK inflation data came in below expectations, raising questions about the Bank of England’s monetary policy trajectory. The pound fell 1.2% against the dollar and 0.8% against the euro in immediate reaction to the news. Currency Pair Movement Key Driver GBP/USD -1.2% UK CPI miss EUR/GBP +0.8% Diverging inflation trends USD/JPY +0.6% Dollar strength CPI Inflation Impact on Global Currency Markets The recent CPI inflation data from the United Kingdom has sent ripples across global currency markets. Lower-than-expected inflation readings suggest the Bank of England might delay further interest rate hikes, reducing the pound’s attractiveness to yield-seeking investors. This development highlights how CPI inflation figures can dramatically alter currency valuations and trading strategies. Navigating Forex Markets During Economic Data Releases Successful navigation of forex markets requires understanding how economic indicators interact with currency values. The current environment demonstrates several key principles for traders: Economic data surprises often trigger immediate currency movements Central bank expectations drive medium-term trends Cross-currency correlations can create trading opportunities Risk management becomes crucial during high-volatility periods Actionable Insights for Modern Traders Traders can leverage these market movements by implementing strategic approaches. Monitoring economic calendars, understanding central bank communications, and maintaining flexible position sizing can help capitalize on volatility while managing risk. The interplay between traditional forex markets and cryptocurrency valuations offers additional dimensions for portfolio diversification. Unprecedented opportunities emerge when traditional currency movements create ripple effects across digital asset markets. The current dollar strength and sterling weakness present unique conditions for astute traders who understand the interconnected nature of global financial markets. FAQs What economic indicators most affect currency values? Key indicators include employment data, inflation figures (CPI), GDP growth, central bank decisions, and retail sales numbers. Each provides insights into economic health and potential policy changes. How does the Federal Reserve influence the US dollar? The Federal Reserve impacts the dollar through interest rate decisions, quantitative easing programs, and forward guidance about future monetary policy. What role does the Bank of England play in sterling valuation? The Bank of England sets UK monetary policy, including interest rates and asset purchase programs, which directly affect pound sterling’s attractiveness to international investors. How do payrolls data affect cryptocurrency markets? Strong payrolls data can strengthen the dollar, potentially creating headwinds for dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies. However, the relationship is complex and influenced by multiple factors including risk appetite and inflation expectations. Where can I track real-time forex market movements? Major financial platforms like Bloomberg and Reuters provide comprehensive forex coverage, while trading platforms offer real-time charts and analysis tools.

In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump said: “I think I already know my choice,” when asked about the next Fed chair. He added that he would “love to get the guy currently in there out right now, but people are holding me back,” a clear swipe at Powell without naming him. Trump also hinted at the shape of his shortlist, saying, “We have some surprising names and we have some standard names that everybody’s talking about. And we may go the standard way. It’s nice to every once in a while go politically correct.” That was enough to move markets. On Polymarket and Kalshi, contracts on “Who will Trump nominate as Fed Chair?” quickly converged around Hassett, with odds in the mid-40s to high-40s percent range. Jim Bianco summarized the shift by writing: “He wants Bessent but will take Hassett. The rest get to take selfies in the Oval Office.” In a follow-up, he noted that “Hassett (blue) is separating himself from the pack and is on the verge of being the first person to trade over 50%,” as prediction markets pushed his contract well clear of rivals. Kalshi’s own social media account underscored the move: “BREAKING: Trump thinks he ‘already knows’ who will be next Fed Chair. 47% chance it’s Kevin Hassett.” The pseudonymous trader Byzantine General zoomed out to the timeline, pointing out that “Powell’s term ends May next year,” and sketching out a Q2 scenario with “a FED chair that listens to Trump” and “tariff dividends for plebs,” before cautioning that “you never know with Trump of course, but man, there could be something cooking.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash What Hassett Could Mean For The Crypto Market For macro-oriented crypto traders, the key is the policy signal embedded in those probabilities. Hassett is widely perceived as more dovish than Powell and more aligned with Trump’s preference for easier financial conditions. That is why trader CRG (@MacroCRG), framed the moment as the arrival of a “New hand picked super dove as Fed chair coming soon.” Macro and crypto analyst Alex Krüger went further, arguing that the Fed-chair race is the real medium-term driver for risk assets once the current FOMC noise fades. “Here’s the next macro catalyst after the FOMC. A bullish catalyst the market is paying no heed to atm. It’s hard to peer into the horizon when stressed to the marrow about the present,” he wrote, adding that “the most bullish choices would be Hassett (likely), Rieder (possibly) and Zervos (unlikely).” Related Reading: Crypto Carnage Continues — Tom Lee Exposes What’s Really Going On The reason crypto traders care is straightforward: crypto assets trade as high-beta, liquidity-sensitive risk assets. A chair seen as more willing to cut rates faster, tolerate easier financial conditions or respond aggressively to equity and growth weakness is, in market logic, a structural tailwind for the long-run liquidity environment that underpins speculative flows into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the same time, Trump’s open pressure on Powell and his readiness to talk about replacing the Fed chair in overtly political terms reinforce another strand of the crypto thesis. The more investors worry about the politicization of US monetary policy and the erosion of central-bank independence, the more compelling the “Bitcoin as hedge against political and institutional risk” narrative becomes for a subset of allocators. For now, nothing has changed at the Fed. Powell remains in office, and all that has moved is a set of probability distributions on prediction markets. But as those distributions shift toward Kevin Hassett, crypto traders are already treating the prospective hand-off as a latent, potentially significant bullish tailwind building in the background. At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.11 trillion.

Among emerging DeFi players, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has established an impressive trajectory through consistent development and transparent presale execution. The project’s presale is now in Phase 6, priced at $0.035, with 90% of tokens already sold. Since inception, $18,800,000 has been raised, attracting 18,050 holders. With Phase 7 approaching, the price will rise nearly 20% to $0.04, while the confirmed launch price stands at $0.06. As interest accelerates, the final days of Phase 6 represent the last entry point for buyers seeking a cost-effective position before the next valuation step. Mutuum Finance’s Structured Growth Path Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates as a dual-market lending protocol integrating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C layer facilitates pooled liquidity for high-volume assets such as ETH and USDT, while P2P lending allows customized agreements for less liquid tokens. This structure balances efficiency with flexibility, appealing to both retail and institutional participants. The development roadmap reinforces this utility-driven model. The team confirmed that its V1 protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring a Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot. This marks a transition from concept to product, giving the project operational credibility. A completed CertiK audit with a 90/100 score and a $50,000 bug-bounty program further anchor investor trust. To maintain engagement, Mutuum Finance launched a 24-hour leaderboard rewarding daily top contributors with $500 in MUTM, provided a transaction is completed within the window. The leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC, ensuring ongoing activity. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway awards ten participants $10,000 each in MUTM. These initiatives continue to drive new signups and investor participation as Phase 6 nears sellout. Price Projection and DOGE Analogy: Logic Behind the Forecast Mutuum Finance’s structured pricing and clear tokenomics allow for a measurable projection through 2030. The presale price progression, from $0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.035 in Phase 6 and $0.06 at launch, demonstrates sustained growth driven by real milestones. Assuming continued adoption following the testnet launch in 2025 and subsequent exchange listings, a conservative near-term projection would place MUTM around $0.30 by 2026. This represents an 8.5x increase from the launch price. By 2028, after full mainnet implementation and expansion of its dual lending model to Layer-2 environments, the token could trade near $1.20 as DeFi usage broadens and token demand deepens. Extending the horizon to 2030, Mutuum Finance could achieve $2.10–$2.50 per token, marking an approximate 7,000%–8,000% gain from the current presale price, assuming continued investor participation and ecosystem growth. This projection draws contextual justification from historical precedents. Dogecoin (DOGE) offers a compelling case study. In early 2020, DOGE traded around $0.0025. Within one year, fueled by community momentum, broader crypto market expansion, and increasing utility, it surged to $0.75 in May 2021. That movement represented a 29,900% ROI over twelve months. While DOGE’s rise was primarily sentiment-driven, MUTM’s trajectory is based on utility and structural development, making its long-term growth more sustainable. If MUTM captures even a fraction of that magnitude, reaching $1–$2 by 2030 becomes attainable. The underlying logic here rests on DeFi’s continuing relevance. As lending and borrowing migrate to decentralized systems, protocols offering layered liquidity and security auditing will likely capture the next wave of adoption. Mutuum Finance fits this framework, and its transparent presale model indicates a disciplined approach that appeals to long-term investors rather than short-term traders. Investor Momentum Strengthens The current presale phase underscores rising demand. Phase 6’s 90% completion rate shows sustained inflows despite broader market caution. The fixed price of $0.035 is rapidly becoming history, and once Phase 7 begins at $0.04, early buyers will already have a 14% notional gain before launch. Those entering now are positioning ahead of both retail and institutional buyers expected post-listing. The projected 400% ROI at the $0.06 launch valuation further emphasizes that this closing window is critical for anyone evaluating what crypto to buy now for long-term yield. Long-Term View to 2030 Mutuum Finance’s trajectory reflects a structured expansion model uncommon among early-stage DeFi projects. Security through audits, liquidity through dual lending systems, and transparency through phased presale design all combine to create a foundation for longevity. The project’s testnet rollout in 2025 will likely trigger the first major valuation phase, similar to how functional milestones catalyzed DOGE’s speculative wave. As Phase 6 concludes, market signals suggest Mutuum Finance is transitioning from niche presale to mainstream awareness. Investors positioning now stand to benefit from both early pricing and the compounding effect of future protocol adoption. Considering the market’s appetite for real-yield DeFi products, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to emerge as one of the best cryptos to buy now with a realistic path toward exponential gains through 2030.

54604230,630460,1763546631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54604230.jpeg,US Treasury Leans On Stablecoins For $38T Debt; Where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Fits,https://bitcoinist.com/best-wallet-token-to-explode-as-us-treasury-presents-stablecoins-debt-plan/,"Quick Facts: The US Treasury now openly treats stablecoins and money-market funds as structural buyers of Treasury bills, supporting long-term demand for US debt. Scott Bessent expects the stablecoin market to grow from roughly $300B today to around $3T by 2030, a tenfold jump in tokenized dollars. Best Wallet Token powers a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with integrated DEX, staking, launchpad access, and an upcoming crypto card for real-world spending. The $BEST presale has raised over $17.1M, with staking rewards currently at 76% APY. The fundraiser ends in nine days, which should boost demand. The new US debt strategy is starting to sound a lot like a crypto thesis. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent just laid out how the department plans to keep funding its $38T federal debt without blowing up borrowing costs: money-market funds and stablecoins. In his Treasury Market Conference speech, Bessent highlighted that money-market funds already sit around $7.5T and have added nearly $1T in the past year. Stablecoins, meanwhile, are worth about $300B today but are expected to grow tenfold by 2030, helped by the GENIUS Act. Both groups already allocate heavily into Treasury bills, and Treasury now explicitly treats them as long-term demand pillars when planning issuance. That’s a big shift. Stablecoins are no longer just a side quest for crypto traders; they’re being positioned as part of the plumbing that keeps the US government funded. If stablecoins become a $3T+ market dominated by tokenized dollars and T-bill-backed assets, on-chain settlement volume and wallet usage should rise in lockstep. Liquidity flows, yields, and even macro policy will increasingly run through wallets, bridges, and DeFi rails. This is where wallet-native tokens come in. As more of that yield-hunting capital sits in non-custodial wallets, the projects that actually make stablecoins easy to hold, swap, stake, and spend are the ones that stand to capture value. Best Wallet is trying to plant its flag exactly there: a Fireblocks-secured, multi-chain non-custodial wallet with an integrated DEX, and a presale launchpad. Powering it is its native $BEST Token , whose presale has already raised over $17.1. With just a few days left before the fundraiser ends, expect demand for these tokens to ramp up. Best Wallet Builds For Stablecoin-Led Debt Demand If the Treasury is betting that stablecoins become a core buyer of US debt, wallets are the front-end that everyday users will actually touch. Best Wallet is essentially building for that stablecoin super-cycle. The app is a mobile-first, non-custodial wallet that uses Fireblocks MPC-CMP security to remove the need for seed phrases, while keeping self-custody intact. It supports major chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Base, and more, with portfolio tracking across multiple wallets, and integrated swaps, all inside a single interface. That feature mix matters in a world where stablecoins are treated as yield-bearing cash. Users will want to park $USDT/$USDC equivalents, bridge them across chains to wherever the best rates are, and still be able to cash out to real-world spending. Best Wallet leans into that flow: it aggregates liquidity across hundreds of DEXs and dozens of bridges for cross-chain swaps. It will also roll out its Best Card, allowing you to spend crypto anywhere cards are accepted, with cashback boosted when you hold and stake $BEST. The $BEST token is the glue that holds everything together. As a token holder, you’ll get reduced transaction fees in the ecosystem, staking rewards, and early access to new presales via the in-app Token Launchpad. On top of that come governance rights over future upgrades. To learn more about the project and $BEST, check out ‘What Is Best Wallet Token?’ Best Wallet Token Presale Prices Leave Room for Future Growth On the token side, $BEST is still in presale but already behaving like an infrastructure play rather than a pure meme. Currently, the Best Wallet Token presale has raised over $17.1M, with the current token price at $0.025965. You can also stake immediately for headline rewards of 76% APY, although that rate is expected to trend lower as more tokens are locked. There are only nine days left before the fundraiser wraps up, after which $BEST is set to list on exchanges and transition from presale narrative to execution test. Want to grab your share of $BEST tokens? Our Best Wallet Token buying guide has all the details. Price modeling built around wallet-growth and stablecoin-flow scenarios projects a wide but interesting range. Based on our Best Wallet Token price prediction , $BEST will trade between $0.24 and $0.62 by the end of 2026, provided the team fulfills its roadmap. Taking the top end of that band, $0.62 would be about a 23x move from the current presale price. That’s the kind of upside that attracts presale hunters, but it also assumes a favorable macro backdrop and that the team actually delivers. Context helps here. Wallet-native tokens have already shown there’s room for sizable valuations when a wallet owns a sticky user base and real fee flows. $BEST is trying to go a step further by combining the wallet with a launchpad and a spendable card, all underpinned by security tech that removes seed-phrase friction. If Bessent’s vision plays out and stablecoins become a $3T market plugged directly into Treasury bills, an app that helps users move between yield, presales, and everyday spending has a clear narrative tailwind. The Best Wallet Token presale ends soon. Buy $BEST tokens today. Disclaimer: This article is educational only, not investment advice; crypto and presale tokens are volatile, and you can lose capital.

US $38T Debt, Stablecoins And Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Could This Be The Next 1000x Crypto Play? November 19, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Scott Bessent’s plan to tackle the USA’s $38T debt leans heavily on on-chain rails . By courting demand from money-market funds and a potentially tenfold larger stablecoin market, the Treasury is basically admitting that dollar liquidity is going to live on-chain, not just in legacy broker accounts. That’s bullish for infrastructure, but it also raises a practical question for regular users: where do you actually hold and move these assets without handing custody to a centralized middleman? Best Wallet sits right in that lane. The non-custodial app already supports major chains and stablecoins, lets you buy, swap, and stake, and is building towards 60+ networks plus a crypto debit card. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , the native token, underpins that ecosystem with reduced fees, high-yield staking, governance, and priority access to new presales that could benefit from the same on-chain macro tailwinds, with the presale already past $17M raised and offering up to around 70% staking yields. More importantly, the presale will end in just 9 days, so this is the last chance to get in at ground level. Here’s how to buy $BEST right now. Altcoin Season, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) And The Next 1000x Crypto Narrative November 19, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Analyst Michael van de Poppe argues that the latest smackdown in majors looks more like a cycle reset than the start of a bear market, with falling Bitcoin dominance and rising ‘Others’ share lining up with previous altcoin season setups. As $BTC chops below recent highs and ETF attention drifts toward alt-focused products, rotation bets are back on the table for anyone hunting higher beta exposure this cycle. If that thesis plays out, Bitcoin infrastructure alts like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) sit in a sweet spot. $HYPER is a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, aiming to give Bitcoin near-instant, low-fee transactions and smart contracts while still settling back to L1. Its presale has already raised over $28M at roughly $0.013295 per token, with staking yields at 41% APY for early participants, signaling that whales and retail alike are leaning into the ‘Bitcoin but usable’ narrative. For altseason traders, it’s one of the few plays that keeps core exposure to Bitcoin while adding upside to infrastructure growth. Our $HYPER price prediction estimates explosive gains – read it.

As a CPA or tax professional, you know that your clients are required to pay taxes on their crypto transactions. But what kinds of crypto transactions are taxable? Here is a breakdown of taxable events within the crypto market in accordance with most jurisdictions: Capital gains taxes: They refer to the taxation of profits on crypto sale and swap, and the use of crypto to purchase goods or services. Income taxes: They apply to crypto earned from activities such as mining, staking, fork events, and airdrops. It also encompasses salaries and wages paid using crypto. The truth is that compiling these taxable events together is time-consuming and prone to human error. Hence, crypto tax software makes it easy for one to compile bulk crypto transactions and determine the applicable taxes. Not just that, but many of these tools will help you with identifying the best strategies to decrease crypto taxes owed by your clients. Crypto tax software is an automated platform designed to help users compile and calculate the applicable taxes on their crypto transactions. It achieves this by tracking users’ transactions across various blockchains, crypto projects, exchanges, and Web3 wallets. The tax tool also helps with the submission of tax reports. This way, users can appropriately cover their crypto tax obligations. Why Do CPAs and Tax Professionals Need Crypto Tax Software? CPAs and tax professionals are often hired to assist individuals and businesses in compiling and filing accurate tax returns. Cryptocurrencies could be among the taxable events. Even if you’re well aware of how crypto taxes work, handling all that work manually is just tedious, time-consuming, not to mention prone to human mistakes. It is important to use software that makes it easy to navigate the complexities of the crypto industry while compiling the applicable taxe for your clients. This way, you can provide accurate tax filing after scanning through every transaction for a given tax year. It also enables you to provide expert consultation services to clients. Using crypto tax software helps CPA and tax professionals to create foolproof tax reports, avoiding human errors in the process. It also saves the time and resources that would have otherwise been spent on other activities. As a result, you can serve more clients simultaneously. As crypto is still an evolving ecosystem, the applicable tax laws implemented in various countries may change over time. Instead of staying up-to-date with every updated tax regulation, tax professionals can rely on crypto tax tools to ensure regulatory compliance with the local laws of their clients. CPAs and tax experts can also use crypto tax software tools for their personal use. If they decide to venture into the crypto world, these professionals can monitor their transactions across various blockchains, projects, wallets, and exchanges. How Do Crypto Tax Tools Work for CPAs and Tax Experts Regardless of the crypto tax software tool that a CPA or tax accountant chooses, they often follow a similar path to manage their clients’ crypto data effectively. Here’s how it works: Step 1: Create an Account on the Platform The first thing to do as a tax accountant is to create an account on a crypto tax software platform. Ensure you register as a CPA and not a regular user. This way, you would have all the needed tools to oversee your clients’ dashboards. Step 2: Invite Your Clients The next thing is to invite your clients to create an account on the same platform using a link you provide them with. Once they create their accounts, the platform usually provides the client with a step-by-step process to import their crypto transactions across wallets, exchanges, blockchains, and projects. Alternatively, clients can upload their data through CSV or API. Step 3: Review Clients’ Transactions As your clients upload their crypto transactions directly or through CSV and API, you, as the CPA or tax expert, gain access to their transactions. You can then flag missing price history and other incomplete data for reconciliation. Some platforms allow you to work with AI-powered tools to ease the review process. During this stage, you can deduce whether your client is eligible to benefit from tax loss harvesting and other deductions to save their money. Step 4: Download the Tax Report(s) The final step is to download the completed tax form in one click. These include IRS Form 8949, Schedule D, Schedule 1, Capital Gains CSV, and Transaction History CSV. The crypto tax software provides the creation of tax reports that are compatible with the local tax laws, freeing the CPA from much hassle. It is worth noting that before downloading the tax report, most crypto tax software mandates that your clients purchase a plan that matches their number of transactions.

54604348,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90049,1763546909,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Is About to Explode. Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-about-to-explode-heres-what-is-happening/,"A recent video posted by crypto analyst Ripple Bull Winkle argues that new on-chain activity tied to the Flare Network fundamentally alters the supply dynamics for XRP and therefore its near-term price trajectory. The analyst presents a concrete statistic and a chain of reasoning. If a substantial portion of bridged XRP is actively deployed in decentralized finance, then exchange-available supply falls and price sensitivity to demand increases. The claim is presented as a turning point for how market participants should view XRP’s utility and liquidity profile. The core claim Ripple Bull Winkle attributes the key data point to statements made by Hugo Filion, who is reported to have observed that approximately 70% of XRP bridged into Flare is being used within DeFi protocols. The analyst emphasizes that this is not passive custody or static bridging; rather, it is active liquidity deployment—tokens are being staked, pooled, or otherwise placed into contracts that provide measurable on-chain utility. The video frames this figure as a refutation of long-standing critiques that XRP holders do not engage with DeFi or that XRP lacks meaningful on-chain activity. Mechanism: why active DeFi usage matters for price The analyst links active DeFi usage to a mechanics-based view of price formation. When tokens are locked in smart contracts or liquidity pools, they are effectively removed from the pool of assets available for immediate sale on exchanges. That reduction in readily liquid supply means that, when demand arrives, the same order flow will move price more sharply than it would if exchange reserves were higher. The argument relies on two connected assertions: that a majority of bridged XRPs are committed to DeFi, and that those commitments translate into a measurable and sustained decline in exchange inventories. Market context and implications If the reported on-chain allocation is accurate and persistent, it changes the empirical basis for supply-side modeling of XRP. Market participants who monitor exchange reserves, on-chain flows, and liquidity provisioning would need to account for a larger portion of supply being effectively immobile. The analyst frames this as a potential trigger for accelerated price movements during periods of renewed buying pressure. He also positions the XRP community as active participants in DeFi adoption rather than passive holders, suggesting a shift in narrative that has implications for institutional and retail sentiment. Ripple Bull Winkle presents a simple, data-driven thesis: meaningful DeFi utilization of bridged XRP reduces exchange-available supply and increases the potential for pronounced price moves when demand reappears. The argument centers on a single, large percentage claim attributed to Hugo Filion and proceeds from there to draw market implications. Verifying the persistence and scale of the reported flows will determine whether this claim represents a transient observation or the beginning of a structural change in XRP liquidity dynamics.

""Only If This Happens, Will the US Start Buying Bitcoin!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-celebrity-reveals-when-trump-will-start-buying-bitcoin-btc-for-reserves-only-if-this-happens-will-the-us-start-buying-bitcoin/,"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last March establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US. While the US is actively seeking ways to acquire Bitcoin (BTC), cryptocurrency entrepreneur Mike Alfred said that the US will not stockpile BTC unless sufficiently pressured by other countries. At this point, Mike Alfred argued that the US government will start purchasing Bitcoin for its strategic reserve when there is “sufficient pressure from outside, that is, from other countries.” Related News: Trump and WLFI Debate Escalates! US Democrats Make New Move to Anger Trump! Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast, Alfred stated that the US will only start building BTC reserves when sufficient external pressure is applied. Stating that other countries need to start purchasing BTC for the Bitcoin reserve, Alfred said that the US will have no choice but to react to this, but that it is difficult to predict the exact timing of such purchases. “Despite announcing a strategic Bitcoin reserve plan earlier this year, there has been no active buying yet. Once the U.S. government realizes that others have acted before it, this will likely trigger additional actions in the future. The catalyst for the US will be the point where it sees other countries starting to accumulate before them.” Alfred also stated that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2033, by which time most countries will hold Bitcoin directly or indirectly. Things to Know About Bitcoin Reserve! Donald Trump announced his plan to create a 'Strategic Bitcoin Reserve' with the executive order he signed last March. White House cryptocurrency advisor David Sacks, who later revealed details about the Bitcoin reserve, stated that the reserve would be funded by Bitcoins seized by the government through criminal or civil asset forfeiture, and therefore would not impose any additional cost on taxpayers. But Trump also ordered Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to investigate how the country could finance additional Bitcoin purchases without costing taxpayers a penny.

What makes this transaction particularly noteworthy isn’t just the sheer size, but also the astonishingly low fee: a mere 0.0004 XRP, practically negligible by any standard. The large amount of XRP was transferred to a Ripple-linked wallet created 12 years ago, raising eyebrows and speculation across the crypto community. Such a move prompts questions about Ripple’s long-term strategy, potential market positioning, and the implications for XRP holders. Therefore, this transaction underscores XRP’s real-world utility, showcasing Ripple’s blockchain speed and efficiency, multi-hundred-million-dollar transfers executed almost instantly with minimal fees, far outperforming traditional banking. For investors, it highlights XRP as more than a speculative asset: a powerful tool for large-scale, low-cost transactions. What’s interesting? Well, the 12-year-old receiving wallet adds intrigue. Predating Ripple’s mainstream adoption, such transfers often hint at internal moves, liquidity management, treasury operations, or long-term strategy. While Ripple hasn’t disclosed the purpose, analysts are watching closely for potential market signals. Therefore, the $442M XRP transfer highlights the market’s volatility and the influence of major wallets. Such moves can sway sentiment, spark speculation, and hint at strategic accumulation or Ripple’s operational plans, demonstrating how project-linked wallets can shape market narratives. U.S. Banks Get Regulatory Green Light to Hold Crypto for Network Fees In a landmark move for the crypto and banking sectors, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has officially clarified that national banks can hold crypto-assets on their balance sheets to cover blockchain network fees. According to market analyst Diana, this development represents a major step forward in bridging traditional finance and digital assets. The OCC’s new interpretive letter officially lets banks hold crypto to cover network fees, ending regulatory uncertainty and clearing the way for seamless integration of digital assets into daily operations. Therefore, this decision marks a pivotal shift, signaling broader acceptance of blockchain as a core banking infrastructure. Banks can now interact directly with public blockchains, executing payments and settlements with crypto, streamlining processes, and cutting out intermediaries. As banks explore faster, cheaper digital payment rails, regulatory clarity is key. XRP’s blockchain, built for rapid, low-fee cross-border settlements, stands to gain, with the OCC’s guidance removing a major hurdle for institutional adoption. What does this mean? Well, the OCC’s guidance marks a pivotal shift in digital finance, allowing banks to hold crypto for network fees and integrate blockchain into operations. For networks like XRP, this accelerates mainstream adoption with low-cost, high-speed settlement solutions. Conclusion Ripple’s $442M XRP transfer to a 12-year-old wallet showcases the network’s speed, strategic maneuvering, and market influence. Large, low-fee transactions like this can sway sentiment and offer insight into Ripple’s long-term plans, reinforcing XRP’s role as both a tradable asset and a key tool in the company’s financial ecosystem. On the other hand, The OCC’s guidance is a game-changer for U.S. banking and crypto adoption. By allowing banks to hold crypto for network fees, it removes a major barrier, enabling faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions. This clarity empowers banks to integrate blockchain directly into operations and highlights networks like XRP as practical solutions for real-world settlements, accelerating innovation and reshaping the future of payments.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-19 10:09:58

Firas Isa, 36, founder and CEO of Virtual Assets LLC, which operated publicly as Crypto Dispensers, was indicted on one count of money-laundering conspiracy, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Isa and the company have pleaded not guilty. A status hearing is scheduled for January 30, 2026, before U.S. District Judge Elaine E. Bucklo in Chicago. Crypto ATM Network Used to Wash Millions From Fraud and Drug Trafficking According to the indictment , unsealed in the Northern District of Illinois, Isa and a co-conspirator operated Virtual Assets as a cash-to-crypto exchange. The exchange offered a network of ATMs and bank accounts that allowed users to deposit cash, checks, or wired funds for conversion into digital assets. Prosecutors allege that between 2018 and 2025, the operation processed millions of dollars sent by criminals and, at times, by fraud victims unknowingly depositing illicit funds. Source: DOJ The money was allegedly converted into cryptocurrency and transferred to external wallets to obscure its source. Investigators say Isa knew the proceeds were tied to wire-fraud schemes and narcotics trafficking. The indictment describes transactions where Isa and a co-conspirator allegedly collected cash from fraud operations, converted it into crypto, and routed the assets through multiple wallets to conceal ownership and control. The case, brought by a special April 2025 grand jury, includes a forfeiture notice seeking any property linked to the alleged crimes, including a personal money judgment. If specific assets cannot be recovered, prosecutors plan to pursue substitute property as permitted under federal law. Officials stressed that an indictment is only an allegation and that the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty. Lawmakers Push New Rules for Crypto ATMs After Spike in Scam Complaints The charges arrive as federal and state authorities intensify crackdowns on crypto ATM-related fraud nationwide, which has surged, particularly targeting older victims. In September, the District of Columbia’s Attorney General filed a separate lawsuit against Athena Bitcoin , one of the largest crypto ATM operators in the United States. The suit alleges that 93% of the company’s deposits in Washington, D.C., during a five-month period were tied to scams, many involving elderly residents pressured into transferring savings through Bitcoin kiosks. Prosecutors in that case say the company charged undisclosed fees as high as 26% while failing to implement meaningful safeguards. Federal data shows sharp increases in losses connected to cryptocurrency ATMs. The FBI reported nearly 11,000 related complaints in 2024 , totaling more than $246 million. Source: Federal Trade Commission The Federal Trade Commission found that losses rose from $12 million in 2020 to $114 million in 2023, with victims aged 60 and above accounting for more than two-thirds of reported cases. Median losses in that age group reached $10,000 per incident. Lawmakers have begun responding with new proposals. In February, Senator Dick Durbin introduced the “Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act,” which would impose transaction caps, require direct communication with users conducting higher-value transfers, and mandate refunds for certain fraud victims. Durbin described the measure as an attempt to curb scams that increasingly involve intimidation tactics targeting seniors. Multiple states are pursuing similar regulatory approaches. Wisconsin legislators recently introduced bills to bring the state’s more than 580 crypto kiosks under money transmitter licensing requirements. The proposal also includes setting daily transaction limits, imposing stricter identity verification procedures, and requiring fraud warnings on machines. Spokane, Washington, voted to ban crypto ATMs entirely following federal investigations that linked kiosks in the region to large-scale fraud schemes. International regulators have moved in the same direction. New Zealand imposed a complete ban on cryptocurrency ATMs as part of updated anti-money laundering reforms, while Australia’s financial intelligence agency introduced stricter rules and declined to renew a registration for a local operator .

54608093,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=864062,1763552123,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54608093.jpeg,Pump.fun’s new AI 'Mayhem Mode' fails to significantly increase activity in first week,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pump-fun-mayhem-mode-slow-first-week/,"Pump.fun launched Mayhem Mode to increase early trading volumes by tapping into AI agents to launch more coins and boost revenue, but after a week of operation, the feature has had little to show for the excitement it had garnered. Mayhem Mode is an opt-in setting that allows an autonomous AI agent to buy and sell a newly launched coin during its first 24 hours. The agent receives an extra one billion tokens for trading, with any unused tokens burned after the period ends. Before Mayhem Mode’s introduction, Pump.fun averaged around 17,300 token launches per day. Since the feature went live, daily launches have inched up to 17,800, a negligible increase given the expectations set by the launch. Cryptopolitan had previously reported a decline in daily token creation, down to 12,000–15,000, while active addresses dropped to roughly 31,000 from over 200,000 a year ago. Mayhem Mode weekly token launch numbers underwhelm According to Pump.fun’s development team, the system is meant to facilitate early price discovery, helping new coins attract attention from investors faster and to boost trading revenues on the platform. “Mayhem Mode aims to increase the number of good projects in the pump.fun ecosystem by making coin projects more appealing to engage in at early stages where they typically might fail,” the platform wrote in its documentation released last week. Pump.fun had pitched it as a solution to lift token visibility to help developers launch and trade more coins, but the small uptick in launches could mean that early adoption of Mayhem has not significantly changed platform dynamics, though a longer observation period may offer different insights. Compounding the underwhelming launch numbers, Pump.fun’s daily revenue has actually declined since Mayhem Mode debuted. Lower revenue has a knock-on effect, reducing PUMP token buybacks that mechanically support its price. Without complementary curation or ranking mechanisms, Mayhem Mode’s added AI-driven activity could be more “market noise,” as it is visibly struggling to live out its purpose of meaningful token visibility. The PUMP token currently trades at around $0.0031, down 74% from its all-time high of $0.012 reached in July. Pump.fun has invested over $175 million in buybacks since the peak, yet the token’s trading fees and token launch revenue have dropped between 40–50%, with “technical issues” preventing buybacks on one day. Daily tokens created chart. Source: Dune Analytics Per data from Dune Analytics, token “graduation” rates, the share of launched coins that gain traction, are modest and tanking by the month. The Solana launchpad has seen 16,858 tokens launched in the last day, a 4.8% downtick from Monday’s recorded tally. In October, out of 451,939 tokens launched, only 2,767 graduated, a 0.61% rate. September saw 679,341 tokens launched with a 0.58% graduation rate, and August recorded 604,162 launches with 0.75% graduation. Pump.fun Mayhem mode, more harm than good? While Pump.fun insists Mayhem Mode is fully opt-in and agents pay no protocol fees, some traders are worried it resembles wash trading. A single AI agent drawing massive numbers in early trading activity could make token markets appear busier than they are, or rather cause what they deem “artificial inflation.” Naysayers have propounded that pairing the feature with curation could improve outcomes and help more coins “break out.” Yet, without these safeguards, Mayhem Mode may become another way for bad actors to redirect investors into rug-pulls while dragging liquidity levels down. “The new mayhem mode (aka rapebot) on pumpfun has actually broken the problem pump set out to fix originally and is now creating situations on coins where it’s removing the LP, so not even the first wallet can sell into zero volume.

Despite scaling mining capacity, HIVE posted a net loss in the quarter and continues to face sector-wide profitability challenges. HIVE trades at a discount to peers based on valuation metrics, but dilution and missed capital-raising opportunities temper enthusiasm for the stock. Given weak mining profitability and smaller relative AI/HPC exposure, I downgrade HIVE to 'hold' and see it as a speculative play on potential Bitcoin rallies. In the 2 months since I last covered HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) for Seeking Alpha, it has been a wild ride for shareholders, to say the least. Following a massive 100% rally in the stock from the publishing of that article to mid-October, HIVE has almost entirely retraced that rally and is now up roughly 5% since early September: Data by YCharts While HIVE is still generally trailing other companies in the sector, judging by the performance in the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF ( WGMI ), it is well ahead of Bitcoin over these last 2 months. With the company having just released its latest earnings report, it's time to reassess if there is still a reason to be bullish on HIVE. Q2 FY26 Earnings For the quarter ended September, HIVE reported $87.3 million in top-line revenue. This was an explosive quarter with year-over-year growth of 285% and sequential growth of 91.3%: Quarter Ended 9/30/24 6/30/25 9/30/25 YoY QoQ Revenue From Mining $20,765 $40,797 $82,073 295.2% 101.2% Revenue From HPC $1,883 $4,814 $5,180 175.1% 7.6% Total Revenue $22,648 $45,611 $87,253 285.3% 91.3% Source: HIVE Digital, Revenue in 000s While the percentage growth for HPC revenue was impressive at 175%, it was dwarfed by the growth in revenue from mining in both aggregate and percentage terms. At $5.2 million in revenue from high-performance compute, HIVE's HPC segment made up a little under 6% of the company's total revenue in the quarter. Calendar Year Quarterly Revenue Breakout (HIVE, Analyst's Chart) While 6% is still a larger percentage of HPC revenue than most of the other Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners-turned-HPC providers in the public markets, it's actually the lowest level of HPC revenue share for HIVE Digital in the last 6 quarters. You can see in the chart above, HIVE Digital had previously grown HPC revenue as a share of total revenue for 5 consecutive quarters. Even for a company that has indeed grown revenue from HPC, HIVE is still a Bitcoin mining company if the top line is any indication. Thus, it's likely problematic that during a quarter when Bitcoin's price was never lower than it is as of article submission (November 18th, 2025), HIVE Digital still couldn't generate a positive net income: Data by YCharts During the quarter ended September, HIVE reported a $15.8 million net loss after taxes. But to get a better sense of the actual health of the underlying business in the quarter, we can strip out things like gains/losses on investments, digital asset holdings, and derivatives: Revenue $87,253 Operating and maintenance costs -$44,065 High-performance computing service fees -$784 Depreciation -$38,292 Selling, general and administrative expenses -$7,800 Foreign exchange gain $601 Stock-based compensation -$5,472 Adjusted income/loss -$8,559 Source: HIVE Digital, Revenue in 000s Even if we took out the $5.5 million in stock-based compensation, HIVE Digital still lost over $3 million in the quarter. Some of this is likely due to HIVE accelerating its ASIC depreciation as part of its Paraguay expansion. But I still don't think it gets any easier from here, given what is happening to the price of Bitcoin and the impact those price declines are having on mining Hashprice: Bitcoin Hashprice 1yr Trend (HashrateIndex) As of article submission, mining profitability just hit a new 52-week low of $37.5 per PH/s. More than a 52-week low, though, this is both a halving epoch low and an all-time low in mining profitability. I think this is critically important for shareholders to understand because it highlights why so many miners are pivoting to HPC. I recognize that I've made these points before. But we now have public miners who are leaving the business entirely. This should theoretically limit the growth of global exahash. Data by YCharts Yet so far, it's the smaller companies that are leaving mining entirely. The bigger players are often accelerating their hash growth. For instance, HIVE is guiding for 25 EH/s by the end of November. For a company that had just 5 EH/s this time last year, scaling this production capacity has been incredible to watch. The problem is, it hasn't been a good enough reason to own HIVE stock. Balance Sheet and Dilution Where I'll give HIVE some credit is here; they've seemingly put what was a 2,800 BTC stack at the beginning of the year to good use in 2025. At the end of September, HIVE reported holding just 210 BTC and $22.6 million in cash/equivalents. To the degree that it has been able to do so, HIVE has utilized its Bitcoin holdings to fund its capex growth: Data by YCharts At the end of September, HIVE had $693 million in total assets against just $68.4 million in total liabilities. With shareholder equity of just under $625 million and 228 million shares outstanding, HIVE had a book value of $2.74 per share at the end of the quarter. It should be noted that HIVE's losses have generally been funded by shareholder dilution: Data by YCharts Over the last 5 years, HIVE shares outstanding grew by 243%. This is substantially lower than many of HIVE's sector peers, and it's important to point that out. But still, dilution should be an expectation when holding this stock for longer than a quarter or two. From where I sit, the dilution is forgivable when it is done strategically. Which is why I find it interesting that the company wasn't tapping the ATM aggressively when the stock traded above $5 for several weeks between early October and early November. Per the company's recent quarterly filing , HIVE issued an additional 3.6 million shares subsequent to the end of September, but just 523k of those shares came from the ATM. If HIVE needed to tap the ATM again before the end of the calendar year 2025, it feels like the company missed an opportunity to raise capital at a heightened share price last month, with the stock now trading well below $4 per share. Valuation Through my work on Seeking Alpha in recent years, I've made it no mystery that I don't generally like Bitcoin miners, fundamentally speaking. But buying these stocks for swing trades is something that does appeal to me in certain scenarios. I like buying the stocks when I think they're trading at a discount to peers if I feel the discount is unwarranted. Mining Stock Valuations (Seeking Alpha) At a price-to-book ratio of 1.3, a price-to-sales ratio of 3.2, and a Seeking Alpha valuation grade of ""A-,"" I think you could argue HIVE is cheap relative to peers. Especially considering I'd put HIVE closer to TeraWulf ( WULF ) or IREN Limited ( IREN ) as true peers given its dwindling BTC stack and HPC footprint. HIVE has prioritized scaling over HODLing like TeraWulf and IREN have, yet it trades at multiples more similar to CleanSpark ( CLSK ) or Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). The question is whether or not HIVE is undervalued or if WULF and IREN are overvalued—I'm currently leaning towards the latter. Closing Takeaways HIVE is not a ticker that I think has properly benefited from AI hype like some of its peers. Which could work to HIVE's advantage if the AI mania in markets starts to unwind, as it shouldn't fall nearly as far as IREN or WULF based on valuations. It could also work to HIVE's advantage if Wall Street's AI mania continues since the stock could rally higher as the company monetizes its GPUs for HPC. Execution is certainly important in these names. And I think the apparent lack of ATM usage in October was a missed opportunity to raise capital. Mining profitability broadly remains putrid, so even if you decide to take a flier on the company, I wouldn't personally fall in love with HIVE as long as more than 90% of revenue comes from mining. Having said all this, there are worse ways to play a potential dead cat rally in Bitcoin than HIVE. But since I think we've seen the highs in Bitcoin's price for this halving cycle, I'm going to downgrade the stock to a 'hold' at this time.",BTC-USD|HIVE|HIVE:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-19 11:37:34

The cost of short-term insurance against these swings has jumped to heights not seen in months. Options contracts covering one week now show traders expect more turbulence ahead. The euro-pound pairing saw the biggest jump, with one-week volatility measures hitting a six-month peak. Protection costs for pound-Swiss franc trades climbed near a four-month high, while pound-dollar hedging reached levels last recorded in early September. The gap between expected volatility and actual price movements in euro-pound now stands at its widest point since April. This suggests traders are ready to pay extra for near-term coverage. Bearish bets mount against sterling Trading patterns over the past month reveal a gloomy outlook for the pound. Records from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation show more bets against the currency than for it, in trades involving both the euro and the dollar. The euro trades picked up speed in recent days. Many traders view this pairing as a simpler way to bet on UK-specific troubles, since dollar trades get tangled up with American economic news and reports. Wednesday brought data showing UK inflation dropped in October, marking the first decline in seven months. Despite this, money markets increased their expectations for Bank of England rate cuts. For currency traders, this signals that budget worries now matter more than central bank policy. British markets fell into fresh chaos on Friday as budget rumors sparked concern about the nation’s financial health. Mixed signals about tax policy caused wild swings in government bonds and the pound. Questions mounted about whether the government can tackle the country’s rising debt while keeping its campaign promises to voters and maintaining support from its own lawmakers. The 10-year yield rose 14 basis points to 4.58%, while the 30-year yield jumped 16 basis points. The pound dropped 0.5% to $1.3131, though it recovered slightly from an earlier 0.6% fall. Conflicting headlines fuel uncertainty Last Friday’s chaos started with conflicting news stories. Government borrowing costs shot up the most since July, and the pound tumbled while the FTSE 100 stock index headed for its worst session since April. Overnight reports said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves planned to drop income tax increases from the budget. Markets steadied somewhat after Bloomberg News reported that better UK economic forecasts drove the decision. But yields climbed again when word spread that Reeves might extend the freeze on income-tax thresholds rather than lowering them. This approach would bring less money into government accounts, raising fears about financial stability. “My fear is that the budget may be based on overly optimistic growth estimates,” said Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies. “We still need to wait and see that measures the chancellor comes up with.” Not everyone worries about the selloff. Ales Koutny, head of international rates at Vanguard Asset Management Ltd., called the move a “strong overreaction” and expects the budget will calm markets. Fidelity fund manager Mike Riddell plans to keep his long position in gilts. The bond market swings echoed a July reversal on welfare reform that sparked talk about a possible Reeves departure, making investors uneasy about Britain’s finances . The recent turmoil stands in sharp contrast to earlier calm. Gilts posted their best month in almost two years during October, helped by expectations of more Bank of England rate cuts.

54607701,https://finbold.com/?p=257739,1763552547,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,We asked AI if Bitcoin price has peaked; Here’s what it said,https://finbold.com/we-asked-ai-if-bitcoin-price-has-peaked-heres-what-it-said/,"With Bitcoin ( BTC ) currently witnessing increased bearish sentiments, an AI model has suggested that the asset has likely peaked and investors should expect a possible further downturn in the coming days. Notably, after Bitcoin briefly dropped below the $90,000 spot, the asset has since made a minor recovery but remains deeply in bearish territory. By press time, Bitcoin was valued at $91,527, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the leading cryptocurrency has crashed almost 13%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding whether the asset has peaked, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which noted that the asset may indeed have formed a medium-term peak. Has Bitcoin peaked? According to insights, Bitcoin’s recent breakdown below major support levels such as $100,000, combined with increased selling from long-term holders and tighter macroeconomic conditions, suggests the market has entered a corrective phase. The model argued that the recent high at $126,000 likely marked a top, with several probable price zones now defining the path ahead. ChatGPT’s primary scenario projects Bitcoin correcting to $72,000 and $85,000, a range it assigns a 65% probability. The AI noted this zone sits just below the $90,000 liquidity pocket and matches past mid-cycle pullbacks where buyers typically return, effectively a “normal correction zone” following a strong local peak. ChatGPT’s secondary scenario forecasts a deeper correction into the $58,000–$68,000 range, with a 25% probability. This becomes more likely if macro conditions tighten, long-term holders increase selling, ETF outflows grow, or Bitcoin fails to reclaim $90,000 for several weeks. The range aligns with the 2025 macro base and reflects a typical 30%–40% retracement from the $126,000 peak. The AI model also highlighted a low-probability, high-risk scenario of a capitulation drop to $45,000–$52,000, with a 10% chance. This would require a major liquidity shock, rapid leverage unwind, or intense miner and ETF pressure, resembling the deepest corrections of previous Bitcoin cycles. Probability of Bitcoin crashing. Source: ChatGPT Final verdict In its final assessment, ChatGPT concluded that Bitcoin has likely peaked for the year, at least over the coming months. Although the long-term uptrend remains, short-term risks lean strongly bearish, making a retest of recent highs unlikely unless macro conditions turn sharply more favorable.

Jim Cramer believes something weird is going on behind the scenes,https://finbold.com/bitcoin-over-90k-jim-cramer-believes-something-weird-is-going-on-behind-the-scenes/,"Bitcoin is still trading above $90,000, hovering around the $91,000 mark on 19 November, but the mood around it is anything but euphoric. Over the past week, the price has dropped by roughly 12% and is down close to 30% from its October peak above $125,000. What looks like strength at first glance is starting to feel more like a fragile balance. That is exactly the tension Jim Cramer tapped into in his latest post on X. On 19 November, he wrote from his official account: “Almost feels like a cabal is trying to keep Bitcoin above $90,000. I like Bitcoin but I do not like any of the derivatives created to play it or game it or mine it.” The line is classic Cramer: part suspicion, part warning, and partly a backhanded compliment to Bitcoin itself. He is not attacking the asset outright. Instead, he is questioning the machinery around it. Almost feels like a cabal is trying to keep Bitcoin above $90,000. I like Bitcoin but i do not like any of the derivatives created to play it or game it or mine it. — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) November 19, 2025 Cramer weighs in amid Bitcoin uncertainty Cramer’s comment lands at a moment when the backdrop has clearly turned bearish. Bitcoin briefly dropped below 90,000 dollars for the first time in months, wiping out its gains for 2025 before bouncing back above that psychological level. At the same time, crypto ETFs tied to Bitcoin have seen billions in outflows in November, with some of the largest spot products logging record redemption days. That combination of price weakness and institutional money heading for the exit has pulled overall crypto market capitalization down by more than a trillion dollars compared with early autumn. So when Cramer talks about a “cabal” trying to keep Bitcoin above $90,000, he is effectively pointing to the disconnect between the headline price and the underlying tone of the market. Bitcoin is still expensive on an absolute basis, yet sentiment is slipping, liquidity is thinner, and the bulk of recent flows have been out, not in. Cramer’s second line in the post is just as important as the first. He says he likes Bitcoin, but not “any of the derivatives created to play it or game it or mine it.” In other words, he is drawing a distinction between owning BTC outright and speculating around it through futures, leveraged products, complex ETFs, or mining-linked vehicles. That is where a lot of the current stress is showing up. Futures flows have tilted in favour of bears, and leveraged positioning has been unwinding as price has drifted lower. At the same time, Bitcoin ETFs that were once celebrated as the gateway for institutional capital are now seeing sustained daily outflows, a sign that the “strong hands” narrative is not holding up as neatly as it did on the way up.

The trend has turned bearish, and traders are now focused on the next critical area: the $78,000 support level. If that zone holds, BTC could attempt a strong bounce during the final months of 2025. If not, the year may close with elevated volatility and deeper downside pressure. This article outlines Bitcoin’s outlook for the remaining two months of 2025, the factors behind the current market behavior, and several thought-provoking questions investors should consider. What’s Happening With Bitcoin Right Now? BTC’s recent pullback has surprised many traders, especially after strong performance earlier in the year. Some investors ask: Is this a normal correction or the start of a deeper trend shift? Here are the main drivers behind current sentiment: Risk-off shift across global markets ETF outflows reducing buy-side liquidity Whale repositioning, especially after large profit-taking moves Technical weakness after failing to hold above the $100K psychological zone Bitcoin has seen similar sharp pullbacks in previous cycles before recovering. The question now: Will BTC repeat that pattern? Key Support and Resistance Zones Investors are closely monitoring the following areas: $78,000 support – The most important level. If broken, momentum may turn sharply bearish. $85,000 region – Short-term stabilization point. $100,000 resistance – A return above this level would shift sentiment to bullish quickly. If BTC loses $78K, the next deeper zone sits between $70K–$72K, a region where long-term buyers historically step in. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Table for 2025 Below is a practical prediction table you can reuse each year by changing only the numbers: Month (2025) Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price November $82,000 $90,000 $97,000 December $80,000 $92,500 $105,000 Why these ranges? November may reflect continued caution as markets test key support zones. December often brings stronger liquidity, and if BTC holds above $78K, a recovery toward $100K becomes realistic. Factors That Could Influence BTC Price in 2025 Here are the elements likely to shape Bitcoin’s direction: Institutional flows: ETF demand can shift quickly. Macro environment: Interest-rate expectations still drive crypto movements. Market psychology: Will traders buy the dip or wait for lower levels? Network fundamentals: Hash rate strength continues to support long-term confidence. A final thought: Does the market still believe in BTC reaching six-figure territory? Many long-term holders do — but short-term turbulence may continue. Conclusion Bitcoin’s outlook for the last two months of 2025 combines cautious sentiment with real recovery potential. A bounce from $78,000 could stabilize the market and open the door for a push back toward $100,000 by year-end. However, a breakdown below this zone may extend the bearish trend. Traders should stay alert, watch liquidity flows closely, and be ready for sharp volatility — something BTC never fails to deliver during cycle transitions.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-19 11:45:16

Meanwhile, PEPE ($PEPE) is splitting opinions with conflicting chart signals, keeping traders on edge as social chatter heats up.

Apeing ($APEING) is setting the stage for the upcoming top crypto presale , and early community members are buzzing about the whitelist. Timing is critical, and hesitation could mean missing out on gains that early adopters are about to capture. The frenzy is real, and the race to join is on.

Whitelist members secure priority notifications, clear step-by-step guidance and front-row placement before broader attention floods in. Instead of chasing green candles later, they position at the cheapest entry while others are still thinking about whether to act. Apeing is not only offering allocation; it is offering timing. The tiered structure means every round gets more expensive, and the earliest slots disappear first. Joining the whitelist gives community members the cleanest shot at maximum upside while the window is still open and the crowd has not fully arrived. How Apeing Targets Real Problems in Crypto Apeing is built to address problems that keep burning traders in crypto: unaudited launches, confusing rollouts and poor communication at critical moments. By committing to third-party audits before the sale, publishing verified social channels and providing structured guidance for whitelist users, Apeing aims to remove guesswork during the riskiest stage of any project. The project also leans into culture without sacrificing structure. Many culture-driven tokens focus on memes and hype, then leave buyers to navigate fake links, unclear timelines and sudden changes. Apeing takes the opposite route by pairing its community vibe with clear timing, official updates and a simple entry path. That combination gives early participants practical tools to act with more confidence instead of fighting through chaos when the market heats up. How to Join the Apeing Whitelist Go to the official Apeing website, submit your email in the whitelist section, and confirm via email. Updates include verified presale timing and official instructions. Following the verified channels ensures protection from scams and early access to the top crypto presale. PEPE Slips to Around $0.054786 After 53.7% Three-Month Drop PEPE is trading near $0.054786 after a sharp 53.7% decline over the last three months, keeping traders on alert as the token hovers around its lower support range. The price action shows steady downside pressure, but the tight consolidation zone has captured attention among short-term market watchers who are looking for clues on whether a bounce or another leg down comes next. Trading behavior around this level suggests cautious sentiment. Analysts note that PEPE’s compressed range often precedes sharper moves, making the current setup interesting for those monitoring volatility spikes through Q4 2025. SHIB Trades Near $0.058728 as Three-Month Losses Reach 28.8% SHIB is priced at $0.058728 after falling 28.8% over the last three months, reflecting sustained weakness across the broader memecoin sector. The recent chart shows a series of lower highs and continued sell-side pressure, with today’s range sitting between $0.058473 and $0.059082. On the fundamentals side, ShibaSwap reported that multiple signer keys were compromised, triggering an estimated $2.8M loss. This incident has added stress to SHIB’s already declining trend, as traders weigh the impact of security concerns against long-term community strength. Whale activity remains worth watching, but for now the token sits in a cautious trading zone as participants await stronger confirmation signals. Crypto Liquidity Analysis Market liquidity remains thin following October’s crash, increasing the potential for sharp price swings. Coins like SHIB and PEPE face amplified volatility, while Apeing ($APEING) benefits from a controlled rollout and verified audits. Timing and strategic entry are essential in this environment.

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at 181 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation is up by 0.9% on Wednesday morning (UTC); 85 of the top 100 coins and all top 10 coins appreciated today; BTC increased by 1.5% to $91,381, and ETH is up by 1.2% to $3,061; This could be a temporary cooling-off phase or the early stages of a more prolonged reset; Composite Index fell to its lowest level since April 2025; Expectations of a December US Federal Reserve rate cut fade; ’A push back toward $95,000 or even a retest of $100,000 isn’t off the table’; ’BTC at $250,000 by the end of this year may seem more aspirational than realistic’; El Salvador bought 1,090 BTC despite their agreement with the IMF; US BTC and ETH spot ETFs continued their read streaks with $372.77 million and $75.22 million in outflows, respectively; Samosa Capital Investment said Michael Saylor’s BTC strategy is ‘hurting Bitcoin’s price action’; Crypto market sentiment has entered the extreme fear territory. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices rise over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated by 1.5% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $91,381. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 1.2%, now changing hands at $3,061. The highest increase in this category today is 2.2% by Binance Coin (BNB) , which currently stands at $930. It’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 2.1% to $0.1582. Tron (TRX) is up the least, practically not changing over the past day: 0.1% to $0.2877. When it comes to the top 100 coins, 85 are green at the time of writing. Among these, two saw double-digit gains. WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) is up by 19.5% to $60.63, while Cronos (CRO) appreciated 11.4% to $0.1134. On the other side, two coins also saw double-digit drops. Monero (XMR) is down 10.4% to $363, while Internet Computer (ICP) fell by 10.3% to the price of $5. Meanwhile, according to on-chain data shared by analyst GugaOnChain, the market’s Composite Index fell to its lowest level since April 2025 , a move which historically precedes sharper pullbacks. It indicates that BTC could revisit the $87,000 zone. This comes as expectations of a December US Federal Reserve rate cut fade, while risk appetite thins. Moreover, even whales and long-term holders have decided to sell some of their holdings this time around. ‘Any Renewed Macro Pressure Could Easily Force Prices Lower’ According to Robin Singh, CEO of the crypto tax reporting platform Koinly , “Bitcoin appears to be settling into a period of directionless trading, gradually hovering around the low $90,000s and offering little relief to traders who came into November expecting a decisive rebound.” The price is now sitting near $90,000, which is notably below its opening level for the year. The slide beneath $100,000 has seen sentiment plunge sharply, Singh writes in an email. Now, “the market is trying to determine whether this is a temporary cooling-off phase or the early stages of a more prolonged reset. For now, conviction remains thin, and any renewed macro pressure could easily force prices lower.” Moreover, a push back toward $95,000 or even a retest of $100,000 isn’t off the table, he argues. However, this “may require a clear macro catalyst emerging such as more market confidence in a US Federal Reserve rate cut in December, which the market is unsure about and not ready to price in confidently.” Singh concludes that forecasts from earlier in the year that projected BTC at $250,000 by the end of this year “now seem increasingly far-fetched. With just over a month left in 2025 and momentum on shaky ground, those targets may seem more aspirational than realistic.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC stood at $91,381. Over the past day, the coin initially saw a surge to the intraday high of $93,668, but it then plunged to the low of $90,021. That said, it also fell 11.1% in a week, trading in a range between $89,455 and $105,023. It is now 27.3% away from its all-time high of $126,080. If the coin resists falling below the $83,800 zone, it could move towards $96,000 and $99,000. However, if it fails to do so, lower levels could await, possibly around $74,500. Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,061. It rose to the day’s high of $3,162 before dropping to the lowest point in 24 hours (by the time of writing) of $2,995, which was followed by a moderate recovery. Over the past week, ETH traded between the intraweek low of $2,980 and the intraweek high of $3,580. Overall, it’s down 10.6% in a week and 38% from its ATH of $4,946. ETH is currently holding above $3,000, but there’s a threat of it falling below the $2,850 mark. Nonetheless, should bears defend this level, the price could push higher towards $3,280. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has entered the extreme fear zone over the past couple of days. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 16 today , only slightly higher from yesterday’s 15. This is the lowest level in seven months. The last time this index went into the extreme fear territory was in April 2025. The market is currently driven by concerns over the falling prices and potential of an incoming bear market. It is likely that market participants are worried about the near-term outcomes, and a number of them are resorting to selling their assets. Others are taking advantage of the dips to stack up on coins. That said, once the market becomes oversold, it typically prepares for a rebound. ETFs Continue Outflow Streak On Tuesday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their fifths consecutive day of outflows, with $372.77 million . This brought the total net inflow back down to $58.22 billion, moving away from the $60 billion mark. While two of the 12 BTC ETFs did see positive flows, the negative flows of a single company pulled the entire category into red. Grayscale took in $139.63 million and Franklin noted $10.76 in inflows. At the same time, BlackRock let go of $523.15 million. At the same time, the US ETH ETFs also continued their outflow streak for the eighth day in a row, seeing another $75.22 million leave on 18 November. The total net inflow pulled back to $12.88 billion. Notably, four of the nine funds recorded inflows, but a single one recorded massive outflows, outweighing all the others. Grayscale took in the most ($62.39 million), followed by Bitwise , VanEck , and Franklin . BlackRock , however, released $165.08 million. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest bought $10.2 million worth of shares in Bullish (BLSH) on Monday as crypto-linked stocks plunged. Moreover, El Salvador purchased 1,090 additional BTC valued more than $100 million despite their agreement with the IMF to restrict Bitcoin purchases as part of a $1.4 billion loan arrangement. On the other hand, analysts at Samosa Capital Investment Fund have argued that Michael Saylor’s BTC strategy is actually “hurting Bitcoin’s price action” , which is detrimental for the Bitcoin community. Saylor, however, pushed back against concerns that Wall Street’s increasing presence in BTC has intensified volatility. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has seen a slight increase over the past day, while the stock market closed lower on Tuesday, for a second consecutive session, pulled down by the AI-tied tech stocks. By the closing time on 18 November, the S&P 500 was down by 0.83%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 1.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.07%. Is this rally sustainable? While the crypto market has seen a slight increase today, it’s worth noting that it remains overwhelmingly red over the past week. It would take clear macro signals to push it upwards. Otherwise, we may see smaller ups and downs continue over the next couple of days or a deeper push downwards.

It is being argued that quantum computing could one day undermine the cryptographic foundations that secure trillions of dollars in crypto assets. The latest statement on this issue came from Ethereum (ETH) founder Vitalik Buterin. Speaking at the Devconnect event, Vitalik Buterin said that quantum computing could break cryptographic encryption by 2028. At this point, Buterin warned that Quantum computing could break Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), the foundation of Ethereum's security, before the 2028 US presidential election. Buterin said Ethereum should transition to quantum-resistant cryptography within the next four years. Most blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, currently use ECC to generate private and public keys and verify transactions. Mysten Labs, the developer of the Sui blockchain, said in a recent report that new blockchains are better prepared to counter quantum threats. Mysten Labs said that new research shows that blockchains using the Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) are in a better position to deal with future quantum threats. According to Mysten Labs, new networks like Sui (SUI), Solana (SOL), and Near (NEAR) are more reliable against quantum threats. *This is not investment advice.

Despite recent losses, traders are watching for signs of a possible short-term reversal. Several technical indicators show that downside momentum may be weakening. Bullish Divergence Forms on Daily Chart A potential bullish divergence has formed on Dogecoin’s daily chart. The price has continued to make lower lows, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing higher lows. This setup, shared by Trader Tardigrade, often points to a shift in momentum before the price begins to recover. “Dogecoin Bullish Divergence remains valid,” the analyst noted. Notably, the divergence zone is highlighted on the chart, showing the price falling while RSI trends upward. Traders are watching this pattern to see if DOGE can stabilize and build support for a move higher. Meanwhile, DOGE is trading near the bottom of its Bollinger Band range on the weekly chart. The lower band sits at $0.151, just below the current price. This level has historically marked areas where selling pressure slows down. Source: TradingView The Stochastic RSI is also in oversold territory. The %K line is at 5.10 and the %D line is at 9.68, both below the 20 threshold. The lines are beginning to curve upward, which can suggest a potential bullish crossover if the move continues. This would be one of the first signs of a possible price recovery. Fractal Pattern Points to $1.80 Target A chart shared by Bitcoinsensus outlines a repeating structure in DOGE’s long-term trend. Previous rallies followed a similar setup — the price bouncing from a rising green trendline before large breakouts. The past moves returned 300% and 500%, and a third cycle appears to be forming now. If the structure continues, DOGE could target around $1.80, based on the slope of previous rallies. The red trendline marking earlier peaks intersects near this area. The current pattern matches earlier phases in both timing and structure. Whale Activity and Market Context On-chain data shows that whale wallets accumulated 4.72 billion DOGE, worth about $770 million, over the last two weeks. This accumulation took place during the recent decline, suggesting that large holders are positioning despite broader market weakness. At the same time, traders are watching for potential ETF-related news. There is speculation that firms such as Bitwise and Grayscale may soon file for spot DOGE ETFs. Meanwhile, the meme-coin sector remains under pressure, with the total crypto market cap slipping 2% in recent days.

Market sentiment is shaky but not broken, and traders are now focused on a cluster of critical support levels that could determine ETH’s next major direction. Key levels in play include: $3,000: primary short-term support (bullish wedge support) $2,900: secondary support if $3K breaks $2,150 zone: Deeper demand zone for deeper corrections $3,800: The major resistance bulls must reclaim to restore strong bullish momentum The big question: Can Ethereum hold above $3,000 long enough to fuel a meaningful recovery into 2026? Market Context: Why ETH Is Struggling Ethereum’s decline is not happening in isolation. Market-wide liquidity remains thin, risk assets are under pressure, and Bitcoin’s volatility has weighed on altcoins. Still, ETH’s current structure is not decisively bearish. Several factors are supporting stability: The bullish wedge pattern is still intact DeFi activity remains stable, though not aggressive Staking participation continues rising, supporting long-term scarcity L2 ecosystems like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base remain active The upcoming December Fusaka upgrade But challenges remain: ETH is underperforming BTC in the short term Whales have reduced accumulation over the past few weeks Retail interest is low compared to earlier in the year This mixed environment makes the $3,000 level even more important. Technical Outlook: Are the Bulls Still in Control? Looking at the chart, the bearish month has pushed ETH back into a long-term support region. However, sellers have not broken the wedge structure yet. If $3,000 holds: ETH can rebound toward $3,450, then $3,800 A breakout above $3,800 could trigger a late-year trend reversal Momentum indicators hint at a possible bounce forming If $3,000 breaks and closes below $2,900: ETH may drop toward the $2,150–$2,200 range This deeper zone has historically triggered strong reversals Long-term buyers may step in aggressively there Source: X The question to consider now is: Is the current retracement just a healthy cooling period for ETH before its next strong cycle, or just a fresh start to a major correction? Many analysts believe the first statement, but only if bullish momentum is witnessed at the current strong support zone. Ethereum Price Prediction Table for 2025 Period (2025) Minimum Average Maximum November 2025 $2,950 $3,150 $3,450 December 2025 $3,000 $3,250 $3,600 Full-Year 2025 $2,900 $3,800 $5,200 These estimates consider current market structure, historical volatility and typical ETH behavior during long consolidations. The year-end range reflects the possibility of a moderate recovery, especially if Bitcoin stabilizes and capital rotates back into altcoins. Key Drivers That Could Influence ETH’s End-of-Year Performance Bullish catalysts: A breakout above $3,800 Rising ETH staking participation Strong adoption of L2 networks Renewed institutional flows into crypto A Bitcoin recovery that restores broader risk appetite Bearish catalysts: Breakdown below $2,900 Continued weakness in risk markets Declining DeFi activity Negative macroeconomic developments Bullet point to remember: ETH does not need explosive upside to remain healthy, it only needs to maintain its long-term structure above $2,900. Final Thoughts: What Should You Watch? Ethereum is at a make-or-break level. Holding above $3,000 will determine whether ETH ends 2025 in recovery mode or slides toward a deeper correction. The trend is still salvageable, and the bullish wedge pattern suggests the market may attempt a rebound soon. A question worth asking: If ETH retests $2,900 or even $2,150, would that be a risk or an opportunity? Historically, such deep pullbacks have given long-term investors attractive entry points, but this would need a reversal confirmation and bullish momentum build-up. For now, ETH remains a structurally strong asset facing a temporary challenge, and the next two months will likely shape the narrative moving into 2026.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-19 11:50:54

54608314,630309,1763553632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54608314.jpeg,Hoskinson Vs. Cardano Foundation: From Berlin Parties To ‘Useful Idiots’,https://bitcoinist.com/hoskinson-vs-cardano-foundation/,"A fresh public clash between Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and the Cardano Foundation (CF) has reignited long-running tensions over governance, accountability and culture inside the ecosystem. The latest dispute centers on two flashpoints: a community-approved summit budget and a dispute over “useful idiots.” Commenting on X about the Cardano Summit in Berlin and its associated budget, Hoskinson attacked what he framed as resistance to scrutiny at the Foundation: “Also known as we don’t want accountability, oversight, or real KPIs so please let us return to no scrutiny and 6 million ada parties in Berlin.” The Hoskinson Vs. Cardano Foundation Beef Flares Up Again He linked that criticism directly to comments from Nicolas Cerny, the Cardano Foundation’s community and governance lead. In an earlier post, Cerny had written: “The ‘CF derangement syndrome’ is flaring up again. I strongly advise practicing critical thinking rather than simply parroting the talking points of certain individuals. You’re better than just being a useful idiot for someone’s political games.” Hoskinson seized on this wording as emblematic of a deeper cultural problem at the Foundation, saying: “It is also extraordinary that the community lead at the CF calls the community ‘useful idiots’ when they ask for oversight and control over their foundation. Are you all getting the arrogance of their culture? It’s fundamentally broken.” He later drew a clear line around his own base: “No one in my community is a useful idiot.” Cerny, in follow-up posts, tried to supply context. He argued that fair criticism “is always welcome and encouraged,” claimed the CF has “a culture of listening and engaging,” and pointed back to Cardano’s original three-pillar model. Citing a 2018 description of Cardano.org, he noted that the Foundation was initially tasked with standards, community support and regulatory engagement, while Emurgo was presented as the entity responsible for investing in start-ups and helping businesses, including stablecoin projects, build on Cardano. “Based on this,” Cerny wrote, “Emurgo was the entity originally responsible for getting businesses, like stablecoin projects, to build on Cardano Many things have changed since then, and the Cardano Foundation has had to pick up more responsibilities, so I understand why people are frustrated. However, it seems unfair to blame an organization for not fulfilling a role it was never originally designed to fill. Regardless, we are doing it now because it matters.” The Foundation today explicitly presents a wider mandate , including support for DeFi liquidity, Web3 integrations and real-world adoption, and has formalized these priorities in its public roadmap. Hoskinson, however, continues to argue that structural issues at the CF outweigh those efforts. Replying to a community member who urged IOG, CF and Emurgo to “team up in favour of growth” and warned that “this is wrong” if the three entities cannot work constructively, Hoskinson was blunt: “I spent years trying to work with them. It is not possible with their current form and culture. They need oversight and leadership changes. Only uncompromising and continuous scrutiny can force this change and enable a reset.” The result is a governance paradox at the heart of Cardano. On paper, the ecosystem is rolling out one of the industry’s most elaborate on-chain governance stacks. In practice, its founding institutions remain locked in a public struggle over mandate, legitimacy and tone — one now symbolized by Berlin’s “6 million ada parties” on one side and “useful idiots” on the other.

Altcoin ETF approvals, especially around assets like Solana and XRP, are quietly shifting institutional focus away from Bitcoin and toward broader market exposure. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is positioned as a serious infrastructure play, offering utility, low fees, presale access, and staking rewards for its rapidly growing self-custody wallet ecosystem. Best Wallet Token, Maxi Doge, and Aster tap different narratives for those mapping potential altcoin season positioning. Bitcoin ($BTC) just flushed below $90K after a five-week slide. Liquidations blew out across majors, $BTC dominance ticked lower, and the mood flipped from euphoria to ‘is this the top?’ almost overnight. Yet some analysts are flatly rejecting the ‘new bear market’ narrative. In particular, Michaël van de Poppe points out that Bitcoin is wrestling with its 20-week MA in a pattern that previously marked cycle bottoms, not tops. The rotation hints are already there. $BTC has slipped while altcoins are gaining share , and fresh capital is eyeing sectors turbocharged by recent trends like altcoin ETFs, self-custody, and on-chain derivatives. For example, Aster rallied while the rest of the market bled, reminding everyone that selective strength is still alive. For anyone scanning the best altcoins to buy into a potential rotation, three narratives stand out right now: Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , a wallet token tied to real usage; Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a degen meme coin with staking; and Aster ($ASTER) , a perp DEX token that’s ignoring the dump. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Powering an Up-and-Coming Non-Custodial Wallet When the market is nervous, self-custody usually gets an upgrade. This is where Best Wallet comes in, a multi-chain Web3 wallet that already claims over 500K users, with swaps, a launchpad, portfolio tools, and a planned card product. Powering it is its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which offers exclusive benefits to holders, including low trading fees inside the ecosystem, access to early-stage presales, and governance rights. You can also stake tokens after you buy them. Staking yields currently sit at 76% APY for presale participants, giving holders something productive to do while waiting for an alt season bid. On the numbers side, the presale has raised more than $17.1M at a token price of $0.025965, putting it firmly in ‘serious infrastructure’ territory rather than microcap gamble. Want to grab $BEST tokens? Check out our detailed guide on how to buy Best Wallet Token . According to our Best Wallet Token price prediction , $BEST has a potential end-of-2026 high at $0.62. This bodes well for HODLers, as you could see a potential ROI of 2,287%. But that is dependent on the team checking items off its roadmap. In a backdrop where Bitcoin is losing dominance and altcoin ETFs are grabbing headlines, a wallet token with existing users and fee-cutting utility fits neatly into the rotation thesis. Join the Best Wallet Token presale. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Coin Leverage On A Possible Risk-On Snapback Altcoin season discussions always end up in the same place: which memes are going to rip if risk-on comes back. That’s where Maxi Doge ($MAXI) lives. It leans into the gym-bro Doge aesthetic, targets degen traders, and wraps the usual meme chaos around a more structured ecosystem of competitions, leaderboards, and potential futures integrations. Our ‘ What Is Maxi Doge’ guide gives you the full lowdown on the project, including its origins, tokenomics, and price potential. Under the hood, $MAXI is built for traders who want volatility with a reward layer on top. The presale has already pulled in over $4M, with the token currently at $0.000269. Early buyers also get access to staking yields of around 76% currently, but these are dynamic, so they will change over time. That combination of low unit price, strong branding, and staking hooks tends to attract meme-coin hunters once fear cools and greed creeps back in. Our Maxi Doge price forecast outlines a potential end-of-2026 high at $0.0058. With 40% of its token supply allocated towards marketing, the project should have enough firepower to attract even more degens into its token presale and beyond. Still, if the ‘no bear market’ thesis holds and altcoin beta comes back online, a high-energy meme with built-in staking and gamified trading could catch flows from traders looking to rotate out of exhausted majors. Get your $MAXI tokens here. 3. Aster ($ASTER): Perp DEX Token That’s Rallying Into The Fear While most charts have been drifting lower with Bitcoin’s slide under $90K, Aster has been doing the opposite. The token has just put in a 13% daily jump, with its current price at around $1.32 . That strength isn’t coming out of nowhere. Aster is a next-gen decentralized exchange built for both spot and perpetual trading across multiple chains, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum. It leans on MEV-resistant execution, one-click ‘Simple’ trading, and a more advanced ‘Pro’ mode with features like hidden orders and grid strategies. On top of that, it uses yield-bearing collateral such as liquid-staking tokens and interest-bearing stablecoins to squeeze more capital efficiency out of each position. Recent upgrades and incentive programs, including a $10M rewards push and ongoing buybacks, have tightened circulating supply just as trading volume exploded into the billions. Unlike the presales, Aster is already listed and liquid, trading on major venues such as Binance via the ASTER/USDT pair, making it a live option for traders positioning into any altcoin season narrative right now. Get Aster on Binance. Recap: Overall, Bitcoin’s drop below $90K and falling dominance have reignited altcoin season talk, especially as alt ETFs and on-chain revenue plays gain attention. Within that backdrop, Best Wallet Token ties into self-custody and presale access, Maxi Doge offers a staked meme vehicle for pure beta, and Aster represents a live, revenue-backed DEX token that’s already defying the broader sell-off.

The filing is part of the existing federal class action lawsuit against the creators of the memecoin launch she promoted last year. The lawsuit alleged that Welch was paid approximately $325,000 to be an essential part of a token launch, which promised features that it could not technically deliver. The filing stated that the launch of the coin was premeditated to crash within minutes after its release. Welch receives funds for promoting HAWK Hawk Tuah Lawsuit pic.twitter.com/cHJ6T1fB0k — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) November 18, 2025 Court documents revealed that Welch was previously excluded from the lawsuit, which was filed just weeks after the Solana-based token launched. The social media star and podcast host previously said in a now-deleted post on X that she was fully cooperating with the law firm Burwick Law that’s suing her business associates to uncover the truth. Burwick Law previously stated that it intentionally left Welch out of the lawsuit as it felt it was the most effective way to make its clients whole. However, the law firm asked the court to allow it to amend the lawsuit to include Welch, her manager, Jonnie Forster, and the company, 16 Minutes LLC, as defendants. According to Court Listener, the law firm also included new fraud allegations and sought an order to serve existing defendants, Clinton So and OverHere Limited. The filing revealed that Welch’s company, 16 Minutes LLC, signed a Meme Token Creation and Monetization Agreement with Memetic Labs about five months before launching the memecoin. The agreement required Welch to promote the token across all social media channels in exchange for $125,000 upfront, with an additional $200,000 upon reaching promotional milestones. The lawsuit also revealed that Memetic Labs was granted a 50% lifetime profit share tied to the token’s trading activity. On-chain data revealed that HAWK rose to a market capitalization of $490 million within less than 15 minutes of its launch. The token immediately collapsed in value by 93% minutes after its launch. Lawsuit links HAWK’s insiders to other memecoin rug pulls The lawsuit alleged that the collapse of HAWK wasn’t coincidental, but rather an intentional scheme designed to occur in that manner. The suit added that insiders purchased large portions of the token’s supply before selling $1.27 million in tokens just minutes after launch. Blockchain forensics later found that the pseudonymous wallets orchestrating the scam were not random actors. The same wallet clusters were found to have funded, executed, or laundered proceeds from multiple other rug pulls. Other notable rug pulls included LIBRA , M3M3, AIAI, and the infamous TRUMP snipe. The suit found nearly identical timing patterns, funding flows, and extraction methods in the wallets across the schemes. Burwck Law also claimed that those schemes were all rug pulls and followed similar on-chain patterns to what happened with HAWK. Welch has been included in the latest lawsuit due to her role in promoting HAWK based on misrepresentations about the token’s potential utilities. The filing also alleged that the influencer’s manager, Forster, was responsible for Welch’s branding, including the embrace of the memecoin. The manager is also accused of promoting the token himself. The law firm added 16 Minutes LLC as a defendant in the case, due to being the operating entity for Welch’s career that signed the monetization agreements.

54608444,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90062,1763553953,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Just Got a Super Weird Flashwick On Kraken. Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-got-a-super-weird-flashwick-on-kraken-heres-what-happened/,"The XRP market delivered a dramatic surprise on Kraken when a one-minute candle printed an unbelievable price spike before crashing back to normal levels . Traders watching live saw a surreal vertical wick that did not match broader market action. The situation raised concerns because it appeared to be a huge price surge, but no similar movement was seen on other exchanges. The anomaly gained attention after Kevin Cage shared a screenshot of the one-minute XRP/USD chart . His post showed XRP shooting to $90.13 in a single candle before instantly slipping back to $2.18. The incident happened when market liquidity was low. A large market order hit a thin layer of sell orders, causing the price to jump far above its normal trading range. The chart returned to normal almost immediately, confirming an order-driven distortion rather than a real surge. What Caused the Flashwick Flash wicks occur when liquidity thins and order books lose depth. During off-peak hours, market makers often pull back, leaving wider spreads and fewer resting orders. A large buy or sell order can sweep through multiple empty levels. This creates a dramatic spike that looks like a market breakout. The effect appears extreme on lower timeframes, especially on volatile pairs like XRP. Kraken has experienced similar incidents in the past when trading activity decreased and the order book became thinner. Why the Wick Reversed Instantly The instant reversion shows that no broader market move supported the spike. Real rallies need sustained buying pressure and rising volume. In this case, trading volume remained low and the price quickly returned to its previous stable level. Other exchanges priced XRP normally through the event. That divergence confirms a technical distortion rather than genuine price discovery. Such anomalies vanish quickly when the order book refills and spreads tighten. History Shows This Is Not New The crypto market has seen similar spikes across several exchanges. In 2021, XRP showed brief but dramatic wick events during low-volume sessions on multiple platforms. Those spikes also came from order imbalances, not organic demand. These events highlight structural weaknesses that appear when liquidity becomes fragmented. The Kraken wick fits the same pattern and reflects the ongoing challenges of managing depth in fast markets. Lessons for Traders and Analysts Flash wicks can trigger alerts, stop-losses, or liquidation events. Traders should confirm unusual moves across multiple exchanges before reacting. Using weighted indices reduces the effect of single-exchange distortions. Risk controls should consider the possibility of errant candles during thin trading sessions. Understanding order-book dynamics can also prevent emotional responses during anomalies. A Reminder of Crypto’s Fragile Microstructure The unusual price spike underscores the importance of liquidity in price stability. XRP never traded near $90 across the market. The chart only reflected a temporary imbalance on one platform. Events like this remind traders that single-exchange prints can be misleading. Careful verification remains essential in a market where thin liquidity can create extreme but meaningless spikes.

These shocking claims suggest creditors may have lost out on massive recovery opportunities due to legal interference. What Did the FTX Creditor Actually Reveal? Arush, a former member of the FTX Unsecured Creditors Committee, dropped a bombshell on social media platform X. He stated that three major companies actively sought to bid for FTX’s assets but faced obstruction from the exchange’s bankruptcy law firm. This FTX creditor’s testimony contradicts official narratives about the bankruptcy proceedings. The alleged interested bidders included: Bullish – a major cryptocurrency exchange Figure – a blockchain lending platform One unnamed centralized exchange How Could This Have Changed Creditor Recovery? The blocked bids weren’t just ordinary offers. According to the FTX creditor, these proposals involved equity structures that could have added tens of billions of dollars to creditor repayments. This represents far more value than simple cash settlements. The consortium bid organized by the creditors committee envisioned an FTX 2.0 relaunch. This approach could have preserved enterprise value rather than liquidating assets piecemeal. Every FTX creditor potentially stood to benefit significantly from this alternative path. Why Would Anyone Block Better Deals? The former FTX creditor made serious allegations about motivations. He claimed the law firm obstructed these superior deals to force a liquidation process that would generate higher legal fees. This accusation strikes at the heart of bankruptcy ethics and creditor protection. Moreover, the FTX creditor called recent statements from FTX’s lawyers – who claimed there were no interested buyers – a blatant lie . The sharing of this post by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried adds another layer of complexity to these already serious allegations. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto Bankruptcies? These revelations from a former FTX creditor could set important precedents for how cryptocurrency bankruptcies are handled. The case highlights the critical need for transparency in creditor committees and legal representation. The situation raises crucial questions about: Creditor committee oversight mechanisms Legal fee structures in complex bankruptcies Bid evaluation processes for distressed crypto assets Protections for the average FTX creditor What’s Next for the FTX Creditor Community? The allegations from this courageous FTX creditor have ignited discussions about potential legal challenges to the current bankruptcy process. Creditors may explore options to investigate the blocked bids further and potentially recover lost value. This situation serves as a stark reminder that in complex bankruptcies, the interests of legal professionals don’t always align with those of the people they’re supposed to serve – the creditors themselves. Frequently Asked Questions Who is the FTX creditor making these allegations? The whistleblower is Arush, a former member of the FTX Unsecured Creditors Committee who had inside knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings and potential acquisition offers. Which companies were allegedly blocked from bidding? According to the allegations, Bullish (crypto exchange), Figure (blockchain lending platform), and one unnamed centralized exchange were prevented from submitting formal bids. How much value might creditors have lost? The equity-based proposals could have added tens of billions of dollars to creditor recoveries compared to liquidation values, representing potentially massive losses for each FTX creditor. Why would a law firm block better deals? The allegation suggests the law firm preferred liquidation because it would generate higher legal fees through extended bankruptcy proceedings rather than a quick sale. Has FTX’s legal team responded to these claims? As of now, FTX’s bankruptcy lawyers maintain their position that there were no serious interested buyers, directly contradicting the FTX creditor’s allegations. What can creditors do about this situation? Creditors can potentially petition the bankruptcy court to investigate these allegations and consider challenging the legal team’s actions and fee structures. Did this investigation into FTX creditor allegations surprise you?

54609017,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=864108,1763554271,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54609017.jpeg,Meta unveils $4 million bounty program for WhatsApp security research,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-expands-whatsapp-security-bounty/,"Meta has expanded its bug bounty program for WhatsApp, announcing new incentives to improve security research on the messaging platform alongside a $4 million award to white hat hackers who discover vulnerabilities. According to the tech company’s press statement released on Tuesday, WhatsApp is a lucrative target for state-sponsored hackers and commercial spyware developers. Meta said the new initiative seeks to make it easier for security researchers to investigate hacking strategies used specifically on the app messenger. Meta launches WhatsApp Research Proxy for bug bounty researchers Meta has introduced a tool called the WhatsApp Research Proxy to help security researchers examine the messaging platform’s network protocol more effectively. Initially available to a select group of long-time bug bounty participants, the company said it helps simplify investigations into WhatsApp’s infrastructure. The Research Proxy is intended to assist in uncovering vulnerabilities that might otherwise go undetected, and plans to expand access to more researchers over time are underway, leading to its public release in the coming months. “Our goal is to lower the barrier of entry for academics and other researchers who might not be as familiar with bug bounties to join our program,” a Meta spokesperson said. “WhatsApp clients and server infrastructure are high targets but also among the hardest surfaces to find bugs in.” Meta issues $25 million in payouts to global bug hunting participation Meta confirmed that it has already paid $4 million this year for nearly 800 validated reports. Over the past 15 years, the company has awarded more than $25 million to 1,400 researchers from 88 countries, and it received approximately 13,000 submissions from security researchers worldwide. According to the Facebook and Instagram parent company’s latest blog, academic researchers at the University of Vienna recently reported a novel method for enumerating WhatsApp accounts at scale. University of Vienna’s study generated lists of possible phone numbers using open-source tools, and checked if the numbers registered on WhatsApp compiled publicly accessible information. Although the research exceeded the platform’s intended limits, Meta said it provided valuable security flaws it needed to mitigate. Other bugs were found in an incomplete validation flaw on WhatsApp versions prior to v2.25.23.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25.23.82, and WhatsApp for Mac v2.25.23.83. The vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to process content retrieved from arbitrary URLs on another user’s device. Meta released an operating system-level patch to address CVE-2025-59489, an exploit that could have installed malware on Quest devices to execute arbitrary code on Unity applications. In its annual Bug Bounty Researcher Conference, security researcher RyotaK won the “Most Impact Award” for identifying bugs from the Quest device vulnerability traced to Unity’s third-party code. The researcher worked with Unity to resolve the issue affecting apps built on Unity 2017.1 and later. Meta counts legal victory in antitrust US FTC case Meta’s bug bounty program announcement comes on the heels of a legal win in its antitrust case against the US Federal Trade Commission, as reported by Cryptopolitan on Tuesday. The FTC had alleged five years ago that Meta held a monopoly in social networking through Instagram and WhatsApp. In a memorandum opinion, Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court in Washington, DC, said the FTC had failed to prove its case. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so. A judgment so stating shall issue this day.” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former operating chief Sheryl Sandberg, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, and other executives all gave their testimonies earlier this year. The court had dismissed the case in 2021 for lack of evidence, although the FTC filed an amended complaint that year with updated metrics and user data. Boasberg allowed the case to proceed in 2022 after a review, but he finally ruled in Meta’s favor this week. Joe Simonson, the FTC’s director of public affairs, argued that Meta was favored by Judge Boasberg, whom he claimed was “currently facing articles of impeachment.” “We are reviewing all our options,” Simonson told reporters after the ruling, insinuating that another appeal could come.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency continues trading in a tight range as buyers and sellers reach an impasse. According to recent analysis, this Bitcoin sideways trend reflects a fascinating battle between different market participants that could determine the next major price move. What’s Causing This Bitcoin Sideways Trend? Timothy Misir, head of BRN Research, identifies a clear standoff in current market dynamics. While retail investors deposited 31,800 BTC onto exchanges recently, creating selling pressure, large holders have been accumulating. The number of wallets holding over 1,000 BTC increased by 2.2% during the last four months. This creates a perfect equilibrium that maintains the current Bitcoin sideways trend . Who’s Buying and Who’s Selling in This Stalemate? The market reveals two distinct groups with opposing strategies: Long-term investors and whales continue accumulating Bitcoin Retail and short-term holders provide consistent selling pressure Institutional buying hasn’t been sufficient to absorb market-wide deleveraging This balance of forces keeps the Bitcoin sideways trend intact, with neither bulls nor bears gaining significant ground. When Will This Bitcoin Sideways Trend Break? Misir suggests macroeconomic factors could provide the catalyst needed to end this stalemate. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision in December looms large as a potential volatility trigger. Historically, such major economic announcements have disrupted similar Bitcoin sideways trend patterns, often leading to significant price movements in either direction. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? Understanding the current Bitcoin sideways trend provides valuable insights for market participants: Patience becomes crucial during consolidation phases Accumulation by large holders suggests long-term confidence Market structure remains healthy despite price stagnation Volatility typically follows extended periods of sideways movement How to Navigate This Bitcoin Market Environment The ongoing Bitcoin sideways trend presents both challenges and opportunities. While short-term traders struggle with limited price action, long-term investors benefit from accumulation opportunities. The key is recognizing that such consolidation periods often precede significant breakouts, making current market conditions particularly important to monitor. Frequently Asked Questions How long has Bitcoin been in this sideways trend? Bitcoin has been trading in a relatively narrow range for several weeks, with the stalemate between buyers and sellers becoming increasingly apparent in recent trading sessions. What typically breaks a Bitcoin sideways trend? Major catalysts like macroeconomic announcements, regulatory developments, or significant institutional moves typically break prolonged consolidation periods in cryptocurrency markets. Is whale accumulation during sideways trends bullish? Yes, accumulation by large holders during consolidation phases generally indicates confidence in long-term price appreciation and often precedes upward breakouts. Should investors worry about extended sideways movement? Not necessarily. Sideways trends represent healthy market consolidation and often build the foundation for the next significant price movement in either direction. How does retail selling pressure affect Bitcoin price? Retail selling creates consistent downward pressure, but when offset by institutional and whale accumulation, it results in the sideways price action we’re currently observing. What’s the significance of the Federal Reserve decision for Bitcoin? Interest rate decisions significantly impact risk assets like Bitcoin. The December Fed meeting could provide the volatility catalyst needed to break the current stalemate. Found this analysis helpful?

In an interview, he said Bitcoin has become more stable since he started buying it for Strategy in 2020. Saylor says Bitcoin is getting steadier and not changing price as much Saylor said Bitcoin was unstable when he first bought it for Strategy in 2020. The price fluctuated sharply, almost every day at the time, and the annualized volatility was approximately 80%. Even the most experienced investors struggled to predict what would happen next, so people lost or gained a significant amount of money in a very short time, as the price swings were massive. However, he said the price is steadier now than ever before because volatility has decreased to 50% over the last few years. Saylor explained that many institutional investors have been purchasing a significant amount of Bitcoin, thereby strengthening the market and making it less susceptible to small trades. He also said that the rules have improved, and more people are aware of how Bitcoin works, which makes the market more stable and predictable. Saylor said the trend will continue because he expects the volatility to drop by about 5% every few years. He explained that the large swings in the price of Bitcoin will eventually grow smaller over time, and investors will hold the coin for a long time without worrying about sudden drops. According to him, BTC still has strong profits because it’s only one and a half times more volatile than the S&P 500 index, yet it now grows about one and a half times faster. He said the coin is a safer and more reliable investment, and these qualities will attract more people and institutions to invest in it in the future. Saylor also mentioned that investors need to understand that it is very normal to have short-term drops even when BTC is becoming more stable, because it does not mean the coin is failing or losing value. He advised investors not to panic simply because the price fell temporarily. After all, the overall trend shows the market is still growing stronger than ever. Saylor says his company can handle big drops in the price of Bitcoin Saylor stated that Strategy can withstand the heat when the price of Bitcoin drops due to its careful planning, strong financial structure, and substantial holdings of 649,870 BTC worth around $61.7 billion. The company’s market net asset value (mNAV) dropped to 1.11x from around 1.52x when Bitcoin reached $125,100 in October. This indicates that while the market and the company’s stock, MSTR, can fluctuate rapidly in the short term, the company itself is robust and well-prepared to handle these changes without panic. Saylor said Strategy can handle drawdowns of 80 to 90% in the price of Bitcoin without risking its survival or ability to continue accumulating Bitcoin. He explained that the company is focused on long-term growth rather than reacting to short-term losses, which makes it more resilient to fluctuations. Even with his confidence, the Strategy CEO still acknowledged that traders, such as veteran trader Peter Brandt, had stated that BTC could experience even greater losses in the future. These claims were based on historical market patterns, such as the soybean bubble in the 1970s, but Saylor said the examples do not change the fact that Strategy is well-prepared for extreme market conditions. Analysts also noted that Wall Street has significant influence in Bitcoin, but Saylor countered that Strategy’s long-term approach will protect it from external pressure or short-term market fluctuations. He explained that his company doesn’t chase after short-term gains or react to temporary drops; instead, discipline is what keeps the company going strong and gives it an advantage over smaller investors who are exposed to panic selling.

54610209,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90064,1763557501,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Market Analyst: Massive Bounce Imminent for XRP. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-analyst-massive-bounce-imminent-for-xrp-heres-why/,"Traders are intensely focused on XRP this week as fresh technical signs suggest a possible rebound from a deeply watched support zone. The drama has spurred speculation that the token could be positioning itself for a strong short-term run. The bullish bounce scenario stems from a chart analysis shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO. In his post, Steph highlights a 3D candlestick setup that emphasizes a support range between $2.00 and $2.18. According to him, previous bounces from this same range yielded gains of 40–75 percent, lending weight to the idea that history might repeat itself. Technical Backdrop XRP has recently hovered around $2.18, which aligns with the lower end of Steph’s support band. Short-term momentum indicators are showing signs of cooling bearish pressure, and some oscillators suggest the market may be oversold. These conditions create a window for tactical buyers to step in. At the same time, XRP recently broke below critical levels, notably the $2.20 region, triggering a breakdown and increased selling pressure. That said, the $2.20 area has also been a defensive base, hinting at accumulation and a potential springboard for a recovery. Support Strength and Demand Zones Steph’s emphasis on the $2.00–$2.18 range resonates with broader market observations. Many analysts and traders see this as a high-liquidity zone where buyers previously entered aggressively. If XRP can reestablish firmness here, it could re-trigger liquidity-driven buying pressure. Historically, when XRP revisits this area, strong bids emerge. That makes it more than just a psychological level — it’s a structurally meaningful zone. This aligns with the narrative that earlier buyers or institutional programs might re-enter here. Risks and Longer-Term Constraints However, the longer-term backdrop isn’t risk-free. Despite the potential for a short-term bounce, many technical metrics remain weak. On daily timeframes, XRP has formed lower highs and struggles to reclaim key resistance zones. Without a clear break above, bullish hopes could dissipate quickly. Moreover, previous breakdowns below $2.20 occurred with surging volume. That suggests institutional selling remains a factor, and the conviction behind a bounce may be limited. Catalysts to Watch To validate the bounce thesis, traders will want to see confirmations: first, a clean daily close above resistance around $2.20–$2.28; second, sustained volume during the rebound rather than sporadic spikes; third, on-chain data that shows accumulation or reduced outflows to exchanges. If these align, XRP could stage a meaningful up-leg. Some analysts even project targets in the $2.70 range over the medium term. But if the bounce fails or the breakdown resumes, downside risk may return toward $2.00 or below. Strategic Takeaway Steph’s support-zone call is compelling: the $2.00–$2.18 range has historical relevance and could trigger another strong bounce. But traders must manage risk tightly. Use defined entries, set stops below the key support band, and be cautious of exchange-induced flash moves. A confirmed bounce will require volume conviction and follow-through — not just a base retest. In short, a “massive bounce” is possible, but it hinges on whether buyers show up with conviction again.

However, market analysis shows that there are some other tokens that are still performing well, like ZCash, Aster, and Meteora. Still, on-chain trends show that smart money is now opting for lower-priced presale opportunities like Remittix that offer value and demonstrate momentum. Here are seven crypto presales capturing investor attention and liquidity in November 2025: 1. Remittix (RTX): the global payments and PayFi solution Remittix is a PayFi solution built on blockchain technology that aims to become the go-to crypto-to-fiat hub, drastically lowering the cost and speed of money transfers for individuals and merchants worldwide. RTX actually stands out from all the other presale options on this list for its strong adoption and clear focus towards disrupting the $19 trillion global remittance market. Why Remittix is standing out: Institutional Attention: Remittix has already secured over $28.1 million in funding from more than 30,000 investors, indicating that there is a strong interest in the protocol. Compliance First: Remittix is fully verified by CertiK , and the team has also completed full KYC verification. Remittix has confirmed token listings on multiple Tier-1 CEXs like BitMart and LBANK, paving the way for immediate liquidity and access. Ecosystem Delivery: Unlike many projects that only promise future solutions, Remittix is already expanding its ecosystem with a released wallet for beta testing and partner APIs that allow merchants and platforms to quickly integrate fiat payment rails. Strong community support powered by an active $250,000 giveaway and a highly rewarding referrals program. Pros Multi-Trillion Dollar Utility: Directly addresses high fees and delays in global remittance. High Compliance & Trust: Fully audited by CertiK, and the team is KYC verified Confirmed CEX listings show strong liquidity planned for the post-launch phase. Strong institutional and retail adoption Factors to watch Faces high competition from established financial tech companies. Broader success relies on continued global merchant and institution integration. 2. BlockDAG (BDAG): the next-generation infrastructure BlockDAG has successfully secured over $436 million in funding and built a community of more than 312,000 holders, making it one of the hottest presales around. According to analysts, however, the attention is because of its technical offering. BDAG actually represents a major advancement in blockchain technology infrastructure. Its design is a hybrid that merges the security and decentralization of Bitcoin-style Proof-of-Work with the speed and scalability of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. This innovative approach is reportedly designed to produce an impressive capacity of up to 15,000 transactions per second (TPS). BlockGAG is also fully verified by CertiK. 3. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): a faster Bitcoin Layer 2 Bitcoin Hyper is solving one of the longest-standing problems in the crypto market: the speed and cost of transactions on the Bitcoin network. To do this, Hyper has raised over $27.8 million to build a performant Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that offers a faster, cheaper “express lane” for Bitcoin activity. This is possible thanks to the fact that it combines SVM technology with ZK proofs Hyper also commits transaction states back to the main Bitcoin chain, allowing it to maintain security while easily powering complex DeFi operations. Analysts suggest that this combination of performance and security could be one of the core things attracting investors to the Bitcoin Hyper presale, making it a powerful contender for the best altcoin to buy now in the infrastructure category. 4. Solargy (SOLARGY): the green utility token Solargy is one of the most compelling utility altcoin presales currently available in November 2025. It is an environment-focused project that has raised over $246,558 to build an infrastructure that directly connects tangible, real-world sustainable energy solutions with on-chain token rewards. According to the team, the SOLARGY token will be used to fund distribution and incentivize community growth and participation. 5. Ionix (IONX) Ionix is building a new, high-performance blockchain technology focused on making it easier and cheaper for developers to launch decentralized applications. It is specifically engineered for high-speed, low-fee environments necessary for demanding applications like GameFi crypto and fast-paced DeFi platforms. According to analysts, if Ionix can successfully deliver speed and user-friendliness, then it may be able to capture significant market share among teams looking to innovate quickly in the fast-moving Web3 space. This is evidently something investors find interesting because already IONX has secured more than $1.5 million in funding out of its $4.57 million target. 6. Best Wallet Token (BEST) The BEST token is the most recent addition to the Best Wallet multi-chain ecosystem. This token is actually designed to enhance Best Wallet’s overall utility by introducing benefits like reduced transaction fees, boosted staking rewards, and early-access privileges to new partner projects. This simple yet effective model provides a practical, everyday use case. The token’s value is inherently linked to the growing user base and activity within the wallet ecosystem. With over $17.1 million raised, BEST is proving its appeal to users who value real utility and convenience in their digital assets. 7. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the community-driven asset While lacking the foundational utility of the other tokens, Little Pepe is a memecoin project that is thriving at the same time other meme projects are struggling to stay afloat. Little Pepe has successfully leveraged humor and a strong community spirit to build momentum, and already, the project has secured over $27.5 million in funding. LILPEPE focuses on a simple, engaging brand and a clear plan for community-driven growth, demonstrating that cultural and very speculative assets still hold a place in the broader crypto market. Final verdict: Remittix still leads the pack for long-term value While BlockDAG presents impressive technical scale and Bitcoin Hyper tackles a foundational infrastructure challenge, Remittix’s solution is both simpler to understand and addresses a problem with guaranteed, persistent demand: money transfer. The global flow of money is an immutable, multi-trillion-dollar necessity. Remittix’s approach of securing CertiK verification, completing KYC, and lining up major exchange listings (for post-launch liquidity) shows a highly professional, compliance-focused strategy. As such, the emphasis on institutional adoption and verifiable utility is very clear. This positions Remittix as the most compelling choice for early investors seeking a project with a strong blend of innovation and execution, making it the most likely candidate for significant success in 2026 predictions. Frequently asked questions (FAQs) What is the most important factor for an altcoin’s success in 2026? According to veteran investors, an altcoin has to have clear real-world utility and a strong focus on compliance to succeed in 2026. Projects that solve high-value problems in niches like global payments and decentralized physical infrastructure networks are now being favored as the future of crypto. How important is a CertiK audit for the best crypto presale to buy now? A CertiK audit is extremely important. It indicates that a project does not have smart contract vulnerabilities that could affect user safety. The security audit is even more trustworthy when you consider that CertiK is one of the top security firms. If a project has high funding, does that mean it will succeed? No, it doesn’t. High funding is good because it indicates powerful community and investor confidence. However, it doesn’t guarantee success. That said, it does provide the necessary capital for robust development, marketing, and securing major exchange listings, which are all vital ingredients for success.

On July 19, CFTC chair nominee Michael Selig will face intense questioning about how he plans to oversee digital assets. This hearing comes at a critical moment for the cryptocurrency industry, as regulators worldwide struggle to establish clear rules for this rapidly evolving market. Why Is Crypto Regulation So Important Right Now? Proper crypto regulation ensures market stability and protects investors from fraud. The CFTC’s approach to digital assets could determine how easily Americans can participate in cryptocurrency markets. Michael Selig’s background as senior legal counsel for the SEC’s crypto task force gives him unique insight into the challenges of regulating this space. His confirmation hearing represents a significant step toward establishing comprehensive crypto regulation frameworks. What Questions Will Senators Ask About Crypto Regulation? Senators are expected to focus on several key areas during the confirmation hearing. They will likely ask about: How the CFTC will coordinate with the SEC on crypto regulation The regulation of prediction markets and their impact on investors Plans for preventing market manipulation in cryptocurrency trading Approaches to international cooperation on digital asset oversight These questions reflect growing congressional concern about establishing effective crypto regulation that balances innovation with consumer protection. How Will This Affect Future Crypto Regulation? The outcome of this hearing could signal major changes in how the United States approaches crypto regulation. If confirmed, Selig would bring his SEC experience to the CFTC, potentially creating more consistent regulatory approaches between the two agencies. This coordination is essential for developing coherent crypto regulation that doesn’t stifle innovation while maintaining market integrity. The hearing represents an opportunity to clarify how different digital assets will be classified and regulated. What Challenges Does Crypto Regulation Face? Establishing effective crypto regulation involves navigating complex technical and legal landscapes. Regulators must understand blockchain technology while addressing concerns about: Consumer protection in decentralized finance systems Preventing money laundering and terrorist financing Ensuring fair markets across global jurisdictions Adapting existing financial regulations to new technology These challenges make Selig’s confirmation hearing particularly significant for the future of crypto regulation. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Digital Asset Oversight The Senate’s questioning of Michael Selig represents a pivotal moment for crypto regulation in the United States. His responses could shape regulatory approaches for years to come, affecting everything from consumer protection to market innovation. As digital assets continue to evolve, establishing clear and effective crypto regulation becomes increasingly urgent for maintaining market confidence and stability. Frequently Asked Questions What is the CFTC’s role in crypto regulation? The CFTC regulates commodity futures and options markets, which includes certain cryptocurrency derivatives and spot markets for commodities like Bitcoin. When will the Senate vote on Selig’s confirmation? The confirmation vote typically follows the hearing within several weeks, though exact timing depends on the Senate schedule. How does CFTC crypto regulation differ from SEC oversight? The CFTC generally oversees commodities and derivatives, while the SEC focuses on securities. The classification of specific digital assets determines which agency has primary jurisdiction. What are prediction markets in cryptocurrency? Prediction markets allow users to bet on future events using cryptocurrency, creating regulatory challenges around gambling laws and financial oversight. Why is inter-agency cooperation important for crypto regulation? Cooperation prevents regulatory gaps and ensures consistent rules across different types of digital assets and financial products. How might this affect cryptocurrency prices? Clear regulatory frameworks typically increase market confidence, potentially leading to greater institutional investment and price stability.

I grabbed coffee the other day and tapped my phone. Ordered takeout last night — the same thing. With payment providers everywhere you look, picking one isn’t just another business decision. It can literally make or break you. When you choose a trusted digital payment provider, you’re not buying software. You’re buying peace of mind. And honestly? Your business’s future depends on it. Enhanced Security Security stuff keeps me awake sometimes. It probably keeps you up, too. The good providers don’t play games with this. They’re constantly tweaking encryption, adding tokenization layers, and staying two steps ahead of hackers. Customers actually notice this stuff. There’s a bakery near me that has “secure payments” written right on their window. Smart move. People see that and think “these guys get it.” Your grandmother probably checks for that little lock icon before entering her card info online. Security sells. Improved Efficiency Time equals money. We all know this. But digital payments make it literal. Think about that sandwich place you love — the one where everything flows smoothly. You order, pay, and done. Compare that to places where you’re standing around while they figure out their ancient register. Real-time processing changes your world overnight. Cash flow improves instantly, you stop babysitting payment issues, and your team can focus on actually running the business instead of wrestling with tech problems. User-Friendly Experience Nobody wants to solve puzzles just to buy lunch. Smart payment providers understand this completely. Their systems just work. Your customers don’t need engineering degrees to check out. And when buying is easy, people actually finish instead of giving up halfway through. I watched an online store lose sales last month because its checkout was confusing — three screens, weird error messages, the whole mess. Don’t be that business. Access to Advanced Features A trusted digital payment provider packs in features you’d never build yourself. Detailed reporting that actually makes sense? Yes. Analytics that tell real stories? Absolutely. Fraud detection that learns as it goes? You bet. There’s this vintage shop downtown that discovered through payment data that their biggest spenders always come in on Thursday evenings. Now they save their best stuff for Thursday releases. Genius, right? These insights can completely reshape how you operate. Scalability Growing fast? Well, your payment system should keep pace. Good providers scale effortlessly with you. Whether you’re processing fifty transactions or fifty thousand, they handle it. No crashes when you go viral. No slowdowns during holiday rushes. I know a startup that went international and dealt with different currencies, banking rules, and compliance nightmares, but their payment provider handled everything. That’s the kind of support growing businesses actually need. Moving Forward Choosing a trusted digital payment provider isn’t another line item expense. It’s a strategy. You’re investing in security, efficiency, happier customers, powerful insights, and room to grow. Digital payments aren’t slowing down. They’re speeding up. Get ahead now, thank yourself later.

The proposal comes amid changing attitudes towards digital assets in the Islamic republic and some of its partners that have been dealing with banking restrictions. Tehran seeks SCO crypto to circumvent sanctions Iran is trying to convince other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) that a new cryptocurrency under their control would help them trade without Western interference. The country’s First Vice President Mohammad-Reza Aref has just proposed to jointly create a coin to enhance ties between nations participating in the format, such as China, Russia and India. Speaking at the latest summit of the SCO heads of government in Moscow on Tuesday, Aref argued that such digital currency has the potential to streamline economic exchange, boost trust and increase transparency among them. Implementing the common crypto would ultimately foster integration in the region and help reach goals aimed at ensuring sustainable development, he underscored. Quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA, the vice president also urged colleagues to join forces on establishing what he described as more efficient interbank messaging mechanisms. He issued the call while highlighting the need for an independent financial system amid rapid changes in the global economy. Regional financial frameworks, Aref elaborated, can counteract pressures from the West, which he accused of exploiting existing international banking systems. The SCO is a Eurasian organization for political, economic, and security cooperation. It has 10 members, including Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Belarus, besides the already mentioned major powers. Its roots trace back to the Shanghai Five, a group formed by the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and three other former Soviet republics in the mid-90s. Iran is among its newer members after joining in the summer of 2023. SCO is the world’s largest regional body in terms of geography and population. As of last year, it combined nominal gross domestic product accounted for approximately 23% of the global GDP. In his address, Mohammad-Reza Aref expressed the support of the Iranian government for establishing a development bank under the organization. It would fund infrastructure projects and, in his words, “reduce reliance on unfair global financial systems.” The Iranian official also urged accelerating his country’s membership in the SCO Interbank Consortium, which is currently financing joint projects. Iran is taking the path of crypto adoption During the meeting with the SCO prime ministers in the Russian capital, Iran’s vice president also reiterated that the Islamic Republic is ready to enhance collaboration in the fintech space to facilitate financial transactions among the partners in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. His government has lately been changing its attitude towards new financial technologies, and most notably regarding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), as reported by Cryptopolitan. During a recent blockchain conference in Tehran, Iran’s first international event of this kind, officials spoke of decentralized digital money as a means to strengthen their nation’s financial independence and set crypto regulation as a priority. In an address to attendees, the Speaker of the Iranian parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, emphasized that Iran wouldn’t be able to meet its development goal of making 10% of its economy digital without embracing crypto. The notion was backed by other representatives of the government and the legislature, such as the chairman of the parliamentary economic committee, Shamseddin Hosseini, who agreed that reaching the target “is impossible without crypto assets.” “Cryptocurrencies provide new ways to do business and to pay for trade,” Ghalibaf also said at the forum attended by delegates from over a dozen countries, including members of the BRICS group of emerging economies. The head of the Majlis urged the latter to use crypto in their transactions. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

That future just got closer as Apex Group, overseeing an astonishing $3 trillion in assets, announces its acquisition of Globacap. This strategic move represents a monumental leap forward for tokenized funds in regulated markets. Why Are Tokenized Funds Gaining Massive Institutional Attention? The acquisition of Globacap, a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer, positions Apex Group to launch compliant tokenized funds in the United States. This development signals a significant shift in how institutional players approach digital assets. Traditional finance giants are now embracing blockchain’s potential to transform fund management. Tokenization offers numerous advantages that traditional funds cannot match: Enhanced liquidity through fractional ownership Reduced settlement times from days to minutes Lower operational costs and administrative overhead Increased transparency through blockchain tracking How Does This Acquisition Transform the Digital Asset Landscape? Apex Group’s move demonstrates that major financial institutions recognize the inevitable convergence of traditional and digital finance. By acquiring Globacap’s regulatory expertise and infrastructure, Apex can now navigate the complex US regulatory environment while advancing their tokenized funds strategy. This acquisition represents more than just a business transaction. It validates the entire concept of tokenized funds as a legitimate investment vehicle. Moreover, it provides a blueprint for other traditional asset managers considering digital transformation. What Challenges Do Tokenized Funds Face in Mainstream Adoption? Despite the excitement surrounding this development, several hurdles remain for widespread tokenized funds adoption. Regulatory uncertainty continues to be the primary concern for many institutions. However, Apex’s approach through acquiring regulated entities shows a practical path forward. Other challenges include: Technological infrastructure requirements Investor education and awareness Interoperability between traditional and blockchain systems Cybersecurity and custody solutions What Does This Mean for Future Financial Innovation? The Apex-Globacap deal serves as a powerful catalyst for the entire digital assets industry.

Blockchain analysis by Arkham Intelligence on Tate’s address showed a rapid depletion of his funds before he could make a single successful withdrawal. The former athlete deposited $727,000 into decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid, where he placed a long leverage bet on Bitcoin. ANDREW TATE: HYPERLIQUIDATED Andrew Tate deposited a total of $727K to Hyperliquid and as of today, has lost it all – without making a single withdrawal. He also claimed a total of $75K as referral rewards from traders using his reflink. He has lost all of that trading as well. pic.twitter.com/LRPn1ImS0p — Arkham (@arkham) November 18, 2025 The market slump wiped away the whole amount as he attempted to recover funds through referral rewards totaling $75,000 on his link. However, all of Tate’s holdings were locked in losing positions until they were fully liquidated. Andrew Tate suffers Hyperliquid trading catastrophe According to Andrew Tate’s trading records shared by X user StarPlatinum, he placed a leveraged long on Ethereum with 25× leverage in June, losing $597,000 in a single trade. Tate had tried hiding his losses, but he forgot or probably did not understand that it was a DEX, so his wallet was found and discovered to have been $600,000 deep in red. Cryptopolitan reported in September how he took a long position on WLFI just before the token’s unlock, which resulted in a loss of $67,500. An attempt to reopen the trade minutes later led to more profit shedding, and he went quiet for a few weeks afterwards. He did register one profitable trade in August, a small short on YZY that earned $16,000. However, this gain was short-lived, as subsequent trades erased the profit almost immediately. November 14’s Bitcoin long at 40× leverage wiped out $235,000, leaving the influencer with a balance of just $983. Over the course of several months, Tate executed more than 80 trades, achieving a win rate of just 35.5%. His total profit and loss (PnL) in this period amounted to a net loss of $699,000, where more than 65% of Tate’s net worth in tokens he promoted himself was consumed. Andrew Tate’s main Ethereum wallet has about $65,000 in it, largely in ETH and low-cap tokens that he got through swaps. His wallet on the Solana blockchain holds over $140,000, most of which is in memecoins. The DADDY token alone accounts for $91,000, the TOPG token holds $5,000, and the remaining tokens are small positions that have fallen between 70% and 90% in value in the last month. Crypto Twitter blasts Tate for wrong trade moves Crypto Twitter has called Andrew Tate “the only cobra that bites itself” and “one of the worst traders in crypto” due to his string of losses. “Based on this trading record, Andrew Tate might be one of the worst traders in crypto. And people still pay him for advice,” said one market watcher. Lookonchain posted a ranking of the most-liquidated traders on Hyperliquid since November 1, where Tate ranked third with 19 liquidations, behind Jeffrey “Machi Big Brother” Huang’s 71, and James Wynn with 26. Wynn quoted Lookonchain’s update to mock the American and British former kickboxer, writing: “Hahahahhahahaa I beat you Cobratate you’re a fucking loser. 26-19, numbers speak for themselves. Try harder, be more reckless G.” Tate has spent years promoting crypto in his messages on financial independence, giving his social media followers so-called “business courses.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|BTC|DADDY|ETH|SOL,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-19 13:23:44

The latest breakdown below a long-standing support level has accelerated selling momentum and placed ADA at risk of revisiting price zones not seen since early 2023. Bearish Structure Dominates as Technical Levels Fail Cardano (ADA) is currently trading beneath every critical moving average, including the 7-day SMA at $0.50, 30-day SMA at $0.58, and the 200-day SMA at $0.73 — a configuration that signals persistent structural weakness. This alignment typically reflects a mature downtrend with limited near-term bullish catalysts. Short-term momentum indicators paint a similar picture. The RSI-7 sits at 27.3, indicating oversold conditions, yet oversold alone is insufficient to confirm a reversal. The MACD, meanwhile, shows no signs of bullish crossover, reflecting ongoing downward momentum and a lack of accumulation from larger traders. Sentiment worsened after ADA broke below the $0.52 support level, a zone that had held firm throughout 2024. The breakdown triggered algorithmic sell programs, pushing targets toward the $0.43–$0.30 range — an area where liquidity depth is thin and volatility historically increases. Liquidity Shock and Market Fear Amplify Decline Cardano’s decline has been compounded by a liquidity shock across decentralized exchanges, reducing the network’s ability to absorb sustained sell flows. Lower DEX liquidity amplifies price swings, enabling relatively small orders to drive disproportionate downside moves. The broader crypto environment has also turned defensive, with risk appetite weakening amid macro uncertainty. This crypto-wide risk aversion intensified the impact of ADA’s technical breakdown, accelerating the shift toward lower price zones. Analysts note that while ADA is oversold on several short-term metrics, a meaningful recovery remains difficult without structural improvement in on-chain liquidity and buying interest near critical support levels. Smart PR in Down Markets: How Outset PR Maximizes Visibility Without Overspending In periods when market sentiment turns sharply negative — as Cardano’s price action demonstrates — the importance of communicating value, stability, and long-term direction becomes even more critical. This is where Outset PR has built a distinctive advantage through data-driven budgeting, precision media targeting, and measurable syndication results. Traditional PR models often rely on mass pitching and unclear distribution outcomes. Many companies end up overspending on placements that fail to deliver meaningful readership. Outset PR addresses this through Syndication Map , a proprietary analytics tool that identifies which outlets deliver the strongest visibility and syndication lift. Outset PR’s campaigns regularly achieve multiplicative reach through syndication, where top-tier placements are organically republished across platforms such as CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, Yahoo Finance, and numerous aggregators. A recent StealthEX campaign illustrates this effect: targeted placement resulted in 92 republications and generated a total outreach of over 3 billion — far beyond the initial distribution. Through a combination of proprietary tools, strong editorial relationships, and strategic syndication, Outset PR has redefined what efficient PR looks like in the crypto sector, especially when markets demand clarity and cost-effectiveness. Outlook Cardano’s bearish trend is likely to persist unless ADA can reclaim and hold $0.48, a level that would signal renewed accumulation. For now, the breakdown below long-term support and weak liquidity conditions keep downside risks elevated. As market narratives shift and sentiment becomes more fragile, strategically crafted, data-driven communication — such as that pioneered by Outset PR — plays an increasingly important role in how projects maintain visibility, credibility, and long-term positioning during prolonged drawdowns.

The partnership allows regulated institutions to use BlackRock’s BUIDL tokenized fund as collateral for trading on Binance, potentially strengthening the utility and liquidity profile of the BNB Chain. BlackRock Partnership Signals Institutional Validation The agreement enables institutions to pledge real-world assets (RWAs) — including U.S. Treasuries tokenized within BUIDL — directly on Binance for trading activities. The move effectively extends BUIDL’s operational reach to the BNB Chain, deepening the exchange’s foothold in regulated digital asset infrastructure. The partnership represents a milestone in institutional acceptance of BNB Chain’s settlement architecture and security model. By allowing conservative institutional capital to participate in crypto markets with lower counterparty risk, Binance is positioning BNB Chain as a venue capable of supporting tokenized RWAs at scale. This expansion of collateral options could drive higher demand for BNB , which fuels network fees, governance operations, and on-chain utilities. Increased activity from institutional traders tends to boost volumes, creating a positive feedback loop for ecosystem value capture. BNB Holds Long-Term Support Despite Market Fear Source: coinmarketcap While broader crypto markets have faced renewed pressure — reflected in a Fear Index reading of 16 — BNB has demonstrated notable resilience. The token successfully defended its 200-day moving average at $838.30, a level widely viewed as long-term trend support. The RSI(14) sits at 39.21, remaining above oversold territory and suggesting continued participation from strategic buyers. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram, at –3.01, shows narrowing bearish divergence, a signal that selling pressure may be losing momentum. Defending the 200-day MA in an environment of broad market weakness often reflects accumulation by high-conviction participants, reinforcing the view that BNB is building a structural base for a potential rebound. Strategic Communications in Shifting Markets: Outset PR’s Data-Driven Approach As major partnerships reshape market expectations, communications have become a crucial factor in how projects signal strength, credibility, and strategic direction during volatile periods. Outset PR , led by crypto communications specialist Mike Ermolaev, has emerged as a leader in data-driven crypto PR management that aligns messaging with market cycles. Unlike traditional agencies, Outset PR operates like a workshop, constructing campaigns based on quantitative indicators such as discoverability, domain authority, conversion potential, and viral probability. Each pitch is tailored to the tone and audience of the publication, while timing is synchronized with market conditions to maximize impact. For projects operating in a competitive and sentiment-driven market, clear, analytics-backed data-driven communication by Outset PR can reinforce institutional trust, shape investor perception, and amplify catalysts like the Binance–BlackRock collaboration. Can Institutional Catalysts Support a Break Higher? BNB’s price action reflects a mix of technical resilience and institutional catalysts, but upside momentum remains constrained by broader risk aversion. Market participants are watching whether capital inflows tied to the Binance–BlackRock collaboration can offset macro-driven hesitation. If sentiment improves and BNB maintains its hold above the 200-day MA, analysts say a recovery could gain traction, supported by higher BNB Chain utility and renewed demand from institutional desks adopting tokenized RWA collateral models. Until then, the partnership offers a meaningful narrative tailwind — but the market will likely require clearer signs of risk appetite before a sustained bullish trend develops.

Naver and Dunamu, the powerhouse behind Upbit exchange, are preparing for a groundbreaking stock swap that could redefine their corporate futures. The July 26 board meetings mark a pivotal moment for both companies and the entire crypto industry. What Exactly is This Strategic Stock Swap? The proposed stock swap represents a sophisticated merger strategy where Naver and Dunamu exchange shares to create a unified corporate structure. Industry insiders estimate the exchange ratio will fall between 1:3 and 1:4, meaning Dunamu shareholders would receive three to four Naver shares for each Dunamu share they own. This arrangement transforms Dunamu into a Naver affiliate while maintaining operational independence. This strategic move follows months of negotiation and due diligence. Both companies recognize the immense potential of combining Naver’s technological infrastructure with Dunamu’s cryptocurrency expertise. The stock swap mechanism allows for a seamless integration without the complexities of traditional mergers. Why Does This Stock Swap Matter for Crypto Investors? The implications of this stock swap extend far beyond corporate boardrooms. Consider these key benefits: Enhanced market position : Combined resources create a stronger competitor in global crypto markets Technology integration : Naver’s AI and cloud capabilities could revolutionize Upbit’s platform Regulatory advantages : Larger corporate structure provides better compliance resources Shareholder value : Both companies’ shareholders benefit from diversified exposure Moreover, this stock swap positions the merged entity to compete more effectively against international exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. The timing is particularly strategic given South Korea’s evolving regulatory framework for digital assets. Who Emerges as the Power Players After the Stock Swap? The leadership dynamics post- stock swap reveal fascinating corporate chess moves. Dunamu Chairman Song Chi-hyung is poised to become the largest shareholder of Naver Financial, while Naver secures the second-largest shareholder position. This balanced power structure ensures both companies maintain influence in the new entity. Current industry analysis suggests this leadership arrangement will: Preserve Dunamu’s entrepreneurial spirit Leverage Naver’s corporate governance experience Create synergistic decision-making processes Maintain operational continuity during transition What Challenges Could This Stock Swap Face? While the stock swap appears promising, several hurdles remain. Regulatory approval represents the most significant challenge, as South Korean authorities scrutinize major corporate combinations. Shareholder acceptance of the exchange ratio also requires careful navigation, particularly for minority investors. Integration complexities could emerge in areas like: Corporate culture alignment Technology system compatibility Operational process standardization Market competition considerations However, both companies have demonstrated strong preparation for these challenges through extensive pre-merger planning and stakeholder communication. The Future After the Stock Swap: What’s Next? Successful completion of this stock swap could trigger several industry developments. We might see accelerated innovation in Upbit’s trading platform, expanded service offerings, and potentially international market expansion. The combined entity would possess substantial resources to invest in blockchain research and development. This strategic move also signals growing maturity in the cryptocurrency sector, where traditional corporate strategies like stock swap arrangements become increasingly common. Other crypto exchanges may follow similar paths as the industry consolidates and matures. FAQs: Your Stock Swap Questions Answered What happens to Upbit after the stock swap? Upbit continues operations as usual but gains access to Naver’s extensive technological resources and corporate infrastructure, potentially enhancing its service offerings. How will the stock swap affect share prices? While short-term volatility is possible, the long-term outlook appears positive due to synergistic benefits and expanded market opportunities. When will the stock swap be finalized? If approved on July 26, the implementation process typically takes several weeks to complete all regulatory and administrative requirements. Can shareholders vote against the stock swap? Yes, shareholders have voting rights, though board recommendations and the strategic benefits make approval likely. Will Upbit users notice any immediate changes? Most users won’t see immediate changes, but gradual platform improvements and new features may emerge over time. How does this affect South Korea’s crypto regulations? The merger could influence regulatory discussions by demonstrating how major corporations can successfully integrate cryptocurrency operations.

At the same time, Monad’s public token sale on Coinbase lost momentum after a strong opening. Monad’s team insists the slower pace reflects its goal of broad distribution rather than hype, but the trajectory still falls short of recent blockbuster sales like MegaETH. Coinbase Quietly Building Prediction Market? Coinbase seems to be preparing its own prediction markets platform, according to new findings that were shared by well-known tech researcher Jane Manchun Wong. Wong has built a reputation for uncovering unreleased features across major platforms like Facebook, Instagram and X, and posted screenshots suggesting that Coinbase is developing a dedicated website for prediction markets in partnership with Kalshi. The images show what looks like a full prediction market interface branded with Coinbase’s logo, complete with FAQ sections and an introductory guide to the service. One screenshot indicates that the offering will be provided through Coinbase Financial Markets, the company’s derivatives division, and powered on the back end by Kalshi, a federally regulated prediction market platform. Coinbase and Kalshi actually announced a partnership on Nov. 13, naming Coinbase as the custodian for Kalshi’s USDC-based event contracts. The new screenshots seem to show the next evolution of that collaboration, and hint at a full-scale integration that will make prediction markets a core part of Coinbase’s overall strategy. Coinbase previously told CNBC that it intends to build an “everything exchange,” expanding far beyond standard crypto trading and into other financial markets. Prediction markets have proven to be one of the fastest-growing segments in the digital-asset industry this year, with rising trading volumes on platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket bringing more attention from mainstream investors. Wong’s screenshots suggest Coinbase plans to allow users to trade in either USDC or US dollars across a wide range of categories, including economics, politics, technology, sports and science. The interface also implies that the exchange will regularly roll out new markets tied to trending events. The interest in prediction markets is not limited to just Coinbase. Several major crypto exchanges have started exploring or launching their own offerings this year to meet the rising demand. Crypto.com recently introduced a prediction platform that will integrate with Trump Media, while Gemini is developing a similar service as part of a planned “super app.” Gemini also revealed last week that it filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to become a designated contract market, which is an essential step toward offering regulated event-based trading. Coinbase Monad Sale Stalls In other Coinbase-related news, Monad’s closely watched public token sale on Coinbase is showing signs of losing momentum after an explosive start. This is raising concerns that the offering may end up undersubscribed. Interest surged in the first half hour on Monday, with more than $43 million committed. This quickly created early expectations that the 7.5 billion MON tokens could sell out within 24 hours. But by late on day one, only 48% had been taken up, and by 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the subscription rate climbed to just under 64%. This was a noticeable slowdown. In response to the cooling activity, Monad co-founder Keone Hon took to social media to share more details about the project’s vision. He explained that the goal of the MON sale is not rapid oversubscription, but wide distribution, and argued that Coinbase’s transparent and “democratic” allocation method allows the token to reach a broader audience. Hon also noted that many participants may be holding back intentionally since Coinbase’s format gives users five and a half days to decide whether to commit — and once they do, they are locked in. This, he said, creates an incentive for buyers to wait until the final hours, a dynamic they may reassess in future offerings. Even so, the sale’s current trajectory compares unfavorably with recent market benchmarks. MegaETH’s public sale last month drew overwhelming demand by attracting over $1.39 billion in commitments despite seeking just $50 million. By contrast, Monad plans to raise approximately $187 million in USDC, with minimum and maximum bids set between 100 USDC and 100,000 USDC. Market analysts online speculated that the exclusion of European users, combined with questions over Monad’s tokenomics and previous fundraising rounds, may also be dampening investor enthusiasm. If the sale ends without full subscription before its Saturday close, Monad says any unsold tokens will be redirected to its ecosystem development fund. The offering is one of the first major tests of Coinbase’s newly built token-sales platform, which was launched after the company’s $375 million acquisition of Echo.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-19 13:30:00
54610922,629978,1763559033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54610922.jpeg,"Veteran Whales Blamed For Bitcoin’s Sharp Slide, Crypto Boss Says",https://bitcoinist.com/veteran-whales-blamed-for-bitcoins-sharp-slide-crypto-boss-says/,"It has been a tough week for the alpha dog of crypto and analysts aren’t so sure when the beating will stop. Bitcoin hovered a little over $90,000 on Wednesday while Ethereum traded around $3,041, showing sharp moves after a rough week. Over the past seven days, Bitcoin fell more than 12% and Ethereum dropped about 11%, according to market updates. Traders and analysts say the swings reflect both on-chain activity and wider macro pressure. Long-Term Holders Rotate According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, much of the recent price action reflects long-term holders moving coins between each other and into new hands. He said older Bitcoin holders have been selling into buyers from traditional finance, including spot ETF vehicles and corporate treasuries, which then hold the assets for a long period. Earlier this year he flagged heavy selling by OG whales when prices peaked, but he now points to fresh liquidity from different institutional sources that are changing how supply is absorbed. Some On-Chain Signals Point To Normal Correction On-chain metrics suggest the drop may be a mid-cycle correction rather than a full market reversal. Reports show short-term holders were panic selling and reducing exposure, while long-term holders performed routine profit-taking. Analysts note that newer buyers continued to add funds during the slide, but inflows were not large enough to offset the wave of selling from nervous short-term traders. Bitcoin’s pullback from highs near $126K is cited as part of this rebalancing. Based on reports , more than $1 trillion was wiped off the broader crypto market over six weeks, and the total market cap has fallen by a quarter since an early October high. Tracking more than 18,500 coins, CoinGecko data shows the sector’s value slid sharply, with Bitcoin down about 25% over that period to roughly $91,200 at one point. Trading flows have thinned, and many market participants say both retail and institutional conviction weakened as prices tumbled. Large Buyers See Discounts JAN3 CEO Samson Mow told reporters that some buyers are largely price-insensitive and can use dips to increase holdings. He named examples like Strategy and other firms with big treasury budgets, and he pointed to stablecoin issuers and high-revenue companies that can add to positions. At about $95k, Mow suggested Bitcoin may look like a near 20% “discount” for those buyers, making accumulation more attractive while supply remains limited. Caught Between Chain Signals And Macro Risk Meanwhile, analysts at Nansen and others say Bitcoin now behaves more like a macro asset, moving with liquidity, the dollar, and policy cues. Traders have also mentioned forced selling and tightened risk appetite after global events pushed sentiment lower in early October. Political backing increased under US President Donald Trump earlier this year, and Wall Street’s adoption via spot ETFs helped, but those supports have not prevented the recent pullback.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spots-xrp-bullish-divergence-heres-the-significance/,"Market participants tracking XRP price movements have been presented with a new technical viewpoint from crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto, who recently outlined a potential bullish divergence forming on the XRP chart. The analyst shared a four-hour chart of XRP paired with USDT, emphasizing the contrast between declining price lows and gradually rising lows on the Relative Strength Index. Traders often use this visual comparison to identify early signs of weakening downward momentum. The chart included a clearly marked descending trendline beneath the price and an ascending trendline beneath the RSI, indicating the gap between momentum and price action that characterizes this type of divergence. $XRP BULLISH DIVERGENCE! pic.twitter.com/uTyFBVuXzy — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 16, 2025 The chart spans activity across October and November, showing consistently lower lows on the price candles that continue to press against the lower support line. In contrast, RSI data shows the indicator making higher lows over the same time period, with the most recent RSI reading displayed at 38.72. This positioning keeps RSI below the midpoint but reflects the steady upward trajectory highlighted by the analyst. The visual example accompanying the chart provided additional context, showing how bullish divergence patterns typically develop when price and indicators move in opposite directions. Community Reactions to the Pattern Following the analyst’s post, a user identified as Alexandra Ulmer offered a skeptical response. She expressed uncertainty about the reliability of technical indicators when applied to XRP , referencing her own observations that the asset has historically behaved unpredictably. Her comment underscored the persistent debate within the community over how technical analysis should be weighed when assessing XRP’s short-term market direction. Despite differing perspectives among observers, the technical structure presented by Steph Is Crypto remained focused on the relationship between XRP’s price trajectory and its underlying momentum indicator. The analysis did not assign any targets or timeframes but instead limited its focus to the emerging divergence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For traders who follow RSI-based signals, the pattern often suggests potential stabilization or a shift in momentum when the price continues to decline while the indicator strengthens. The analyst’s chart also reflected that the price is hovering slightly above the support zone that has been held through multiple retests across recent weeks. Positioning Within Current Market Conditions The context for XRP includes a market environment with uneven sentiment and limited volatility, making any technical development more closely monitored by traders looking for early indications of movement. Some might interpret the divergence highlighted by Steph Is Crypto as a preliminary sign that selling pressure could be slowing, although this interpretation depends on individual trading frameworks. As with all technical patterns, the signal requires confirmation through price behavior, and the analyst’s post served primarily to showcase the developing conditions visible on the chart.

54610967,630780,1763559175,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54610967.jpeg,"Bitcoin Liquidity Turns, And Bitcoin Hyper Emerges As The Best Crypto To Buy Now",https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-bitcoin-liquidity-shifts/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin’s recent weakness stems from a structural dollar liquidity squeeze, but Fed repo support and an eventual TGA decline point to improving conditions A more targeted fiscal stimulus path could gradually restore risk appetite, supporting a broader recovery in crypto demand. Bitcoin Hyper plans to launch a fast, SVM-powered Bitcoin Layer-2 where payments, DeFi, NFTs, and memes can all settle back to $BTC. The $HYPER token presale has already raised over $28M to date, making it one of the best crypto to buy now. Bitcoin ($BTC) just spent weeks grinding lower while funding markets screamed ‘liquidity crunch’. Now the mechanics behind that squeeze are quietly shifting, and that matters a lot for anyone sitting on the sidelines wondering where the next leg of upside could come from. Dollar liquidity has been tight because the Treasury General Account (TGA) ballooned back toward the $1T mark , sucking cash out of markets at the same time banks’ reserve cushions shrank. Short-term funding rates even pushed above the Federal Reserve’s target range, forcing the Fed to restart overnight repo operations and inject around $30B in collateralized liquidity for the first time since 2019. That’s the dry macro version of why Bitcoin has struggled even as equities and big tech looked relatively resilient. Bitcoin is hypersensitive to liquidity: when reserves fall and TGA plus reverse-repo balances climb, risk assets get choked. When that direction flips, they tend to rip. Historically, phases where TGA drops and bank reserves rebuild have lined up with powerful rallies in both stocks and Bitcoin. If you’re a Bitcoin holder, one option you have in the meantime is to park your $BTC and wait for the next cycle. Another, more aggressive play is to position slightly further out on the risk curve in infrastructure that amplifies Bitcoin once liquidity comes back. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. It’s a Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) presale that’s already raised more than $28M, making it one of the best crypto to buy now . Bitcoin Hyper Turns Liquidity Tailwinds Into Real Bitcoin Utility If the last cycle was about Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ the next one is shaping up to be about what you can do with that collateral. Bitcoin Hyper is built exactly for that moment. At its core, the project is a true Bitcoin L2. When it launches, users will be able to bridge $BTC from its Layer-1 to a canonical bridge , where a Bitcoin relay program will verify block headers and transaction proofs. Once verified, equivalent $BTC is minted on the L2, where users can send, receive, and interact with Bitcoin at near-instant finality and low fees. Batched transactions plus zero-knowledge proofs are then committed back to Bitcoin’s base layer for settlement and security. Execution doesn’t happen on some fragile sidechain bolted together in a weekend. Bitcoin Hyper will lean on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , which translates into fast transactions and low fees. If dollar liquidity is indeed close to turning and capital starts flowing back into risk, the projects that let you use Bitcoin rather than just hold it are likely to attract outsized attention. Bitcoin Hyper fits neatly into that thesis: Bitcoin remains the reserve asset; Hyper becomes the high-speed execution engine on top. Want a full lowdown on the project? Be sure to check out our complete Bitcoin Hyper review . Bitcoin Hyper Presale Lines Up For The Next Cycle Macro conditions are still messy: growth is soft, sector data is patchy, and there’s real fiscal strain under the surface. That’s precisely why it’s notable that the Bitcoin Hyper presale has already cleared $28M, with tokens currently at $0.013295, and staking yields at 41% APY. Capital is clearly willing to back Bitcoin infrastructure even while spot $BTC chops around. From an incentive angle, the model is straightforward. $HYPER is the native token used for gas, staking, and governance on the network. As a token holder, you’ll also enjoy access to exclusive features on the platform when it launches. On the upside math, our $HYPER price prediction sees the token reaching a high of $0.20 by the end of 2026. This is good news if you prefer to HODL rather than cash out early. Learn how to get your share of $HYPER tokens in our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide . Where this ties back to liquidity is simple. When TGA eventually rolls over and the Fed’s repo support morphs into a sustained easing in funding stress, dollar liquidity should improve. Historically, that has pushed investors out along the risk curve, first into Bitcoin, then into higher-beta sectors like the best meme coins , DeFi, and infrastructure. Bitcoin Hyper sits at the intersection of all three: a meme-flavored, DeFi-enabled Layer-2 riding on Bitcoin’s brand. If you’re looking for exposure that can benefit disproportionately from a shift in liquidity while still being anchored to the Bitcoin narrative, the structure of this presale and its early traction make $HYPER hard to ignore. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. Disclaimer: This article is informational only, not financial advice.

Bitcoin Holds Above $90,000: Whales Continue Accumulating as Retail Sales Rise The current market structure is becoming increasingly vulnerable due to increased selling pressure from retail investors, high outflows from ETFs, and the strengthening of bearish hedge positions. Analysts emphasize the unbalanced flow of funds in the market. While short-term investors and some large Wall Street-based funds are seen selling, long-term investors, also known as “whales,” continue to quietly accumulate. This suggests two opposing trends in market psychology. BRN Research Director notes that Bitcoin is at a “crossroads.” While large investors are steadily increasing their positions, retail investors and short-term buyers are being hit by sharp price declines. While approximately 31,800 Bitcoins were reportedly transferred to exchanges at a loss recently, the number of wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC increased by 2.2 percent. This rate represents the highest growth rate in four months. Analysts believe this divergence will play a crucial role in determining the market's direction through the end of the year. Bitcoin's ability to maintain the $90,000 support will depend on whether the selling pressure can be offset. *This is not investment advice.

The market is approaching an area where long-term buyers historically begin accumulating, yet momentum remains decisively bearish in the short term. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart BTC has extended its decline into the $90K–$92K demand block, completing a full sweep of the October liquidity pocket. The asset is currently interacting with the lower half of a multi-week Fair Value Gap, where previous macro re-accumulation phases have formed. Both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages continue to slope downward above the price, confirming that buyers remain under pressure. The most recent breakdown below $96K produced no meaningful reaction, suggesting that momentum is still with the sellers for now. What is becoming more notable, however, is the growing separation between the price and its mean trend. The RSI has reached deeply oversold historical levels, matching the conditions seen during the mid-cycle retracements of April and August. If buyers manage to defend the $89K–$92K band, this zone could form the base of a multi-week consolidation, potentially marking a higher-timeframe accumulation zone before the next structural reversal. Confirmation of strength would only come if the market reclaims the $98K–$100K region. Failure to do so keeps the door open toward the lower demand zone near $85K. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, the asset continues to move within a bearish formation, with each lower high forming closer to the support boundary. This compression often appears in the later stages of a downtrend. Bitcoin is testing the $90K–$92K support box for the second time, and the reactions remain weak. A clean bullish reversal above $96K would indicate a shift in short-term momentum, allowing a corrective rally toward the unfilled inefficiency at $102K. If sellers maintain control, a deeper sweep of the $88K liquidity layer becomes likely. The structure remains vulnerable, but the clustering of lows within this region suggests that buy orders may be absorbing supply quietly, a common feature of early accumulation phases, even if the price volatility persists. On-chain Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin is entering one of the most intense short-term capitulation phases of this cycle. The Short-Term Holder SOPR has dropped sharply toward 0.97, confirming that short-term holders are now realizing losses on a persistent basis. SOPR has remained below the critical 1.0 threshold for several weeks, forming a clear capitulation band. Historically, such periods represent fear-driven liquidations rather than informed long-term distribution. This behavior tends to emerge not at the beginning of corrections but near their later stages, when weak hands are flushed out and stronger holders begin absorbing supply. While this does not guarantee an immediate reversal, it reflects an important structural shift. The ongoing loss-taking by short-term investors resets cost bases and clears out speculative positioning, allowing the market to transition toward a healthier foundation for the next macro move. If price stabilizes above the $89K–$92K zone while SOPR remains suppressed but begins curling upward, it would indicate that capitulation has reached exhaustion and that accumulation is underway. A sustained breakdown of this zone, however, would open the path toward a deeper sentiment reset before recovery can develop.

Their Bitcoin ETF holdings exploded to $518 million in Q3 – that’s more than triple their previous investment. This stunning development shows how major institutional players are embracing digital assets. Why Is This Bitcoin ETF Move So Significant? When a sovereign wealth fund triples its position in a Bitcoin ETF, it sends powerful signals across global markets. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council manages one of the world’s largest investment portfolios. Their growing confidence in BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF demonstrates institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. This isn’t just about numbers. It represents a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Sovereign funds typically pursue conservative, long-term strategies. Their embrace of Bitcoin ETF products suggests they see substantial potential in cryptocurrency markets. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETF Adoption? The rapid scaling from previous quarters reveals several key insights: Institutional investors are accelerating their Bitcoin ETF allocations Sovereign wealth funds see long-term value in cryptocurrency exposure Traditional finance increasingly trusts regulated Bitcoin ETF products Middle Eastern investors are leading in digital asset adoption This Bitcoin ETF investment comes at a crucial time for cryptocurrency markets. Many institutions have been cautiously exploring digital assets. The UAE’s bold move could encourage other sovereign funds to follow suit. How Are Other Institutions Responding? The Abu Dhabi Investment Council isn’t alone in recognizing Bitcoin ETF potential. Major financial institutions worldwide are increasing their cryptocurrency exposure. However, the scale and speed of this particular Bitcoin ETF investment stands out remarkably. Other sovereign funds are likely watching this development closely. The successful integration of Bitcoin ETF products into traditional portfolios could pave the way for broader institutional adoption. This creates a positive feedback loop that benefits the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. What Challenges Remain for Bitcoin ETF Investments? Despite growing acceptance, institutions still face several considerations: Regulatory frameworks continue evolving across jurisdictions Market volatility requires sophisticated risk management Long-term performance data remains limited for Bitcoin ETF products Integration with traditional portfolio strategies needs refinement However, the substantial Bitcoin ETF commitment from the UAE suggests these challenges are manageable. Their due diligence process likely involved extensive analysis before tripling their position. What’s Next for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The $518 million Bitcoin ETF investment represents just the beginning. As more institutions witness successful deployments, we can expect similar moves from other sovereign funds and pension funds. The Bitcoin ETF structure provides a familiar, regulated pathway into cryptocurrency markets. This development could accelerate mainstream financial integration. The barriers between traditional finance and digital assets continue crumbling. The UAE’s decisive action demonstrates that sophisticated investors recognize cryptocurrency’s potential role in diversified portfolios. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Digital Assets The Abu Dhabi Investment Council’s Bitcoin ETF expansion marks a pivotal moment in financial history. When sovereign funds make moves this substantial, the entire investment world takes notice. This isn’t speculative gambling – it’s calculated, institutional-scale positioning in the future of finance. The tripling of their Bitcoin ETF holdings to $518 million validates cryptocurrency’s growing importance. It signals to other institutions that digital assets deserve serious consideration. The message is clear: Bitcoin and regulated Bitcoin ETF products have arrived as legitimate investment vehicles. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin ETF? A Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks Bitcoin’s price, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly holding cryptocurrency. Why are sovereign funds investing in Bitcoin ETFs? Sovereign funds seek diversification and potential returns. Bitcoin ETFs offer regulated exposure to cryptocurrency’s growth potential. How significant is a $518 million Bitcoin ETF investment? It’s highly significant because sovereign funds typically make conservative moves. This size indicates strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s price?

Price action on both USDT and BTC pairs suggests that Ripple’s token is at a critical decision point. While sellers remain active, the downside appears limited unless broader market weakness resumes. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair XRPUSDT is still trading inside the descending channel pattern marked on the daily chart. The asset has now reached the lower boundary of the wedge while also testing the key $2.10–$2.20 support zone. This region has acted as a demand earlier in recent months. Yet, a breakdown could prove to be devastating for investors, as it can rapidly drag the price down toward the $1.80 zone. The overall trend also remains bearish under the 200-day and 100-day moving averages, with both converging around the $2.60 mark. So, for any sustained bullish recovery, XRP must first reclaim the $2.60 area and break above the key moving averages. Until then, the risk remains skewed to the downside. The BTC Pair The XRPBTC pair is pushing into the key 2,400 SAT resistance zone, which also aligns with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. So far, buyers have struggled to go past this area. Momentum also remains neutral, with RSI hovering around 52, and the price action suggests that a rejection is likely if BTC dominance picks up again. If XRP manages to break and close above the 2,400 SAT supply zone, the next potential upside target sits near the 3,000 SAT mark. However, failure to break above the current area could lead to another visit to the 2,000 SAT support band in the coming weeks.

Altcoins just reminded everyone it’s not dead yet. While the wider market has been busy bleeding, Aster ($ASTER) ripped 26% higher in 24 hours , breaking out of a months-long consolidation and putting a potential march to a $10B market cap on the table. The thesis from high-conviction analysts is simple: usage of Aster’s DEX is surging, buybacks and burns are tightening circulating supply, and the chart just completed a rounded-bottom breakout. If that supply shock story plays out and the market cap really does press toward $10B, price projections cluster around the $4 region from today’s roughly $2 zone. Technically, the key battleground sits higher up the chart, but one level matters on the downside: $1.13. That’s where the last big wave of buyers stepped in. A pullback toward that zone would hurt some late entries but wouldn’t invalidate the larger bullish structure; it would just slow the move and force another reset before any attack on new highs. All of this is happening against a grim backdrop where $BTC and other majors have slid hard from recent highs, dragging total crypto market cap down to $3.09T and souring sentiment. Aster’s strength shows capital is still willing to chase compelling narratives and real fee generation, even in a choppy environment. That’s exactly the kind of mood where speculative capital also starts hunting for earlier-stage plays that could be the next 1000x crypto . One of the loudest contenders in that lane right now: Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a meme presale surfing the same risk-on pockets Aster just lit up. Aster’s Supply Shock Story Sets The Stage For Maxi Doge Aster’s breakout is built on a textbook mix of fundamentals and narrative. The DEX is throwing off millions in daily revenue, funneling that into buybacks and burns that steadily reduce float while usage keeps climbing. The result is a clean series of higher lows, a tightening triangle, and then a decisive pop as demand finally overwhelms available supply. That kind of move does two things for the rest of the market. First, it proves traders are still willing to pay up for tokens linked to real on-chain activity, even while macro headwinds weigh on $BTC. Second, it reminds everyone how violently a name can reprice once accumulation is done quietly and the chart finally flips from ‘ignored’ to ‘in play.’ Maxi Doge is angling for a similar dynamic, just much earlier in the curve. Instead of a DEX revenue machine, $MAXI leans into high-beta meme branding and a clear use case around leveraged trading. The project positions itself as a ‘giga-Chad’ Doge for degens, with plans to tie into futures platforms that could eventually let holders trade with up to 1000x leverage, plus trading leaderboards and gamified events for active users. Under the hood, the token runs on Ethereum with a fixed 150.24B supply, audited smart contracts, and no ability for the team to mint new tokens, blacklist wallets, or add arbitrary fees. That’s important in a meme market still haunted by rug pulls and stealth inflation. Roughly 40% of supply is reserved for marketing, with dedicated allocations for liquidity, development, and staking, designed to keep the ecosystem funded without handing insiders cheap tokens. In other words, if Aster is showing how a strong product plus transparent tokenomics can still rip in a tired market, Maxi Doge is trying to preload those same ingredients into a meme format with far more upside volatility. Maxi Doge Presale Aims For High-Beta Upside In 2025–2026 On the numbers side, the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale has already pulled in more than $4M, helped by aggressive branding and growing coverage across trading communities. Tokens are currently offered at $0.000269, giving the project a relatively low implied valuation versus the kind of targets meme-coin traders like to throw around. One of the big hooks is staking that’s live during presale. The structure is simple: lock $MAXI, earn more $MAXI, with rewards funded from a 5% staking allocation and distributed over time. That encourages holders to sit tight instead of flipping immediately at TGE. Looking further out, our Maxi Doge price prediction puts an initial upside band that’s punchy without being ridiculous. Fresh analysis suggests $MAXI could trade as high as $0.0058 in 2026 if the broader cycle cooperates and key CEX listings land. Relative to today’s $0.000269 presale level, a 2026 high of $0.0058 would represent around 20x. Those are big numbers, but still well below the 100x memes floating around social media, which keeps the projections at least loosely connected to similar past cycles in the meme sector. To learn more, check out our guide on how to buy $MAXI. The roadmap is built around that thesis. Once the presale wraps, liquidity will be pushed to DEX listings, followed by attempts to secure CEX exposure and roll out trading games, contests, and futures integrations. Combine that with a fully-audited, non-mintable contract and no private-sale overhang, and the pitch is clear: a meme coin trying to behave structurally like a ‘real’ alt while still giving holders a shot at outsized moves if the leverage narrative catches fire. In a market where Aster is proving that strong stories still get paid, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as one of the more interesting high-octane bets on that same risk-on rotation.

Counterpoint research has revealed that the shift could double global server memory prices by the end of 2026. According to the research, Nvidia shifted from DDR5 server memory to LPDDR, a low-power-consuming chip commonly used in mobile devices. The shift forms as part of Nvidia’s efforts to reduce power consumption in AI servers, which have been considered energy-intensive in modern data centers. Although the new architecture adopted by Nvidia will reduce operational costs, some analysts have argued that it’s creating intensive pressure across the memory supply chain . DRAM prices surge 171% as Samsung and Micron prioritize HBM for AI So far, memory manufacturers have shifted most of their focus towards high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is primarily used in advanced AI accelerators, resulting in a reduction in DRAM memory production. DRAM is widely used in consumer computing to automotive electronics, according to Counterpoint research , which has caused a widespread shortage across multiple sectors. Major manufacturers for memory parts, such as Samsung Electronics , SK Hynix, and Micron, acknowledged the reduction in output of lower-end DRAM memory capacity, with much of their focus directed to HBM. The shortage has triggered a surge in DRAM prices, which recorded a 171.8% year-over-year increase in the third quarter. Retail prices for DDR5 components for PCs have also doubled in a short period, following the diversion of supply chain attention toward AI data center customers. According to Counterpoint Research, Nvidia’s shift of its memory architecture introduced a new layer of pressure. For instance, LPDDR, which is commonly used in smartphones, is now being produced in large volumes to meet the demand for AI servers, placing Nvidia among the most prominent firms by market capitalization. The research warned that reclassifying LPDDR as a core component for AI data centers is an upheaval that the supply chain cannot easily adapt to. The research published by Counterpoint revealed that the shift has created a dilemma across the semiconductor industry, with chipmakers struggling to decide whether to focus their attention on manufacturing more capacity of LPDDR, which may exacerbate the shortage in other sectors, or prioritize HBM production to meet the demand for AI accelerators. Both decisions pose a risk to the global memory markets as revealed by the research. DRAM and LPDDR shortages threaten cloud infrastructure costs increase Based on the research, an increase in LPDDR demand is expected to trigger a doubling of server memory prices by late 2026. The study noted that cloud providers, AI developers, and hyperscalers would face the immediate impact, yet they are already struggling with rising costs tied to GPU and power infrastructure upgrades. Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung have already invested in high-bandwidth and advanced DRAM production capabilities. Shifting towards LPDDR means that new fabricators will be required, which the study noted are capital-intensive and require multi-year development cycles. Notably, the sector underinvested during the post-2023 memory downturn, leaving the semiconductor sector with limited capacity to handle the sudden AI-driven demand. So far, Nvidia stock has surged to higher highs, increasing approximately 35% year to date, following a shift in AI spending in 2025. The stock price is currently up 23% in 2025, trading at $181, with a year-to-date range of $86.63 to $212.19. The current price marks a brief drawdown after the asset’s price doubled since the beginning of the year. The company’s market capitalization is currently $4.4 trillion, placing it among the most prominent firms globally by market cap, surpassing Microsoft and Google. ADATA also forecasts that DRAM prices will continue to increase, extending into late 2026 with a persistent shortage across the consumer, enterprise, and industrial segments. Nvidia is expected to release its earnings today.

Through PESL — Kraken’s MiCA-regulated European entity — institutions across the EEA can now safeguard their assets with a custody solution designed for compliance, transparency and operational assurance. This milestone extends Kraken’s institutional footprint, pairing MiCA oversight in Europe with the existing U.S. framework operated through Kraken Financial , creating a unified global custody network. Regulated protection under MiCA PESL’s authorization by the Central Bank of Ireland brings the rigor of traditional financial supervision to digital assets. Under MiCA, clients benefit from: Segregated custody: Client assets are fully segregated from PESL’s and Kraken exchange’s assets Independent audits and transparent reserves: Assets are supported by independent collateral verification and robust reporting MiCA-compliant governance: Oversight aligned with the EU’s highest regulatory standards The result is a custody environment that delivers both institutional security and regulatory clarity across the EEA. Seamless integration across jurisdictions Kraken’s custody network now provides clients with true jurisdictional flexibility . Institutions based in the EEA can onboard through PESL under MiCA while clients in the U.S. continue to access custody through Kraken Financial — both built on a unified technical and operational architecture. This shared foundation ensures: Consistent reporting and security standards A harmonized client experience Cross-jurisdictional coordination for global portfolios Operational assurance institutions can trust Kraken Custody combines institutional-grade security with the transparency and speed of blockchain technology. PESL’s framework applies the same principles that guide Kraken Financial — including secure cold storage, rigorous key management and independent audits — to ensure operational maturity across every layer of the custody stack. This alignment enables institutions to confidently custody digital assets under a regulated, resilient and independently verified structure purpose-built for fiduciaries, funds and corporate treasuries. Strengthening Kraken’s global custody network With the addition of PESL in Ireland, Kraken now offers regulated digital asset custody under two major regimes — MiCA in Europe and state and federal oversight in the U.S. This expansion reflects Kraken’s long-standing commitment to operating transparently and compliantly across global markets, empowering institutions to engage in the digital asset ecosystem with confidence.

But this time, the opportunity is no longer for a select few Moon Hash is using a combination of “tidal new energy + mainstream crypto mining” to transform a field previously reserved for professional players into an entry point easily accessible to ordinary people. This isn’t just a slogan; it’s a new path that has been completely reshaped in terms of entry difficulty, cost pressure, and risk transparency. Tidal Energy Mining: More Stable, More Environmentally Friendly, and Cheaper Than Traditional Mining. Traditional mining machines rely on electricity, and electricity costs are precisely the cost that American retail investors fear most. Moon Hash uses clean tidal energy – the natural kinetic energy brought by ocean waves, almost uninterrupted throughout the year. Let’s use an analogy to understand: Traditional mining: like driving a gasoline car to profit from price differences—high costs and high volatility. Moon Hash’s energy model: like using a free solar/tidal power car—you just “get on,” and the energy comes automatically. Because of the low energy cost, mining profits can truly return to the participants, instead of being eaten up by mining farms. Why is Moon Hash particularly suitable for American beginners? Because it directly addresses the four major pain points of American crypto beginners: Pain Point 1: Lack of understanding of crypto concepts—Moon Hash directly helps you digest them. The platform demonstrates the mining principles of mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in the simplest way—like “automatic backup from a mobile cloud drive.” You activate the contract, and it runs automatically; you don’t need technical knowledge. Pain Point 2: Fear of being scammed → Platform provides a transparent risk framework Moon Hash explicitly states: Mining revenue fluctuates with the price of mainstream cryptocurrencies. Contract returns are not “guaranteed returns,” but rather the actual output of the market. The platform will not induce investments beyond your capabilities. This honesty and restraint actually makes users feel more at ease. Pain Point 3: Fear of high costs → It offers an extremely low barrier to entry experience New users receive a $15 “welcome bonus” upon registration. Even if you don’t invest a single penny, you can experience real tidal energy mining. Pain Point 4: Not knowing where to start → Providing a clear small-scale entry path Moon Hash offers a path that won’t harm your wallet: Register an account (receive $15 bonus) Use the bonus to experience an introductory mining contract, feel the yield curve, and then decide whether to increase your investment. Only invest according to your comfort level; a small amount allows you to participate in the trend. This path allows most beginners to truly “understand how making money in crypto” for the first time. The opportunity is right in front of you: Tidal Energy x Mainstream Crypto Mining is the next wave of trends. You can think of Moon Hash as a way to participate in this trend: Mainstream cryptocurrencies are still in a long-term upward trend, green energy mining is becoming a policy-driven direction, and US retail investors are looking for low-cost, secure, and knowledge-free ways to participate in crypto. As a Moon Hash user shared: A California user said that he previously thought only “professional miners” could make money from crypto, but after trying Moon Hash with free registration rewards, the moment he saw his mining rewards jump in numbers for the first time, he realized that the barrier to entry wasn’t as high as he had imagined. This is the reversal brought about by “understanding the trend and daring to experience it.” Why is this an opportunity you’ll “regret missing”? Not because Moon Hash can make you “rich overnight.” But because: green energy mining is lower in cost than traditional models, mainstream cryptocurrencies are moving towards global consensus, the platform offers a near-zero-cost entry experience, and ordinary users can unusually gain a foothold in the underlying trend early on. Those who have profited from past trends all share one thing in common: They weren’t the smartest, but they were the first to be willing to try. Register now to experience it (free $15 bonus) Click to register (claim your $15 bonus now) Click to learn about the contract (see how tidal energy mining works) Not participating won’t hurt, but by participating, you’ll at least gain: A clearer understanding of the crypto world, a real experience of green energy mining, and the potential to become an early participant in the next wave of trends. The trend is already in motion, and Moon Hash is the entry point that allows ordinary people to easily “get on board.” Media Contact Official Website: https://moonhash.com Contact: info@moonhash.com Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

The flagship cryptocurrency is back in the red during the ongoing session, down nearly 2% at $91,368. The decline pushed the average spot Bitcoin ETF investor into collective losses for the first time since their launch. No US Bitcoin Reserve Until Other Countries Make The First Move: Mike Alfred Crypto entrepreneur Mike Alfred believes the US government will not begin accumulating for its strategic reserve until other nations make the first move. Alfred stated that the US government will start accumulating Bitcoin into its reserves when there is enough external pressure. “Once the US government recognizes that others are taking action before them, that’ll probably catalyze additional action in the future.” Alfred’s comments come as industry executives push the US government to step up Bitcoin accumulation to avoid its reserve size falling behind other nations. Alfred also expressed confidence that Bitcoin will be worth $1 million per coin by 2033. Alfred’s prediction is conservative compared to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who predict the flagship cryptocurrency will reach seven figures by 2030. “I think by the time that happens, almost every government will have some direct or indirect exposure to the asset, and it will be viewed as a common strategic reserve type of asset.” Michael Saylor Dismisses Concerns About Wall Street Hurting Bitcoin Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has dismissed concerns that Wall Street’s entry into the Bitcoin ecosystem impacted its price and volatility. Saylor added that he believes Bitcoin has become less volatile, stating, “I think we are getting a lot less volatility.” Saylor stated that when he began buying Bitcoin in 2020, the asset carried an annualized volatility of 80%, which is down to around 50% currently. Strategy holds 649,870 Bitcoin, worth $59.59 billion at current prices. However, the company’s Net Asset Value (NAV) has fallen to 1.11X, down from 1.52X when Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached its all-time high. Saylor added that he is not too concerned about a major downturn, stating, “The company is engineered to take an 80 to 90% drawdown and keep on ticking. So I think we’re pretty indestructible. Our leverage is in the know, the level of the 10 to 15% going toward zero right now, which is extremely robust.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) pullback has pushed the average spot Bitcoin ETF investor into the red for the first time since the investment vehicles launched. The flow-weighted cost basis across the ETFs is at $89,600, a level that BTC fell below on Tuesday, pushing investors into the red. However, early buyers, particularly those who entered the market when BTC was between $40,000 and $70,000, remain in profit. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, stated, “Even with the average ETF cost basis above spot, most ETF holders are long-term allocators, so being underwater doesn’t trigger quick exits. In this risk-off environment, liquidity and macro remain the key drivers. Tight conditions can turn losses into downside pressure, while clear easing signals lift anchors.” BTC continues to face pressure around $92,000, with the $90,000 level being tested repeatedly. Analysts believe BTC and the broader crypto market could remain under pressure ahead of the upcoming US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on December 10. Experts are divided about the direction of monetary policy, with concerns around inflation and a slowing economy persisting. Experts are also divided between a 0,25% rate cut or leaving them unchanged at 4%. More fiscally conservative Federal Reserve members argue that President Trump’s changing stance on tariffs has added inflationary pressure, reducing room to cut rates and support growth. The US job market is also showing signs of cooling. Federal Reserve members have consistently flagged concerns about inflation. BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising over 2% and settling at $104,694. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, rising 1.23% to cross $105,000 and settle at $105,979. BTC reached an intraday high of $107,482 on Tuesday. However, it lost momentum as bear market conditions set in. As a result, it fell nearly 3% and settled at $103,009. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.33% to $101,639. BTC faced substantial selling pressure and volatility on Thursday. As a result, it slipped below the crucial $100,000 mark, falling to a low of $97,870 before settling at $99,614. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price plunged over 5%, falling to a low of $93,951 before settling at $94,503. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Saturday, rising 1.10% to reclaim $95,000 and settling at $95,544. Selling pressure returned on Sunday as BTC fell to a low of $92,943 before settling at $94,183, ultimately dropping 1.42%. Bearish sentiment persisted on Monday as the price fell by over 2% and settled at $92,100. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC slipped below $90,000, falling to an intraday low of 89,183. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $90,000 and settle at $92,914, ultimately rising nearly 1%. BTC is down almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $91,408.

As highlighted by X Finance Bull, Ripple is not just chasing retail adoption. Its ambition is structural. By positioning XRP to tap into the debt and credit markets, Ripple aims to become the settlement layer for massive traditional finance flows. Institutional Infrastructure: Building the Rails Ripple is building the foundational infrastructure that institutions require. Its $1.25 billion acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road strengthens its post-trade, clearing, and settlement capabilities. Hidden Road plans to migrate its operations onto the XRP Ledger, pushing settlement onto the blockchain. This gives Ripple direct access to the world of custody, financing, and securities lending. “ $XRP will never go mainstream! ” That’s what they told you! Until David Schwartz got on stage and showed you the real target: The $130 TRILLION global credit market. This isn’t some weekend pump project. It’s a full-scale infrastructure upgrade backed by acquisitions in… https://t.co/c3YyoFsLfQ pic.twitter.com/aRu4LX5hNY — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) November 17, 2025 Regulatory Momentum Canary Capital’s XRPC spot XRP ETF is officially trading . Nasdaq certified its listing on November 12, 2025, making it the first U.S.-listed single-token XRP ETF. The ETF launched on November 13 and had an impressive start, with its first 30 minutes of trading being astonishing and its overall first-day volume breaking records. A few days later, Franklin Templeton followed with its own XRP ETF . Their fund, under ticker EZRP, launched on November 18, 2025. This move comes after Franklin Templeton updated its S‑1 filing, removing the delaying “8(a)” clause—an adjustment that cleared the way for auto‑activation. Franklin’s ETF also appears on the DTCC’s active funds list , under the name “Franklin XRP Trust (XRPZ),” signaling that it’s fully set up for institutional clearing and settlement. These launches collectively represent a significant regulatory milestone for XRP. With major issuers now offering spot ETFs, the digital asset has crossed a critical threshold toward mainstream, regulated access. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Scaling Cross-Border Finance By linking custody, broker operations, and tokenization, Ripple is laying the rails for seamless, institution-grade settlement. XRP could finally serve as the bridge between traditional credit instruments and blockchain-native finance. This goes well beyond weekend pump strategies—it’s deep integration. Why the Timing Matters This strategy unfolds at a moment of regulatory clarity. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has introduced new rules that simplify the listing of spot crypto ETFs, including XRP. That regulatory tailwind could accelerate adoption and push XRP deeper into the infrastructure of institutional finance. In conclusion, Skeptics may argue that XRP lacks retail buzz. But Ripple’s long game is not about viral demand—it’s about structural relevance. As Schwartz hinted on stage, this is not speculation. It’s infrastructure. And if all the pieces fall into place, the critics will realize they underestimated XRP by a wide margin. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A few days ago, they outlined the launch of new upgrades and now posted a video that explains how users (known as Pioneers) can take full advantage. How to Maximize User Experience CryptoPotato reported during the weekend the new updates posted by the team, which were primarily focused on the Pi App Studio. These new functions made it a hybrid low-code platform, allowing users to export their projects, refine the code externally, and then re-upload the modified version back to the Pi App Studio for further editing and deployment. The explanation video posted by the team shows what Pioneers need to do. After opening the Pi App Studio (and being logged in to their respective accounts), they need to go to the Settings menu (under Customize App With Pi AI) and click on the “Download App Code” button. Once the code is downloaded, users can make all the changes they want locally on their own device. Upon completing the alterations, they can re-upload it using the “Upload App Code” button situated right below the “Download App Code.” The app will still be compatible and integrated with the broader Pi ecosystem. The changes will be visible in the account after the page is refreshed. Even after downloading and re-uploading the app once, users can repeat the process over and over again. They can also directly deploy it or revise it within the Pi App Studio without restrictions. Lastly, the team doubled down on their AI involvement by asserting that Pioneers can utilize the technology to enhance their user experience within the Pi ecosystem. PI Token Update In times when BTC and many larger-cap altcoins, such as ETH, XRP, and SOL, are down by double digits weekly, Pi Network’s native token has defied the trend with a minor 3% increase since this time last Wednesday. On a daily scale, the asset is up by over 4% and trades close to $0.235 as of press time. What might be considered a worrisome sign is the growing number of PI tokens to be unlocked in the next month. Aside from a more modest 4 million coins scheduled to be released today, the next 30 days will see an average of almost 5.5 million, which could increase the immediate selling pressure and halt the underlying asset’s recent progress.

The company targets owning 5% of all ETH supply, requiring an additional 6 million ETH through a $24.5 billion equity program. BMNR trades at a discount to its NAV despite rapid ETH-per-share growth, reflecting market concerns about ongoing dilution and execution risk. Macro volatility, thin liquidity, and extreme fear readings have amplified crypto price swings, creating speculative accumulation opportunities for high-beta assets like BMNR. Institutional backing from Galaxy Digital, Pantera, Founders Fund, and ARK supports BMNR’s thesis, but its success depends on Ethereum dominance and tokenization adoption. Investment Thesis BitMine Immersion Technologies’ ( BMNR ) investment thesis rests on an audacious tightrope of continuously raising equity with the sole intention of obtaining the hard-pressed yet ambitious goal of 5% of the Ethereum supply . Currently sitting on this tightrope with its balance sheet boasting a whopping 3.6 million ETH, BitMine stands out not only as an Ethereum-proxy company but as an investment vehicle on the Ethereum agenda. Nevertheless, its tale extends well beyond that. As ETH/BTC marginally increases with Ethereum’s prevalence as the blockchain of choice for the tokenization of various assets and virtual financial transactions, BitMine finds itself on the same pedestal that MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) occupied on Bitcoin’s pedestal, the only form of significant growth that Bitcoin currently receives. While dilution risk looms, opportunistic investors can view sharp pullbacks as speculative entry points, betting on ETH upside and BMNR's ability to convert narrative momentum into shareholder value. Ideal for crypto-aligned portfolios seeking asymmetric return potential. BMNR Nov Pres Why Crypto’s Next Move Hinges on Fragile Liquidity and Mixed Macro Signals Looking at the macro environment that precedes the beginning of the new year of 2026, it’s a bit of a mixed bag in the world of cryptocurrency. On the positive side of things, the Fed has halted its rate hikes on interest rates with the expectation that more favorable conditions may come about. However, the fact that inflation still exists causes the markets to tread carefully. On the other hand, the markets just recently experienced the effects of forceful selling within the world of cryptocurrency that left its markets highly vulnerable to disruption. Market makers have pulled back significantly due to this fact. This makes the markets behave more erratically than expected due to the lack of liquidity. This implies that even small trading activity could cause the markets to move more than usual. This could indeed result in sharp rallies based on the effects of positive news events that could happen. But it also means downside moves can get exaggerated quickly. BitMine’s $24B Ethereum Gambit Chases MicroStrategy Glory What started out as a mining corporation today serves the purpose of an ETH holding company. BitMine owns a total of 3.56 million ETH , 192 BTC, and $607 million of funds. The stated mission of the company is the attainment of the so-called “Alchemy of 5%” with the ETH supply. This corresponds with around 6 million ETH purchases with an extra price tag of around $7-8 billion. This isn’t just a hypothetical mission, the company’s filings talk about the valuation of the equity issuance program at the price of $24.5 billion. This is the point of practical application. The share base has grown exponentially with the increments of ETH share price at the grace of dilution. The company’s latest NAV filings don’t even reflect the share price of NAV. But there’s a precedent with the model too. MicroStrategy took on the role of the Bitcoin proxy through its leverage of debt and equity. They currently hold 650,000 BTC and operate very close to their Money NAV. BitMine wants the same with ETH. What’s different? Execution. MicroStrategy had a cash-flowing business with software. BitMine is mining out of its past with its speculation on ETH’s future. All action on the price climb. The Tom Lee Variable: Catalyst or Risk of Story? As the Chairman of BitMine, Tom Lee’s role cannot only be considered strategic but more so ideological. Lee expects ETH at the price of $7,000 at the end of the year and anticipates the top of the market occurring within the next 12-36 months. That will give BitMine sufficient time to accumulate capital. His reputation comes with the group of fans of the bullish predictions of Fundstrat. However, this could prove counterproductive should the ETH price fail. But I must say Lee’s got company. BitMine’s investors include Galaxy Digital, Kraken , Pantera, Founders’ Fund, and ARK’s Cathie Wood. But with this sort of highly correlated stock instrument, the effects of sentiment flip-flop can be brutal. BMNR’s currently down about 50% from the October highs. Lack of NAV disclosure and the enormous share issuance program give bears more than an initiation point. Data by YCharts Nevertheless, the bullish argument rests on cognitive biases as well. Should ETH experience a reflexive move owing to various tokenization-related positives along with rate cuts and macro trends of risk-on shifts, BitMine’s potential seems greatly multiplied. But the question arises whether investors could get diluted prior to the rewards. Lastly, Crypto sentiment has turned to Extreme Fear, with the CMC Fear and Greed Index plunging to 15 , the lowest reading of the year. This level, last seen in March 2025, reflects a sharp deterioration in investor confidence, likely exacerbated by recent liquidity collapses and October’s marketwide deleveraging. Historically, such sentiment troughs have preceded strong rebounds, making the current environment a potential accumulation zone for high-beta assets like BMNR, especially for investors who believe ETH fundamentals remain intact despite macro-driven volatility. CMC Fear and Greed Index NAV, Premium Volatility: Decoding the Risk-Reward Exchange BitMine offers a slight discount relative to its own announced NAV of approximately 0.99x mNAV . This discount of nearly a quarter-off price marks the value of BitMine relative to MicroStrategy's 1.24x mNAV . And the reason this discount should persist? Because execution risk remains very high. To buy ETH with an inflow of new shareholders (via new share distribution), BitMine must issue more of its shares. And thus the paradox emerges because BitMine requires an expensive equity price to operate but its equity price trades at a discount because of fear of execution. Indeed, the dilution problem is genuine. However, BitMine on the medium term horizon (6-18 months) could prove an attractive but very volatile Ethereum call option. A new ETH price system that makes tokenization the new standard on Wall Street could cause BMNR’s price to take-off if the company starts staking and engaging with the Ethereum community. But investors must stay cautious. If the volatility persists or if there’s a shift in the Ethereum dominance due to the growing pace of cheaper Layer 1 blockchains, its structure becomes speculative if not strategically positioned beforehand. This investment cannot remain a buy-and-forget option. Takeaway BMNR is a speculation vehicle on Ethereum with institutional backing and the kind of token exposure that few possess. The company’s stock hasn’t yet bottomed out due to the NAV buffer that prevents the stock price from plummeting further, on the other hand, its strategy of investing only 5% of its capital in ETH could prove extremely lucrative if the macro trends turn favorable.",MSTR|BMNR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-19 14:07:57

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, 21Shares debuts this innovative fund with an impressive $100 million in initial assets under management. This substantial backing demonstrates strong institutional confidence in Solana’s long-term potential and the growing demand for regulated crypto investment products. The spot SOL ETF represents a game-changing opportunity for traditional investors who want exposure to Solana without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. This eliminates concerns about: Private key management and security risks Regulatory uncertainty surrounding direct crypto holdings Technical barriers to entry for mainstream investors Why Should Investors Care About This Spot SOL ETF?

Regulatory clarity offers peace of mind since the spot SOL ETF operates within established financial frameworks. Investors gain exposure to Solana’s price movements while benefiting from the protections and oversight that come with regulated financial products.

This level of institutional backing typically indicates thorough due diligence and strong conviction in the underlying asset’s potential. The spot SOL ETF structure also offers: Daily liquidity through major exchanges Transparent pricing and NAV calculations Professional custody and security measures What Challenges Might This Spot SOL ETF Face? Despite the enthusiasm surrounding this launch, investors should consider potential hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny remains intense in the cryptocurrency ETF space, though 21Shares has established itself as a trusted issuer with multiple successful crypto product launches. Market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies could impact short-term performance. However, the spot SOL ETF structure provides a regulated framework that may appeal to risk-averse investors who still want crypto exposure.

Announced on Wednesday, this latest launch is part of the company’s strategy to broaden access to Bittensor (TAO) exposure across Europe. The product is now available for trading in U.S. dollars on European trading platforms and through major online brokers. Safello's staked TAO ETP is now listed on SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich Europe now gets regulated access to Bittensor's $TAO via our physically backed, staked #ETP issued by @DDA_GmbH . Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP ( #STAO ) trades in $USD and reinvests staking rewards pic.twitter.com/1GoqItkYee — Safello (@SafelloAB) November 19, 2025 The ETP, formally named the Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP, is issued by DDA ETP AG under a partnership established earlier this year. Trading under the ticker STAO, the product carries a management fee of 1.49% and provides investors with a regulated, exchange-traded vehicle designed to mirror both the performance and staking yield of Bittensor’s TAO token. Fully Backed and Staked Structure Targets Total Return The new ETP offers 100% physical backing through staked TAO held within the structure. This enables investors to gain direct price exposure to the underlying asset while also capturing the staking rewards generated on-chain. After deducting service provider fees, these rewards are automatically reinvested into the ETP, boosting its net asset value over time. This design creates a total return instrument, combining the appreciation potential of TAO with the compounding effect of reinvested staking yields. The structure reflects a growing market preference for regulated, yield-generating crypto products that do not require investors to manage custody, staking mechanics or blockchain interactions themselves. Revenue Share Model Supports Safello’s Growth Strategy Safello said it will receive a revenue share based on the ETP’s assets under management (AUM), according to the company. While the long-term financial impact remains uncertain and will depend on market demand for TAO exposure, the listing represents a new revenue stream for Safello as it continues to diversify its product ecosystem. The collaboration with DDA ETP AG is in line with Safello’s broader goal of offering compliant crypto investment options across Europe. The company emphasized that the STAO launch supports its mission of making digital assets easier to access while maintaining regulatory clarity and investor protections. Digital Asset Products See $2B Outflows CoinShares reports digital asset investment products suffered their heaviest weekly outflows since February, with $2 billion exiting the market last week. The sell-off marked the third consecutive week of withdrawals, bringing total outflows over the period to $3.2 billion, according to a Monday report from CoinShares . The slump follows sharp price declines across major cryptocurrencies, which have pushed total assets under management in digital asset ETPs down 27% from their early-October peak of $264 billion to $191 billion.

On-chain metrics show signs of stress, with key support levels now in focus. Sentiment Slides Into Anxiety Long-term XRP holders are showing early signs of concern. Data from the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric shows a shift from euphoria to denial, now moving into anxiety. Analyst Ali Martinez said , “Anxiety is creeping in as $XRP flirts with a drop below $2.” The sentiment change comes as many holders see their gains erode. If the decline continues, the next stage on the NUPL curve is fear, followed by capitulation. Source: Ali Martinez/X Recent data shows that almost half of XRP’s supply is now held at a loss. This points to a market where late buyers face growing pressure. The token has also fallen into the oversold range, adding to short-term risk. In the event of a further drop, on-chain positioning shows two main levels below $2.15. Around $1.91, about 1.9 billion XRP were last moved. At $1.73, roughly 1.8 billion tokens changed hands. These price points represent areas where many holders first entered the market. Below $2.15, the next key $XRP levels are: • $1.91 • $1.73 pic.twitter.com/jZHPv3I9EW — Ali (@ali_charts) November 18, 2025 They may act as support if the price continues to fall, as traders could be unwilling to sell below their cost. However, a move under $1.73 would place XRP in a zone with less support, opening the door to more downside. Mixed Technical Views CryptoWZRD noted XRP closed bullish on the daily chart. The analyst said jumping above $2.28 could trigger a move toward $2.41. If the price fails to hold, the chart could shift into sideways action. EGRAG CRYPTO pointed to a bullish divergence on the 3-day chart, saying, “If it plays out… it could become your exit plan and the rest of the market will likely follow.” The divergence shows early strength, but it needs to be confirmed before any real move begins. Repeat Pattern Remains Active ChartNerd described a pattern that has repeated several times in XRP’s structure. The setup includes five downward waves, a test of descending resistance, and the price holding at $2.15 support. Each time this pattern formed, XRP broke resistance and moved higher. The current structure shows the same conditions developing. If support holds and resistance breaks again, the asset could aim for the $3 area. The pattern stays valid as long as XRP remains above $2.15. The post Is XRP Cracking?

The move followed a $513 million Bitcoin dump on Tuesday, which marked the fund’s largest single-day withdrawal since launch. BlackRock Coinbase Prime activity. Source: Arkham Intelligenc e While large-scale crypto deposits such as these often trigger market speculation about potential selling pressure, the current activity appears consistent with BlackRock’s standard liquidity and risk management practices. Bitcoin and Ethereum face short-term pressure The timing of the deposits coincides with broader market uncertainty. Indeed, Bitcoin and Ethereum both continue to face liquidity challenges, while sentiment is subdued ahead of key events, including U.S. employment data. Ethereum briefly slipped below the $3,000 level today following the news, already being weighed down by a combined $74 million in ETF withdrawals the day prior. Moreover, centralized exchange reserves have fallen by 700,000 ETH over the past month, the kind of supply compression that often precedes heightened volatility. However, crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader argues that the current accumulation trends indicate strong underlying demand for ETH, meaning the jitters are only a short-term effect. “Exchange reserves just lost 700,000 Ethereum in 30 days. This is the type of supply shock that never looks bullish… until the chart catches up. ETH is being accumulated aggressively,” wrote Merlijn on X.

During this decline, some investors made panic sales, while others saw it as a buying opportunity and accumulated. However, in the options market, investors aggressively added leverage despite the deep correction. Analysts at K33 Research, evaluating this situation, said that although the Bitcoin price fell to $89,000, risk appetite increased in the futures market and investors increased their leveraged positions at a record pace despite the decline. This situation was interpreted by analysts as a “dangerous trap” and structurally worrying. K33 Research Head Vetle Lunde stated in the report that perpetual futures investors increased their open positions by more than 36,000 BTC, the largest weekly growth since April 2023, while funding rates rose. At this point, Lunde likened these actions of option investors to “catching a falling knife” and warned that a harsh liquidation wave could occur if the expected rapid recovery does not come. Lunde also noted that CME futures premiums are trading near yearly lows and the maturity structure remains tight. This reflects the ongoing risk aversion among institutional participants, as opposed to individual investors. Lunde warned that this type of divergence has historically been a precursor to future negative price action. In this context, Lunde added that statistically, this worrying market structure mirrors seven similar situations in the last five years, six of which saw declines continue in the following month. How Much Lower Can Bitcoin Go? Lunde finally stated that the current decline is among the most severe 43-day declines since 2017, and emphasized that he does not expect a repeat of the major downturns in 2018 and 2022. However, if the current decline repeats the two deepest declines in the last two years, the Bitcoin price could fall to $84,000 to $86,000, potentially making a bottom in that range. However, if selling pressure continues, the decline could deepen further and could see a deeper drop towards the April lows, which is also the Strategy's average entry price of $74,433. *This is not investment advice.

In a follow-up submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force, the London-based firm pressed for clarity on two key issues, which are allowing dealers to settle trades directly on-chain without triggering customer protection rules and ensuring that liquidity providers on decentralized finance protocols are not forced to register as dealers. On-chain settlement without legacy infrastructure Wintermute’s primary concern centers on Rule 15c3-3, the so-called Customer Protection Rule, which was designed to prevent broker-dealers from misusing client assets. The firm says that when dealers settle tokenized securities directly on blockchain with counterparties who control their own digital wallets, they should qualify for an existing exemption that allows dealers to avoid maintaining special bank accounts for customer protection. “Imposing a bank, and legacy infrastructure, into a blockchain-based settlement cycle would completely undermine and eliminate the benefits and efficiencies of a dealer’s on-chain settlement process using its own wallet and key management software,” Wintermute wrote in its October submission to Commissioner Peirce and task force members. After its follow-up meeting with the SEC, Wintermute stated that the “Current rules were written for an era of multiple layers of intermediation. For blockchain settlement, those multiple layers aren’t needed and actually remove the efficiency benefits the technology provides.” “Regulated dealers should be empowered to develop their own clearance and settlement procedures for tokenized securities, without triggering rules applicable to broker-dealers that provide clearing services to customers. This would allow dealers to settle trades directly on-chain with counterparties, with tailored risk management standards,” the OTC platform wrote. The trader-dealer divide in DeFi markets Wintermute’s second request concerns the longstanding distinction between “dealers,” who must register with the SEC, and “traders,” who buy and sell solely for their own accounts. The firm wants confirmation that proprietary traders and liquidity providers on decentralized finance protocols should not be considered dealers simply because they provide liquidity to markets. Wintermute wrote on X that “Proprietary trading and liquidity provision on DeFi protocols should not trigger dealer registration.” If a firm trades only for its own account and doesn’t interact with customers, that activity fits the long-standing “trader exemption” it added. Wintermute’s advocacy in the crypto market The broker-dealer exemptions that Wintermute seeks could substantially lower the friction for on-chain settlement and reduce cost and operational drag. This could, in turn, increase institutional adoption of tokenized securities. However, such a shift raises important questions about investor protection and market integrity. Less intermediation means fewer layers safeguarding clients, and regulators will want assurances that on-chain mechanisms are robust. In September, Wintermute advocated that the SEC make clear that network tokens, such as Bitcoin and Ether, should not be treated as securities. It said that these tokens are better viewed as infrastructure, collectibles, or commodities, and that mislabeling them would stifle innovation and push trading outside the US market. How the SEC responds will be closely watched across the digital-asset industry, with Wintermute commending the regulator for its “continued openness to dialogue on how existing regulations can adapt to blockchain-based markets.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|Wintermute,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-19 15:51:50

The announcement was delivered by Jon Jones, Co-Founder and Chief Business Officer of Supra, during a session exploring the future of interoperability and next-generation Web3 infrastructure. This launch marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of dApp development, as Supra aims to offer EVM developers, in addition to MoveVM developers, a powerful new foundation to build, test, and deploy high-performance applications that can scale across ecosystems without compromising on security, composability, or liquidity. SolanaVM support is underway and is expected to be deployed early next year, making Supra the first L1 ever to support multiple virtual machines and execution environments from a variety of ecosystems. “We built MultiVM because we believe developers should never have to choose between innovation and access,” said Jones . “Supra aims to give teams the ability to write smart contracts in the languages of multiple virtual machines and deploy them into a fully parallelized environment, while also accessing native automation and cross-chain services, all within one unified infrastructure.” The Supra MultiVM architecture empowers dApp developers to write smart contracts in either Solidity or Move, with SolanaVM support underway, tapping into Supra’s native services such as their 600+ built-in Oracle price feeds, cross-chain communications, and automation capabilities. This eliminates long-standing constraints that have forced projects to remain locked into Ethereum-compatible environments, foregoing access to interoperate with applications from other growing ecosystems. By unifying these environments with shared blockspace and a converged execution model, Supra’s MultiVM is poised to redefine what is possible in the multi-chain era. Supra aims to become a decentralized global super computer, and their thesis is that any such infrastructure should be able to run programs from a variety of programming languages. A core component of their MultiVM design is SupraEVM, the network’s native EVM-compatible implementation. Built from the ground up with performance in mind, SupraEVM incorporates SupraBTM, a hybrid parallel execution engine capable of deterministic, conflict-aware scheduling. This enables significantly higher throughput and lower latency compared to all EVM chains in the industry, but without requiring developers to modify existing Solidity contracts. SupraBTM has recently been benchmarked as the fastest parallel EVM executor publicly tested to date. Independent analysis confirms that SupraBTM outperforms emerging EVM projects such as Monad in high-conflict DeFi workloads, while maintaining verifiable safety and deterministic finality. In a bold move to further validate this claim, Supra’s Co-Founder and CEO, Joshua Tobkin, launched a $1 million public bounty , offering a reward to any team capable of beating SupraBTM’s performance by 15% or more in open, reproducible benchmarks. “Too often, developers are forced to compromise between ecosystems. EVM devs feel the constraints of legacy performance, while Move developers remain isolated from the liquidity-rich Ethereum economy,” said Tobkin . “With MultiVM, Supra is collapsing the walls between ecosystems. Our vision is to provide a scalable foundation that allows applications to transcend technical silos and reach users wherever they are. With SupraBTM, we’re also proving that high performance and verifiability can coexist without tradeoffs.” MultiVM on a Supra Testnet: Now Open for Applications In a significant step to attract the best EVM talent to the Supra ecosystem, Supra has today opened applications for a considerable grant program. The program invites EVM developers seeking early access to the MultiVM Testnet environment, purpose-built to simulate mainnet conditions, to submit their best ideas and applications. Selected projects will have access to nearly all of Supra’s complete developer stack, including: Full MoveVM and EVM compatibility (no code changes required for Solidity contracts) Vertically integrated services such as native oracles, deterministic verifiable randomness (dVRF), and event-driven automation, all live or coming soon to the SupraEVM Unified RPC infrastructure supporting both Move and EVM environments Tooling compatibility with Hardhat, Foundry, and Supra’s native CLI/IDE Upcoming support for VM-to-VM communication and composable automation across environments The EVM grant program has been allocated $250,000 to the best talent on offer, and is designed to support innovative EVM-native projects deploying on Supra’s infrastructure. The program will fund up to 10 development teams, with each team eligible for up to $25,000 in milestone-based grants. Each selected project will work closely with the Supra developer relations team to define technical milestones, deploy contracts on MultiVM infrastructure, and prepare for eventual mainnet integration in early 2026. This initiative follows a wave of recent infrastructure developments from Supra, including the launch of the DevWire Hub, a new resource portal offering tutorials, CLI tools, RPC documentation, and weekly updates for developers building in Supra’s ecosystem. Supra’s MultiVM strategy also includes long-term support for additional VM integrations beyond EVM and Move, with SolanaVM currently in development. This approach reflects a broader vision of universal Web3 composability, where developers can launch applications once, then reach users on any network without friction or fragmentation. Accessing Supra’s MultiVM Infrastructure Developers building high-performance dApps in Solidity are now invited to apply for Supra’s MultiVM Testnet and associated grant program. The program offers early access to Supra’s next-generation infrastructure, engineering support, and funding for projects that demonstrate strong technical merit and alignment with Supra’s multi-chain vision. Interested development teams may apply directly via the official application portal .

The announcement was delivered by Jon Jones, Co-Founder and Chief Business Officer of Supra, during a session exploring the future of interoperability and next-generation Web3 infrastructure. This launch marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of dApp development, as Supra aims to offer EVM developers, in addition to MoveVM developers, a powerful new foundation to build, test, and deploy high-performance applications that can scale across ecosystems without compromising on security, composability, or liquidity. SolanaVM support is underway and is expected to be deployed early next year, making Supra the first L1 ever to support multiple virtual machines and execution environments from a variety of ecosystems. “We built MultiVM because we believe developers should never have to choose between innovation and access,” said Jones. “Supra aims to give teams the ability to write smart contracts in the languages of multiple virtual machines and deploy them into a fully parallelized environment, while also accessing native automation and cross-chain services, all within one unified infrastructure.” The Supra MultiVM architecture empowers dApp developers to write smart contracts in either Solidity or Move, with SolanaVM support underway, tapping into Supra’s native services such as their 600+ built-in Oracle price feeds, cross-chain communications, and automation capabilities. This eliminates long-standing constraints that have forced projects to remain locked into Ethereum-compatible environments, foregoing access to interoperate with applications from other growing ecosystems. By unifying these environments with shared blockspace and a converged execution model, Supra’s MultiVM is poised to redefine what is possible in the multi-chain era. Supra aims to become a decentralized global super computer, and their thesis is that any such infrastructure should be able to run programs from a variety of programming languages. A core component of their MultiVM design is SupraEVM, the network’s native EVM-compatible implementation. Built from the ground up with performance in mind, SupraEVM incorporates SupraBTM, a hybrid parallel execution engine capable of deterministic, conflict-aware scheduling. This enables significantly higher throughput and lower latency compared to all EVM chains in the industry, but without requiring developers to modify existing Solidity contracts. SupraBTM has recently been benchmarked as the fastest parallel EVM executor publicly tested to date. Independent analysis confirms that SupraBTM outperforms emerging EVM projects such as Monad in high-conflict DeFi workloads, while maintaining verifiable safety and deterministic finality. In a bold move to further validate this claim, Supra’s Co-Founder and CEO, Joshua Tobkin, launched a $1 million public bounty , offering a reward to any team capable of beating SupraBTM’s performance by 15% or more in open, reproducible benchmarks. “Too often, developers are forced to compromise between ecosystems. EVM devs feel the constraints of legacy performance, while Move developers remain isolated from the liquidity-rich Ethereum economy,” said Tobkin. “With MultiVM, Supra is collapsing the walls between ecosystems. Our vision is to provide a scalable foundation that allows applications to transcend technical silos and reach users wherever they are. With SupraBTM, we’re also proving that high performance and verifiability can coexist without tradeoffs.” MultiVM on a Supra Testnet: Now Open for Applications In a significant step to attract the best EVM talent to the Supra ecosystem, Supra has today opened applications for a considerable grant program. The program invites EVM developers seeking early access to the MultiVM Testnet environment, purpose-built to simulate mainnet conditions, to submit their best ideas and applications. Selected projects will have access to nearly all of Supra’s complete developer stack, including: Full MoveVM and EVM compatibility (no code changes required for Solidity contracts) Vertically integrated services such as native oracles, deterministic verifiable randomness (dVRF), and event-driven automation, all live or coming soon to the SupraEVM Unified RPC infrastructure supporting both Move and EVM environments Tooling compatibility with Hardhat, Foundry, and Supra’s native CLI/IDE Upcoming support for VM-to-VM communication and composable automation across environments The EVM grant program has been allocated $250,000 to the best talent on offer, and is designed to support innovative EVM-native projects deploying on Supra’s infrastructure.

XRP still offers strong functionality in international payments, while Solana (SOL) remains the undisputed leader in speedy blockchain technology, boasting the fastest rates of trade. However, the most interesting crypto to buy now will be Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the swiftly growing DeFi token developing important momentum as its Phase 6 sale, over 90% sold out, gains speed. While the next move for the market looms, these three assets promise the most massive gains when the next move occurs. XRP Rests in a Micro Support Zone XRP remains in a sideways movement, demonstrating little variation in relation to yesterday’s actions, currently oscillating in a micro support zone lined up around the $2.16-$2.25 Fibonacci levels. This zone has also turned out to be a temporary battleground, as breaking upwards here might herald the beginning of a more sophisticated correction pattern rather than a confirmed market turnaround. Until then, however, there remains no clear-cut indication of a larger market trough having been established. Market participants remain focused on two breakout levels, $2.52 as the first indicator of renewed market power, as well as $2.84, which would provide a much stronger market message. And while the established assets, as XRP, are waiting for a stronger market cue, the attention of a growing number of investors has turned to Mutuum Finance, a DeFi Initiative which continue to demonstrate an ever-accelerating speed of progress, making it a top crypto to buy for early momentum gains. Solana Builds Momentum as it Breaks out From Key Demand Zone Solana (SOL) has been the last few weeks establishing a series of strong consolidation levels, taking a pause between each movement as market participants waited to confirm a change in momentum. Following the last drop back into the sturdy region of $135-$140, SOL has just begun to show the first signs of a potential turnaround, as buyers began to reenter this crucial region to support it. If this nascent breakout continues, SOL might just unlock from the currently established rangebound pattern, taking a stab at the $160-$170 area, which previously served as a strong anchor level during periods of positive momentum. And as the tides of momentum continue to turn back in favor of high-performing networks like Solana, investors are also considering Mutuum Finance, which is breaking into the market quite rapidly as a top crypto to buy now, as well as a quickly rising presale project that has attracted widespread attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Moves Toward Testnet Launch Mutuum Finance continues to move forward in momentum as presale phase 6 approaches its culmination. Phase 6 remains 90% full, presenting the last opportunity for buyers to acquire tokens at the discounted price of $0.035, before increasing by a massive 20% in Phase 7. Since the presale’s launch, the project has managed to raise $18.8 million, along with having 18,080 unique holders, showcasing the level of support it has received. The current token value shows a 250% rise from the Phase 1 cost of just $0.01, placing it in the list of the top crypto to buy before the potential launch at $0.06. Potential gains up to a staggering 400% can be made from buying early, making MUTM a prime crypto to buy now opportunity. Mutuum Finance Provides Investor Trust through CertiK Security Audit Mutuum Finance has security and transparency as the core values in the platform it offers. Unlike most projects, where investors might be endangered by the use of unaudited smart contracts as well as unsecured lending pools, Mutuum Finance has involved a CertiK audit, where the entire smart contract code has been verified for security. This enables the investors to feel safe while taking advantage of the potential for growth offered by the next-generation DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance has managed to raise $18.8M, attracted over 18,080 investors, and sold over 90% of the Phase 6 presale tokens at $0.035. This increases in Phase 7, where the price increases to $0.04, expected to be listed in the exchange at $0.06, giving early investors the potential to realize gains of up to 500%. Mutuum has a platform audited by CertiK and soon will be running the testnet. Don’t miss the chance to buy before the sellout of Phase 6, securing a top crypto to buy.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $90,953.83 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples through the entire digital asset ecosystem. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Movement? The sudden Bitcoin price decline has left many investors wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several factors that could be influencing this downward trend. However, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are naturally volatile, and price fluctuations are common occurrences in this space. Several key elements typically affect Bitcoin price movements: Market sentiment and investor psychology Regulatory developments worldwide Institutional investment patterns Global economic conditions Technical trading indicators How Should Investors React to Bitcoin Price Volatility? When the Bitcoin price shows significant movement, both new and experienced investors face important decisions. Rather than making impulsive choices based on short-term fluctuations, consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-cost averaging remains one of the most reliable strategies during volatile periods. This approach involves investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, regardless of the current Bitcoin price. Therefore, you automatically buy more when prices are low and less when they’re high. Moreover, maintaining a long-term perspective is crucial. Historical data shows that despite temporary setbacks, the overall trajectory of Bitcoin price has been upward over extended periods. Many experts suggest that focusing on fundamental adoption metrics rather than daily price changes provides better investment clarity. Understanding Market Cycles and Bitcoin Price Patterns The current Bitcoin price movement fits into broader market cycles that cryptocurrency investors have observed over the years. These patterns typically include: Accumulation phases where prices consolidate Rapid upward movements followed by corrections Periods of sideways trading and stability Breakout phases leading to new price discoveries Today’s Bitcoin price action represents one of these natural correction phases. While seeing red numbers can be unsettling, experienced traders understand that these moments often present buying opportunities for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. What Does This Mean for the Future Bitcoin Price? Looking ahead, the Bitcoin price trajectory depends on multiple converging factors. The fundamental adoption story remains strong, with increasing institutional interest and growing global acceptance. However, short-term price movements like today’s drop below $91,000 serve as important reminders about market dynamics. The current Bitcoin price situation highlights why risk management is essential in cryptocurrency investing. Always ensure that your exposure aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Remember that while today’s Bitcoin price shows decline, the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout its history. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $91,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from combined factors including profit-taking, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic conditions affecting risk assets. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Some investors see price dips as buying opportunities, but always conduct your own research. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible, but historical patterns show Bitcoin has experienced significant corrections before resuming upward trends. Will this affect other cryptocurrencies? Yes, Bitcoin price movements often influence the broader cryptocurrency market since Bitcoin serves as a benchmark for the entire sector. How long might this price correction last? Correction durations vary widely. Some last days, while others extend for weeks or months depending on market conditions and catalyst events. What indicators should I watch during Bitcoin price volatility? Key metrics include trading volume, market sentiment, regulatory news, institutional activity, and technical support/resistance levels.

CryptoQuant CEO Presents The Data",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bottom-56000-cryptoquant-ceo/,"CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has put a clear reference level on the current Bitcoin correction – but is adamant it should not be mistaken for a prediction. “Many people seem to be misunderstanding this, so let me clarify,” he wrote. “I am not saying $56K is the bottom. I am saying the realized price is 56K. If you follow the cycle theory, that level would be the bottom. But I think the cycle theory is broken, and the price could flip at any time depending on macro conditions and market sentiment.” Bitcoin Realized Price Sits at $56,000 His latest data briefing breaks the market into three layers: futures, spot, and on-chain. In the futures market, Ju says the average order size shows that futures whales have left and retail now dominates. Internal flow profile (IFP) data indicates BTC inflows from spot to futures exchanges have collapsed, ending the phase when large players were posting BTC as collateral to go long. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Price Crashing? Arthur Hayes Isn’t Surprised At the same time, the Estimated Leverage Ratio remains high, and Binance deposit cost basis sits around $57,000, which “means traders already captured large gains from ETF and institutional flows.” Open interest is still above last year’s levels, while the aggregated funding rate is neutral, not fearful, suggesting leverage remains elevated but without a classic capitulation reset. Spot data points to fading institutional aggression. Ju notes the Coinbase Premium is at a nine-month low, which he attributes to ETF-driven institutional selling. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen net negative weekly flows for three straight weeks, and Strategy mNAV at 1.23 implies that “near-term capital raising seems difficult,” as many structured strategies are already sitting on substantial gains. On-chain metrics provide the context for the much-discussed $56,000 level. Ju observes that realized cap growth has stalled for three days, while market cap is growing more slowly than realized cap, a configuration he interprets as strong selling pressure as profitable coins move. CryptoQuant’s PnL Index flipped short on November 8, which Ju summarizes as whales taking profit. “If the cycle theory holds, the cycle bottom would be around $56K (realized price),” he says – and immediately distances himself from treating that as a hard rule in a structurally changing market. CryptoQuant CEO Rejects Classic Cycle Bottom Theory In a separate prediction segment, Ju turns to macro conditions. “Short-term conditions are weak: dollar liquidity is slow, funding markets are tight, and Bitcoin inflows have cooled,” he writes. However, he adds, “I do not expect Bitcoin inflows to stop or turn into sustained outflows over the next six months.” Related Reading: Bitcoin SSR Flashes Buy Signal: Rebound Incoming? In his view, a shift in the policy narrative could rapidly invert sentiment: “If rate cuts or any easy-money narrative appears, sentiment could flip and liquidity would rush back into ETFs.” Ju also sketches a longer-term structural thesis. He argues that stablecoin adoption and a wave of reverse ICOs by public companies could push traditional assets onto DEXs, enabling on-chain long and short trading in names like Tesla. In that world, on-chain analysis could evolve into labeling wallets like “Elon Musk’s ETH address to track Tesla coin onchain inflows and outflows.” He believes Bitcoin would benefit the most, while altcoins with weak narratives or no real performance would likely lose liquidity as capital concentrates in assets with clear utility or narrative strength. “I gave up predicting Bitcoin price,” Ju reminds followers, “but I haven’t given up analyzing data.” His $56,000 reference is best understood in that spirit: a data-driven anchor derived from realized price and cycle theory, not a promise that this drawdown will end neatly at that line.

Malaysia’s national utility company, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), has reported a loss of more than $1billion (RM 4.6 billion) due to illegal electricity use by cryptocurrency miners between 2020 and August 2025, according to its Energy and Water Transformation Ministry. Enforcement is ongoing under “Operation Letrik,” a joint effort by the Criminal Investigation Department, TNB’s SEAL (Special Engagement Against Losses) unit, local councils, and other agencies. Malaysia has lost over $1 billion to illegal crypto mining Electricity theft in Malaysia is on the rise due to a surge in illegal crypto mining in the country. In total, 13,827 premises were identified to be related to illegal power consumption related to crypto mining. Several of the mining equipment being used on these premises, such as Bitcoin rigs, have been seized through law enforcement operations. Authorities are working to prevent further financial damage. As of this report, Malaysia doesn’t have a law against crypto mining, so authorities are pursuing criminal charges under the Electricity Supply Act for meter tampering or bypassing meters, which are officially illegal. The TNB has led joint raids and investigations with the police, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, and the anti-graft agency (MACC). The ministry explained that they have set up a database with the names of property owners and tenants of premises suspected of illegal mining. This lets TNB flag suspicious sites and plan its inspections more efficiently. TNB is also installing smart meters at distribution substations that can detect abnormal power usage and any potential tampering with electrical power in real time. Illegal mining has become a headache TNB reports that electricity theft linked to crypto mining has jumped by nearly 300% from 2018 to 2024. The number of detected cases rose from 610 in 2018 to 2,397 in 2024. In July 2025, Malaysia’s Deputy Minister for Energy Transition and Water Transformation, Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, said that since 2018, about RM 4.8 billion has been lost to illegal Bitcoin mining through electricity theft. He also emphasized that the growing value of Bitcoin is making more people willing to take the risk. In some cases, property owners are being held responsible for the electricity bills racked up by their tenants. Forty-five landlords reportedly owe a combined RM 8.5 million after their tenants used their properties for illegal mining. These individuals will often use false identities to open TNB accounts. TNB has said it will assist these landlords and is encouraging property owners to submit “Change of Tenancy” applications to avoid similar issues in the future. In August this year, during a small police raid, TNB seized 61 Bitcoin miners in the Manjung district during coordinated raids. In Terengganu, another operation led to the seizure of 45 machines, and authorities estimate that the monthly electricity losses add up to RM 36,000. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Analysts expect revenue of $54.9 billion (up 57% year-over-year) and earnings per share of $1.25 , but the bar is extraordinarily high for the world’s most valuable company, which briefly topped $5 trillion in market capitalization last month. NVIDIA’s stock closed Tuesday at $181.36, down nearly 14.5% from its October 29 all-time high of $212.19, as growing concerns about AI bubble valuations and the sustainability of massive infrastructure spending have triggered a broad tech selloff. As per Reuters , options markets are pricing in a potential 7-8% swing in either direction following the results, which could translate into a $320 billion move in market value, making it the largest post-earnings volatility in Nvidia’s history. The pressure on Nvidia comes amid mounting skepticism about the AI trade itself. High-profile investors, including Michael Burry, have disclosed short positions and raised red flags about potential accounting irregularities related to chip depreciation, while Peter Thiel’s hedge fund dumped its entire $100 million Nvidia stake and SoftBank unloaded $5.8 billion in shares to fund its own AI ventures. Crazy Michael Burry just filed is 13F 11 days early. HE HAS NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE Massive PUTs (short) on Palantir and Nvidia pic.twitter.com/7LjKqcKIuB — It's a Bubble (@itsabubble) November 3, 2025 The broader market context is equally challenging, with the Nasdaq down over 4% in November, its steepest monthly decline since March, as fading odds of a December Fed rate cut and inflation concerns weigh on risk assets. Data center revenue is expected to account for roughly $49 billion of the quarter’s total, driven by continued demand for Hopper chips and the highly anticipated ramp of the Blackwell platform, which CEO Jensen Huang has described as experiencing “ incredible ” demand from hyperscalers and foundation model makers. Despite the recent selloff and bubble concerns, most Wall Street analysts remain bullish, with Stifel raising its price target to $250 ahead of earnings and Wedbush’s Dan Ives calling Nvidia “ a foundational piece ” of the AI revolution. The company has beaten earnings expectations in 19 of the past 21 quarters, and the consensus view is another “ beat and raise ” scenario. However, the real test will be Q4 guidance as analysts expect around $61.5 billion, and anything below that level could trigger a sharp selloff. Geopolitical headwinds loom large, with Q3 results excluding any H20 chip sales to China due to export restrictions and new Chinese regulations mandating that state-funded data centers use only domestic AI chips. Yet retail sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish, with Polymarket traders chancing in at 96% that the company will beat its quarterly earnings.

54615363,630999,1763568287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54615363.jpeg,Un Nuovo Crash di Bitcoin è Possibile? Perché la Salute della Rete Conta Davvero e Come Potrebbe Intervenire Bitcoin Hyper,https://bitcoinist.com/un-nuovo-crash-di-bitcoin-e-possibile-perche-la-salute-della-rete-conta-davvero-e-come-potrebbe-intervenire-bitcoin-hyper/,"La volatilità di mercato è tornata a farsi sentire e molti trader si chiedono se Bitcoin ($BTC) possa affrontare un nuovo calo significativo. Di solito l’attenzione si concentra quasi esclusivamente sul prezzo, ma spesso sono alcune debolezze interne della rete a generare ulteriori timori. Limiti come la lentezza delle conferme e le commissioni elevate possono accentuare la pressione nei momenti più critici. Nelle ultime 24 ore, Bitcoin è sceso sotto i 90.000 dollari e ha provocato liquidazioni per oltre 568 milioni di dollari, di cui la maggior parte provenienti da posizioni long. A questo si è aggiunta la comparsa del cosiddetto death cross – un incrocio tra medie mobili in cui la media a breve termine scende sotto quella a lungo termine. In analisi tecnica, questo incrocio viene spesso interpretato come potenziale segnale di debolezza, anche se non garantisce necessariamente ulteriori ribassi. Quando il mercato accelera, la rete Bitcoin fatica a gestire l’aumento di attività. Le conferme delle transazioni, che in condizioni normali richiedono diversi minuti, possono arrivare a durare ore. Le commissioni – spesso chiamate “gas” anche se il termine è più comune su altre blockchain – possono aumentare rapidamente. Questo genera congestione e rende difficile spostare i fondi verso gli exchange per vendere o verso un portafoglio offline per maggiore sicurezza. Questi ritardi non rappresentano solo un problema tecnico: possono peggiorare la situazione nei momenti di incertezza. Se gli utenti non riescono a spostare i propri BTC quando ne hanno bisogno, la loro capacità di reagire ai movimenti del mercato si riduce drasticamente. Il problema di fondo è la scalabilità, cioè la capacità del sistema di reggere un alto numero di transazioni contemporaneamente. Questo limite ha a lungo frenato la possibilità di trasformare Bitcoin in una base solida per applicazioni decentralizzate (dApp) e servizi avanzati. Negli ultimi anni, tuttavia, l’attenzione si è spostata sulle soluzioni Layer-2: protocolli costruiti sopra la blockchain principale che cercano di unire la sicurezza di Bitcoin con una maggiore velocità e flessibilità. L’obiettivo è affrontare proprio i problemi che emergono nei momenti di forte stress del mercato. Tra i progetti che puntano a migliorare il funzionamento complessivo dell’ecosistema c’è Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , che propone un’infrastruttura capace di aumentare la capacità della rete e introdurre funzionalità avanzate. ESPLORA: Migliori Casino Online Costruire un Ecosistema di dApp e DeFi su Bitcoin Le implicazioni di questa architettura vanno oltre la semplice velocità. Introducendo gli smart contract, Bitcoin Hyper potrebbe aprire la porta alla creazione di un vero ecosistema applicativo su Bitcoin. Questo include progetti di finanza decentralizzata (DeFi) per prestiti, staking e scambi automatizzati, piattaforme NFT dinamiche e applicazioni di gioco basate interamente sulla blockchain. Gli sviluppatori potrebbero utilizzare linguaggi familiari come Rust – già molto diffuso nello sviluppo web3 – per costruire e distribuire le applicazioni. Un elemento importante sarà il Canonical Bridge , progettato per permettere trasferimenti semplici e sicuri di $BTC tra il livello principale e quello secondario, mantenendo liquidità e accessibilità. Il token nativo $HYPER fungerà da elemento centrale dell’ecosistema, con ruoli legati alla governance e alle ricompense per lo staking. Con la possibilità di mettere in staking i token fin dal token generation event (TGE), il progetto punta a coinvolgere fin da subito la propria community. Attualmente, il token è disponibile in prevendita a 0,013295 dollari , con la possibilità di metterlo in staking per un rendimento annuo del 41%.

According to a post from Bullrunners on X, he recently bought $1 million in XRP , as well as $750,000 in Bitcoin and $400,000 in Ethereum. A Calculated Dive into the Dip Portnoy’s move reflects a deliberate accumulation strategy rather than a spur-of-the-moment gamble. As reported by Bullrunners, he injected a total of $2.15 million into the three largest crypto assets during the recent decline. He likened his approach to a predator striking at opportunity: “When there’s blood in the streets, I’m like a Great White Shark,” he said. This isn’t the first time Portnoy has bought into XRP during weakness. Earlier in 2025, he added another $1 million during a pullback, signaling that he views these moments as entry opportunities rather than missteps. Dave Portnoy says he bought the dip — scooping up $1,000,000 in XRP, $750,000 in Bitcoin, and $400,000 in Ethereum. #XRP #XRPCommunity pic.twitter.com/ZUMF1ndS2z — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) November 18, 2025 Portnoy’s Crypto Journey: From FOMO to Big Bets Portnoy first publicly embraced Bitcoin in 2020, after a visit from the Winklevoss twins. Over time, he expanded his holdings to include XRP, calling it his “10x bet” given its potential for outsized returns. In December 2024, he disclosed having $1.3 million in XRP and $1.5 million in Bitcoin, describing his style as “bet it and set it, not trading.” Yet, his history with XRP is not without regret. In mid‑2025, he sold a large portion of his XRP at around $2.40, only to see it rally sharply afterward. He later admitted in a video that the decision made him emotional — “I would’ve made millions … I want to cry.” Why XRP, Again? His latest commitment to XRP suggests that Portnoy believes in its long-term potential, even amid regulatory risks and price volatility. Ripple’s ongoing legal battles and developing use cases may offer the kind of asymmetric payoff he seems to favor. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Moreover, Portnoy appears to be doubling down on his core strategy: buy on weakness and hold. He has publicly embraced a “HODL” mindset, especially during market stress. Reflection and Risk Critics argue that Portnoy’s style is part showmanship, part high-stakes gamble. He has admitted to emotional decisions, like his XRP exit, and even called himself “always late to these runs.” Yet, his willingness to re-enter the market shows conviction — or at least a willingness to bet big on his own convictions. For Portnoy, this is more than just a meme — it is a serious wager. Whether he’s proven prescient or reckless will depend on where the markets go next. But one thing is clear: he’s not just watching from the sidelines. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The updated filing claims that Welch played a central role in a promotional effort that encouraged thousands of retail buyers to support a token that collapsed within minutes of trading. The lawsuit says the token’s design and marketing created conditions that helped insiders exit early with significant gains. Moreover, the filing links the token’s launch to a broader pattern of alleged rug-pull activity involving the same wallet clusters. New Filing Claims Welch Became a Key Player in the Launch The latest complaint says Welch earned up to $325,000 for the promotion. The filing claims she received $125,000 upfront and expected an additional $200,000 after meeting specific milestones. Besides this, the agreement allegedly placed her at the center of a full marketing funnel managed by Memetic Labs. The complaint says her involvement encouraged buyers who trusted her expanding online presence. Welch gained significant visibility in 2024 after a viral interview shaped her online identity. She later built a large audience and launched a successful podcast. The filing claims she used this momentum to promote the Hawk Tuah token as a new cultural product with subscription-style benefits. However, the lawsuit argues that the team never created the technology needed to support these claimed features. Lawsuit Alleges Token Collapsed as Insiders Exited Quickly The Hawk Tuah token reached a market cap near $490 million within minutes of trading. The price then dropped more than 90% shortly after launch. Hence, the complaint states that the crash occurred during a period when insiders sold large portions of their supply for more than $1.2 million. Additionally, investigators tracked the same wallet activity across earlier failed meme coins, including LIBRA , M3M3, AIAI, and a separate token tied to former political branding deals. Significantly, the filing links these patterns to similar timing and extraction methods across past collapses. Consequently, the new amendment names Welch, her manager Johnnie Forster, and her company 16 Minutes LLC as defendants. The complaint says Forster aligned Welch’s brand with the token’s rollout and promoted the launch himself. Moreover, the updated filing argues that 16 Minutes LLC negotiated the monetization agreement that supported the campaign. Legal Team Expands Case as Investigations Continue Burwick Law now seeks permission to proceed with new fraud allegations. The firm also requests expanded methods to reach the remaining defendants linked to the launch. Additionally, investigators continue to review related wallet flows tied to earlier meme coin failures.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-19 16:06:17

On Nov. 19, Payward Inc., the operator of the crypto exchange, announced that it has confidentially submitted a Form S-1 draft to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed initial public offering of its common stock. Founded in 2011, Kraken operates a digital asset trading platform where clients can trade over 450 digital assets, US futures, US-listed stocks, exchange-traded funds, and fiat currencies. Kraken confidentially files for a US IPO According to an official press release , Kraken’s filing doesn’t include details on timing, share count, or pricing. As with all confidential submissions, the SEC’s review — and market conditions — will dictate the next move. The IPO is expected to proceed after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions. With the growing scams in the crypto space, Kraken warned that “This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Any offers, solicitations, or offers to buy, or any sales of securities, will be made in accordance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”).” What is Form S-1? A Form S-1 is the official registration document a company must file with the US SEC before it can go public. It includes detailed financial statements, business risks, revenue information, management disclosures, and how much money the company plans to raise in its initial public offering (IPO). Crypto IPO’s thrive in 2025 In 2025, a number of digital assets have gone public, paving the way for Kraken to follow suit. With over $1 billion in funding, stablecoin issuer Circle finally closed its highly anticipated IPO in June. Crypto exchange Gemini—through its parent Gemini Space Station—also went public this year, debuting on the Nasdaq under the ticker GEMI. Meanwhile, Tron Inc. advanced toward the public markets via a reverse merger structure announced earlier this year, providing traditional investors with exposure to a major blockchain ecosystem. Kraken is valued at $20B valuation after $ a $200M Citadel injection The listing follows Kraken’s new valuation. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Kraken raised $200 million from Wall Street’s Citadel Securities. The investment valued Kraken at $20 billion, marking it as one of the largest firms in the fast-growing digital assets industry. The most recent raise comes quickly on the tail of another large fundraising round for Kraken in September. In that round of financing, the company raised $600 million at a $15 billion valuation from an all-star roster of investors from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Together, the two rounds bring Kraken’s recent total fundraising haul to $800 million. Jim Esposito, the president of Citadel Securities, stressed the move as a strategic change, stating that his firm was “excited to support Kraken’s continued momentum,” and would work with the exchange on risk management, market structure research, and other technical aspects that govern market operations.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $89,964.05 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable decline that has caught investors’ attention worldwide. What Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for Investors? The sudden Bitcoin price movement below $90,000 represents a psychological barrier break that often triggers market reactions. When major support levels like this give way, it typically indicates increased selling pressure or profit-taking among traders. However, experienced investors understand that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and such movements create both challenges and opportunities. Market analysts suggest several factors could be influencing the current Bitcoin price action: Increased regulatory uncertainty in key markets Profit-taking after recent gains Broader economic factors affecting risk assets Technical correction following overbought conditions How Should You Respond to Bitcoin Price Volatility? Understanding market cycles is crucial when dealing with Bitcoin price fluctuations. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience after significant corrections. The current Bitcoin price movement, while concerning to some, may represent a healthy market correction rather than a long-term trend reversal. Seasoned cryptocurrency investors often view these dips as potential buying opportunities. However, it’s essential to consider your risk tolerance and investment strategy before making any decisions. The Bitcoin price today reflects real-time market sentiment, but long-term value depends on broader adoption and technological development. Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin Price Movements Several fundamental factors continue to shape the Bitcoin price trajectory. Institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions all play significant roles in determining where the Bitcoin price might head next. The current Bitcoin price below $90,000 could attract new buyers who’ve been waiting for a better entry point. Market sentiment around the Bitcoin price often shifts quickly, so maintaining perspective is vital. Remember that cryptocurrency investing requires patience and a long-term outlook. The Bitcoin price today is just one data point in a much larger narrative about digital asset adoption. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, having a clear strategy becomes paramount. Consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks Setting clear profit-taking and stop-loss levels Diversifying across different time horizons Staying informed about market developments The Bitcoin price action serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency markets remain highly dynamic. While the drop below $90,000 may concern short-term traders, long-term investors often use these periods to reassess their positions and strategy. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price fall below $90,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from combined factors including profit-taking, regulatory concerns, and broader market sentiment affecting risk assets. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some investors view price dips as buying opportunities, but your decision should align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is challenging, but historical support zones and market fundamentals provide context for potential floors. Should I sell my Bitcoin holdings? This depends on your investment goals, time horizon, and financial situation. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance. How long might this correction last? Cryptocurrency market corrections can vary in duration from days to months, depending on market conditions and catalyst developments. What indicators should I watch? Key metrics include trading volume, institutional flows, regulatory news, and broader economic indicators affecting risk appetite. Share Your Thoughts Found this analysis helpful?

According to renowned market analyst X Finance Bull, local traders are panic buying XRP , signaling a stark contrast to the global trend of crypto sell-offs. Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, is now leading global spot trading by a wide margin. Amid a market-wide downturn, South Koreans are flocking to XRP, seeking potential gains in the turbulence. As the crypto market plunges, with Bitcoin hitting a six-month low of $90K and altcoins tanking, global investors face mounting fear, yet South Korea tells a different story. X Finance Bull highlights that South Korean investors see the market dip as a buying opportunity, not a warning. Unlike global trends, they are strategically accumulating XRP at lower prices, positioning themselves for a potential rebound. XRP has consistently shown resilience in South Korea, often rebounding faster than other cryptocurrencies. Upbit’s market dominance, high liquidity, and robust infrastructure empower traders to act decisively, making it a prime platform for swift movements in volatile conditions. Korea’s surge in XRP buying is reshaping global markets. Upbit’s record volumes are boosting worldwide XRP liquidity, underscoring South Korea’s pivotal role in crypto. X Finance Bull says sustained Korean demand could stabilize XRP and spark a broader recovery.

According to the data we have collected, this step aims to enhance transparency, strengthen compliance with regulatory standards, and prepare the platform for entering the broader institutional market. Many observers note that filing the application is a “logical step in the company’s development,” given its growing user base and interest from international funds. The process of engagement with the regulator will be an important phase in building a long-term, sustainable operational model focused on both individual investors and large institutions. Company representatives emphasize that readiness for regulation is a sign of the cryptocurrency infrastructure’s maturity and a step towards strengthening trust. The Mevolaxy platform is known for its mevstake model, which allows users to participate in liquidity pools managed by a network of MEV bots. Over the past year, the project has significantly increased its assets under management and user base, and has frequently appeared at international events, including participation in the TOKEN2049 conference. Filing the application does not imply automatic approval. However, we believe the very fact of initiating the official process is important for the company. In the coming months, we will monitor and publish updates on the review progress and disclose additional details. Industry experts note that such moves could mark the beginning of a global trend where technological DeFi projects seek integration with the traditional financial system and increased regulatory clarity .

In its latest weekly report, the on-chain intelligence firm says the current drawdown is fundamentally different from prior corrections, with both technical and demand-side indicators turning decisively negative. Last week, CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index fell to 20/100, a level associated with extremely bearish conditions. The decline reflects shrinking spot demand, a shift to negative price momentum, and a slowdown in stablecoin liquidity growth. Adding to those pressures, Bitcoin has now broken below its 365-day moving average—a key trend indicator that signaled the confirmation of the 2022 bear market. “Fundamental and technical indicators are both pointing in the same direction: we are in a bearish phase,” said a CryptoQuant analyst, noting that Bitcoin managed to hold the 365-day moving average during every correction earlier in this cycle. “This breakdown is significant.” Bitcoin has officially erased its yearly gains YTD Performance: BTC: +0.1% ETH: -7.2% The market reset is real. pic.twitter.com/h1O4yKWowR — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) November 19, 2025 Treasury Company Demand Has Evaporated One of the most striking shifts is the collapse of demand from Bitcoin Treasury companies—entities that earlier this year were major buyers of BTC. Many of these companies have seen their market capitalizations fall 70% to over 90%, pushing them below the value of their Bitcoin holdings. As a result, they can no longer issue new shares to raise capital and buy additional BTC. Meanwhile Strategy —once the largest consistent buyer in the market—has sharply reduced its accumulation as its stock market valuation fell toward the value of its Bitcoin reserves. “Strategy can’t do all the lifting in this market, and Treasury companies have effectively disappeared as a demand source,” the CryptoQuant analyst said. Cycle Debate: End in 2025 or Extension to 2026? Bitcoin’s past bull-bear cycles have neatly spanned four years (2014–2017 and 2018–2021), a pattern often attributed to the supply shock of halvings. The current cycle—2022 to 2025—would theoretically end this year. But some analysts argue the cycle may extend into 2026 as institutions and ETFs play a larger role. CryptoQuant warns against assuming longevity simply because buyers are institutional. “Demand from long-term-oriented institutions can also dry up, just as we saw with Treasury companies,” the analyst noted. The firm argues that Bitcoin cycles are ultimately about demand waves, not halving dates. In this cycle, the biggest demand catalysts—Trump’s election victory and the surge of Bitcoin Treasury companies—are already behind the market. Support Holds, But Resistance Strengthens Despite a 28% drawdown, Bitcoin is holding near major support around $90,000–$92,000, and bear markets can still produce sharp relief rallies. But with the breakdown of the 365-day moving average, that level—now near $102,600—has become a major resistance zone. “Bitcoin is vulnerable, but not doomed,” the CryptoQuant analyst said. “Support is strong, yet the next bullish catalyst remains unclear.” The post Bitcoin Enters Most Bearish Phase Since 2023 as Demand Weakens and Key Technical Levels Break: CryptoQuant appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|CryptoQuant,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-19 16:18:35

The drop followed a fresh wave of global tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, who’s now back in the White House and pushing hard on trade deals. The trade deficit data should have landed on October 7, but it got pushed back thanks to the longest government shutdown in US history, which finally ended last week. The shutdown delayed a string of economic reports, and the agency still hasn’t said when the September trade numbers, originally set for release on November 4, will be announced. The drop was mostly caused by a 5.1% decrease in imports, the largest monthly slide in four months. Exports went up slightly. These numbers aren’t inflation-adjusted, but the trend was clear: companies pulled back on foreign buying after Trump’s new tariffs kicked in. Just a month earlier, the deficit had spiked because businesses were rushing to bring in goods ahead of the tariff deadline. Those import surges are now reversing as deals take effect. US import collapse hits gold, tech; GDP math changes again Back in April, Trump announced a new set of reciprocal tariffs, but he paused them while the US tried to negotiate deals with key trading partners. By August, several of those deals were finalized, causing the trade data to swing wildly. That kind of volatility also messes with GDP calculations. Before the latest update, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model projected that net exports were adding 0.57 percentage point to Q3 GDP. That could change again now that August numbers are out. Meanwhile, the Census Bureau said it will publish September retail sales on November 25, and durable goods orders on November 26. The most aggressive pullback in imports came from nonmonetary gold, after the US slapped a 39% tariff on Switzerland, a top gold supplier. The result? Imports plunged, and the deficit with Switzerland got smaller. Imports of capital goods, including computer accessories and communications equipment, also fell. On an inflation-adjusted basis, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $83.7 billion, the lowest since the end of 2023. That’s a big move, but the damage wasn’t evenly spread. The deficit with China hit its highest since April, while the gaps with Mexico and Canada shrank slightly. It’s a snapshot of how trade tensions continue to reshape US trade flows and impact supply chains. Switzerland cuts deal as tariff fight cools off Jamieson Greer, the US Trade Representative, confirmed in a CNBC interview that Washington and Bern had “essentially reached a deal” to bring the Swiss tariff down from 39% to 15%. “We’ve essentially reached a deal with Switzerland. So we’ll post details of that today on the White House website,” Greer said. The administration plans to release the full terms this Friday. Greer said the agreement will bring more Swiss manufacturing to the US, including pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, and railway equipment. “So we’re really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing,” he added. The deal is the end of a months-long negotiation that began when Trump shocked Swiss officials by imposing the massive 39% tariff, more than double the one applied to EU nations. Trump defended the move by pointing to what officials described as a $40 billion goods trade deficit with Switzerland. But Swiss negotiators said they thought they already had an agreement with the US before Trump’s move hit. Bloomberg had earlier reported that both countries were circling the 15% rate. Trump later confirmed that “officials had been working on a deal.” Swiss industries like watches, machinery, and precision instruments took the brunt of the blow. Greer said this new deal clears the way for those sectors to bounce back and ship more to the US, without the punishing duties.

Daily earnings from transaction fees have plummeted to a 12-month low of around $300,000, making up less than 1% of total income. This sharp drop raises concerns about mining sustainability and network activity. Why is Bitcoin Miner Revenue from Fees So Low? Bitcoin miner revenue from fees has hit its lowest point in a year due to reduced transaction volumes and network congestion easing. Miners now rely heavily on block rewards, which can be risky if Bitcoin prices fall. This trend highlights how fee income acts as a buffer during market downturns. What Does This Mean for Miners? Lower Bitcoin miner revenue from fees squeezes profitability, especially for smaller operations. Key challenges include: Increased dependence on block subsidies Higher operational costs amid energy price hikes Potential shutdowns if margins thin further However, some miners adapt by optimizing energy use or diversifying into other crypto activities. How Can Miners Boost Their Earnings? To counter falling Bitcoin miner revenue, miners can explore strategies like joining mining pools for consistent payouts or investing in efficient hardware. Moreover, engaging in transaction batching and supporting layer-2 solutions might gradually increase fee contributions over time. What’s the Future Outlook? Bitcoin miner revenue trends often reflect broader market cycles. If adoption grows and transaction demand rises, fees could rebound. Therefore, staying informed and flexible is crucial for miners to navigate these fluctuations successfully. In summary, the decline in Bitcoin miner revenue from fees signals a need for adaptation in the mining sector. By understanding these dynamics, stakeholders can make smarter decisions to ensure long-term viability. Frequently Asked Questions Why has Bitcoin miner revenue from fees decreased? It’s primarily due to lower transaction activity and reduced network congestion, leading to fewer fees paid by users. How does low fee revenue affect Bitcoin miners? It reduces overall profitability, forcing miners to rely more on block rewards and potentially leading to operational cuts. Can Bitcoin miner revenue from fees recover? Yes, if transaction volumes increase with higher network usage, fees could rise again. What are miners doing to cope with low revenue? Many are optimizing energy consumption, joining pools, or diversifying income sources to stay afloat. Is this fee drop unique to Bitcoin? No, other cryptocurrencies can experience similar fee fluctuations based on network demand and design. How can investors monitor Bitcoin miner revenue? Track reliable crypto data platforms that report daily mining earnings and fee percentages. Found this insight on Bitcoin miner revenue helpful?

On Wednesday, while speaking to the Bank Policy Institute, Steve said the Fed needs to fix the entire post-crisis framework before wasting time debating the balance sheet or how much interest it pays on reserves. “For many years, financial regulation mostly moved in one direction, increasingly restricting the banking sector,” Steve said. He pointed out that the impact of these rules on markets, credit, and monetary policy gets ignored way too often. He believes this overregulation has pushed traditional banking activity out of the regulated space entirely. “While I have no bias against nonbank financial companies,” he added, “credit allocation should be driven by market forces, not regulatory arbitrage.” Steve says regulation moved too far after 2008 Steve also said the banking rulebook went into overdrive after the 2008 financial crisis. And now, more than a decade later, the pendulum has swung too far. “Regulators should resist the urge to overreact,” he warned. His view is that stricter capital rules, especially ones like the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, forced core lending activity into the shadows, out of reach from formal oversight. That rule, part of a broader set of global Basel III capital standards, is meant to serve as a backstop to the usual risk-based capital rules. But it’s now under fire. Steve isn’t the only one sounding the alarm either. Other Trump-backed officials and some top banking voices have also pushed to loosen it. Their argument: the rule punishes banks for holding low-risk assets like Treasuries. This week, Bloomberg said the Fed and other top regulators submitted a final plan to the White House to revise the leverage ratio. The update would let the biggest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs, hold less capital compared to total assets. It’s mostly in line with a proposal from back in June, but not everyone got what they wanted. Some banks tried and failed to get Treasuries excluded completely from the ratio calculation. New rule advances as Treasuries outperform swaps News of the planned changes moved markets fast. After Bloomberg reported it on Tuesday, Treasury bonds outperformed interest-rate swaps, a rival fixed-income instrument. The spread between five- and 10-year Treasury yields and swap rates tightened to levels not seen since March. Traders saw it as a green light for banks to load up on more Treasuries. Officials are still aiming to get the rule change finalized “in the coming weeks,” depending on White House sign-off. But that could shift. Nothing is locked in yet. And it’s clear that not every ask from Wall Street made it into the draft. That said, Steve thinks the focus needs to stay on rewriting the full regulatory setup before the Fed dives back into balance sheet debates or reserve management. He also pushed for more transparency from the Fed itself. In his words, both the public and the banking industry would gain from knowing what the Fed is doing, and why. Right now, Steve argued, too much of the regulatory impact is invisible until something breaks. That’s not good enough anymore.

The senators allege the company may be linked to illicit actors linked to North Korea and Russia and does not have adequate security measures in place to prevent malicious actors from gaining influence. Warren and Reed’s request is based on a striking allegation in a report against the company, which alleges that World Liberty Financial may have sold 600,000 WLFI tokens worth approximately $10,000 to suspicious addresses linked to organizations known for money laundering, such as North Korea, Iran, and Tornado Cash. Related News: The OCC, a Key US Agency, Announces New Bullish Decision for Cryptocurrencies ZachXBT, known for its crypto analysis and on-chain research, commented on the allegations, arguing that the figures were exaggerated. The analyst noted that the total token sale raised $550 million, while the alleged $10,000 amounted to only 0.0018% of the sale. The analyst also added that he has not made any investments in the project and does not hold WLFI tokens. ZachXBT said that if the senators are successful in this attempt, the next target could be altcoins like Hyperliquid (HYPE). *This is not investment advice.

This is a period of stagnation after there have been big changes in the value of Bitcoin and so much money being transferred from Bitcoin ETFs. This indicates a cautious and watchful mood from institutions. Analysts are being cautious themselves, noting a worrying Bitcoin crash towards $89,600. Traders remain optimistic though, trying to find the best crypto to buy now with the best return. In the midst of finding a top crypto to invest in, there is a strong alternative coin that is catching the eyes of everyone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a Prominent DeFi crypto, and in the DeFi market there’s no one else with the same strong potential. Predicting Mutuum to be a market leader after its ongoing presale, analysts are confident in stating MUTM is easily the best crypto to invest in. Headwinds Affect Bitcoin Prices Bitcoin has seen its latest cycle in a market experiencing a liquidity crisis and market participants reallocating capital. BTC is facing its first major resistance zone while consolidating below $96,000 after first hitting a new all-time high of almost $126,000. The level of outflows out of Bitcoin spot ETFs, while also likely driven by profit taking, have been some of the worst ever seen in the space. Many market commentators, especially institutional investors, classify the current snapshot in the market cycle as a bear regime, which is a bear market characterized by a structural repricing of the asset as market participants continue to flush leverage out of the system and remove capital out of the market. If strong support in the area of $93-95k is broken, the market is likely to slide further. The current market structure is strong and many participants, driven by fundamentals, have shifted to higher-value crypto assets. Mutuum Finance Presale Sets Off Buy Alarm Though there is a Bitcoin market stall, there is no halt in the presale for the new crypto. Mutuum Finance has an active presale currently in phase six. There are already over 18,080 holders and $18.8 million in fundraising. Investors are fully supporting the presale in all its stages. The price for each Mutuum Finance token is $0.035. In the initial phase, the price was $0.01. This is a recorded increase of over 250% and is a return on the investment the presale holders are receiving. All presale stages shoot for a sellout, and, phase 6 is no different. In addition, phase 7 is coming up right now. In phase 7, the price of the token is expected to jump to over $0.040, a 20% increase. This jump is expected, with an ROI of 500% projected for its investors once $0.06 is reached. The team has made an update where investors get to buy MUTM tokens directly with cards without limits, making it so much easier to get tokens. Added to that, there is a generous $100,000 giveaway from Mutuum Finance where ten random winners receive a whopping $10,000 each. These two extreme and positively accessible conditions make buying MUTM a perfect opportunity for both regular and institutional investors looking for a new crypto. For investors looking at the situation from a Diversified Investment Growth perspective, Mutuum’s Finance premise is the most accurate synthesis of real market opportunity and positive tokenomics. The Mutuum Finance presale is effectively one of the last presales before a potential price gain. Investing now should be an easy decision for those looking to gain significantly with crypto in 2026. This is one of those times when there is an opportunity and it won’t last long. Buying MUTM is the perfect opportunity to be part of one of the leading DeFi innovations.

The pullback has pushed the price far below its October all-time high of $126,000 and has dragged sentiment with it as traders search for answers. A detailed breakdown shared by crypto analyst Tracy Shuchart offers the clearest picture yet of why this downturn has been so aggressive. Her analysis points to a failure not driven by a single factor but by several interconnected forces that broke simultaneously and created the conditions for a cascading crash. This presents the possibility of Bitcoin extending its crash to as low as $80,000. Breakdown Of The Macro Story That Sent Bitcoin To $126,000 According to Tracy Shuchart, Bitcoin’s climb from $40,000 to $126,000 was powered based on one dominant theory: a Federal Reserve easing cycle combined with a wave of institutional participation through spot ETFs. Related Reading: 4 Bitcoin Indicators That Led To Market Rallies In The Last 2 Years Have Returned Traders priced in a supportive macro backdrop where rate cuts were all but guaranteed, liquidity would expand, and institutions would steadily absorb supply. However, once the Federal Reserve reversed course, the foundation of that theory collapsed. Expectations for December rate cuts fell from 90% to 40%. Real yields on short-term Treasuries stayed elevated above 5%, and the strong-dollar environment returned. With the macro assumption gone, Bitcoin’s valuation near all-time highs became difficult to justify. Institutions that had accumulated through Spot ETFs quickly reduced exposure, producing more than $1.1 billion in outflows within days. This wasn’t panic selling but a systematic rebalancing by portfolio managers who no longer believed the macro thesis. This change in macro expectations effectively removed the first layer of support that had been holding Bitcoin above six-figure levels. The second layer of the decline came from the behavior of long-term holders. Wallets that accumulated bitcoin between $40,000 and $80,000 began distributing aggressively once volatility returned. They offloaded roughly 815,000 Bitcoin in thirty days, locking in substantial profits. Is $80,000 Next For Bitcoin? Shuchart’s argument is based on the notion that the ongoing decline persists because the market has now reached a point where natural buyers have vanished. Institutions are rebalancing away from risk, long-term holders are waiting for deeper discounts, and retail traders have retreated. Until there’s new demand, Bitcoin’s price will continue drifting lower. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Just Flashed A Death Cross, But It’s Not What You Think “Now the market is repricing based on reality: high real yields, no Fed easing, strong dollar environment,” the analyst said. For a bottom to form, three conditions must be met. Leverage must be completely flushed out of the system, long-term holders need to stop selling and begin accumulating again, and real capital must find the price attractive enough. As it stands, Bitcoin is still trading above the $90,000 price level. However, recent price action saw it briefly slip below that threshold on November 18, touching lows near $89,000 before recovering. That move shows that the downtrend is already probing for lower support in the $80,000 zone. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $91,080.

However, trading revenue and graduation rates are still low. The platform also launched an AI trading agent called Mayhem Mode, which experienced a slow start to its first trading week. Last week, over 200k crypto projects launched on Solana as its Mayhem Mode AI agent went live. According to on-chain data from Solana blockchain explorer Solscan, the majority of the new launches were memecoins launched on Solana’s memecoin launchpad pump.fun. Solana’s Pump.fun records a slow week despite unveiling a new AI agent The data also shows that Monday experienced the most launches, which cumulated to a total of 31,193 new tokens. 📊DATA: Over 200K new tokens launched on @Solana last week, with the majority coming from @pumpdotfun, primarily memecoins. pic.twitter.com/vTiWy3PCmd — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) November 19, 2025 Tuesday saw a slight dip from Monday’s launches, with 29,127 new tokens added by the end of the day. In contrast, Wednesday saw a slight surge in launching activity, resulting in 30,574 new tokens. On Thursday and Friday, the platform recorded 28,783 and 28,469 new launches, respectively. Activity decreased during the weekend, with the network closing the day on Saturday at 25,611 new launches and 26,312 new tokens on Sunday. The network ended the week with a total of 206,669 tokens launched. The data also showed that the Solana network recorded 129,434 new NFT mints, with the highest mint for the week being 20,546 recorded on Friday. The news follows Cryptopolitan’s recent report dated November 19 that Pump.fun’s new AI-driven “Mayhem Mode” experienced a slow start in its first week. The report detailed that Pump.fun averaged 17,300 new token launches per day, but the number only slightly increased to 17,800 after the AI trading agent was deployed on the network. The launchpad’s developers explained that the agent was developed to facilitate early price discovery, helping new coins attract investor attention more quickly and simultaneously increase trading revenue on the platform. The developers highlighted that the AI agent will only work on new projects and cannot be deployed on existing projects, such as those on the Pump.fun bonding curve or those classified as graduated tokens. The AI-powered trading bot features functions that involve minting, trading, and burning memecoins on the platform randomly to outcompete other trading bots. However, some traders show concerns that it resembles wash trading. A single AI agent pulling massive numbers during early trading activity could make markets appear more active than they are. Others described Mayhem Mode as another means for malicious traders to direct unsuspecting investors into rug pulls. Pump.fun launches Mayhem Mode to lift token visibility The memecoin launchpad unveiled the agent as a solution to lift token visibility and help devs launch and trade more crypto assets. However, the slow first week suggests that the new agent might not have a significant impact on the platform and its trading activities. Since the inception of Mayhem Mode, Solana’s Pump.fun trading volume has declined. Lower revenue has caused PUMP tokens, the native token of the Pump.fun platform, to decline significantly. Lower revenue reduces PUMP token buybacks that mechanically support its value. The token is down 74% from its peak of $0.012 and currently retails at $0.003, according to CoinMarketCap data at the time of this publication. Pump.fun has reinvested over $175 million in PUMP’s buybacks since its all-time high. However, the token’s price has still plummeted. Cryptopolitan recently reported that token graduation rates, which is the share of launched coins that gain traction, have declined significantly. In October, the platform saw 451,939 tokens launched, out of which only 2767 graduated. The figure only represented a graduation rate of 0.61%. September’s graduation decreased to 0.58% after 679,341 tokens were launched on the network. Solana is down 13.23% in the last seven days but has relatively remained unchanged in the last 24 hours. The digital asset is currently trading at $138, as of the time of this publication. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The bank also allows transactions in euros, pounds, U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and Singapore dollars. Kohli acknowledged that HSBC will include UAE dirhams next year when it expands its operations to the Middle East. HSBC’s initiative follows similar initiatives by other major banks, including Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup, and Banco Santander SA, which are already exploring how digital assets can facilitate quicker and more efficient payments. The lender’s initiative also comes as the U.S. previously passed the stablecoin legislation, the GENIUS Act, which sets out rules for the digital asset class. “The topic of tokenization, stablecoins, digital money, and digital currencies has obviously gathered so much momentum. We are making big bets in this space.” – Manish Kohli , Global Head of Payments Solutions at HSBC. HSBC’s deposit tokens will be digital assets that represent a claim on existing deposits, functioning as tokenized forms of money already held in bank accounts. The deposit tokens differ from stablecoins, which are typically linked to fiat currencies. While stablecoins are also backed by high-quality liquid assets such as government debt, deposit tokens are created within the existing banking system and can pay interest. Kohli argued that deposit tokens can become more attractive to clients who hold large amounts of money in their bank accounts. Kohli also revealed plans for the lender to expand the use of tokenized deposits in programmable payments and autonomous treasuries. He added that the initiative is to include tokenized deposits in systems that use automation and artificial intelligence to manage cash and liquidity risk independently. HSBC’s executive also acknowledged that the bank sees a big theme around treasury formation in nearly every large firm that it has a conversation with. Other financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon, are also considering or have already established deposit token services. HSBC revealed that it processes around $500 trillion in electronic payments a year, making it one of the world’s largest transaction banking providers. However, the bank doesn’t yet disclose volumes on its tokenized deposit service. Banks globally have advanced their experimentation with blockchain technology over the past decade, but only a handful of projects have gone live. HSBC seeks to get involved in the stablecoin industry Kohli revealed that the financial institution is studying the stablecoin sector. He also disclosed that HSBC is currently discussing with some stablecoin issuers to offer reserve management and settlement account services. The bank’s official also mentioned that the lender has not excluded the idea of issuing a stablecoin on its own or jointly with other banks in the future. Kohli revealed that the initiative is something HSBC would continue to evaluate, but there are a few legal frameworks that need to be clearer first.

This groundbreaking development represents a massive leap forward for institutional cryptocurrency adoption and opens new investment avenues for millions of investors. Why Are XRP ETFs Creating Such a Buzz? The launch of XRP ETFs marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency history. These exchange-traded funds allow traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the digital asset. This eliminates the technical barriers that previously kept many institutional and retail investors away from cryptocurrency markets. James Seyffart’s announcement has sent ripples through the financial community. The simultaneous launch of Grayscale’s DOGE ETF adds another layer of excitement to November 24. This coordinated effort signals growing confidence among major financial institutions in the long-term viability of digital assets. What Benefits Do XRP ETFs Offer Investors? The introduction of XRP ETFs brings numerous advantages to the investment landscape. Investors can now access XRP through familiar brokerage accounts rather than navigating complex cryptocurrency exchanges. This accessibility could potentially drive massive capital inflows into the XRP ecosystem. Simplified investment process through traditional brokerage platforms Enhanced regulatory oversight and investor protection Reduced technical barriers for mainstream adoption Potential for increased liquidity and market stability Professional fund management from established financial institutions How Will This Impact the Cryptocurrency Market? The launch of these XRP ETFs could fundamentally reshape how traditional investors interact with digital assets. Grayscale and Franklin Templeton bring decades of financial expertise and established trust to the cryptocurrency space. Their involvement validates XRP as a legitimate investment asset class. Moreover, the simultaneous launch of multiple cryptocurrency ETFs suggests coordinated regulatory approval and institutional confidence. This could pave the way for additional digital asset ETFs in the future, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. What Challenges Might These ETFs Face? While the excitement around XRP ETFs is palpable, investors should remain aware of potential challenges. Regulatory scrutiny continues to evolve, and market volatility remains a consideration. However, the involvement of established financial institutions like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton provides additional layers of due diligence and risk management. The November 24 launch date gives investors time to research and understand how these new investment vehicles fit into their portfolios. As with any investment, careful consideration of risk tolerance and investment goals remains crucial. Conclusion: A New Era for Cryptocurrency Investment The November 24 launch of Grayscale and Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETFs represents a transformative moment for cryptocurrency markets. These investment vehicles democratize access to digital assets while bringing institutional credibility to the space. As traditional and cryptocurrency markets continue to converge, these ETFs could serve as crucial bridges for mainstream adoption. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are XRP ETFs? XRP ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of XRP, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly purchasing or storing the digital asset. When will the XRP ETFs be available for trading? According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the Grayscale and Franklin Templeton XRP ETFs are expected to launch on November 24. Can I buy these XRP ETFs through my regular brokerage account? Yes, once launched, these XRP ETFs will be available for purchase through most traditional brokerage platforms, just like any other exchange-traded fund. What is the advantage of investing in XRP ETFs versus buying XRP directly? XRP ETFs offer simplified investment processes, regulatory protections, and eliminate the need for cryptocurrency wallets or exchange accounts, making them more accessible to traditional investors. Will Grayscale’s DOGE ETF launch on the same day? Yes, Grayscale’s DOGE ETF is also anticipated to launch on November 24, according to the same announcement. Are there any risks specific to cryptocurrency ETFs? While ETFs provide regulatory oversight, they still carry cryptocurrency market risks including volatility and regulatory changes, though with additional institutional safeguards.

Dunamu will also hold a board meeting on November 26 to finalize the details. According to reports , Naver plans to use its fintech subsidiary, Naver Financial, for a full equity swap to acquire Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, Korea’s largest crypto exchange. JUST IN: Naver is set to acquire Upbit parent Dunamu via full equity swap, with a South Korean won stablecoin in view. pic.twitter.com/3U3kUL2t7B — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) November 19, 2025 In practice, a stock swap allows two companies to exchange shares instead of cash, creating a parent-subsidiary type governance structure. Ultimately, the move is seen as a way for Naver to cement its entry into digital finance and crypto markets. Dunamu to grab the largest shareholder After the two companies confirm the plan at their respective board meetings next week, they must get approval at a shareholders’ meeting to officially start integration procedures. Industry sources estimate the share-swap ratio between Naver and Dunamu to fall in the range of 1 to 3 or 1 to 4. In other words, the stock exchange ratio is at the level of about 15 trillion won in Dunamu and 5 trillion won in Naver Financial, which have become the mainstream in the market since last month. Once the acquisition is finalized, Song Chi-hyung, chairman of Dunamu, will become the largest shareholder by securing about 28% of the integrated corporation. Naver (70% of Naver Financial), the previous largest shareholder, will be diluted to 17%, falling to the second largest shareholder. Mirae Asset Securities, Naver Financial’s second-largest shareholder (holding a 30% stake), agrees to the merger itself but expresses regret over the valuation calculation. “It is conservative to evaluate Naver Financial at 5 trillion won when Kakao Pay’s market cap is around 7 trillion won,” a high-ranking Mirae Asset official said. “On the other hand, Dunamoo has a structure in which Naver Chairman Lee Hae-jin has made a lot of concessions as the merger ratio has been calculated at a time when its current value is at a high point.” Additionally, some in the industry have noted that the merger of the two companies could clash with the financial authorities’ separation of finance and virtual assets regulation. However, as the authorities are said to have determined that the merger does not violate the separation rule, the merger process is reportedly moving ahead at a brisk pace. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Naver Financial processes annual payment volumes worth 80 trillion Korean won ($58b). In contrast, pairing that scale with Dunamu’s Upbit platform, ranked the No. 1 exchange in Korea and No. 4 globally, is expected to create one of the strongest alliances yet between South Korea’s tech and crypto sectors. Dunamu and Naver plan to launch a won-backed stablecoin project The two firms are expected to launch a won-backed stablecoin project, along with other digital finance initiatives. They plan to use the deal as a springboard for global expansion. Domestically, for years, Upbit has enjoyed a dominant position in South Korea, holding above 80% of market share in some months since 2022. That dominance has triggered criticism from lawmakers, who argue that Dunamu’s grip on the exchange market risks creating a monopoly. More recently, market dynamics have undergone significant shifts. At the end of Q3, Bithumb’s domestic share climbed to 46%. Additionally, Bithumb formed a partnership with World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture associated with US President Donald Trump. Upbit held 50.6%. As a result, competition has tightened. This raises the stakes for Naver as it seeks control of Dunamu. However, crypto trading in South Korea is heavily restricted to South Korean citizens. The deal underscores a global trend of internet and fintech giants steadily colonising crypto rails to expand their businesses. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

According to recent analysis, the Bitcoin price could be approaching a critical support zone that might determine its next major move. Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, has identified key levels that every Bitcoin investor should watch closely. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Decline? The Bitcoin price is currently experiencing its steepest 43-day decline since 2017. This significant drop has pushed BTC below the average purchase price of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, creating concern among investors. However, historical patterns suggest this might be setting up for a potential recovery. Lunde’s analysis compares the current downturn to the two most severe declines of the past two years. Based on these comparisons, he identifies a crucial support zone between $84,000 and $86,000. This level could serve as the foundation for Bitcoin’s next upward movement. Key Support Levels for Bitcoin Price Recovery Understanding these critical price levels is essential for making informed investment decisions. The analysis highlights: $84,000-$86,000 range as the primary support zone $74,433 level as the secondary support if the primary zone fails Comparison to April lows for context on potential downside risk The Bitcoin price movement below ETF average purchase prices indicates significant market pressure. However, this also creates potential buying opportunities for long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamentals. What Happens If Support Levels Break? Lunde warns that if the $84,000-$86,000 support zone fails to hold, the Bitcoin price could retest its April low. The $74,433 level represents the average purchase price of Strategy’s investments, making it another critical level to monitor. This scenario would represent a more significant correction, but it’s important to remember that Bitcoin has historically recovered from similar situations. The current Bitcoin price action reflects normal market cycles, though the speed of decline has been particularly sharp. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors For investors watching the Bitcoin price closely, here are key considerations: Monitor the $84,000-$86,000 zone for potential entry points Set stop-loss orders below key support levels if trading actively Consider dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk Keep perspective on long-term Bitcoin fundamentals The current Bitcoin price volatility presents both risks and opportunities. While short-term movements can be concerning, they often create the best long-term entry points for patient investors. Final Thoughts on Bitcoin Price Outlook The analysis from K33 Research provides valuable context for understanding current Bitcoin price movements. While the decline appears dramatic, it fits within historical patterns of market corrections. The identified support levels give investors clear markers to watch as the situation develops. Remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and multiple factors influence the Bitcoin price beyond technical analysis. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What is causing Bitcoin’s current price decline? Bitcoin is experiencing its steepest 43-day decline since 2017, driven by market sentiment, profit-taking, and broader economic factors affecting cryptocurrency markets. How reliable are these Bitcoin price predictions? While based on historical data and expert analysis, all cryptocurrency predictions carry uncertainty. These levels should be used as guidelines rather than guarantees. Should I buy Bitcoin at current prices? Investment decisions depend on your risk tolerance and strategy. The identified support zones may present opportunities, but always do your own research first. What happens if Bitcoin breaks below $74,433? This would represent a more significant correction, potentially testing lower support levels. However, Bitcoin has historically recovered from such declines over time. How does ETF activity affect Bitcoin price? Spot Bitcoin ETFs represent institutional demand. When Bitcoin trades below their average purchase price, it can indicate oversold conditions or create buying pressure. Is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin? Market corrections often create attractive entry points for long-term investors, but timing the market perfectly is extremely difficult. Consider dollar-cost averaging as an alternative strategy.

ADIC spokesperson noted, “We view Bitcoin as a store of value similar to gold, and as the world continues to move toward a more digital future, we see Bitcoin playing an increasingly important role alongside gold. Both assets contribute to diversifying our portfolio, and we expect to hold them as part of our near and long-term strategy.” ADIC’s mother fund Mubadala had already invested in Bitcoin Mubadala separately disclosed that it owned 8.7 million shares valued at $567 million in the same Bitcoin ETF earlier this year.

This outlook was presented by popular cryptocurrency analyst TradingShot , who in a TradingView post on November 18 pointed out that the rebound potential can be traced back to last month’s performance. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Since early October, ETH has been trading within a descending channel, experiencing two consecutive bearish legs, each declining roughly 27.5%. This ongoing trend has kept Ethereum below key technical levels, reflecting broader market caution among investors. The analyst highlighted the one-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) as a potential signal for a temporary recovery. The RSI is forming higher lows while the price continues to make lower lows, creating a bullish divergence. This pattern mirrors similar price behavior observed in early October and suggests that a short-term bounce could occur. Such a rebound might push Ethereum toward the one-day 50-day moving average , which previously acted as resistance in late October, offering a key test point for market participants. Despite this potential uptick, the medium-term outlook remains bearish. TradingShot projects that Ethereum will likely complete its current downward leg before any sustained recovery, with a projected target near $2,650. Key ETH price levels to watch Meanwhile, another analysis by crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades identified key price levels to watch. He noted that $2,800 and $4,100 remain significant support and resistance zones that have shaped price action over the last two years. In the short-to-medium term, the $3,350 area, which marked the August low and recently acted as support, could also play a role in upcoming market moves. ETH price analysis chart.

Source: Finbold Currently, the asset is tilting toward the bearish side. Notably, the 50-day SMA sits at $3,817, signaling short-term weakness as the price trades roughly 19% below this level, a downtrend indicator where sustained closes underneath suggest further downside risk unless momentum shifts.

According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $88,956.12 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples of concern throughout the crypto community. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop Below $89,000? The sudden decline in Bitcoin price has left many traders wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several key factors that may have contributed to this downward movement: Increased selling pressure from institutional investors Regulatory uncertainty in major markets Profit-taking after recent gains Broader market correction affecting all cryptocurrencies What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Investors? When the Bitcoin price experiences significant volatility, it creates both challenges and opportunities. Long-term holders might see this as a buying opportunity, while short-term traders could face unexpected losses. The current Bitcoin price action suggests we might be entering a period of increased market uncertainty. How to Navigate This Bitcoin Price Volatility Successful cryptocurrency investing requires strategic thinking during price fluctuations. Here are some actionable insights for dealing with the current Bitcoin price situation: Dollar-cost average your positions Set clear stop-loss orders Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio Stay informed about market developments Historical Context of Bitcoin Price Movements The current Bitcoin price drop, while concerning, fits within historical patterns of cryptocurrency market behavior. Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its history, yet has consistently recovered to reach new highs. This perspective helps investors maintain a balanced view during market downturns. What’s Next for Bitcoin Price? Market analysts are closely watching key support and resistance levels to predict the next Bitcoin price movement. The $88,000 level now becomes critical, as breaking below this could signal further declines. However, strong buying interest at current levels might provide the foundation for a recovery. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $89,000 serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. While short-term movements can be unsettling, they often create strategic entry points for disciplined investors. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged, making this an important moment for careful decision-making rather than emotional reactions. Frequently Asked Questions How low could Bitcoin price go after breaking $89,000? The next major support level sits around $85,000, though market conditions will determine whether we test this level. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? This depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Many investors use price drops as buying opportunities, but always conduct your own research. How long might this Bitcoin price correction last? Cryptocurrency corrections can last from days to several weeks. Historical patterns suggest we might see stabilization within 1-2 weeks. What indicators should I watch during Bitcoin price volatility? Key indicators include trading volume, moving averages, RSI, and major support/resistance levels to gauge market sentiment. Could this Bitcoin price drop affect other cryptocurrencies? Yes, Bitcoin often leads the market, so other cryptocurrencies typically follow its price movements, though with varying intensity. Is this normal for Bitcoin price behavior? Absolutely. Bitcoin has experienced numerous 20-30% corrections throughout its history while maintaining its long-term upward trend.

CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain analytics firm, delivered this stark assessment in its latest weekly report . Bitcoin now faces a fundamentally different situation compared to earlier corrections in this cycle. Multiple indicators, spanning both technical analysis and demand metrics, have turned sharply negative. Critical Technical Breakdown Signals Shift CryptoQuant's Bull Score Index dropped to 20 out of 100 last week. This reading marks extremely bearish territory. The decline stems from weakening spot demand, negative price momentum, and slowing growth in stablecoin liquidity. Bitcoin broke below its 365-day moving average, a crucial trend indicator. This breakdown carries special significance. The same level held firm during the 2022 bear market confirmation. Throughout every correction in the current cycle, Bitcoin has maintained support above this moving average to date. A CryptoQuant analyst emphasized the weight of this development. Bitcoin's failure to hold this technical level represents a major shift in market structure. The 365-day moving average now sits near $102,600, creating a substantial resistance zone overhead. Source: X The cryptocurrency has suffered a 28% drawdown from recent highs. However, support remains intact around the $90,000 to $92,000 range. This support level continues to attract buyers despite mounting bearish pressure. Treasury Company Demand Collapses The demand landscape has transformed dramatically. Bitcoin Treasury companies served as major buyers earlier this year. These firms accumulated substantial Bitcoin holdings as core business strategies. That buying power has evaporated. Many Treasury companies saw their market capitalizations decline by between 70% and 90%. Their stock values now trade below the worth of their Bitcoin reserves. This pricing dynamic eliminates their ability to issue new shares for capital raises. Without fresh capital, these companies cannot purchase additional Bitcoin. Strategy, formerly the market's largest consistent buyer, sharply reduced its accumulation rate. The company faced similar pressures as its stock market valuation approached the value of its Bitcoin holdings. The CryptoQuant analyst noted that Strategy cannot support the entire market alone. Treasury companies have effectively vanished as a demand source. This removal of significant buying pressure leaves Bitcoin vulnerable. Historical Bitcoin cycles have followed four-year patterns. The 2014 to 2017 cycle and the 2018 to 2021 cycle both adhered to this timeframe. Many analysts credit Bitcoin's halving events for creating these rhythmic supply shocks. The current cycle began in 2022 and is expected to conclude in 2025. Some market observers suggest the cycle might extend into 2026. They point to institutional participation and the involvement of exchange-traded funds as factors that could alter traditional patterns. CryptoQuant challenges this assumption. The firm argues that institutional demand can disappear just as quickly as retail interest. The Treasury company's collapse provides recent evidence of this vulnerability. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at around $89,376, suggesting a 4.17% decline in the last 24 hours.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-19 17:55:18

This sudden market movement has sent shockwaves through the trading community and highlights the extreme volatility that can occur in crypto markets. What Exactly Are Futures Liquidated? When we talk about futures liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged trading positions. Traders using leverage borrow funds to amplify their positions, but when the market moves against them, exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses. The recent $115 million in futures liquidated represents massive losses for traders who bet wrong on market direction. Why Did This Massive Liquidation Event Occur? Several factors typically trigger such significant futures liquidated events. Market volatility, unexpected news, or large whale movements can all contribute. When prices move rapidly in either direction, traders with leveraged positions find their collateral insufficient, leading to automatic position closures. The scale of this event – $115 million in futures liquidated in just one hour – suggests a major market shift caught many traders off guard. Understanding the Broader Impact The $441 million in futures liquidated over 24 hours paints an even clearer picture of market turbulence. Consider these key implications: Increased volatility as liquidated positions create additional selling pressure Margin calls affecting traders across multiple exchanges Market sentiment shifts as fear spreads through the trading community Opportunity for some as price dislocations create buying chances How Can Traders Protect Themselves? Experienced traders understand that futures liquidated events are part of cryptocurrency markets. To minimize risk, consider these strategies: Use proper position sizing and avoid over-leveraging Set stop-loss orders to automatically exit positions Diversify across different trading strategies Maintain adequate collateral to withstand normal market swings The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Crypto Markets While $115 million in futures liquidated seems massive, it’s important to view this in context of overall market capitalization. Such events often create buying opportunities for long-term investors and can help reset over-leveraged market conditions. However, they also serve as stark reminders of the risks involved in leveraged trading. Learning From Market Turbulence Every significant futures liquidated event provides valuable lessons for market participants. The rapid $115 million liquidation demonstrates how quickly conditions can change and why risk management remains crucial. Traders who survive these events often emerge with better strategies and deeper understanding of market dynamics. The stunning scale of futures liquidated in this recent event – $115 million in one hour alone – underscores the raw power of cryptocurrency markets. While painful for those affected, such events help maintain market health by clearing out excessive leverage. As the dust settles, smart traders will analyze what happened, adjust their approaches, and prepare for the next market move with renewed caution and respect for risk management principles. Frequently Asked Questions What causes futures to be liquidated? Futures get liquidated when traders’ positions move against them and their collateral becomes insufficient to maintain leveraged positions, triggering automatic closures by exchanges. How does liquidation affect cryptocurrency prices? Mass liquidations often create additional selling pressure as positions are forcibly closed, which can accelerate price movements in the direction that triggered the liquidations. Can I recover funds after liquidation? Once a position is liquidated, the funds are lost. However, some exchanges offer insurance funds or partial recovery mechanisms in certain circumstances. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations occur when prices drop rapidly, while short liquidations happen when prices rise quickly, both affecting traders who bet wrong on market direction. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use proper risk management, avoid excessive leverage, maintain adequate collateral, and set stop-loss orders to protect your positions from sudden market moves. Are liquidations more common in crypto than traditional markets? Yes, cryptocurrency markets experience more frequent and severe liquidations due to higher volatility, 24/7 trading, and the prevalence of leverage trading.

According to H100 Group’s Bitcoin lead, Brian Brookshire, convertible bonds, while often attractive, represent a significant and underappreciated threat to corporate Bitcoin strategies. Capital Structure Takes Center Stage as BTCTCs Expand BTC Bets In a recent post on X, Brookshire laid out the menu of financing tools available to Bitcoin treasury firms and highlighted why they can be dangerous if misused. Convertible bonds sit at the center of that anxiety. They allow companies to raise funds at a premium to spot share prices, as seen with UK-listed The Smarter Web Company’s “Smarter Convert” instrument, fully subscribed for $21 million and structured as a Bitcoin-denominated convertible. “Convertible bonds can have quite favorable terms when issued under the right market conditions,” Brookshire wrote, “but have refinancing risk, are often accompanied by large upfront short-selling, and can take up to 5 years to be discharged.” For those trying to copy Strategy’s treasury playbook, that’s a direct warning: the very instruments that helped accelerate BTC accumulation can quietly box companies into a corner when markets turn. Paris-based Sequans exemplified this by becoming the first major treasury to liquidate a portion of its holdings, selling 970 BTC for $93 million. “It is absolutely crucial for BTCTC management to be well versed in the tradeoffs, think with a long-term view about how the usage of any particular instrument will impact the health of the business, and only issue debt or deploy a particular strategy when terms are favorable to the long-term interests of shareholders,” added the market observer. His comments come in the wake of rising scrutiny on corporate Bitcoin leverage, with a report by Keyrock from earlier in the year projecting a $12.8 billion debt maturity wall for BTC-focused companies, much of it in convertible notes clustered in 2027–2028. If equity prices fall below conversion levels, issuers may be forced to sell their Bitcoin or accept harsh refinancing terms, potentially dragging both share prices and the cryptocurrency lower in a feedback loop. Market Tests Leverage and mNAV Premiums Recent activity shows how entrenched the BTC corporate playbook has become. Despite Strategy’s mNAV multiple slipping from 1.52x to about 1.11x, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has told Fox Business that his company is engineered to withstand an 80–90% drawdown in the price of Bitcoin. On November 17, the firm disclosed its biggest purchase since July, worth over $830 million, refuting rumors that it had been selling off its stash. In Asia, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet has increased its holdings to 30,823 BTC as of November 19, 2025, following a series of acquisitions. Meanwhile, WiseLink’s announcement in August of a three-year convertible note to Nasdaq-listed Top Win International marked the first Bitcoin treasury strategy by a Taiwan-listed firm, again leaning on convertibles to finance BTC exposure.

Market analysts say uncertainty surrounding the Fed's interest rate policy, combined with intense selling pressure from both institutional and individual investors, is pushing crypto asset prices down. Yesterday's outflow of over half a billion dollars from BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust fund was the clearest indication of the fragility of the ETF. This was the fund's largest daily outflow since its inception. Bitcoin's sharp decline since its peak in early October has particularly challenged investors who had been using high leverage in anticipation of a recovery. With the price retreating to $89,500 today, interest in leveraged trading on offshore exchanges has sharply increased. Open interest in Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts on platforms like Binance surged by over 36,000 Bitcoin last week. This increase, valued at over $3.3 billion, was the largest weekly jump since April. According to K33 Research, funding rates remain high, indicating that the market is still heavily long. K33 Research Head of Research Vetle Lunde said, “Perp open interest has reached its October peak again. This systematically increases the risk of a squeeze.” During the price's rapid decline below $98,000, many traders placed limit orders to “buy the dip.” However, the price's continued decline triggered these orders, suddenly exposing investors to the market with real, leveraged positions. This led to speculation that the increased leveraged exposure, which occurred before the rally, made the market vulnerable.

Since then, inflows into crypto ETFs have reversed, digital asset-focused companies have scaled back their buying, and institutional demand has weakened significantly. Many funds have fallen below their average inflow levels into Bitcoin. K33 Research notes that Bitcoin experienced additional losses in six of the seven periods in which similar dynamics were observed in the past. The average monthly decline during these periods was around 15%. Rails CEO Satraj Bambra said, “The liquidation incident on October 10 created a serious liquidity gap in the market, which has still not been filled. There is insufficient new buyers entering the market; sellers outnumber buyers in the spot and derivative markets.” *This is not investment advice.

Market tension has increased because this signal has not appeared with such strength in months. Many analysts now believe XRP is entering a decisive phase that could reshape near-term market behavior. A Rare Reversal Signal Emerges Analyst Egrag Crypto reports a significant bullish divergence on XRP’s three-day chart. Price pushed into lower lows while momentum printed higher lows. That mismatch often reveals fading bearish strength. It can also signal an early reversal on larger charts, especially when confirmed with volume. Egrag describes this divergence as one of the strongest he has seen this year. His observation has drawn attention because the three-day chart carries deep influence over long-term sentiment. Traders now treat this divergence as a potential turning point for XRP. #XRP – Major Bullish Divergence Appears on the 3D: #XRP is flashing a major bullish divergence on the 3-Day chart, one of the strongest signals we’ve had in months. If this plays out and we tap the FVG, and you’re tired or stressed… that might be your last real chance to sell.… pic.twitter.com/TajFt9Oqgz — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 19, 2025 The Fair Value Gap and Its Role Egrag highlights a nearby Fair Value Gap, also known as an FVG. An FVG forms when the price moves very fast and leaves an imbalance behind. These zones often act as magnets for liquidity and tend to attract price sooner or later. If XRP rises toward that FVG, the market could witness strong reactions. A clean fill of the gap may create renewed interest among buyers. Many traders see that event as a possible final chance to exit before the next major phase begins. Egrag Crypto’s Firm Personal Conviction Egrag also explains his own position. He has no intention of selling his XRP holdings at this stage. He compares exiting now to selling Bitcoin at three dollars . To him, the long-term potential outweighs the short-term volatility. He believes XRP will deliver higher value in the future and refuses to abandon his stance. However, he warns followers not to copy his approach without strong emotional discipline. He emphasizes that his conviction comes from a unique tolerance for risk and long-term focus. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Possible Market-Wide Impact The three-day divergence may influence more than just XRP. Egrag suggests that a confirmed bullish structure across major charts could trigger a broader shift. That shift could offer exit points for traders holding various altcoins. He plans to reduce positions in other assets if the structure is confirmed in the wider market. Still, his position on XRP remains unchanged. He treats XRP differently because he considers its long-term outlook stronger than many alternatives. What Traders Should Watch The coming days will likely determine the strength of this signal. Traders will monitor volume recovery, structural breaks, and interactions with the FVG. A confirmed reclaim of resistance may support a full reversal. Failure to confirm could delay any major trend change. XRP now stands at a potentially important moment. Egrag Crypto’s analysis highlights a rare signal that demands close attention. If the divergence confirms, XRP could enter a powerful new phase . If it weakens, the market may continue its slow consolidation. For now, traders watch the charts as anticipation grows across the entire sector. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The sudden shift in sentiment follows the unexpected cancellation of October’s crucial jobs report, leaving economists and market participants in the dark about key employment data that typically guides Federal Reserve decisions. Why Are December Fed Rate Cut Odds Declining? The probability of a December Fed rate cut has dropped substantially after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced it will not release its October employment report. This critical data point serves as a cornerstone for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and its absence creates substantial uncertainty in monetary policy forecasting. Without the October jobs report, Federal Reserve officials lack essential information about: Employment growth trends Wage inflation pressures Labor market participation rates Unemployment dynamics How Does Missing Data Impact Fed Decisions? The Federal Reserve relies heavily on consistent economic data to make informed decisions about interest rates. When key reports like the jobs data disappear from the landscape, policymakers become more cautious about implementing significant changes to monetary policy. This data gap means the December Fed rate cut becomes less likely because officials prefer to act with comprehensive information. The absence of October employment figures creates a blind spot in understanding whether the labor market continues to cool or remains robust. What Are the Market Implications? The declining odds of a December Fed rate cut have immediate consequences across financial markets. Bond yields may rise as traders adjust their expectations, while equity markets could face pressure from higher borrowing costs. Key sectors that benefit from lower interest rates—such as real estate and technology—may experience increased volatility. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar could strengthen as delayed rate cuts maintain higher yield differentials compared to other currencies. What Should Investors Watch Now? With the December Fed rate cut probability shrinking, investors should monitor alternative economic indicators that might influence Federal Reserve thinking. These include: CPI inflation data – The next consumer price index report Retail sales figures – Consumer spending patterns Manufacturing surveys – PMI and industrial production Federal Reserve speeches – Public comments from officials Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainty The reduced likelihood of a December Fed rate cut underscores how dependent markets are on consistent economic data. While the missing jobs report creates short-term uncertainty, it also highlights the importance of diversified investment strategies that can withstand unexpected data disruptions. As we approach the final Federal Reserve meeting of the year, market participants should prepare for potential volatility and maintain flexibility in their positioning. The December Fed rate cut story demonstrates that in today’s complex economic environment, being prepared for data surprises is just as important as reacting to expected outcomes. Frequently Asked Questions Why was the October jobs report cancelled? The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics cited technical issues and data collection challenges as the primary reasons for cancelling the October employment report release. How does this affect the likelihood of a December Fed rate cut? The missing data makes a December Fed rate cut less probable because policymakers prefer comprehensive information before making significant monetary policy changes. What other economic indicators will the Fed consider now? The Federal Reserve will likely place greater emphasis on inflation data, retail sales, manufacturing surveys, and other labor market indicators to compensate for the missing jobs report. How long will the data gap affect Fed decisions? The impact should be temporary, as November data will eventually fill some gaps, but the missing October data creates a permanent hole in the economic timeline. Should investors change their strategies because of this? While investors should monitor the situation, drastic strategy changes based on single data points (or missing data) are generally not recommended. When will we get clarity on Fed rate decisions? Clearer signals should emerge after the November jobs report and additional economic data releases in coming weeks. Found this analysis helpful?

Those days are over. Amazon Prime Video is launching a groundbreaking feature that uses artificial intelligence to create cinematic video recaps, transforming how we catch up on our favorite shows between seasons. This streaming innovation represents the next evolution in personalized entertainment. How Amazon Prime Video’s AI-Generated Video Works Amazon’s new feature utilizes advanced generative AI technology to produce what the company describes as ‘theatrical-quality season recaps.’ These aren’t your typical text summaries – they’re fully produced video packages complete with synchronized narration, dialogue, and background music. The AI analyzes entire seasons of content to identify key plot points, character development arcs, and crucial moments, then assembles them into coherent, engaging recaps. The Streaming Innovation That Changes Everything This represents a significant leap beyond traditional recap methods. Unlike simple text summaries or basic clip compilations, these AI-generated video recaps are designed to feel like professionally produced content. The technology behind this streaming innovation includes: Advanced scene recognition and analysis Natural language processing for narration Emotional tone matching through music selection Spoiler prevention algorithms Prime Video’s AI Evolution: From X-Ray to Video Recaps This isn’t Amazon’s first foray into AI-powered features. Last year, the platform introduced ‘X-Ray Recaps,’ which provided text-based summaries. The new video recaps represent a natural progression, leveraging the same underlying generative AI technology but with enhanced capabilities for visual storytelling.

The race to integrate AI represents a fundamental shift in how streaming services compete and innovate. Why This Streaming Innovation Matters for Viewers For audiences, these AI-generated video recaps solve a real problem: remembering complex plotlines between seasons. As shows become more serialized and intricate, having a reliable way to refresh memory enhances the viewing experience without requiring full re-watches. FAQs About Amazon’s AI Video Technology Which shows will have AI-generated video recaps? The feature launches in beta for select Prime Originals including Fallout , Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan , and Upload . How does the AI avoid spoilers? Amazon has implemented guardrails in its AI model to ensure recaps don’t inadvertently reveal crucial plot twists or endings. Are other streaming services using similar technology? Yes, YouTube TV uses AI for sports highlights, and Netflix employs generative AI for production tasks like visual effects and character aging. When will this feature be widely available? The beta rollout begins immediately, with broader availability expected based on user feedback and technical refinement. Who developed this AI technology? The feature was developed by Amazon ‘s Prime Video team, building on their previous work with X-Ray technology. The Future of AI in Entertainment Amazon’s AI-generated video recaps represent just the beginning of how generative AI will transform entertainment. As the technology matures, we can expect even more sophisticated applications that personalize content, enhance production efficiency, and create entirely new forms of interactive storytelling. This streaming innovation demonstrates how AI is moving from behind-the-scenes tool to front-facing feature, directly enhancing the consumer experience. While concerns about AI’s impact on creative industries remain valid, features like these show how technology can complement rather than replace human creativity.
